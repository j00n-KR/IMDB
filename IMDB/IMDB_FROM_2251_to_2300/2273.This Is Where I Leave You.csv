0,bkoganbing,Altman Family Values,8,28 February 2015,"The Altman family patriarch has died and this most secular of Jews desired that the family come together and sit Shiva. For those of you gentiles out there a Shiva is a Jewish wake, but it happens after the funeral which is done as quickly as possible. So his children who include Jason Bateman, Tina Fey, Corey Stoll and Adam Driver gather at the family home where Jane Fonda their mother still lives. Fonda insists that these very secular kids observe the custom as a matter of respect for their dad.Father had a sporting goods business he ran and he made some very specific bequests in his will about the division of the business. That is only one bone of contention. In fact me telling any more will ruin the story. I will say this though that after a lot of revelations about the children and their lives, Fonda provides the biggest revelation of all at the end and kind of brings them all to an understanding.This Is Where I Leave You is one of those films short on plot, but long and deep in character development. Jason Bateman as per his status as the lead is the sibling who never really went anywhere, the one with the most ability, but the one who always played it safe. His character is the most fully formed, the other siblings have their moments, but in the end function as reflections of sides of Bateman.No one is all warm and fuzzy as This Is Where I Leave You ends. But they all come away with a better understanding of themselves and the family dynamic.And isn't that what families are all about?",This Is Where I Leave You
1,SnoopyStyle,Subtract at least one sibling please,5,3 July 2015,"Judd Altman (Jason Bateman) is a radio producer who finds his wife Quinn (Abigail Spencer) in bed with his boss (Dax Shepard) and about to divorce her. His father passes away and his final wish is for his family to hold shiva even though they're not religious. The family is forced to spend 7 days together. His sister Wendy (Tina Fey) is married with a kid but she still loves Horry Callen (Timothy Olyphant) who got a brain injury when they were young. His mother Hillary (Jane Fonda) got her boobs done and has no boundaries. She is a famous therapist who wrote an in-depth book about her children's sex lives. His irresponsible brother Phillip (Adam Driver) shows up with his psychiatrist fiancée Tracy Sullivan (Connie Britton). His older brother Paul (Corey Stoll) is married to Judd's first girlfriend Annie (Kathryn Hahn) and they can't seem to conceive. Judd reconnects with Penny Moore (Rose Byrne) who has always held a torch for him. Then Quinn shows up with news that she's pregnant with his child.Honestly, I've condense the interconnection of the characters as much as possible. This is so full that there isn't a spare moment of breather. There are great comedic talents here but everybody is stepping on each other's feet. Everybody is perfectly likable. It may be that there is so much talent in the cast. Everybody is given something to do or be which ends up as being too much. Just when things need to wrap up, the movie adds one more thing.",This Is Where I Leave You
2,nogodnomasters,TIME AFTER TIME,10,19 November 2018,"The family gathers for a funeral and spend time together after the death of their father not in August Osage County. The film centers around Judd (Jason Bateman) the second oldest son and the most stable in the group. Recently he has split up with his wife (Abigail Spencer) when he caught her in bed with his boss (Dax Shepard). His sister Wendy (Tina Fey) is his confidant, although secrets burn inside of her. She has her own issues.Paul (Corey Stoll) is the oldest. He believes the family business should go to him. His wife Alice (Kathryn Hahn) was Judd's girlfriend for 6 months before he met Quinn.Phillip (Adam Driver) is the baby in the group. He hasn't grown up and brings his much older girlfriend Tracy (Connie Britton) who is also his analyst.Mom (Jane Fonda) Loves to talk about her dead husband's sexual ability and shows off her cleavage to the dismay of her family. She has also written a book ""Cradle to All"" based on the personal lives of her children.The film is a light situation comedy with family drama and secrets but without the intensity. On some level it feels like a romantic comedy. The family comes together to form new bonds and more understanding relationships, even those they know are doomed for failure.Parental Guide: F-bomb. Brief sex scene. Implied sex. Near sex. Male rear nudity. Sex talk. Sex heard over a speaker.",This Is Where I Leave You
3,kosmasp,One of the best in 2014,10,15 February 2015,"Don't rate a movie or prejudge it before you see it. Maybe you are a fan of Night at the Museum or not, but this is a whole different thing. While the Night at the museum franchise is regular fun (which is nicely done as well), this movie is also a drama. And very well written one at that. Of course the actors at hand add their touch to it and elevate it even higher, but first comes the script and the very real characters that we get to see.This is not laugh out loud funny and if you're (or your heart are) not made of stone, this will touch you. It's about family, it's about loss, it's about life in general. This is so well put together, that just thinking about it, emotions are coming back from when I watched it. I recommended this movie to a lot of people and I haven't heard anyone not liking it, quite the contrary. Prepare for a comedy/drama and you'll more than a treat ... you get one fantastic emotional ride of a movie :o)",This Is Where I Leave You
4,blanche-2,Four siblings gather to mourn their father,7,27 October 2015,"When their father passes away, four grown siblings, return home to sit Shiva with their mother in ""This is Where I Leave You,"" from 2014.The film stars Jason Bateman, Tina Fey, Jane Fonda, Rose Byrne, Corey Stoll, and Timothy Olyphant. Back where they started, the siblings confront their old lives and loves and reflect on where they are at present.What happens is funny, uncomfortable, sad, and unexpected as they put up with each other and their mother, who pays little attention to discretion as she brags about the sex life she had with her husband and the size of his ... sexuality. Jane Fonda is excellent, outspoken and surprisingly motherly, considering the personality of the character.I love Jason Bateman and watch him in anything in which he appears. He doesn't disappoint here as Judd, with his serious, straight-on delivery and his Everyman frustration. But that isn't to put down the rest of the cast, all of whom give good performances. Rose Byrne as Penny, Judd's old girlfriend, is a standout and again shows her versatility as an actress. Anyone who saw her intense performance on ""Damages"" can't fail to be impressed by this chipper, cheerful character. Family dynamics make for good movies if they're realistic. Though some of the reviewers here didn't feel they rang true, for me they did - bad marriages, old loves left behind, taking stock of what one has accomplished, and future goals -- the death of a parent and being around family is a time of contemplation.""This is Where I Leave You"" is good but it is an uneasy combination of comedy and drama, sort of not knowing which it wanted to be. On the one hand, Bateman and Fey are often associated with comedy, and then on the other, there were some serious issues covered.Worth checking out.",This Is Where I Leave You
5,Quinoa1984,"a decent drama and a bad comedy, mixed with tired formula",5,11 November 2014,"This Is Where I Leave You has a game cast with a good many people who have shown so much talent and excellent, memorable characters over time, and it has a good *dramatic* script in terms of the main core conflict. The main story is about Jason Bateman's character who finds at the start of the story a) his wife has been cheating on him with his boss/d***-head shock-jock boss for a year, and b) his father has just died. So, he has to return to his home-town, amid his dysfunctional family picnic (aka the seven day 'Shiva' ritual for Jews where you sit around, eat, talk, reminisce, and uh, sit some more). Over the course of this story Bateman's character Judd will come to terms with things in his family, but more-so with his wife's infidelity (and then a pregnancy, aye) and then a possible budding relationship with a girl he used to know (Rose Byrne). Decisions decisions! The problem is, and it's major, is that This is Where I Leave You is also a completely lackluster comedy by a hack director (Shawn Levy, who didn't mess up too bad with Date Night but has otherwise had a sucky career in Hollywood), and a stripped-down adapted script. From what I've been told the book was good, really good, excellent even. But of course tone is always the thing, and what gets lost in an adaptation like this is how a character like Judd views these events in first person and with more details about these people than what is crammed into this. This is not to say the material would suit it longer - heaven forbid this was a TV show - but everyone is drawn so cartoonishly, so much like sitcom types. Only Bateman and maybe, arguably, sorta, Fonda's matriarch have more than a dimension.Which, when you have actors like Tina Fey (she plays kinda helpful, kinda a dope) and Courtney Stoll (so good on House of Cards, here reduced to 'I'm frustrated and angry and RAWR!) and then Adam Driver. He's actually not very good at all, though his character is mostly reduced to the loud-mouth annoying caricature who, frankly, doesn't seem realistic at all, like he's drawn out of parts of a sarcastic side of a brain with only the slivers of any decency thrown in there. Of course that's comic relief talking, but the comedy just falls flat, or only a line or two work. 'Situations' also keep happening as well - could Bateman help out his (I'm not kidding) sister-in-law to procreate? Or what about mom's Big New Breasts? Or what about smoking weed at the synagogue? A lot of these things, and even little character moments, I could see being workable, funny, meaningful in a book. Under Levy's direction, and somehow through Tropper's own script chopping up the narrative, it's kind of a mess. It's nice to see the dramatic side workable and have some lasting power during the film, and Bateman is able to find a solid character to work through in that, but it's not enough to make it a good movie. In a strange coincidence just a couple of weeks after this movie would come out, also by Warner brothers, The Judge would appear in theaters and have a similar premise and with less characters (that's another thing, TOO many characters, TOO much quirk) fared better.Bottom line though, if I'm going to watch Jason Bateman surrounded by a family that is all over the place and half the time genuine and the other time totally plastic and dumb, two words instead: Arrested Development. More to the point, an Arrested Development Movie at this point would be nice, but I digress. 5.5/10",This Is Where I Leave You
6,tavm,"While not great, This Is Where I Leave You was pretty entertaining",7,11 April 2015,"Just watched this with my mom on Netflix disc. She wasn't crazy about the dysfunctional aspects of the film plus she thought it was too raunchy. I liked both of those and mostly emphasized with the characters. Tina Fey does a pretty good job with both the drama and comedy as does Jason Bateman, both of whom are usually known for the latter part. Jane Fonda looks and performs as fine as ever in her advanced years as the matriarch who just lets things play out between her now-grown children as they work out their issues in the wake of their father's death. In summary, This Is Where I Leave You was pretty touching and entertaining.",This Is Where I Leave You
7,edwagreen,*,2,3 October 2015,"Why am I rating this film so poorly? Call me old-fashioned but the observing of Shiva revolves having people visit the bereaved to comfort them following the death of a close family member. This film made a complete mockery of the concept. Perhaps, I would have rated it higher had they used a different pretext to assemble the family together.I know that people will criticize me since this was supposed to be a comedy, but to include this sacred Jewish tradition into utter mayhem was ridiculous. Yes, there is reflection of the father, but the other ridiculous circumstances evolving disqualify this as a quality movie.The surprise ending regarding Jane Fonda's secret was already over-the-top for me.We see a dysfunctional family at its worst with all sorts of outrageous situations occurring.",This Is Where I Leave You
8,preppy-3,Bad title but very good dramedy,8,24 September 2014,"When a man passes away his four grown siblings and widowed wife (Jane Fonda) gather together for a week. The siblings are: Judd (Jason Bateman) who had discovered his wife in bed with his boss. He divorced her and has no job. Then there's Wendy (Tina Fey) who has kids and a husband (Aaron Lazar) who ignores her so she turns to an ex-boyfriend Horry (Timothy Olyphant) for comfort. Then there's Paul (Corey Stoll) who has been trying for two years to have a baby with his wife. Last is Phillip (Adam Driver) the youngest and family ""bad boy"". The mother also has written some books in the past that exposed all their families secrets. Got all that? As you can see there's a LOT going on in this movie--actually too much for one movie. Still I was honestly never bored. It moves quickly, has a sharp script and great acting by all (except for Driver). Best of all are Bateman and Fey who play off each other beautifully. There's plenty of laugh out loud moments but also some affecting ones (I admit to tearing up a little once or twice). There are some debits--Driver is terrible in his role and there's a tasteless running gag about a child who walks around with his potty seat on his head--and proceeds to use it. Also I do have to admit I predicted most of the plots and the outcomes but the excellent acting carries it through. However there was a REAL surprising twist at the end. Well worth catching.",This Is Where I Leave You
9,oscaralbert,Even with most of its biggest laughs crammed into its trailer . . .,7,23 September 2014,". . . THIS IS WHERE I LEAVE YOU leaves its audience with a smile if not a smirk. There's no cultural landmarks here as was the case with THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY. But there's also no rabid viciousness; no echoes of WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? THIS is all in good fun, and after 20 minutes or so viewers will sense that no bridges will be burned for the sake of a better joke, or even in the quest for a more memorable movie. Time after time this close-knit circle of friends and relatives seems to be on the verge of conflagration, before the score pipes in some tender music so that the antagonists of the moment can kiss and make up. Though there is some separation of the wheat from the chaff here, it's all pretty pat and predictable. By the close, director Shawn Levy seems to have nowhere to go with any of his characters, which may be a main reason that his final shot is of the lead Altman (Judd) driving a borrowed (or stolen) black Porsche to one of America's few Eastern Nowheres. Car rides aside, THIS probably would work just as well as a stage play (but ticket prices would be higher).",This Is Where I Leave You
10,george.schmidt,Flailing dysfunctional comedy in spite of a game cast,7,21 September 2014,"THIS IS WHERE I LEAVE YOU (2014) ** Jason Bateman, Tina Fey, Jane Fonda, Adam Driver, Rose Byrne, Corey Stoll, Kathryn Hahn, Connie Britton, Timothy Olyphant, Dax Shepard, Debra Monk, Abigail Spencer, Ben Schwartz. Dysfunctional comedy of a family grieving over the recent death of the paterfamilias involving his adult children all flailing about and argumentative while their own lives are in mass disarray sitting shiva as his last dying wish. While Bateman's trademark dry put-upon Everyman schtick glides thru the middling dramedy the supporting cast is more or less stranded by the stilted script adaptation by Jonathan Tropper (based on his novel) and laying it on thick direction by hamfisted, tone deaf Shawn Levy. The supporting cast is game but hard-to-believe anyone is remotely related (or relatable or even likable) which makes the storyline one long wait for something/anything to be resolved.",This Is Where I Leave You
11,neil-476,Bateman anchors ensemble piece,8,31 October 2014,"Coming home early from work, Judd walks in on his wife having very vigorous sex with his boss. No sooner has he moved out of their apartment than he learns that his father has died. He returns home for the funeral and to sit shiva (his father's dying wish, apparently) with his mother and three siblings. All of them turn out to have problems.Given that Jane Fonda is the mother, and Corey Stoll, Jason Bateman, Tina Fey and Adam Driver are the siblings, with Rose Byrne and Timothy Olyphant thrown into the mix, this is something of an all-star affair as it moves gently through the shiva period and the individual problems and tensions inherent in the various inter-character dynamics begin to pay out. Nothing much gets resolved - life simply goes on - but you understand that, for all their difficulties and differences, these family members relate strongly to each other and recognise the importance of family.Bateman's thread is strongest, and provides an anchor for what is essentially an ensemble piece in which everyone performs well. I found it very credible (apart from one late development which seemed to be chucked in just to make you raise your eyebrows), and all the characters were sympathetic, even if not 100% so. Importantly, even though these are very familiar high profile actors, I always accepted them as a family on screen.I liked this.",This Is Where I Leave You
12,ferguson-6,Mommie Dearest,5,21 September 2014,"Greetings again from the darkness. After watching this movie, I thought about researching whether the boobs of a 76 year old actress had ever been as front and center as they are in this dramedy from director Shawn Levy - not counting Calendar Girls which was for a worthy cause. Luckily I came to my senses, and realized that's not a topic anyone should be googling ... except maybe a 76 year old man.Jane Fonda is the actress whose enhanced assets are so prominently featured, and she plays the mother of four adult children come together to mourn the death of the family patriarch. This is based on the novel by Jonathan Tropper and though it's watchable enough, it could have benefited from a better script adaptation and a less mainstream comedy director. Mr. Levy provided the popular and entertaining A Night at the Museum, as well as a long list of simple minded movies that didn't prepare him for the depth of Tropper's story.The four ""kids"" are played by Corey Stoll, Jason Bateman, Tina Fey and Adam Driver. Also joining them under a single roof are Stoll's desperate-for-a-baby wife Kathryn Hahn, Fey's two kids and self-professed a-hole husband (Aaron Lazar), and Driver's engaged-to-be-engaged much older woman played by Connie Britton. If you think that's an outstanding cast, note that also appearing are Timothy Olyphant (Fey's brain-damaged former lover), Rose Byrne (she always lusted after Bateman), Dax Shepard (sleeps with Bateman's wife played by Abigail Spencer), Ben Schwartz as an oddball Jewish rabbi, and Debra Monk (the helpful neighbor and more).Obviously the issue with so many characters and talented actors is that screen time is limited. Somehow each of these have one key moment in the film, and that may be the biggest issue. Some of these we want to know more about (Olyphant, Byrne, Brittain), while others could have been written out of the script altogether (Lazar, Schwartz, Shepard) and the movie wouldn't have suffered, and might have improved.Most of the story revolves around Bateman and his situation - crumbled marriage, lost job, dead father, plus even more. Going through that and facing his sit-com worthy dysfunctional family provides an unending stream of none-too-subtle moments: a basement sleeper/sofa that won't fold out, roof top talks with his bossypants sister, and even fisticuffs inside the family and out.This is another in the sub-genre Suburban-angst, and the numerous contrived scenes and formulaic sequences are salvaged only by the talented casts ability to squeeze the moment from the next one-liner. There is so much rage and resentment in this family that we viewers do find humor in the toddler toting his portable potty with him everywhere, or even Bateman taking the expected fall in an ice rink. There is little edge to this material, but it's not difficult to glimpse how the right director could have approached the genius of The Royal Tenenbaums or the original Death at a Funeral, rather than a generic blend of Garden State and August:Osage County.Britton, Byrne and Batemen all have their moments, and the movie is certainly watchable ... though it could have been exceptional as either a straight out comedy or an indie-type drama. No need to email me if you come up with additional films featuring 76 year old boobs.",This Is Where I Leave You
13,anaconda-40658,A Trash Bin is Where to Leave This Film.,2,24 September 2015,"This Is Where I Left You (2014): Dir: Shawn Levy / Cast: Jason Bateman, Tina Fey, Jane Fonda, Adam Driver, Corey Stoll: A pathetic ensemble comedy about endearing family relationships that are anything but endearing here. Jane Fonda plays a widow whose husband passes away before the film's opening. Her three sons and daughter arrive and everything works at making everyone of them look like people that nobody would desire to spend time with. Fonda is constantly rushing about wearing a robe that conceals everything except for her boob job. Corey Stoll plays oldest son who worked at the family business and cannot get his wife pregnant. Jason Bateman is the one performance given any real character. He arrives home to find his wife in the sack with his co-worker. He will later learn that she is pregnant. He also hooks up with an ex-flame ice skater and the relationship has all the passion of cracking your skull on the ice. Adam Driver plays the idiotic youngest son who drives fast and hits on every woman within reach. He is currently screwing his female therapist. Tina Fey plays the lone sister whose childhood sweetheart has brain damage. She also hasn't the ability to shut her yap and must blab about her brother's divorce. None of these characters are likable. There is even a kid who runs about with a potty and takes a sh*t wherever he seems fit. Director Shawn Levy had success with films such as Date Night and Just Married. Here he creates a film that tries to address the bonds and trials of family. The result is a film that is best left in the potty that the kid lugs about. That is the best time for him to take a sh*t. Score: 2 ½ / 10",This Is Where I Leave You
14,HotToastyRag,Typical Dysfunctional Family Movie,6,28 September 2017,"Jane Fonda's husband has died, and her four children return home for the funeral. The oldest son, Corey Stall, has marital troubles with his wife, Kathryn Hahn, who used to be his younger brother's girlfriend. Jason Bateman, just found out his wife cheated on him, and he seeks to numb his heartache with Rose Byrne, a friend from high school. Tina Fey's husband ignores her and works too much, and she has an emotionally complex history with the neighbor, Timothy Olyphant. And the problemed child, Adam Driver, is involved with an older woman, Connie Britton. With all the children's problems, is there any room for Jane Fonda? Yes, there is. She, just like her children, has problems and secrets that are bound to come out over the weekend.I'm sure every viewer will take his own opinion of the film, but I was pretty split down the middle. Jason Bateman's storyline takes the lead, and it was my worst part of the film. Rose Byrne was wholly unlikable, and I wished that both she and Jason would have surrendered their screen time to someone else. Adam Driver's part of the plot is much smaller, but it's more interesting. His girlfriend is a therapist, and his character, more than anyone, shows the damage dysfunctional parenting does to children. By far, Tina Fey's segment was my favorite. Yes, she's famous for her comedic talents, but when she tackles a dramatic scene, she's surprisingly talented. The scenes she shares with Timothy Olyphant are very touching.This Is Where I Leave You is a very typical dysfunctional family film, so if you don't like those types of movies, you're not going to like this one. I watched it because I like Jane Fonda, but it's not a movie I'll probably want to rent again.Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to some adult content, I wouldn't let my kids watch this movie.",This Is Where I Leave You
15,phd_travel,Top notch ensemble but the main story isn't that funny,5,17 July 2015,There are so many likable actors here there should be something to enjoy for everyone in this family reunion at a funeral dramedy. Unfortunately the story isn't that interesting.Rose Byrne with her curly hair is really sweet and pretty as the small town girl who never left. A bit ludicrous that an average looking joe who looks like Jason Bateman would have 2 such gorgeous women in his life.The story has its moments but they tend to be the minor ones that are funny like Jane Fonda's boob job and the little kid and the potty. Some of the conflict and fighting between Corey Stoll's character and his youngest brother and the older lesbian thing seem very contrived even for this kind of dramedy.Not a must watch but okay if you have the time.,This Is Where I Leave You
16,gradyharp,'It's hard to see people from your past when your present is so cataclysmically screwed up.',10,26 December 2014,"Tough starting out praising this little film because there are just so many fine things about it. But first must come novelist/screenwriter Jonathan Tropper – one of the most promising and brightest lights in comedic writing to come along in a while. Shawn Levy directs this impossibly complex story with such aplomb that it all seems very natural. The cast? It would be difficult to imagine a finer ensemble and not a single member misses the mark.The PR synopsis ties it all together fairly well: 'When their father passes away, four grown siblings, bruised and banged up by their respective adult lives, are forced to return to their childhood home and live under the same roof together for a week, along with their over- sharing mother and an assortment of spouses, exes and might-have-beens. Confronting their history and the frayed states of their relationships among the people who know and love them best, they ultimately reconnect in hysterical and emotionally affecting ways amid the chaos, humor, heartache and redemption that only families can provide-driving us insane even as they remind us of our truest, and often best, selves.'Jason Bateman truly stars in this film – solid, making all the permutations that each of the characters demonstrate come together. Tina Fey is terrific, Jane Fonda is obviously enjoying this important role of a mother with a new breast augmentation and a secret across the street, Rose Byrne is delicate and beautiful and vulnerable who 'doesn't do small talk well', Corey Stoll and Kathryn Hahn are a married couple attempting everything to have a child, Timothy Olyphant is superb as a brain damaged ex-lover of Tina Fey who lives across the street with his mother Debra Monk (the secret Jane Fonda keeps to the end), Ben Schwartz is the hilarious Rabbi who teaches the family how to sit Shiva, Dax Shepard is the very hunky boss of Jason Bateman found sleeping with Jason's wife (Abigail Spencer), and last but most assuredly not least is the every bright performance of the gifted young comedian Adam Driver who all but steals the screen when he is present.The laughs are always present, but equally so the compassion for this dysfunctional but wholly lovable family.

The entire movie is a mish mash of conversations between the different characters. There are supposed to be humorous parts in the movie but besides the mother (played by Jane Fonda) that has some naughty sexy talk the movie is not that funny. It's just a drama about a whole dysfunctional family that comes together after their father died. Each character has his own personality and problems, and that's shared during the whole movie.

19,StevePulaski,Feels like an overlong sitcom pilot when it should feel like an enriching film experience about family and relationships,4,19 December 2014,"This is Where I Leave You is one of those films that can almost trick you into believing it's a good film because you get so wrapped up in the energy and performances of the actors that you forget that the writing is either trying too hard or simply undercutting the wealth of talent on screen rather than enriching. In this case, This is Where I Leave You does both, not giving its characters enough plausible humanity and, instead, trades pragmatic routes for character-driven scenarios for brazen comedy or overly-sappy drama, making for a film that holds about as much emotional maturity as a satire about the topics of family and grief.The film centers around the Altman family, who are united following the death of their patriarch, who's dying wish was for the family to sit Shiva, a Jewish tradition meaning that everyone in the family must live under the same roof for the next week, so we are told by Hillary (Jane Fonda), the Altman's mother. The four Altman siblings, who are all emotionally damaged or troubled in some way, find this to be a daunting task for many reasons: Judd (Jason Bateman), for one, has recently witness his wife having sex with his boss, Wendy (Tina Fey) has a marriage that is failing due to her husband's frequent absence, Phillip (Adam Driver) is an immature playboy unwilling to give up his childish ways, and Paul (Corey Stoll), while seeming like the only sibling who has his ducks in order, still finds ways to be too confrontational with his siblings or too hardened in his own way of thinking. Together, this family must tolerate each other for a week to adhere to their dying father's wish, and we must endure one-hundred and forty-three minutes of their comedic and dramatic zaniness.Instantly, anyone who paid attention to film last year has visions of August: Osage County dancing in their head, a far better and more elaborate drama that won me over because of how invested it was in character relations and dialog. This is Where I Leave You is, on the contrary, invested in sitcom behavior, featuring characters with large and overdrawn personalities and situational humor taking presence over verbal wit or conversational realism. The sole intriguing Altman sibling is Judd, for he has a real problem on his hands, and whenever we get involved in talking about his particular situation is when writer Jonathan Tropper (who also wrote the book of the same name) decided to paint a more honest and emotional picture of these characters. Everything else, given the presence of Adam Driver's obnoxious Phillip character and Jane Fonda's equally obnoxious and annoying Hillary, is rooted in goofy comedy, which goes far beyond my personal threshold for family zaniness.When the film wants to turn a bit more emotional, Tropper makes it interesting enough, at least giving these characters more to think about and place into perspective. However, the feature out of his control was the film's editing, which is crafted in a way to be emotionally manipulative, cuing the right slow-song to get the emotional rise out of the material. The more we cycle to find the broadly-drawn humor of the story, the strange characters in their own peculiar situations, and the emotional manipulation that could be crafted out of the material, the more we feel like we're watching an extended pilot for a new fall primetime program than a theatrical film.Again, This is Where I Leave You has the partial-saving grace of multiple talented people working all in one picture, with everyone doing a pretty commendable job, even if their characters are partially annoying. Tina Fey reminds audiences why she's often considered one of the funniest females in comedy today by her one-liners, and Jason Bateman's heartbreak treads the line of potentially being close to home for some. However, take a step back and look at the film that encompasses these fine actors and you'll see one filled with unsubtle emotions and lackluster comedy, making for a painfully uneven ride through what could've been a hearty depictions of the commonalities of family.Starring: Jason Bateman, Tina Fey, Adam Driver, Corey Stoll, Jane Fonda, Rose Byrne, and Abigail Spencer.

It's based on the bestselling book, of the same name, by Jonathan Tropper (who also wrote the film's screenplay) and directed by Shawn Levy (who's directed such hit comedy and family films as 'NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM', 'CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN', 'THE PINK PANTHER', 'DATE NIGHT' and 'REAL STEEL'). The film stars Jason Bateman, Tina Fey, Adam Driver, Corey Stoll, Rose Byrne, Connie Britton, Kathryn Hahn, Timothy Olyphant, Dax Shepard and Jane Fonda. Considering all of the talent involved I found the movie to be extremely disappointing.The film tells the story of four adult siblings who reunite, at the home they grew up in, when their father passes away. Their mother, Hillary Altman (Fonda), is now a famous psychologist who wrote a bestselling book, about raising children, based on the four siblings. She's ordered her four offspring to stay at the house for a week and sit Shiva (due to their father's dying request). Each Altman has their own recent problems dealing with relationship troubles and other family issues. The story especially focuses on Judd Altman (Bateman), who recently discovered his wife (Abigail Spencer) has been cheating on him for the past year.I love the cast and think they all do an exceptional job delivering the material, as best they can, but the film just doesn't work as a whole. It's funny and dramatically effective (at times) but the mixture of the two just doesn't blend well. I found myself growing really bored with the movie's many melodramatic scenes, as touching as they possibly might have been, and was constantly thirsty for more comedy. The dark humor, and especially the cast's delivery of it, is the best part of the movie. Tropper's book might be really good but his screenplay adaptation, and Levy's directing here, are definitely lacking.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/bPyUBLHQdWM",This Is Where I Leave You
21,Robert_duder,A fun little dark comedy with a great cast,8,11 January 2015,"I knew when I saw the trailer for this that this was the type of comedy I would enjoy. When I heard the critics tearing it apart I was even more certain I would like it. I'm not a normal comedy lover. I need my comedy to be very smart and surprising with a good story and good characters. This Is Where I Leave You was actually great! Ignore all the harsh reviews because I thought it was perfectly entertaining. It is the perfect Jason Bateman vehicle, almost blatantly obvious at this point since he always goes after the same roles anymore but its a wonderfully clever disturbing dark comedy about the most dysfunctional group of people. Its an enormous ensemble cast but everyone gets their moment and the script is very nearly brilliant. The film has romance and sex and growing up and awkward family moments and its moving and sweet and just really a great adult comedy. I love coming of age films with full grown adults realizing they haven't grown up yet and this is an entire family of people exactly that. Its reminiscent of The Big Wedding or The Family Stone and I loved both of those films. The movie has moments of being almost jaded and yet somehow it connected with me in a big way.Jason Bateman knows he's great at being dark and sarcastic so he's milking it for all its worth. However, right now its working for him. He is really great as a guy who is completely lost in life and looking for answers. He is the star of the film and yet his ego is small enough that others can stand next to him strongly. Those others include wicked performance from Tina Fey (loved her and Bateman together and she is perfect for this film and I'm actually surprised she didn't write it), Jane Fonda who is the only one that felt a little underused is good as the matriarch of this wildly dysfunctional family, Adam Driver nails it as the wild younger brother, Corey Stoll is perfect as the older brother who has it all together but is struggling with trying to make a baby with his wife played by Kathryn Hahn. Connie Britton and Timothy Olyphant are both decent in very small roles and they definitely support the main cast well. Rose Byrne rounds out the cast as Bateman's former flame and potential love interest. Byrne is always pretty good and somehow she seems too bubbly for Bateman and yet that's why their two characters mesh so well in this circumstance.The film has this definitive feeling of sadness behind it and yet the appropriate amount of uplifting and life affirming moments. The ending worked and yet it left an awful lot of unanswered questions. Where is the TV Series that follows? (I know that will never happen.) Apparently I'm a fan of Shawn Levy who directed this film. He's also directed Date Night (loved it), Real Steel (LOVED it), Cheaper By The Dozen and Steve Martin's Pink Panther remake. I think Levy and I have very similar ideas when it comes to humour and human interest. I think Levy loves a good character no matter how flawed they are and no matter how ridiculous the story is he makes you love his characters. You can't help but love this eccentric Altman family. It definitely isn't for everyone and I think it could have used a little more fine tuning to really make it great but regardless I thought it was fantastic. Funny and entertaining and if you're a fan of any one of these actors then you'll enjoy it immensely. There are plenty of shocking moments and twists and turns. Definitely worth ignoring the critics and checking this one out. 8.5/10",This Is Where I Leave You
22,lesleyharris30,"Hard Hitting Hilarity,",9,13 June 2017,"This Is Where I Leave You is a great movie with a well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It deals with a lot of serious, somewhat distressing family issues, each character and individual story is very layered, with many surprises throughout. However, it is also a very funny film, there is s lot of comedic dialogue that lightens the mood and takes us away from the depressing situation these characters are in. I did feel that a lot of the plot lines did not go as far as they could have. For a movie that sets up a tone at the very beginning that it is going to deal with some complicated issues and is not going to be a typical comedy you would see the likes of Jason Bateman and Tina Fey in, it did feel like the writers were playing it safe on certain occasions. They had so many opportunities to really surprise its audience, but instead made mundane decisions. The cast is phenomenal, there is amazing chemistry between each individual member and I was truly convinced this was a family. Bateman is stellar in the lead role, playing a very flawed character whom we do support, and his relationship with his brothers, played by Adam Driver and Corey Stoll, is my favourite part of the movie. They had a great back and forth with one another that was very real. Tina Fey also shines in one of her most dramatic roles today, and Rosa Byrne had great presence as Penny Moore, having some beautiful dialogue with Bateman. It is a heavy movie that also had me in stitches at times. Very funny and well acted, I would certainly recommend This Is Where I Leave You to anyone looking for a good comedy drama. A week long mourning period begins to take its toll on four siblings when they return to their family home. Best Performance: Jason Bateman",This Is Where I Leave You
23,inkblot11,"This is where I tell you this funny film, albeit a bit rough, should be on everyone's I-wanna-see list",8,25 September 2014,"Judd Altman (Jason Bateman) leaves work at his Manhattan radio station early. His boss, a shock jock (Dax Sheppard) has finished his show and left himself, so Judd buys a birthday cake to surprise his wife, Quinn, at home. But, nightmare time! When Judd arrives he finds his partner in a sexual tryst with his boss! Whoa, this is beyond sad and upsetting. Could it get worse? Yes, indeed, for his sister Wendy (Tina Fey) calls to inform her bro that their beloved father has passed away. Therefore, Judd is thrown into an inferno of betrayal and loss. Not only this, but his widowed mother, Hillary (Jane Fonda) insists that her four children sit shiva, the seven day wake of Judaism. Relatives and friends will be streaming in but Judd vows he'll just tell all his wife has a herniated disc. Soon, brothers Philip (Adam Driver) and Paul arrive, with Phil's new, quite older galfriend (Connie Britton) coming along in a Porsche. Obviously, this woman is loaded. Because Wendy knows Judd's secret, it comes spilling out after all. Judd sneaks out of the shiva and into a nearby store, where he meets a lady from high school, Penny (Rose Byrne), who still appears interested in Judd. Rounding out this bevy of friends and relatives is the brain damaged adult male next door, Horrie (Timothy Olyphant) who used to date the now married-with-two-kids Wendy. Paul and his wife, too, are wrapped up in a whirlwind, too, as they are trying to conceive and must schedule times for intimate encounters. There is an awful lot going on with this family! Will they make it through the week without choking each other? This funny film has a dream cast, truly, with Bateman, Fey, Fonda, Olyphant, Britton, Byrne, Sheppard, and all of the others. Its especially wonderful to see Fonda, as her recent movie appearances are rare and, wow, does she look great. Viewers will also appreciate the Manhattan setting, the fine costumes, the steady direction and the well-crafted, very gleeful yet poignant script. Do be aware that there is quite a bit of risqué situations and words. Even so, for most, this is where you should probably look over your calendar and pencil in a time to see this new movie!",This Is Where I Leave You

Judd Altman (Bateman) is having a very bad day. He comes home and finds his wife sleeping with his boss and before he can process what is happening he gets a call saying his father has died. After all that he has to face the worst thing ever...his family. I think Jason Bateman is one of the funniest people ever. He has the perfect amount of sarcastic, dry wit combined with perfect comedic timing that makes anything he is in funnier just by his presence. This movie is the perfect example of that. The subject matter is very dark and borderline depressing but the writing and comedy put out by the cast makes this one funny funny movie. Not since the original Death At A Funeral has a dysfunctional family been so fun to watch. Everyone is perfectly cast and the writing is almost perfect. I just can not say enough about this movie.

In fact, they are confronted with most of the occurrences that complicate life: divorce, pregnancy, affairs, love and death. Each of them must refine his understanding of happiness.The central character is played by Jason Bateman. He is surrounded by a strong cast. My favorite performance is by Tina Fey, who commands every scene she is in.As in life, the plot does not resolve into easy, happy solutions. Each character must deal with real issues---or not----and sometimes they are not masters of their own fates.

26,westsideschl,Dysfunctional,2,28 December 2014,"Clichéd, trite rom-com with a storyline that is obviously ripping off from all the previous movies with the same/similar plot and even with ff it was still tediously boring. The usual dysfunctional family coming together to reminisce at family funeral thus exposing tired clichéd personal issues coupled with the usual brief sex scenes interspersed with the usual pretend tough person obscenities. Oh, almost forgot the customary alcohol induced toughness. Guaranteed not to fail at movie making with those three big enticers.

28,eddie_baggins,Wastes a great cast on sub-standard material,4,16 November 2015,"Sometimes you just can't quite begin to fathom why a movie was made, it's not to say the movie is utterly horrible or irremediably bad, but it's existence is one that can't be nailed down, This is Where I Leave You is one of these such films. Why did such a generic and unoriginal film attract such a varied and talented cast? Why did the films writer Jonathan Tropper try so hard to fit in all the awkward family tropes of reunion movies past into one script? These are but a few of the countless such questions you could ask of this film and are questions in which I for one can't answer.The Internship director Shawn Levy has instilled his family dramedy with so many plot strands, so many awkward moments and so many underused actors that it's clear Leave was struggling from the get-go with an identity crisis. In a crowded marketplace of estranged families banding together in adversity or death it does little to distinguish itself from the pack, at any moment you're just expecting a Sigor Ros or Bon Iver song to play in the background amongst a varied amount of other such elements prone to pop up in such films. What makes Leave even more frustrating in this concern is that there are moments that work in the film, short bursts of genuine heart and humour that are quickly smothered out by another outlandish development that encircles our Altman family members.Our central figure here is Jason Bateman's Judd, a man who is facing the prospect of divorce and fatherhood and perhaps a reacquainted love with childhood sweetheart Penny, played by Australia's new favourite Rose Byrne. Judd's arc is so utterly predictable and by the numbers that any hope Leave had of breaking the mould is shattered and it doesn't help also that Bateman continues to be one of the most frustrating and unoriginal actors of the current generation. Trying to enliven and invigorate proceedings here is a raft of supports that on paper should've been an automatic win but again don't at all gel due to an awkward tone and plot. From Jane Fonda's plastic surgery loving matriarch Hillary, Tina Fey's troubled sister Wendy, Adam Driver in yet another film where he plays Adam Driver and even Justified's Timothy Olyphant as brain damaged Horry, this is one family you'll be glad to see disappear into the credits.This is Where I Leave You has some moments, there are laughs and a few nice ponderings upon life, love and all in between yet it's so unappealingly unoriginal that it's very hard to recommend. When you can't pinpoint a reason for a film coming to fruition, whether it be a comedy, drama or anything else in the long line of genres you know that the film missed the mark, This is Where I Leave You misses the mark and misses it badly, in its fruitless struggle to make us care.2 baby monitors out of 5",This Is Where I Leave You
29,leonblackwood,Funny and emotional. 6/10,6,15 March 2015,"Review: I quite enjoyed this light hearted, fun movie about a dysfunctional family who get together after there father sadly passed away. Each individual character has there own personal issues which is brought to light when the family get together. There are some touching moments, like when Jane Fonda breaks her shocking news, but underneath all of the madness, there is a deep love for each other which helps them through there troubled life's. I personally loved the chemistry between the characters and the realistic situations made it a joy to watch. Its very well written and you can't help but feel emotional about the family who all end up leaving the family home with a different view to there personal issues. Jason Bateman, who played the main character, catches his boss sleeping with his wife at the beginning of the movie so he has to sort out what to do with his somewhat perfect life, which has been destroyed. With the help of his ex-girlfriend, he comes to terms with the whole situation and realises that his life has to change, even though his life has been perfect up to now. Anyway, there's enough material throughout the movie which kept it upbeat and funny in parts so it's worth a watch just for its wit. Watchable!Round-Up: It's makes such a difference when you watch a well written movie with some decent actors. I've seen so much movies lately were the movie has a decent script but the actors are terrible or the script is terrible but the actors are OK. In this film, the director got the mixture just right and the humour mixed with emotional situations worked very well. Bateman does act the same in a lot of his movies so I wasn't that surprised about his performance and it was good to see Fonda back on the big screen playing a comedic role as the head of the family. Its not surprising that the movie made a profit at the box office because, I'm sure that there was a few issues that a lot of dysfunctional families can relate to. In all, it's a well made movie that has something for everyone. Budget: $20million Worldwide Gross: $41millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their emotional comedy/dramas about a dysfunctional family who are brought together after there fathers death. 6/10",This Is Where I Leave You
30,TheMovieDiorama,This Is Where I Leave You left me wanting more laughs and less destructive drama.,5,17 April 2020,"Grieving is always a solemn time for solace and melancholy. To reflect upon the life that has departed, recounting the flourishing memories shared with them. A chance for fragmented families to rejoin as a unit once more, offering emotional support for one another. Well, for the Altmans, whose patriarchal father had sadly passed away, that's not the case. A boisterous family consisting of four siblings whom each inhibit their own overbearing issues. There's Judd whom recently witnessed his wife cheat on him with his loud-mouthed ever-growing heterosexual boss, only to then reconcile with his high school friend who was incidentally madly in love with him. Wendy, being married to a workaholic, rekindles a burning flame with her childhood friendly neighbour. Paul whom is unable to provide his wife Annie with a child due to infertility, despite trying repeatedly during the seven days of shiva that their father supposedly demanded. And finally Phillip, the man-child playboy entrepreneur of the family. Rather predictably, being confined to their mother's home for seven days produced bickering, brawls and bail outs between the self-destructive siblings, whom all seemingly yearn to make their lives even more complicated.Levy's ""dramedy"" is equipped with an outstandingly talented cast of both comedy and dramatic prowess, yet frustratingly strolls along at a pedestrian pace. Driver, Bateman, Fey, Byrne, Stoll, Olyphant and even Fonda all in the same feature? That's madness! Unsurprisingly, they all supply compelling performances that bring joyous life into their characters, with Fey offering a career-best presentation that balances emotional complexity with comedic execution.However, Tropper's screenplay, for which he adapted his own book, generally painted unlikeable characters. Family members who would make the very worst relationship decisions, by seemingly committing adultery with every member of their neighbourhood in the space of seven days, that makes them no better morally than Judd's counterpart for example. It's careless characterisation that only had one purpose, to create drama. Whilst it does provide a development strand for adult responsibilities, it does so through a predictable mesh of sub-plots. Certain characters, notably Olyphant's Horry, were underused and acted as mere plot devices. The forced and absolutely unnecessary climactic lesbian revelation was, well, pointless to say the least. Again, supplying the narrative with this abhorrent self-destructive force within these supposedly married couples, culminating into reconciling acceptance.And finally, the obvious flaw, Levy was unable to blend weak comedy with overbearing drama effectively. The poignant moments of reflection produced the largest impact and certainly had its moments. The comedy however? Non-existent. Mostly relying upon profanity and phallic jokes. It's a dire shame that the screenplay reduced the onscreen performances to predictable belligerents.Whilst the end product is an easy and watchable feature, the pedestrian pace and lack of morality certainly left me with no impression. Olyphant and Driver though! Phwoar...",This Is Where I Leave You
31,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A stacked cast can't save this over-the-top mess,4,2 January 2015,"Dysfunctional family antics get taken to the extreme in ""This Is Where I Leave You,"" the story of four adult siblings who reunite in their childhood home after the death of their father, whose last wishes were for them to sit shiva, the Jewish custom of staying together as a family for seven days following the funeral to mourn and be comforted by family and friends. But the Altmans are far from religious, and each family member has his or her shtick along with problems in their personal life, and all together they drive each other bonkers in a perpetual cycle of farcical melodrama.The Altmans are a true all-star family: Jane Fonda plays the matriarch, and her children are played by Jason Bateman, Tina Fey, Corey Stoll (""House of Cards"") and Adam Driver (""Girls""). Along with spouses, significant others and neighbors being played by Kathryn Hahn, Rose Byrne, Dax Shepard, Timothy Olyphant (""Justified""), Connie Britton (""Friday Night Lights"") and Ben Schwartz (""Parks and Recreation""), the cast is totally stacked for Jonathan Tropper's adaptation of his novel. Why they all came together for this script, however, is anyone's guess. ""Leave You"" is an absolutely over-the-top mess of a dark slapstick comedy trying desperately to be an introspective indie dramedy.The main character is Bateman's Judd, who weeks before getting the call about his dad walked on his wife sleeping with his boss (Shepard), but it doesn't seem so bad alongside his siblings' problems. His sister, Wendy (Fey), has two young kids and a jerk husband, his older brother, Paul (Stoll), is having trouble getting his wife (Hahn) — an ex-girlfriend of Judd's — pregnant, and his younger brother, Phillip (Driver), is dating his much older therapist (Britton) who is just like their mother. The side plots don't even end there.The script plays out like an endless round robin of family members having heart-to-hearts and exploding at each other in bouts of physical violence. Judd talks to Wendy out on the roof, fights with Paul, goes for a spin with Phillip, weeps with his mother and falls for a girl he grew up with (Byrne), all while dealing with his soon-to-be ex-wife (Abigail Spencer). The scenes barely have time to set themselves before they escalate into chaos, lust, hilarity, poignancy or whatever the end goal is. Clearly, veteran comedy director Shawn Levy is in over his head with this one. Juggling a dozen characters is easy in the ""Night at the Museum"" films, but illustrating the combination of grief, personal hardship, family dynamics, relationship dynamics and more has him completely out of sorts. He's a director who understands comedic timing and how to pace a film in an entertaining way, but he has no idea how to slow the script's pacing down to create empathy for the characters and allow the audience to chew on Tropper's well-intentioned themes. He also peppers in an ""indie soundtrack"" in hopes of creating that tone, but it only backfires given how ""un-indie"" the rest of the movie is.The cast is fun to watch, but the number of clichés and melodramatic moments kill any seriousness or realism they bring to their characters. The fact that the actors are such proved talents really just proves that the film's biggest problem is the plot and the way the story was strung together. They make this movie infinitely more bearable because they're funny, quality actors, but they don't tip the scales from ""watchable"" to ""good.""There's no breathing space for any of the characters and their stories, which sucks them dry of any realism and makes the whole film seem completely ludicrous. How could that much soap drama happen to one family in a week's time? As much truth as there might be to the themes of Tropper's story and that logically all these things can and do happen in relationships, there are just too many of these conflicts for one movie.""This Is Where I Leave You"" is a classic trap film. Casual moviegoers browsing through their rental options will surely say aloud, ""Jason Bateman, Tina Fey, the director of 'Date Night' ... how did I miss this in theaters?""

The father of the family dies and his last wish was for all of his grown up children and their spouses to have a 'shiva', which is Jewish and means they have to all stay under one roof for 7 days with their mother. Everyone has their own set of problems; from unfaithful spouses to sleeping with their psychologist to wanting to have a baby. Jason and Tina are two of the four siblings and Jane is their mother.

The premise of the film sees a dysfunctional family have to spend time together due to their father's death. Jason Bateman plays the lead in this film and he is really good in this film. He was funny but you also care about the issues that he has to deal with in this film. This is really the first thing I have seem Adam driver in and he is fantastic in this film. He was the funniest person in the film and the character that I liked the most. Tina fey is really funny and I thought she was really good in this film and brought some food drama too. Corey stoll was good in this movie and I thought he played his role pretty well. I liked the story of this dysfunctional family and some of their individual stories were interesting. However, there was just too many stories and too many characters for you to really care about all of them. The script has some decent drama and humour but I ended up not really laughing that much in this comedy. The style was alright with some interesting locations and jokes.

35,jimbo-53-186511,An unfocused mess,2,27 January 2016,"This Is Where I Leave You is a film that seems to be very 'busy' all the time but at the same time is also a film that never really goes anywhere and does very little that's actually interesting.Essentially, we have a bunch of estranged siblings who had little contact with each other prior to their father's death and it is their father's death that brings them together. At the behest of their father the family are forced to spend a week together taking part in a form of Jewish mourning known as Shiva whereby the family are forbidden from leaving the area or taking public transport (amongst other things). This sets out the framework for the film, but that's all it really does - the siblings are at each other's throats at the start and are still the same at the end with very little in the way of reflection or insight offered in between. The characterisations are sketchy and flat here making many of the characters seem more like caricatures rather than human beings.Another problem here is that very little of what is on offer here feels realistic or believable. The Altman family are dysfunctional, but this concept is taken to a ridiculous extreme here and makes it look as if we're watching some sort of parody of a bad soap opera or a bad sitcom. Even if you're prepared to overlook the over-the-top antics of the Altman family then it's almost impossible to get around how unlikeable and annoying many members of the family are - it's safe to say that they are a hard bunch to tolerate over a 100 minute period.Other major problems relate to the unfocused nature of the story; it seemed to just keep flitting around all the over the place without really settling on one main story. It never seems to settle into any kind of rhythm and ironically it actually achieves very little by trying to do too much. Screenwriter Jonathan Tropper gives many of the characters nothing interesting to say or do making the film feel both dull and boring. I also felt that too much time was spent on irritating characters and not enough time was spent on more interesting characters (such as Timothy Olyphant's character). Director Shawn Levy shoots the film in the style of a soap opera and gives the film a very tedious episodic feel.Whilst many of the characters got on my nerves here there were a few exceptions; Jane Fonda was a lot of fun and her dirty talk about their father was both gag-inducing and pretty damn funny. Bateman is the most likable member of the Altman family and probably the most believable (and one of the few characters who didn't annoy me).Sadly, there are only a couple of moments in this film that are either amusing or tolerable and for the most part this is a loud, irritating, and generally unbearable affair from start to finish.",This Is Where I Leave You
36,3xHCCH,Dysfunctional Siblings,7,18 December 2014,"The Altmans reunite when their father dies. Their mother Hilary reveals that his dying wish was for the members of his family to sit Shiva, a Jewish funeral custom during which family members gather in their home and receive visitors for seven days. Forced to stay together, the four Altman siblings have to address their current personal problems in full view of each other. Many times, their dirty laundry would even washed in front of their neighbors.Eldest brother Paul is unsuccessful with trying to have kids with his wife Annie. Judd is still reeling from his wife Quinn's infidelity, as he reconnects with Penny, the girl who had a crush on him. Wendy is drifting away from her constantly busy husband Barry, as she was haunted by her decision to leave her first love Horry, who had a brain injury. Youngest brother Phillip is still immature and direction-less in his life, even as brings along his rich and much-older fiancée Tracy. There have been other films about dysfunctional families reuniting because of a death in the family. The one that immediately comes to mind is ""August: Osage County"". In that one, the Weston sisters all had bones to pick with their ill-tempered, drunk and domineering mother played by Meryl Streep. In this one, the Altman siblings all never forgave their mother for writing about their private childhood misadventures in her best-selling book. In contrast with Streep, Jane Fonda played sexually- frank matriarch Hilary with class and genuine affection for her kids and her artificially-enhanced breasts.The two actors playing the two central characters are more known for their wild funny comedies, Jason Bateman (as Judd) and Tina Fey (as Wendy). Here, while they still had witty exchanges of words, we get to see more of their serious sides. There are really no laugh-out-loud moments in this film, as some audiences may be expecting given their reputation for slapstick. The other members of the cast also do very well. Corey Stoll and Adam Driver play the other two brothers steady Paul and screwball Phillip, respectively. I liked Rose Byrne's portrayal of the sweet Penny. Those scenes of hers in the ice skating rink were very nice indeed. Timothy Olyphant had some affecting scenes as the mentally-impaired Horry.I personally liked this film because of its smart and thought-provoking script as written by Jonathan Tropper from his own novel. While there may be some missteps which may offend others, generally the script had some pretty sharp psychology about sibling relationships within its darkly humorous lines. Director Shawn Levy brings into this project the same sensitive understanding of about families he showed in his previous films ""Date Night"" and ""Real Steel"". 7/10.",This Is Where I Leave You

One an icon who can just show up and light up the screen, and Bateman, a very likable actor who could have been great here, but he falls victim to the mess that permeates every minute of this nightmare. It's not funny, dramatic, or anything else but truly awful because all we get are one stupid remark after another, one loud display of bad acting after another, and what has to be one horrible turn by an actor who should not be allowed to show up in another film after this: Adam Driver, more on him later.A family goes back home to honor their father after his passing. The matriarch, Jane Fonda pretty much finds an opportunity to put them all under the same roof for about a week, and we expect this will result in some matters being resolved, some sort of catharsis to originate from these people confronting each other and getting rid of their demons, and they have plenty to resolve, but it's the presentation and execution of these problems that is the problem. It's hard to like anyone here. Fonda can't find her footing, and all she has to play with are her new and improved breasts. Soon, we are tired of all the jokes, and the best she can say about her husband is that he was gifted. This is just the beginning of one crass joke after another. With the exception of a surprising turn by a celebrity that I can't usually stand and manages to gather some dignity and actually do some good acting here, everyone is awful. Tina Fey somehow delivers her lines as if she was stepping in from another movie and directed by someone who has been behind a camera and knows how to tell a story. She is the steady and logical mind here, reminding them of who they really are, and to stop deluding themselves with silly pretensions.We have the cheating wife, the stressed husband who might never be able to father a child under the pressure of his loving wife, who has no problems finding a sperm donor with the help another family member. We have the immature sibling, who can't make a move without reminding them or any of us in the audience what a truly horrible human being he is. Either Driver is the best actor around because after this is I don't think anyone is going to be able to see him in any other light. We certainly can't understand why anyone would put up with a person like him ever, in any situation. In the film he has managed to seduce a woman with a PhD, but we wonder what in the world she has seen in him because Driver's acting is so one-dimensional that we don't see him as having any charm whatsoever. He certainly doesn't have the looks, or anything in the way he delivers his lines. He's barely tolerable when he is on the screen. He makes everybody else look even worse than they already are.It's certainly a pity because Stoll has managed to shine in previous films, both dramas and comedies with his simple and dry approach. Here he looks lost and like a victim. Maybe he was just reacting to the horrible dialog. Things don't improve in the end. In fact the best of surprises just feels like a last minute desperate attempt to make us feel like we are watching a daring, independent film, but it's just as futile as anything that has been presented before. The jokes are as bad and as infantile as anything we saw in ""Bad Neighbors"". How many times can we see that cute child play with his newly discovered ability to go to the bathroom? Oh, and let me count the way that everyone talks about Ms. Fonda's improved physique, which at 70+ manages to look terrific, but the joke here is if anything offensive. We can also wonder if the producers of ""Porky"" got in their two cents, too because I'll never be able to look at a rabbi again without thinking middle school mentality. It's pretty sad to see grown men playing that joke and other adults actually pretending they like it.Finally, I kept thinking that dysfunctional families have given us plenty to laugh at, laugh with, cry with, and have managed to go from low brow comedy to the heights of Oscar winning material. I kept looking back with more respect than ever at the way Shirley McLaine and Jack Nicholson did so much wonderful work in ""Terms of Endearment"". With the superb support of Winger, De Vitto, and the rest of a cast that managed to show real life situations, sometimes in broad strokes, pushing the limits, but never failing to deliver the message that we are flawed, but that as long as we care, there is room for redemption and a better future. In ""Terms"", even the strength of that love is enough to give us a hint that everything might just be all right. Here we never get the feeling that anyone in this family had anything but revulsion for each other, and we just wonder what the rest of the neighborhood felt when they saw what was going on under that roof.Yes, maybe people should just leave before even going in, and maybe the message is for the actors who should take their cues and start looking more carefully at the kind of material they decide to try next time.",This Is Where I Leave You
38,Amari-Sali,"As a family comes together after the passing of the patriarch, drama from all their lives collide and many secrets are revealed.",8,28 September 2014,"I won't lie, I was thinking I was going to hate watching this movie. For while I love Rose Byrne, everyone else I was sort of unsure of. Especially Jason Bateman since after The Longest Week I was beginning to think of him as a clear sign that a movie isn't worth looking at. Though remembering he was in Juno, as well as many other films I like, perhaps it is just his most recent movies aren't my thing. Rather than him being a dangerous name to see attached to anything like Eugene Levy. But I digress, let's talk about the movie.Characters & StoryJudd Altman (Jason Bateman) has just been dealt a series of blows in his life. His wife Quinn (Abigail Spencer) is cheating on him with his boss Wade (Dax Shepard), and his dad dies. Something which, at any other time, would be truly horrible, but with it being a good excuse to get the hell out of town, it is something which presents mixed emotions. Though while Judd isn't having that great of a life right now, neither are his siblings. His oldest brother Paul (Corey Stoll) is having issues with his wife Annie (Kathryn Hahn) when it comes to getting pregnant and, to make matters interesting, Annie is Judd's ex. Then there comes Wendy (Tina Fey) who is in a rocky relationship with her husband, has two kids by him, and is now back in town where her ex Horry (Timothy Olyphant) is. Someone who pretty much is the love of her life, but guilt and tragedy keep them from being together. Leaving the youngest brother Phillip (Adam Driver) who is wild, crazy, and pretty immature. However, with the family back together for the funeral, as well as to honor the wishes of their dad, chaos ensues. All of which their mother Hillary (Jane Fonda) tries to quell, sometimes.PraiseWhat I love most about this film is that the characters don't seem like a bunch of people slapped together without any sort of connection or chemistry. Everyone in the family seems to have a genuine love for each other, and a unique relationship with one another. Especially Phillip who, smartly, the film utilizes quite well. For with the majority of the cast dealing with marital problems in various ways, Phillip/ Driver makes for an excellent comic relief.Though this isn't to say the rest of the cast isn't funny. Everyone gets the chance to have their moment, but none of it feels like they are telling a joke just because. Each joke seems specially geared for who is speaking it, and seems like it fits the moment they are in. Whether it is a joke about Hillary's new breast, Wendy's son who likes to poop outside, or even the jokes shared between Penny (Rose Bryne) and Judd.Leading to one last thing worth praising: The movie doesn't end with things wrapped up in a pretty bow and everything resolved. Something I quite liked for it really made it seem we were spending about a week with a real life family, rather than seeing characters who appear and disappear once the movie begins and ends, and seem like their lives will cease to exist. Though, I must admit, it does leave you wanting answers. But this is based off a book so answers maybe within there.CriticismWhen it comes to criticism, I must admit I felt, probably due to my own prejudice, not really into the movie when it started. For with the way Fey delivered the news about the dad dying, with her having a horrible sad/ crying face, my eyes were rolling and I was already starting to get antsy to leave. But as things became more genuine, I realized it was just me. Making it so the only real issue I had was those which I made up in my head due to preconceived notions.Overall: Worth SeeingThis is one of those rare films which are ensemble pieces and works. For with most doting too much on one character's story, or perhaps one being really strong while the rest of them are weak, usually you get a lopsided feature when so many recognizable names are sharing a film. However, This Is Where I Leave You somehow finds a good balance so everyone gets to be established, becomes uniquely lovable, and leaves you with the hope something better is on the horizon for them. Hence why I'm labeling this as worth seeing.",This Is Where I Leave You
39,ShelbyTMItchell,Disorganized Family!,8,22 September 2014,"I confess to never reading the book as never very hardly read any fiction books but that is another story.But the movie was really good with an all star cast and also great acting in this story.Jason Bateman the real protagonist, is a man who lost his wife to his friend and boss, at the radio station he works at as a producer. To make matters worse, his father dies and wants the family to get together for a Jewish Shiva. Despite the fact that the father was an Atheist when he died. Still he meets his four siblings, Corey Stoll and Kathryn Hahn as a couple trying to have kids. Tina Fey and her two kids as she messes the man, who took care of the mother, Jane Fonda when her husband dies, played by Justified Timothy Olymphant who has brain damage. Adam Driver who is the immature black sheep of the family who brings his therapist, Nashville's Connie Britton.But still despite the fact that they have their own lives and have not seen one another it seems in years. One of the things the father asks for is that, in his will before he died, to have his siblings and their loved ones under one roof for a week, hence the Shiva thing.It will not be easy. But they have to put aside their differences and own needs to come mourn for their father along with taking care of their mom and getting to reconnect once again.It is a disorganized family.

40,jadepietro,Oy in the Family,5,23 September 2014,"This film is not recommended.The new fall movie season continues with a misguided dramedy aptly entitled This is Where I Leave You. One can view this mishmash-up of genres as a comedy with very little drama, or a drama with not that much comedy. Either way, it's a waste of your time and the talents of its assembled cast with the net result being that one wants to leave it within the film's first hour.The formulaic premise: Another dysfunctional group gathers, once again for funeral purposes, to show the underlying conflicts deep within the American Jewish family. Only this time, the serious nature of their problems are pure sit-com opportunities filled with pratfalls and depreciating humor. The one-liners never really connect nor does the manipulated theatrics. Characters are more serviceable props thrown together to mishandle each other and behave in a childish manner, making them less endearing and all the more tiresome. They constantly overreact, unlike real people placed in the same situations. It's seven days of conflict and resolution = laughter. Supposedly.Now meet the family: Judd Altman (Jason Bateman), recently separated from his wife and sibling to Wendy (Tina Fey), herself in an unhappy marriage, and their oldest brothers, Paul (Corey Stoll), desperately trying to become a father, plus youngest brother Phillip (Adam Driver), the token black sheep of the family. And then their Mama Altman (Jane Fonda), a vain yet knowing matriarch. Add to that lot various love interests and silly complications. The plotting is diametrically set, but it's not remotely believable, especially in its telling.What makes the the film all the more disappointing is the cast of accomplished actors involved, many of whom have successfully honed their comic craft in other projects. With the presence of Mr. Bateman, Ms. Fey, Mr. Driver, Mr. Stoll, and Ms. Fonda on board, and solid support by Rose Bryne, Timothy Olyphant, Connie Britton, Dax Shepard, and Kathryn Hayne, the film should have been much better. An A+ cast lost in a C+ movie.The fault lays in a really weak script by Jonathan Tropper who penned the best-selling novel of which this film is based. The script never defines its characters well or develops any real tension. Some scenes do work nicely, but they are too few to mention. Of course, the pedestrian direction by Shawn Levy, who never finds the right rhythm or tone for his film, never helps matters much.Like most family reunion, it's a hit-and-miss affair.

41,Seraphion,A touching family drama but the comedy lacks a bunch,6,5 October 2014,"Judd has his life torn to shreds when he caught his wife Quinn cheating with his boss Wade. What comes next is his father's death three months later. In honor of their father's last wish, Judd and his siblings Paul, Phillip, and Wendy then spends the next week back under one roof again with their mother Hillary. Conflicts, reconciliations go in and out back and forth as they revisit their memories and mention all those unresolved problems of the past and present. Those include division of shares and ownership of their late father's sporting goods store; Phillip's newest couple Tracy is a way older woman than he is; Paul and his wife Alice's problem of not having any kids yet; Wendy's old romance Horry who's until now sill single; and Judd's own rekindling of old romance with Penny. But then Quinn goes to Judd revealing her pregnancy and Wade's sterility. After a funny encounter with Wade, Quinn and Wendy, Judd decides to keep his marriage intact after Wade backs off. The family then gets closer together with Hillary revealing some shocking things.The movie opens up in a standard drama build up. It then continues on, being so very heavily loaded on the drama side. It kind of feels like the whole promotion of the movie is deceitful as the trailer cuts in those quite funny scenes, which may, like in my case, made me anticipated a funnier movie. The drama thing is so heavy here. I expected to see Jason Bateman's wackier performance such in Paul or Bad Words, but I didn't get it. This is the third 'funeral based' movies I've seen this year after Life After Beth and God's Pocket, which also feature drama content. What's weird about this movie is that the comedy feels either quite awkward at times or simple not funny enough for my standards. Yes, there are moments that sent me cracking laughs, but most of the time the comedy in this movie can only give me little giggles.But then story-wise, this movie did conveyed quite a nice touching story about family closeness. All those scenes of the siblings fighting one another and making up together later that day depict nicely how the ideal family situation regardless of how dysfunctional the family may be. The relationships outside of the family are also depicted quite well, having the family supporting the family member in it.The acting; is quite a good performance overall. I like how Jason Bateman managed to deliver is character as the focus character until the rest of the family cast is introduced. Tina Fey also gave her character enough life in presenting the movie's multi conflict environment. Rose Byrne made her role significant enough even though she is outside of the main family cast. The rest of the family cast did nicely in acting out the conflicts.A 6 out of 10 score is from me for This Is Where I leave You (2014). A recommendation is a so-so option from me. It's nicely touching as a drama. But for those of you expecting laughable comedy, be warned for the lack of hilarious jokes.",This Is Where I Leave You
42,rgkarim,This is Where it Left Me,7,21 September 2014,"My final review for this weekend deviates from the Thriller path into one a little more down to Earth and family oriented. Instead of running from fictitious beasts, or hunting down two ridiculous, this movie focuses on familial drama and complicated relationships. Have you guessed the movie yet? Well of course you have, it's none other than This is Where I Leave You, another film with a cavalcade of stars to act out the drama at hand. Now many of you have seen the trailers and most likely laughed at some of the clips they had to offer. Of course we all know the trailer editors are masters of seducing audience members. So I've returned to my lair of the local movie theater to give you some insight into the latest comedy of the month. This Is Where I Leave You is a mess of family issues all coming together in one giant wreck when the father of the group dies. At the request of the dying man, the family is to spend seven days together to provide the opportunity to reflect and spend some quality time. However, being forced into one living quarters for any ""significant"" amount of time is sure to bring some issues out in the open, especially ones that have been stirring for quite some time. Although it is dubbed a comedy, this film I felt was more of a Drama than anything as a variety of issues surfaces over the course of the movie. Each sibling has some underlying problem that seems to be one dimensional at first only to evolve into a much more complicated mess. Fans of such soap opera dynamics will instantly fall in love with this movie, as relationships, jobs, and personal qualities all come up to the chopping block of family intervention. Fortunately for you drama lovers, these issues are not simple high school level problems, but much bigger and deeper offering many sub-plots for you to get wrapped into. Yet for this reviewer, so many issues in one movie were a little overbearing or too conveniently timed to fit into the whole mess. Some of these issues are dragged out across the story, only to be suddenly wrapped up in the end in a rather bland conclusion, if concluded at all. Despite some of the antics and drama being annoying though, what kept me enthralled in it was the relativity. Surely everyone who sees this movie, not counting kids mind you, can find some character to relate to. While not exact in every detail, I was able to place his own drama in the mix, further grasping my attention to what was coming. Now with all the drama, you might be a little scared that there is a lack of comedy aspect to this movie. My friends you have no need to fear, this movie is filled with comedy moments in the form of dialog, situational, and a little sarcasm thrown in as well. I warn you now that this movie is not the kind of comedy that is filled with repetitive one-liners, out of control stupidity, or far-fetched actions. Instead it's very natural comedy that is dryer in nature and cleverer than the typical milieu we get these days. The dialog is simplistic and realistic, and often what you would find in a typical family outing. Insults are well timed and personalized, occasionally throwing in some more general jokes into the fray. Fights amongst the brothers quickly grow out of hand, and childish behavior rears its head in some of the most embarrassing scenes. And as you have seen in the trailers, there are a few touch ups some of the family members have, so inappropriate at times that you can't help but laugh at the awkwardness. Of course one of my favorite antics was the little boy in the house, who was modeled to be cute, as he shared his potty achievements with the adults. Such simplistic comedy goes a long way in my shoes, and relating it to my own family members. Some of the sexual antics are a little out of my enjoyment area, and unfortunately a few curse words are overused at times. As for the acting, there are just too many characters to mention, so I'll stick to my favorites and wrap this up. First off I loved Tina Fey in this movie. Sassy, strong, and caring, all of these qualities were evenly mixed to make her the guardian sister of the group. I was thoroughly entertained by her in this movie and enjoyed her not acting like she was in an SNL skit. Adam Driver was a welcome addition, his ridiculousness helping him stand out from the group, though he was a little annoying at points. Still Driver did a nice job with his lines, and covered the emotional spectrum quite well. However, the biggest surprise was leading actor Jason Bateman. For once his monotone acting didn't annoy me, because his dry humor was shoved down my face. Being the center of the story, Bateman brought his character's story to life, his emotions adapting to the situation and breaking that emotionless cast we typically see him in. His chemistry with the others was good, and overall was a much better character for me. This is where I leave you is a movie that I feel many drama lovers will love, and is a nice change from the flood of generic movies we get. Clever writing, realistic characters and some interesting lessons will keep many entertained in the fall until November hits. It is definitely not the greatest movie, and I didn't laugh as hard as in some other films, but I say give it a chance. My scores are:Comedy: 6.5-7.0 Movie Overall: 7.5",This Is Where I Leave You
43,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of This Is Where I Leave You,4,20 September 2014,"In my thirty-plus years of watching movies, I have rarely walked out of one. In fact, the only time happened during 1991's Another You. It was a completely misguided Richard Pryor/Gene Wilder exercise that was simply unwatchable. Plus, I forgot that I had to be somewhere else. Anyway, This Is Where I Leave You really tempted me to do what I did over two decades ago. Granted, this is one incoherent mess that felt like it was going to explode. Let me explain.This Is Where I Leave You is like a comedic version of The Big Chill (without a point or purpose) or a poor man's version of August: Osage County (without the stellar acting). It has characters that are despicable, hypocritical, wishy-washy, and to a fault, underdeveloped. Everyone who walks into frame is someone you wanna throw popcorn at, yell at, or slap (hypothetically speaking of course). The only likable actor that existed was the lead, Jason Bateman. Too bad the rest of the proceedings around him were the movie equivalent of a garbage pale.Filmed in a residential area of New York City, based on a novel (the novelist is also the screenwriter), and focused on a main character who is frowned upon or held in the lowest esteem, This Is Where I Leave You chronicles the funeral of a doting father who's identity is never totally revealed. His immediate family members and their respective friends/spouses, gather for 7 days of grieving (if you can honestly call it that) in the form of a Jewish ritual called Shiva (a week-long mourning period in Judaism for 1st degree relatives). These relatives that are front and center, consist of Judd Altman (Jason Bateman), Wendy Altman (Tina Fey), Phillip Altman (Adam Driver), Paul Altman (Corey Stoll), and Hillary Altman (the chest-enhanced mother played by Jane Fonda). In general, Jason Bateman's Judd is the film's main oddity. His wife cheated on him, he has no job, and he's about to be a dad even though he's getting a divorce. His character's nasty misfortune is for some reason, this 2014 release's main metaphor. He's the most likable pawn in this family's sorry game. His respective relatives perpetuate him to feel miserable and by that token, they are one messed up bunch of annoying a- holes.Now as I observed, the family in this film is not dysfunctional but they are a bunch of people that I would wholeheartedly avoid. They obviously don't respect each other, they obviously could care less about their father/husband who died, and they don't mind airing each other's dirty laundry as a form of harassed embarrassment. And I know that actors don't exactly look alike, but at least the casting director could have found 1 or 2 people that resembled the mother played by Jane Fonda. I mean Bateman looks like he could be Fonda's son in real life. As for everybody else, they look adopted, literally.So OK, you can tell that I've used this vehicle as a forum to vent. I've made some notable observations. Note to Jason Bateman's character: it's not cool anymore to hang out on the roof of your parent's house. And in broad daylight it just seems frat party-induced and creepy. Note to Tina Fey: you are not a dramatic actress. You think you are likable and relevant in movies but you're not. Stick to writing and the SNL stuff. Your acting is the equivalent of Lee Press On Nails running ramped on a chalkboard. Note to director Shawn Levy: a bunch of individual scenes that barely add up to parts of a whole, don't qualify as an actual movie. Look at your previous work (2013's harmless, effective The Internship) and you'll see what I mean.In retrospect, if you like monotonous and tedious sequences where characters bicker, yell, and fight with each other (as the script requires) then this is the movie for you. If you like scenes where out of nowhere, these same characters are giving each other bad advice that is edited in the most inconsistent way possible, then this is the film for you. And if you think that the sight of a toddler randomly pooping in broad daylight (in the backyard) is funny, then this is the film for you. Bottom line: This Is Where I Leave You equals the notion, ""this is where I should have left the theater,"" a half hour into it.",This Is Where I Leave You
44,larrys3,Torturous to Watch,1,30 December 2014,"Another movie in a long line of movies that believe it's entertaining and humorous to present it's characters as being completely unfiltered, and who came across to me extremely vile and despicable. It seemed the characters were just trying to outdo each other as to who could be the most mean spirited, lewd, crude, and outrageous.The story revolves around the Altman family patriarch dying, and the remainder of the family being summoned by the Altman matriarch (Jane Fonda) to attend the funeral. Additionally, she informs them that her late husband requested that they all sit shiva for seven days, which in Jewish tradition has the family remaining together in mourning and greeting any family and friends who wish to visit to express their condolences.For me, watching this repugnant cast of characters for seven days seemed like seven years and became incredibly torturous to continue. I wanted to write this review so I stuck with it to the end. but otherwise I would have done something I almost never do and just walk away and not finish it.Maybe there are those that like this ""humor"", but I would say carefully heed the advice of those reviewers on this site that have issued warnings. To me, it became cringe inducing and repulsive, and I couldn't wait till it ended.",This Is Where I Leave You
45,bkrauser-81-311064,Affectionate Little Family Comedy,8,26 June 2016,"When I was very young I sat down and watched a movie called Passed Away (1992) starring Bob Hoskins, Jack Warden, William Petersen and Tim Curry. It wasn't that great but as my earliest introduction to black comedy, specifically the reunion-at-a-funeral plot-line, it was gold. This is Where I Leave You is a little more somber in tone than Passed Away or for that matter Death at a Funeral (2007) but the plot is still roughly the same. A maladjusted family comes together to mourn the passing of the broods patriarch. Before, during and after the funeral family secrets are revealed, rivalries are renewed and dysfunction causes chaos.You mean this movie still doesn't make up for The Ex (2006)? This is Where I Leave You failed to get much critical or box-office attention despite a talented cast which includes Jason Bateman, Tina Fey, Jane Fonda and Adam Driver. Part of that reason is because it's an uneasy blend of comedy and drama which never reaches the level of farce or sad-sack melodrama; it's somewhere in-between. Based on a memoir of the same name by Jonathan Tropper, This is Where I Leave You doesn't really focus on big revelations or reveals though there are a few sprinkled in. Its more about representing an interesting and unique family honestly and with affection. Can't really fault a movie for that.",This Is Where I Leave You

47,maurice_yacowar,Father's funeral brings family new beginning and new losses,8,20 September 2014,"Shawn Levy's This is Where I Leave You is an Altman movie. The family who reunites for the father's shiva is named Altman. Moreover, like so many Robert Altman films this one uses a cultural institution to expose harsh truths about the current American social climate. It also includes such signature elements as off-the-wall dialogue, often black comic or profane, with a collection of nutbar characters airing barely concealed animosities, with overlapping dialogue and colliding egos. Like a Robert Altman film this one subverts its genre. It turns into an anti-RomCom. Normally the splintered courtships recover into marriage, with friendships restored, family ties strengthened. But here the film ends with two marriages broken, one threatened but restored, one affair broken and another perhaps to begin, and the lonely widow turning to a lesbian love. And the nice brother steals his kid brother's Porsche. Levy's lesson is Altmanic — the American promise of success and happiness is a delusion, which the Hollywood dream factory exists to confirm, and that only a maverick has the clear vision and irreverence to expose.Perhaps two outside figures provide the emblems for the main ones. One is the little boy exuberantly learning to use his potty. He embodies a life-changing moment, a turning point into a new level of maturity. The only adult who finds such joy in transition is Momma Hilary (Jane Fonda), whose candid memories of her marital sex life are only trumped by her revelation of a lesbian affair. Her children get only pain and grief at their turning points: Judd (Jason Bateman) finding his wife in bed with his boss, then learning she's carrying his own baby girl; the puerile Phillip (Adam Driver) in an affair with an older, wiser woman, Tracey (Connie Britton), but losing her when he can't resist a side dish; Paul suffering increasing insecurity and jealousy when he can't impregnate his wife and risks losing control of the family sporting goods store. Sister Wendy (Tina Fey) has the maturing son but is at the point of losing her semidetached husband. Worse, she still harbours a passion for her girlhood love Horry (Timothy Olyphant), whom she left behind when their car accident left him brain damaged. If the little boy is an emblem of people moving on to new stages of life, Horry embodies stasis, being stuck in the moment unable to advance. His saving grace is that alone among his generation here he accepts his situation without resentment. The character who most obviously grows is Judd, who accepts both his wife's desertion and responsibility for their child. He also resolves to live a more complicated life, in search of a more real relationship, presumably with the ice skater who had a childhood crush on him. As in Egoyan's The Captive (see separate blog) the ice-skating heroine personifies the solitary search for grace in a harsh, cold hard-surfaced world. Apt for a therapeutic anti-film, there are two therapists here, both mature blonde women. Mother Hilary wrote a bestseller about family relationships (of the physician heal thyself syndrome). Her female sensitivity and sense provided the royalties that enabled the men's world, the sporting goods store, to survive. Tracey was Phillip's therapist until they fell in love, a relationship she was the only adult not to see was doomed from the getgo. Tracey emerges reduced by the whole experience, Hilary enhanced not just by her uplifting surgery but by her courage in discovering a new form of love. Her shiva ploy sustains her family as her royalties did the store. This Altman family is wholly secular, so that the mother's assertion of shiva comes from the spot where they used to put the Christmas tree. Still, the ritual gathering serves to remind the grievers of their bond, engages their community, and provides a ceremony that helps them get through both the loss of their father and their mutual antagonisms. ""Boner"" Grodner, the childhood friend turned rabbi, is a caricature of the new-style with-it ""modern"" rabbi who's so detached from the traditional that his funeral prayer comes from The New Testamant. That's his, not the film's, goof. Perhaps the title draws more clearly on Jewish understanding. Lech lechah. God doesn't like leaving but He approves becoming. Here the healthy characters find ways to be always becoming something more. .",This Is Where I Leave You

I was most surprised by Tina Fey who was so great that I now struggle to disengage her performance from her real life.Now this film probably does tug at one too many heart strings and near the end it does get a bit ""Dawson's Creek"" but I didn't mind for a minute.This is not laugh-out-loud but is a great, simple story; heart warming, humorous and very enjoyable.",This Is Where I Leave You

50,Quietb-1,Seven days passes so quickly it seems like four.,7,25 September 2014,"The premise is dad dies and the family and add-ons must live together for the seven day mourning period. While the ""Big Chill"" did it better, there is still enough here to recommend. Jason Bateman leads an ensemble cast with good work from Tina Fey and Jane Fonda. Not much can be said for the other males in the cast . Rose Byrne plays ""Penny Moore"" and more of her would have improved the movie. It is hard to imagine she stayed in business as she is the only one ever on the ice at her rink.Given the circumstances for the get together there is a good blend of comedy mixed in with the family dynamics. Shawn Levy does a good job in getting the character out of the chairs. There are plenty of conversations even a few on the pitched roof.Don't look at Bateman's watch at the temple scene. And ignore the ""I've checked into the Marriott for three days."". But later Bateman knows Quinn is at the Renaissance.There are some surprises along the way, but you know what is going to happen when a guy walks into his bedroom in the afternoon with lit candles on a birthday cake.

51,bankofmarquis,Dysfunctional Family that you should spend some time with,8,23 November 2014,"Sometimes I walk into a movie not really knowing what I'm getting myself into and am pleasantly surprised by the tone, theme and substance of the film. I find the film resonates within me and have to give it some thought before I can write a review.Such was the case with THIS IS WHERE I LEAVE YOU.I knew it was a movie about a dysfunctional family that gathers at the time of the death of the patriarch. I knew it starred Jason Bateman, Tina Fey and Jane Fonda. I knew it was a ""dramedy"".But what I didn't know is that it is a strongly acted look into a family just trying to find their way in the world.I was impressed. I really enjoyed this movie.Why? Let's start with the performances. Jason Bateman continues to grow as an actor as the center of this movie. His character, Judd Altman is reeling from discovering that his wife is having an affair with his boss. So he is newly split up and jobless and now has to deal with this family.As played by Cory Stall, Adam Driver, Tina Fey and Jane Fonda, this family is certainly a piece of work. All of these actors deliver really fine performances and you can see that there is a history with and between each of them that is just waiting to pop out.The supporting actors are just as strong - Timothy Oliphant, Rose Byrne, Dax Shepard, Debra Monk and the always fantastic Connie Britton - all shine as others in this family's lives.But it wasn't just the acting. I was impressed with the tone and direction from Shawn Levy. I had hopes that the actors could overcome the direction of the guy behind NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM and THE INTERNSHIP, but found Levy showed a deft hand and kept things moving at a nice, fun (but not too frenetic) clip.I am surprised at how much I liked this movie, and how much (a day later) it is staying with me. It's not for everyone - and you'll have to be in the mood for it. But if you are, you will be rewarded.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",This Is Where I Leave You

53,Likes_Ninjas90,"What's on display here simply isn't up to par, even by low standards of Hollywood",3,22 October 2014,"After a death in the family, a privileged white individual returns to their childhood home. As old wounds resurface and secrets are revealed, he or she learns about family values and the catharsis they reach helps resolve the issues in their own adult family life. Many films in the last few years from Garden State, Death at a Funeral, August: Osage County to the recently released The Judge, have used a variation of this increasingly derivative premise. The frequency of the outline amplifies the repetitive thematic goals in Hollywood, like restoring the family in crisis. But none of the films mentioned stooped to the painfully unfunny levels of This is Where I Leave You, an overproduced comedy from director Shawn Levy, which wastes the glossy cast on being gleefully juvenile while simultaneously sulking about how unhappy life can be. Sitting through the film becomes more agonising than the on screen drama because of an identity crisis, where no one knows what type of film this wants to be. Jason Bateman plays Judd Altman, a radio announcer who finds his wife is in bed with his co-host Wade (Dax Shepard). Simultaneously, Judd learns about the death of his father. He returns to his family home where his mother Hillary (Jane Fonda) declares he, his sister Wendy (Tina Fey) and brothers Phillip and Paul (Adam Driver and Corey Stoll) are going to practice Shiva together. In the Jewish faith, Shiva is a one week period of mourning in a single house. Phillip is the boofhead of the family, who arrives at the funeral in a sports car and has an older girlfriend who's a psychiatrist. Paul and his wife are trying to have a baby but failing and Wendy seems fairly unhappy with her partner. They have a young son currently being toilet trained, and Wendy is still upset over an accident that left her former partner (Timothy Olyphant) with a brain injury. Meanwhile, Judd is being courted by Penny, a woman from his high school years who is played by comedian Rose Byrne. This is Where I Leave You is written by Jonathan Tropper, who adapts his own 2009 novel of the same name. Aside from a television show, this is his first feature credit, a fatal decision compounded by making him an executive producer. With a cast this decorated, couldn't a more experienced screenwriter be employed? When there's little distance between an author and the film's script there is no one to blow the whistle on any missteps or poor choices. One such decision in Tropper's poor treatment is not building any grounds to make us care. From the outset the exposition is compromised of two major events, the affair and the father's death, which are carelessly piled on top of each other without establishing the context for Bateman's character. Judd has no personality, drifting through the film aimlessly to display this gallery of unfunny cartoon characters. The novel is said to be written in first person, allowing for Judd's interior thoughts to come to fruition, a quality totally absent here. The other characters lack subtly, with Tropper's writing style favouring broad shadings and caricatures. The narrative is boring, completely tensionless and leaves the performances of the actors uninspired. As the lead Jason Bateman is mostly flat, but at least strains desperately in the final scenes for some sincerity and to understand Judd's unhappiness. Like many modern comedies, the film is also congratulatory about recapturing what it means to be a lumpen youth again. Tropper has cited the scene where the brothers smoke pot together as a highlight of the feature, an endorsement which speak volumes about this film's ambitions. On top of the weight of clichés and overload of broad characters, the script's humour is puerile. Its crassness, where body parts and functions are both regularly commented upon, is consistently at odds with potentially moving and more serious moments. One running joke for example is the size of Jane Fonda's breasts. It's this idiocy which displaces the dramatic potency of the story. The efforts of Shawn Levy, who previously made Real Steel and Night at the Museum, are miniscule. He allows the tone to swirl uncontrollably and displays no stylistic or rhythmic imprint over this film, favouring bland point and shoot filmmaking and glacial pacing. Imagine what a gifted comedian like Tina Fey could have done with this script or even as the film's director. What's on display here simply isn't up to par, even by low standards of Hollywood.",This Is Where I Leave You

It's got a really talented and diverse cast but that doesn't change the fact that the movie itself is a little dull. There are certainly some good moments that keep you interested but overall I didn't love it.The movie was very real life, weird but nevertheless believable. Maybe that's why it bored me a little.

This normally can hurt a film really bad because it will make the presentation appear very sloppy, chaotic and, sometimes, unwatchable but I didn't have this problem with ""This Is Where I Leave You."" I acknowledge this shortcoming but the performances are so strong and the characters are so entertaining (and being played by great performers didn't hurt) that this didn't hut my overall entertainment.Would I have liked to see ""This Is Where I Leave You"" be a tad longer so that all this drama could blend better and each plot point giving the amount of time they need in the story?

56,bbickley13-921-58664,What a super touching story of an adult family,7,26 September 2014,"There was some good acting in this movie done by all involved. Jason Basemen's career making straight man was being challenged by Corey Stoll who plays one of his brothers in the movie. Tiny Fey, plays the only female Altman sibling, showing that she can be both funny and dramatic at the same time, Just like her fellow SNL alum, Kristen Wiig is doing in a similar film The Skeleton Twins. Rounding out the siblings is Adam Driver, who I known from the show Girls, which he's brilliant in. It was good seeing him do something outside of the show even though his part as the baby of the family is similar to his role on the sitcom. Last but definitely not least is the great Jane Fonda who, despite being in her seventies is being use as nothing more than eye candy as the hot MILF who attempts to keep the siblings together in the house for seven days, how cool is that?The chemistry between the actors was very good and really helped to give a truly believable family element to the movie.

LOLBateman is great in exactly this kinda role- one of the straight man set among a sea of insanity. He's just a great reactionary comedic actor, as well as does some of his best serio-dramatic work yet in this film.

58,ArchonCinemaReviews,"Tired and unremarkable narrative, but not a bad movie per se",5,8 December 2014,"This is Where I Leave You is the token comedy about the dysfunctional family brought together after unfortunate circumstances.The premise has been done to death, pun intended, but that does not stop writer Jonathan Tropper adapting his novel This is Where I Leave You for the silver screen thanks to Director Shawn Levy.Four siblings along with some significant others join together under one roof to sit shiva for the death of their father. While stuck together for seven days, secrets and dysfunctional tendencies are revealed.Everything about This is Where I Leave You is laughably cliché, whether that was intentional or not. The vain, overbearing and intrusive mother. The private son whose wife is cheating on him with his boss. The youngest brother who is infantile and immature. The eldest brother who bears the responsibility and family business on his shoulders with martyr-like strength despite no one asking him to do that. The at one time promiscuous sister who is now in a loveless marriage. All the while with the unfinished business and people they left behind at their hometown.Jason Bateman, Adam Driver and Corey Stoll are the three Altman brothers whose personalities are not a big step in comparison to previous roles portrayed. Tina Fey takes the largest leap by playing a busy-body scarily similar to her mother, to mixed effectiveness.This may all sound familiar what with Death at a Funeral and The Family Stone, and the similarities are glaring. Dysfunctional family comedies are practically a genre in its own, but the hope is that any additions will bring something new to the subcategory.This is Where I Leave You does not provide any novel angles and even utilizes tired twists to try to snag the viewer.

60,TheAll-SeeingI,Great Film; Inexplicably Under The Radar,9,24 April 2019,"In a day and age when the mere presence of a single great actor seems to trigger positive reviews from their sycophants, it's amazing that this star-studded cast hasn't elevated ""This Is Where I Leave You"" to critically bulletproof status.It's a bit inexplicable, as there's something for everyone beyond the generational casting feat itself. It's intelligently funny as hell. Every familial character has an individually compelling storyline that seamlessly weaves itself into the story of the collective family itself. And because of the diversity of character sketches, one would think the film would have an appeal that reached out to almost everyone within the American family demographic.Yet despite all that, the film got traction, but didn't get entrenched. What a shame, as it's Really Rather Wonderful. Will streaming allow ""This Is Where I Leave You"" to become a residual classic over time? It could happen.

61,dansview,Bateman Carries,7,23 October 2017,"Yes Jason Bateman plays the same kind of guy in most of his work, and it may even be close to his real personality. But either way, there is something likable about that guy. I don't if it's acting or what, but he's great. Without him, I would not have watched this.Regarding the Jewish aspect. They say up front that the mom is not Jewish (meaning I assume that she didn't even convert), and the dad is an atheist.So these people are secular, born to a non-Jewish woman, but with apparently some loose ""Reform"" Jewish identity. Let's not say that they are typical Jews. Even most of the actors were non-Jewish. Having said that, it presents a horrible family and makes them seem Jewish. So be prepared for that if it's bothersome.But there's more to that. Clearly these people are living Godless lives and never fully understand the relationship between that fact, and their disappointments. (That is probably true for the film makers, or people in Hollywood in general) Yet, I don't know if it was intentional or not, but the writer used the vehicle of religious ritual (sitting together for a week to mourn a loved one)as a means toward some spiritual or moral reckoning, and that seems to be a pro-religion statement.The Bateman character lacks ""alpha"" qualities. That's probably why his wife went with an alpha male, and why he never really lived his life to the fullest. They don't identify this by name, but it's really one of the core themes affecting millions of men around the globe. Beta males live in the shadow of alphas.The house and town looked lovely. Why does everyone talk about who ""got out?"" I guess elitist types view their hometowns as provincial and silly.Tina Fey was good. She was down-to-earth and didn't ham it up. Forget the device of having a kid sitting on a portable toilet. That's such a cheap way to get a laugh. Wouldn't the kid need toilet paper anyways? That whole story line cheapened the experience.I realize that we are living in a ""progressive"" age, but I don't know if audiences want to see same-sex kissing, etc. I guess it will become more and more accepted. If you want to imply that same sex people are together, you could just show them gazing into each other's eyes. I guess the whole movement is about making it identical to the straight life. So showing actual gay bed scenes will be next, if it's not already happening.With this many characters and only so much time, it's hard to establish back stories. I think they did a reasonably decent job of that. Also, as others have said, they walked that fine line between slapstick and drama well.",This Is Where I Leave You
62,shawneofthedead,"Tender, funny, sweet, silly and surprisingly wise.",8,22 September 2014,"Looking at the starry cast of This Is Where I Leave You, it's easy to get excited about the film. But that excitement might easily fade away when you realise that the director at the helm of this family dramedy is Shawn Levy, best-known for resolutely mediocre films like Night At The Museum and The Internship. Surprisingly, however, Levy has crafted something witty, wise and quite wonderful from Jonathan Tropper's screenplay (adapted from the latter's own best-selling novel). Its narrative might struggle a little at points, and some characters fail to really leap off the screen the way they're clearly meant to. But This Is Where I Leave You is without a doubt Levy's most engaging, full-bodied effort yet: a rich, bitter, quirky film about love and family that teeters along the thin, broken lines dividing life and death, and comedy and tragedy.Judd Altman (Bateman) is having the worst year of his life. He's just discovered that his wife Quinn (Spencer) is having an affair with his scumbag radio-host boss (Shepard). The last thing he can handle is the death of a family member. But home he must go in the wake of his father's demise. Once there, Judd and his siblings - driven Wendy (Fey), stern Paul (Stoll), and quirky Phillip (Driver) - must abide by their father's dying wishes, as relayed by their mom Hilary (Fonda): they are to sit shiva for seven days, a week in which secrets are revealed, tensions run high, and love sneaks through amidst all the lies and loss.It's a situation rich with potential, one that could easily have taken the path of high melodrama or descended into outright buffoonery. Levy and Tropper go for something in-between. And so, in a film in which Judd struggles desperately to mourn his father after the implosion of his marriage, the sexual escapades of Paul and his baby-hungry wife Annie (Hahn) are telecast to the entire house via a baby monitor. Wendy re-connects with Horry (Olyphant), the brain-damaged childhood sweetheart she left behind for a loveless marriage to Barry (Lazar). Her brothers sneak off and get high during a service at the synagogue. The final result is a tangle of black humour and bittersweet tragedy, woven into a tapestry of joy and misery that's remarkably close to life itself.What keeps the film's servings of tragedy and comedy from tipping into farce are its endearingly real characters. It's easy to see the wealth of love and resentment that binds the Altman family together. The siblings argue to the point of bloodshed over who will take over their dad's sporting goods shop, and they tease one another with the poker-sharp memories of years of enforced familiarity. But they also let their guards down around one another: Judd chats out his troubles with his sister Wendy, perched atop a roof; the siblings complain about the loss of privacy stemming from their mom's best-selling book about their childhoods, but still find themselves turning to her in moments of deepest grief. ""You're idiots,"" Wendy declares at one point to her brothers, ""But you're my idiots"" - a sentiment that most would agree applies particularly well to one's siblings.Even the supporting characters are mostly well-served by the script, whether it's widowed next-door neighbour Linda (Monk), mother of Horry and keeper of a secret that will shock the Altman children when it's revealed; or Phillip's new fiancée Tracy (Britton), a sexy, intelligent therapist who knows just what a big mistake she's made in falling for the Altman family screw-up. It's particularly intriguing that Quinn isn't written off simply as a degenerate whore, but someone whose mistakes - though inexcusable - are rooted in as much heartbreak and sadness as she's causing Judd with her infidelity.Unfortunately, not every character in This Is Where I Leave You rings quite so truly. While Judd freaks out about Quinn, especially when she flings a bombshell at him when she turns up at the Altman home, he also draws closer to Penny (Byrne) - the sweet, kooky girl who's held a torch for him since high school. In a film filled with so many quirky-but-realistic characters, each of whom could easily have taken the lead, Penny is an odd cardboard cutout of a dream girl. In effect, she bounces around and chirps supposedly insightful but painfully awkward things like, ""I've always seen you, Judd Altman"". Poor Byrne tries her best, and has a sweet chemistry with Bateman, but her character feels less like a genuine romantic option than the wishful thinking of a writer who's spent considerably more time fleshing out his other characters.In news surprising to no one, Levy's ensemble cast is an absolute joy to watch in action. Bateman anchors the entire film with one of his most sensitive performances yet, but everyone around him gets a chance to shine. Fey, better known as a comedian, mines Wendy's troubled relationship with Horry for genuine emotional trauma, while Stoll and Driver round out the Altman quartet with steady, appealing turns as the eldest and youngest brothers who just can't get along. Fonda is luminous, carrying off the comedy - and her prosthetic breasts - with remarkable grace, while creating a picture of a tough, sexually progressive woman with plenty of depth and love for her children.Like the fractured, dysfunctional family at its heart, This Is Where I Leave You isn't perfect. It can be insular at times, and its characters occasionally speak in perfectly tart soundbites that don't quite ring true. But Levy's film is also a tender, silly, deep, smart and ridiculous look at a family in mourning. It finds the hidden joys and awkward sadnesses in a group of people who sometimes love more than they like one another. And it serves as a potent reminder that life - happiness, tragedy, and everything in between - keeps happening, often when we least want it to.",This Is Where I Leave You
63,jawneyfloros,family,10,21 November 2018,Review: I love this movie because it examines the Jewish form of mourning i.e. sitting shiva. The direction and screenplay are both incredible. The casting and acting are incredible also. Jane Fonda steals the show as this very complex and complicated matriarch. The basis of this story is love conquers all and family is forever. The altman's are extremely complicated people thrown together in this very bleak and comical scenario for 7 days. Watching this period it is clear that they are dysfunctional but also relatable to others when someone dies and everyone has to get together. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.,This Is Where I Leave You
64,gavinp9,Solid family-based comedy/drama,7,2 January 2018,"'This Is Where I Leave You' is a good mix of funny moments and dramatic moments of reflection. It's basically the story of four siblings - Judd (Bateman), Wendy (Fey), Phillip (Driver) & Paul (Stoll) - and how they, along with their mum (Fonda), deal with their father's death. There's lots of squabbling and jibes, but also some nice scenes with some emotional depth.This film is slightly better than 'Date Night', Levy's similar film from a few years ago with Fey. It's not too long, is quite well paced and has a good soundtrack. My main gripe is that - since I can relate! - there wasn't a more fleshed-out character for Paul, the big brother. I think Phillip comes off being the most interesting, but it's enjoyable seeing how they all interact with each other & their sibling's partners. No real conclusion, but there is a few unnecessary spanners thrown in the works at the end.The best bits are when they all deal with the loss with some levity, especially aided by ""Boner"" the Rabbi (Schwartz), some of Fey's quips and the toilet-training kid.

The movie is out-of-touch siblings coming together for their deceased father's funeral and 'shiva', a week-long mourning.All the actors have done a commendable job, especially Adam Driver, who is really growing as a comedian.Some of the situations and jokes might seem clichéd, but overall, the film is delightful from beginning to end. Just ignore the bad reviews; it's a good comedy for adults (not an adult comedy). The interactions are quite honest, witty and intriguing. The film doesn't aim to be an all-out drama or a rib-tickling comedy; it reaches the proper balance and beautiful insight (not much, but enough) into the characters. Jonathan Tropper, who adapted his own novel, decided to leave the flashbacks out. Being the kind of movie it is, I think it was a good decision; they would have seemed out-of-place.The movie might be too kind to its characters, but you do end up caring for most of them.

But, it would have been much better had it tried to go somewhere with all this, apart from the silly cliche of ""don't play it safe, take a chance"" for our somewhat-main protagonist (played by Jason Bateman).As-is, it is a look of a particular family and how it deals with its first tragic event. Which is fine, but, there are many families and they deal with this stuff in many ways, we never quite find out what's so special about this one that we should care much.Even the extended cameo of Blah-Blah of HIMYM fame (Abigail Spencer) doesn't really work towards providing much point to all of this.All that being said, it's OK and worth a watch, it's just that it feels like it could have been much better.",This Is Where I Leave You

70,santiagocosme,I almost laughed.,3,14 December 2014,"A family spends a week together on the request of the mom after the father passes away. Once they get together, we see that all of them have sexual related issues/stories that need to get solved and they will do just that during this time off: The mom with 3d breasts who only talks about her late husband's big penis but turns out to be a lesbian, the son whose wife cannot get pregnant, the other son whose wife was having an affair with his boss and gets pregnant, the other daughter who has a crush for her ex neighbor, and the idiotic son who screws a loaded cougar but still has a fling with other girls. I have seen such clichés a hundred times. I was just hoping that they'd find a way to make them funnier for once. As for the rating, I didn't want to give it a 1, it would have been a little too harsh although not completely undeserved. So I figured a way to be fair. I gave the movie a point for each time I almost laughed. Point per laugh result: 3",This Is Where I Leave You
71,Bravesfan17,A Sweet Family Comedy-Drama,8,15 October 2014,"It seems that Shawn Levy is one of the most disliked directors out there. However, I find him to be very hard working and puts out fun and entertaining movies. His newest, This Is Where I Leave You, shows that Levy is getting a little more serious, while still being funny at the same time. Judd Altman (Jason Bateman) is a producer for radio personality Wade (Dax Shepard). One day, Judd comes home to find his wife Quinn (Abigail Spencer) having sex with Wade. Shortly after, we see Judd living in a small apartment ignoring Quinn's phone calls, but receives one from his sister Wendy (Tina Fey) informing him that their father has passed away. Their mother, Hillary (Jane Fonda) is holding it together. At the funeral, we meet two more brothers, Paul (Corey Stoll) and Philip (Adam Driver). At home, Hillary has ordered for her children to stay home as they go through Shiva, or an entire week of mourning, stating that it was in their father's will. Throughout the film, we see the Altman family spend time together, have some fun, and lash things out. Jason Bateman stands out as the lead in this ensemble. Here, Bateman shows us a guy who always played it safe and never took a chance. Bateman also shows that he can mix the comedy and drama in his character arc very well. In her second collaboration with director Shawn Levy, Tina Fey is funny and serious as the sister who keeps her brothers in line. Jane Fonda shows that she is still one of the best living actresses as the mother. Corey Stoll and Adam Driver are both good in their respective roles. Of the ladies in this film, my favorite was Rose Byrne as Penny Moore, a potential love interest for Judd. The standout in the supporting cast was Timothy Olyphant as Horry, the son of Hillary's neighbor Linda. Horry had also suffered a head injury and this character is completely different from Olyphant's Raylan from Justified. This Is Where I Leave You is Shawn Levy's best and most mature film to date. With this film, Levy shows his ability to do comedy and drama mixed together. The script by Jonathan Tropper, based on his own novel, does well with focusing on all of the Altmans. The only technical standout is the music by Michael Giacchino, which made me think of his score from The Family Stone.",This Is Where I Leave You

73,cnycitylady,'Leaves' You Wanting More,6,2 January 2015,"And not in the best way. 'This is Where I Leave You' follows the lives of an out of sync and wacky family as they attempt to be close and Jewish after their father's death. Jason Bateman's character was christened the main character or protagonist but his problems and story- line are quickly overshadowed by the supporting cast. Tina Fey all but steals the movie away from him as her character plays mother to her three brothers and as she deals with her own heartbreak that is more profound and tragic than any of the others combined. Her love for her childhood sweetheart smacks her full in the face when she returns home for the funeral and her guilt all but eats her up.Adam Driver plays the youngest and most carefree of the children. Life is all good all the time and in his own jerk off way he teaches his siblings that life is not something to sweat or mope about.The rest of the cast have their own things going on to make for an ensemble story, but while watching you can't help but pick a favorite and wish that the movie would only focus on them and wrap up their story.

74,Suradit,Arrested Development with less Slapstick,5,18 January 2015,"Great actors turning in excellent performances portraying self-indulgent, self-obsessed characters with measured humor and excessively-elevated drama.The concept of a dysfunctional family forced together and suddenly having to deal with their pasts, their connectedness or lack thereof and where they find themselves now, is hardly original. Woody Allen has managed similar situations far more convincingly and with less apparent effort. At least some of the characters have their ""twins"" in the Arrested Development family, although instead of being zany and laughable, they are pensive, drama-laden and only moderately laughable. And just as Arrested Development exaggerates it's characters & situations to unrealistic levels of inanity for humor, this film exaggerates the levels of unrealistic drama, both in terms of the individual characters and in the family aggregate, in an over-blown hope of finding some deep profound meaning.Like many of the characters, the film was a little too assured of its own significance and at times becomes an excessively sentimental attempt to be more than it really is. I did enjoy watching the movie, but mostly because of the actors, as opposed to the clichéd characters they played. It was little more than a moderately amusing & often pretentiously tedious soap opera.",This Is Where I Leave You
75,cattjones,Leave Now,2,20 September 2014,"This is where I leave you is one of those films that should have been left behind. The gist of the film is that the father of a family dies and the siblings have to participate in a sitting Shiva. I had no clue what a Shiva was. Apparently it is when family member sit around the house at a certain time every day and friends and family stop by to offer their condolences. First of all, the family is not Jewish; or at least not practicing Jews. Second of all, at the funeral the Rabbi reads a passage from the New Testament. I'm not even very religious and I knew that it was the wrong book. Hillary Altman (Jane Fonda) is the mother who does not mind sharing everything and apparently has no filter. Judd (Jason Bateman) is the middle brother whose wife, Quinn (Abigail Spencer) has been sleeping around. This is not news. It's in the trailer. Paul (Corey Stoll), the eldest of the bunch seems to have a stick up his butt and is just annoying. The youngest brother, Phillip (Adam Driver) is the black sheep of the family and seems to have a long history of getting into trouble. Then there is Wendy (Tina Fey) who is there just to keep everyone in line, I think. Anyway, every single person in this film has issues (and I mean everyone); even Wendy's little boy, Cole (Cade Lappin). The only person that I had a little bit of sympathy for was Horry Callen (Timothy Olyphant) who had been in a car accident and had some mental issues, but he was still endearing. It is evident in the film that the siblings have not been together for some time and this is their opportunity to re-connect or at least catch up with what is going on in their respective lives. You would think with a cast like this that the film would have been funnier than it was. I didn't laugh out loud once, although I did find myself saying ""wow"" a lot. I just found the film to be awkward and uncomfortable. You would think that with a veteran producer like Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum, Real Steel) that this film would have been better. It wasn't a total bomb, but it just didn't meet the expectations that I had.",This Is Where I Leave You

I expected that the writing would be good since there was such a good cast - or they would not have done the movie. The ploy to keep the family together for 7 days works and I think works well. The casting is well done - Jane Fonda as the matriarch is good - she is in charge and just gives the instructions for the time together, and then things fall into place. Jason Bateman is wonderful - trying to keep something from the family but of course siblings do not let things go unsaid. Finding the back stories of all the characters was done well - and there are many stories to tell. I was surprised that all the back stories were dealt with well and come to conclusions. Tina Fey - a great harried Mom with an asshole for a husband (the name he used for himself). Driver is in and out in the movie and has some great lines. The older brother feeling the weight of having to run the family business and trying to get his wife pregnant is funny and sad - but lightens up eventually. The comic relief of the show - the little boy with the potty chair - he can go anywhere and does. This is a movie that let the adults be adults - and show that parts of us do not grow up.",This Is Where I Leave You
80,MovieSonic,Lighter version of Oscar-bait films,7,18 December 2014,"It took me ages to watch this. Having seen 'August: Osage County' fairly recently, I can confirm that 'This is Where I Leave You' is what that one was trying to do.I would say that this was meant to be a serious drama that didn't take itself too seriously. In that respect, it's probably a good compromise for two people if one wants to watch an Oscar-bait type film and the other hates them with a passion. It's a drama that won't bore you to tears.Having said that, there are a lot of things wrong with it. For every funny joke, there are some fairly tame or childish ones. As others have pointed out, nothing really gets resolved. One storyline in particular (Tina Fey's) was an utter waste of time. I was expecting certain people to have an affair and certain people to split up and so on and yet nothing! Literally!I don't particularly like Rose Byrne especially since she seems to have succumbed to anorexia, but I imagine a lot of people would agree that there was zero chemistry between her and Jason Bateman. Not only that but her character had almost no back-story. There was no reason for her and Bateman's character to be attracted to each other and they spent almost no time together so the way things unfolded between them made no sense.Yet it was entertaining and funny enough for me to keep watching, not feel bored and generally be happy that I'd watched it.7/10",This Is Where I Leave You
81,john32935,Good comedy but could have been more,7,8 February 2015,"There is so much on-screen talent and good chemistry among them, it is a shame that this movie is not better than ""just OK.""Set in a small New York town after the death of the family patriarch, the mother insists that the family all stay together in the family house for the 7 days of shiva per Jewish custom. The movie then tells the tale of each of the mother and the siblings, each with his/her own secrets and flaws.But it seems as if the writer had a checklist of the dysfunctional family elements that should be crammed into the film and then went about doling them out amongst the numerous characters to be sure that all the bases were covered. Marital infidelity. Screw up younger brother. Unrequited love. Raunchy senior citizen. Infertile couple. Surprise pregnancy. May-December romance. Surprise gay relationship. And more. While each of these elements do provide ample opportunity for some funny scenes, it seems as if too much was being undertaken as many plot elements seem forced and included just to ensure each base was covered. Yet many of the jokes stand out as being true-to-life. With all that being said though, the pros in this movie (outstanding performances by Jane Fonda, Tina Fey and Jason Bateman) make this movie infinitely more watchable and humorous than some recent blockbuster comedies, such as ""Neighbors.""For my other movie reviews, please visit:https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com",This Is Where I Leave You

83,bodhi-13262,"Funny, Cute & (somewhat) Depressing.",5,28 March 2016,"'This Is Where I Leave You' is the story of four siblings (and their respective spouses and partners) and their mother, who come together for one week after the death of their father.1. To start, the movie is overly crowded with subplots; some fit in well while others are simply unnecessary. The main story and character that we follow is Jason Bateman (Judd), who's wife cheats on him with his boss and the way he comes to terms and deals with the fact that she pops up pregnant halfway through the film even after divorce papers have been filed.Bateman has a certain charm that you can't resist and there's no doubt why the audience would gravitate toward him. He also has the more emotional connection in regards to the mourning of his father.2. Corey Stoll, Tina Fey & Adam Driver complete the rest of the sibling cast with the latter being the next interesting (yet quirky) character apart from Bateman. Adam Driver (Phillip) plays the youngest sibling and screw-up of the family dating an older woman. As cliché as it sounds, there is still an entertaining and funny vibe just waiting to see how this inevitable ticking time-bomb will explode.3. The other characters are basically expendable since the plot- lines could intertwine and no one would care. Tina Fey (Wendy) is interesting at first with her funny nagging, but the movie ultimately falls apart in the third act. At the point your mom (Jane Fonda) comes out as being a closeted lesbian by making out with the old lady neighbor, that's where you turn off the TV or walk out of the theater. This film serves better as a one-time-watch and that's it. There's nothing memorable or that emotionally gripping nor funny to purchase on DVD or Blu-Ray. Rent it!

Never, NOT ONCE, did she hold him, talk about him or give any indication she was his mother!!! That was something that was never filmed or left on that cutting room floor. Also, at the end when she's leaving someone says something about is she going to be alright traveling with her two kids...TWO? Where in the hell was the other one during the entire running time??? Very strange. Also, when Judd and Penny are at the ice skating rink in two scenes...NO ONE IS THERE BUT THEM? Another strange happening which makes the film very unrealistic. The twist at the end with the Jane Fonda mother character was a real shocker!!!! Who knew????? Film reminded me a bit like AUGUST; OSAGE COUNTY but without the great acting.

I was terrified that it was going to be the Tina show, placing her as quirky central whirligig, sucking the life out of scenes with malice a forethought. Mercifully, this was not the case, Tina fit quite well into the Jason Bateman driven ensemble.The honor of scene sucking goes to Adam Driver. Obnoxiously barging into scenes like an unwelcome house guest, driver was nevertheless functional as the family black sheep, delivering some of them more comical moments.Jason Bateman put a new spin on his ceremonial straight man in distress, surrounded by morons, and it worked in spades. Jason is in the middle of giving a career performance and then along comes Timothy Olyphant as a kind soul, with a brain injury. This film proves that Timothy has as much range as anyone in the business as you can see his potential as an Oscar nominee finally rearing its head.This movie is a go on all cylinders.

92,daveygandthekeyboard,"Enjoyable, though exposing the difficulty of adaptation",7,21 September 2014,"From the novel by Jonathan Tropper, This is Where I leave You is the story of how a dysfunctional family gets together for a week to conduct the Jewish ritual of sitting Shiva for seven days after the passing of their father, for whom this was his dying wish. Judd, played by Jason Bateman, is fresh off the shocking revelation that his wife has been cheating on him with his boss, while his 3 siblings are wonderful mess of their own problems. The mother, played by Jane Fonda, is an over sharing woman who published a book over 25 years earlier about their childhoods and their family secrets. For her, nothing is secret but for the adult children, the book stands as an obvious lasting scar. After having read all of Jonathan Tropper's novels, it is hard to avoid the thought that they seem to have been written for the screen. His dialog, his wisdom, his humor and outrageous situations have always seemed destined to be made into films. When I saw that This is Where I Leave You was to become a film, I knew that if nothing else, it would reflect many of the same elements that make his fiction so much fun.What I guess I didn't count on was the fact that while this is a very solid movie, it still exposes the difficulty of adaptation. Much of the wisdom and humor of the book must be conveyed in a series of one on one conversations between characters, which, after a while start to feel a little exhausting. Tropper, who did the screenplay himself, chose to stay away from doing flashbacks to convey back story, hoping to work the relevant information into the plot. It is not a bad choice, but it does deprive the audience of some of the information that we would like to know: like what exactly happened to neighbor/semi-adopted child Horry that caused him to be brain damaged? It is referenced but never fully explained, which would seem important because of the apparent role the Tina Fey character had in it. I can only think that maybe some bit of dialog somewhere was cut out of the final edit. The bit at the beginning with the birthday cake was underplayed in comparison to what happened in the book—probably not a terrible choice, though I might have enjoyed seeing the whole sequence end with something more explosive. Still, This Is Where I Leave You had some great moments and the story and performances carried the day. Jason Bateman as Judd is a great everyman; Adam Driver wins an MVP for his role as the goof-up brother, Phillip; Corey Stoll as Paul, the brother who holds down the fort for the others yet has his manhood challenged at every turn; Kathryn Hahn as Judd's Ex and Paul's Current (awkward!) ; Jane Fonda is convincing as the overbearing mother; Tina Fey as the alcoholic sister; Rose Byrne as Judd's hometown love interest, Penny Moore and Connie Britton as the goof-up brother's older woman--all perform the admirable job of making this rather dark comedy enjoyable.",This Is Where I Leave You

A toddler pooping in his potty anywhere in the house is supposed to be cute. I don't think so. All I remember of this film is talk about boobs,penis',the F word,etc. Couldn't Jane Fonda and Jason Bateman get a better movie to appear in. I kept looking at the time and couldn't wait for it to be over. The scenes were so immature and dumb slapstick. There were no witticisms or clever scenes and dialogue. The siblings smoking pot in the synagogue was ridiculous.The young rabbi looked as though he was in junior high.Even though I'm a secular Jew,still,I found that certain traditional scenes like the funeral,synagogue scene, etc.were very embarrassing and even insulting. Sitting shiva after a death is to be taken serious,not the way it was portrayed in this silly film.

His dying wish is for the family to sit Shiva, a Jewish tradition where the family sits for a week under the same roof and mourns the loss of the departed. Judd Altman played by Jason Bateman has just found out that his boss a shock Jock Radio Personality (Dax Sheppard) has been sleeping with his wife (Abigale Spencer) by walking in on them mid coitus. Soon after he gets a call from his sister Wendy (Tina Fey) about his father's demise. His mother, Hillary (Jane Fonda) is a best-selling author who used too much of the family's inner turmoil as literary inspiration. So along with brothers Paul (Corey Stoll) and Phillip (Adam Driver) and their significant others the family settles in to sit Shiva in their fathers dying wish as they hash out their own personal and family turmoil. This film is directed by Shawn Levy, the creator of the beloved Night at the Museum franchise. I cannot express enough my deep dislike of this movie. A phenomenal cast but all playing weak characters with a story that goes nowhere. I would honestly rather sit Shiva for a person I didn't know, and this movie feels almost as long. Each actor in this film are better with other supporting characters, now that I think about it. Tina Fey needs Tracy Morgan and Alec Baldwin in 30 Rock to work her comedy, or even just Amy Poehler in Baby Momma (2007). Adam Driver needs Lena Dunham for his comic charm to work in HBO's Girls. Jason Bateman is better as the Moe to a stooge like comedy ensemble in the Horrible Bosses franchise. These are all great components that just do not fit together in this movie. The director constantly cues up this soft piano background music for these tearful interludes between characters having these life reflecting moments. Only problem, you need to care about the people involved for it to work. Zero time is taken for character development. It's all just Splenda, Saccharine, sweet and low; artificial sweetener crap. Women should be the most offended by this movie as I assume this is geared toward the 22-60 female. This is a chick flick of the utmost intelligence insulting variety, pandering to what they think will get laughter and tears. There is an ongoing gag in this film where Wendy's (Tina Fey) youngest boy is potty training. The kid keeps trucking around his portable training potty, dropping trow and taking dumps. I feel this is a perfect metaphor for this entire movie. CRAP.If you enjoyed this movie please check out my blog at yourturntopick.com",This Is Where I Leave You

98,kvatter,Not based in reality,5,13 May 2015,"This feature has the feel of one of those quirky indie films but with is done using big name actors. The highly improbable situations and the contrived dialogue are to be found only in the movie universe. It centers around a family who has gathered together to mourn the death of their father at the behest of their mother, Fonda. Each family member is dealing with their own personal dilemma that gets a public airing during the gathering. The most interesting of the situations is the budding romance between Bateman and Byrne. Probably most of the other stories could have been excised in favor of developing this one more. Situations like the brothers meeting in a class room at the synagogue during the funeral service to smoke pot are the kind that are pure movie-land and not based in what is most people's reality. They set off the sprinkler system and probably create thousands of dollars in damages while they chuckle about it all and humiliate the rabbi after that as a cherry on top. There is a scene at the end where Fonda defuses a fight by revealing something that makes absolutely ZERO sense and seems to be thrown in by the writer because he wanted to see just how far from reality he could stray without an objection by the producers. Silly plot lines like what is found here are what I guess people think is ""edgy"" and ""bold"".

99,Callum_Hofler,A Disappointingly Unfocused Romantic Comedy,4,8 December 2014,"""So this is where you say ""I told you so""""Above is not only a quote from this film; one which I was greatly anticipating but highly let down by, but is also my initial reaction after viewing it in its entirety. The reviews and ratings from critics and audience members alike informed me that Shawn Levy's first R-rated directorial outing would be a disaster, or at least not nearly as funny or satisfying as what the initial trailers had promised. But alas, I still went into This Is Where I Leave You with relatively high hopes, wanting this film to reinstate my love for the romantic comedy genre, which has as of recently become diminished. Unfortunately, This Is Where I Leave You proved to me yet again that my faith in romantic comedies is unfounded most of the time, and only seeks to enrage and sadden me.The film centres around the character of Judd Altman (Jason Bateman), who is called back to his childhood home after the death of his father, all whilst his job and marriage simultaneously break down. His mother, Hilary Altman (Jane Fonda), manages to convince Judd and the rest of his siblings, all of whom are currently experiencing employment and relationship issues, to stay at home and embrace each others company; to reminisce about their late father, and to engage in supposedly 'funny' ordeals alongside each other.The summary above seems greatly encouraging; it seems funny and entertaining, and a good funeral comedy is always appreciated. Unfortunately, this comedy is most certainly not on the same level as something like Death at a Funeral, due to its often punishing forced sentimentality. The author of which this movie is based upon, Jonathon Tropper, was also the man to write the screenplay, and unlike recent author-turned-screenwriter Gillian Flynn's successful endeavour into the cinematic realm with Gone Girl, Tropper fails at providing a successful or entertaining film. Whilst the opening 20 minutes provide strong introductions for each of the individual characters, as well as some genuinely hilarious moments, the film tries to veer too close to emotional resonance for what it's worth, and falls flat on its face. Often scenes where a supposedly heartwarming event is occurring seems forced, artificial or partially, dare I say it, corny, reducing the viewer to cringing the vast majority of the time. It's not fun, nor entertaining, nor at all engaging.The film also struggles at balancing its direction, as it throws itself all over the place, attempting to cover as many stories as possible. The amount of subplots that Tropper and Levy try to tackle not only convolutes the story and characters exponentially, but prevents us from becoming attached to them; the story is zipping around to so many people at any given time that it's inevitably confusing and unenthralling. The fantastic actors and actresses on offer are relegated to smaller screen times than what many of them could've had if the film hadn't have been so insistent on exploring so many different characters, themes and avenues of interest. The funny thing is that many of these avenues are rendered entirely uninteresting due to the lack of focus. With the film trying to do so much at once, many of the characters become one- dimensional pieces in a huge puzzle; they have a singular role, whether it is to be the 'bad husband', the 'desperate wife that wants a baby', or the 'crazy chick', and they often are unable to transcend these generic and boring character traits to become anything more.That said, the performances from all involved are generally good. Jason Bateman, for the majority of the time, is a constantly comforting presence on screen, and despite his strange lack of emotion throughout a good portion of the running time, provides a solid performance. Tina Fey is absolutely exquisite in her role, however bad that role may be, providing some fantastic quips along the way. Adam Driver, Rose Byrne and Jane Fonda though are the main attractions, delivering exuberant and lively performances that manage to make much of the material they've been gifted sound relatively realistic and/or funny; Driver in particular is currently on a role, participating in What If and now this, both of them films which he has managed to somewhat elevate thanks to his charisma and screen prowess. The rest of the ensemble is quite impressive, some more so than others, with few actively disappointing in their roles.The technical components of the film are all either passable to plain atrocious; Michael Giacchino's score fitting that latter suggestion with flying colours. His basic piano thematic material, repeating constantly throughout, is absolutely infuriating and just sits in the background, doing nothing to advance the emotional or comedic chops of this film. But again, it comes back to the unrefined focus of this picture, this being the primary issue, and that leads me to the question; what exactly does This Is Where I Leave You want to be? As a romantic comedy it fails, as the characters or romances are neither engaging nor amusing enough to warrant approval. A straight-up comedy is off the cards, as the film attempts to provoke too many emotional fronts to be considered such. That, and the comedy in the film doesn't always hit where it's meant to. A family drama? That is the closest I can get to describing this odd mess of a film. So whilst there is perhaps 30 minutes of strong and entertaining material on offer within, the rest of the running time, that being a little over an hour, is a pain to sit through. It rushes around, looking for ways to make up a full length motion picture, and despite reaching the expected running time, fails to feel wholesome nor complete. 4.0You can find more reviews at www.entjunkie.blogspot.com",This Is Where I Leave You
100,nikicianciola-702-657633,Had Potential,6,6 October 2014,"This movie had a decent cast and a lot of potential that it was never quite able to materialize. It ebbed and flowed with a good combination of drama and comedy, but ultimately it was the crude jokes and scenes that were completely unnecessary that sunk this movie. Jason Bateman was the most redeeming thing/character in this movie, and Tina Fey did a pretty good job too. Other than that, it was lacking in substance and was rather disappointing overall.I won't include a spoiler, but one of the last scenes (with Jane Fonda) was just plain stupid and completely irrelevant to the film. It was over the top as the writers could have come up with a much better ending to an already mediocre movie.",This Is Where I Leave You
101,bloodclay,"Rough Around the Edges, But That's Why It Succeeds",8,7 December 2014,"""This is Where I Leave You"" is not perfect, much like its characters. Its got moments that simply don't work, isn't without conventional things that we've all seen before, and it certainly isn't anything remarkable. However, that may be the reason why I enjoyed it so much. It's a story about and for regular people, and features characters that everyone can identity with. These are people that we've seen in our own families, with problems similar to the ones these characters are facing, and that's the beauty of this movie. Because of that alone, it reaches a level of charm that most big budget films can never touch. And despite its flaws, it surprised me.It has a plot that's pretty self-explanatory: four siblings are forced to return to their childhood home after the death of their father and they attempt to work out their past and reconnect. Everybody is dealing with their own issues as well, some of them with marital problems and others with trying to grow up, and each finds comfort in each other. Some of my favorite scenes in the film consisted of the dynamic between Jason Bateman and Tina Fey, who discuss their worries on the roof until late at night.Sincere moments like those seem to outweigh the more goofy, but be ready for a flawed film. It's rough around the edges, I want to stress that, but that's why it succeeds. By the end, it feels as if you've lived with these characters for years and you appreciate where they all end up going more than you may expect. Bateman manages to carry the film and deliver his best performance to date, proving he can play the everyman with a bit more finesse. And overall, it's something you'll appreciate because of its truth.",This Is Where I Leave You
102,xylophone59,Gross dross and gratuitously scatological.,1,8 November 2014,"One thing about movies; if it starts badly it can only get worse. It will not improve. If I had to use one word to characterize it the word would be ""dross"". It was the opposite of inspiring. I wanted to get out but my wife made me hang in until the bitter and banal end. It was unconvincing. The script was utterly witless. Some in the audience were smirking and giggling; so all I could think was "" some people are easily entertained"". The lines were largely scatological. Excreta seemed to be a recurring theme. The ""romance"" scenes were more like bodily functions. The kid on the potty was also a recurring and unwanted theme- kind of disgusting. Is that meant to be funny? No it was just gross; just like seeing the guy performing his bodily function on somebody's wife. I wish he had kept the commandment about not committing adultery. The apposed twists were contrived but simultaneously seemed like afterthoughts. It was Americana at its worst. This trash started poorly but managed to get inexorably worse. With 5 minutes to go I said to my wife there is still time for it to get even worse; you guessed it. It did get worse and worse until I finally managed to escape. The only escapism involved was escaping from the Adelaide cinema. This movie made me proud to be Australian. I said to my wife ""I am so glad I am not American"". This shambles was a comprehensive embarrassment. Don't waste your precious time.",This Is Where I Leave You
103,cuthbertjoel,Just as expected,7,16 February 2015,"I think this is an enjoyable movie as long as you know what you're getting into. The main actors of Jason Bateman and Tina Fey should tip you off that this won't be troubling the scorecards at the Oscars. Jason Bateman is an enjoyable actor to watch. I concede, he plays the same sort of character each time but he brings a laugh and a smile to my face. The plot line is admittedly fairly paper thin to get all of these characters together, but there's enough laughs and contrived family moments to be a fairly decent bit of nonsense to watch. A couple of good exchanges revolving around Bateman/Fey/Fonda were very funny. All in all, just a fairly decent comedy that I enjoyed for what it was but it won't be sticking with me for years to come.",This Is Where I Leave You

The kind of movie where a grandma (Jane Fonda) keeps describing her dead husband's sexual proclivities, people ""do it"" with a baby monitor on nearby, and a variety of people call out streams of embarrassing/incriminating dialogue to their partners during sex.

108,ruimsl,Great family comedy,8,11 January 2016,"I didn't know about this movie until a few days ago when I saw a trailer of it on TV, and it caught my attention.The actors were fairly good at start, but what really caught my eye was the story. I especially like comedy/drama about family inter- relations.So I decide to give it a chance, and I didn't regret it.This is a very well-constructed and modern comedy about a dysfunctional family that grew apart and despite that, they all love each other very much (in their particular way).The script is good. A death in the family brings about the opportunity to reconnect the family, to chase away old ghosts, in a ""forced"" tell all exercise, all wrapped in by the mourning ceremony of Shiva.The performances are very good, and I especially liked Jane Fonda (she rules completely), Tina Fey and Jason Bateman. They all are no strangers to this kind of movie and we can see why.The director already has some comedies under his belt (Night at the Museum 1 and 2 as well as the reboot of the Pink Panther) making this a very efficient exercise of movie watching.Summing it up I enjoyed this movie very much.

Some of the moments are somewhat exaggerated but the underlying melodrama is bittersweet and reflects each character's unique personality.Love permeates throughout the movie as each person strives to achieve happiness in a different way.

114,randbish,Belly Laughs and Life Lessons,8,25 September 2014,"Ensemble comedies are intrinsically challenging. Ultimately, this kind of film needs to make the audience care about the whole gang. Every role must have his or her own story and character arc. So, structuring all of this into a tidy 90-120 minute feature requires surgical skills.While some of my favorite dysfunctional family ensemble pieces — including THE FAMILY STONE, HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS, and PIECES OF APRIL — may have more inventive plot points and quirkier characters, THIS IS WHERE I LEAVE YOU succeeds as excellent entertainment that is firmly founded on truth. The characters are real. These sorts of situations do happen. In fact, some of what's happening here in the Altman household is probably happening on my block as I type.In this story, no one is actually totally satisfied with the way things are. So, they either take risks to experience something else, or fool themselves into believing with all their might in some fabrication of reality. Everyone is disillusioned by their partners, their siblings, their parents, by cruel turns of fate, or by their own penchant for self-destruction.As always, Jason Bateman and Tina Fey are splendid, spot-on, complex, sympathetic, and understated. And, as always, they deliver their punch lines with maximum impact. It's wonderful to see Jane Fonda back in top comic form — especially after her disastrous return in PEACE, LOVE AND MISUNDERSTANDING. Rose Byrne finds another level of quirk in Penny. Her range seems limitless, and we're rooting for her from the moment she blathers her excuse for missing the funeral. Timothy Olyphant is an unlikely, but clever, choice for sweet, brain-damaged Horry — ironically, the one and only character who seems content with his lot in life. And Kathryn Hahn is surprisingly sexy in her desperation to get herself knocked up.The most noticeable performance, however, is turned in by Adam Driver, who not only holds his own with the A Team — he steals the show. Look out for this young actor. I can't wait to see what he does next.THIS IS WHERE I LEAVE YOU is riddled with plot and character clichés. Fortunately, Shawn Levy's grounded direction and his supergroup of thespians pull it off. In the end, we've had some big belly laughs and learned something about ourselves and our relationships with our families, partners, and lovers.What more can we ask?

119,slothhead54,The laughs in this dysfunctional family comedy feels incredibly familiar,5,17 September 2014,"I should preface my comments by saying that the audience that I attended the screening with laughed way, way more than I did. I've also already read four film critic reviews that liked this film much more than I did so maybe I'm a killjoy, but I see so many films and this film really felt like recycled cookie dough to me. Most of the story lines and so many of the jokes are recycled from other family comedies that I've already seen before. The central premise of the film is about the Altmann family. The patriarchal figure of the family has passed away and the four Altmann children are summoned back to their small childhood town to attend their father's funeral. Subsequently, their mother, played by Jane Fonda, tells her four children that their father's dying wish was to practice Shiva, a 7 day mourning period recognized in Judaism. The film then unfolds in a 7 day timeline, which seems a lot longer based on the amount of dramatic points that occur within a 1hr45 minute film. The funeral scene, which happens towards the beginning of the film is the first time all of the Altmann family members appear on screen. The sentiment of this funeral is way more comedic than sentimental that it was hard for me to believe all of these characters just lost a father. It was clear from this scene going forward that the film was aiming for laughs not heart. In my humble opinion you can have laughs in a film when there is heart. When I think of great family dysfunctional comedies I will think of 'Home for the Holidays' 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding,' 'Meet the Parents' and 'National Lampoon's Vacation'. In all of those films the family dynamic is very convincing that as an audience viewer you really lend yourself to experience their joys and their sorrows, which is why the laughs are more enjoyable and amplified. In the case of this film, the family dynamic is totally missing. You really never believe for a second that Tina Fey, Jason Bateman, Adam Driver, Cory Stoll and Jane Fonda belong to the same family nucleus. All of the characters have this natural retraction from their family members, but honestly it's hard to understand why. The Altmann's have it pretty good. Each character's own personal drama seem to be more important than anything their siblings or their mother could possibly be dealing with and to show that they basically talk over one another in a giant, theatrical fashion. The biggest laughs in the audience came from a child trying to self potty train, the three Altmann brothers getting high in temple and singing (which was a steal in my opinion from Holly Hunter in 'Home for the Holidays) and Jane Fonda's largely augmented breasts and all the jokes that come with them. I'm fairly certain a couple months from now I won't even remember seeing this film, it's just that forgettable.",This Is Where I Leave You

The family members: mother, three brothers and a sister and their spouses who have to spend seven days under one roof for fulfilling the dying wish of their father. The grown-up siblings have little chemistry among them and have to live with all issues of their lives: cheating spouse, job issues, lost love, childless marriage and many others that you will get to know when you watch this movie.I recommend it for mature audience as there is nothing special for spice-loving audience here.

His father dies and he goes and stays at his parents house with his three other siblings that he hasn't seen in a long time.The premise is great. I love movies that revolve around family, especially moderatly sized family get to experience some form of tradition that they have lost. Here you have three brothers and a sister stay together for a week as part of a jewish custom. This family is out of touch with each other and the traditions but learn to be a better family.All the actors put on a great performance. I love any Jason Bateman or Adam Driver movie. Each character gets enough development and are distinguishable and likeable.The downside that isn't prevelant enough where it is the a plot but this b plot for every character who are mourning their father is their romantic life. Each of them have a complicated relationship with the opposite sex and even the mother turns out to already be in a relationship before her husband dies. I can't recommend a film that gets distracted every 15 minutes. I really see a great movie in here and probably with a little editing this movie can stand out based on the characters and the relationship they have with each other.TLDR: Every character is chasing tail even though their father just died.

A brother who's' wife is Judd's ex- girlfriend, and another brother who is the hopeless one of the family.

128,goodone49,a good and meaningful comedy for grown ups,8,27 December 2014,"This film was actually funny, but not in a slap-sticky juvenile way. It was a comedy for grown ups in that it dealt with themes that are applicable to 30 and 40-somethings, such as death of a parent, fertility, running a business, divorce, etc., but it was not a heavy film in that it was not a dark comedy. The father who died as the premise for it was never presented to the audience, which keeps his passing from being a sad event and allows for the levity at his funeral to be appreciated. The film generally seems to focus the most of Bateman's character and his relationships with others, but he carries that role well. In fact, I thought this performance was one of his finest in quite some time. Tina Fey was great in it too. I thought she was just a comedian, but she can act too! (Is there noting she can't do?) Overall, this film is worth seeing and is a powerful yet lighthearted journey in the interplay between siblings and the event that all 30 & 40 somethings will face at some point: the loss of a parent. If this film doesn't get you thinking about your relationship with your family members, then nothing will.

This is definitely the type of movie to watch if you're looking to chuckle and feel good; however, there are some points that may pull on your heartstrings. Too, there are a few slow points, but not so much that you lose interest. Lastly, I think most men would deem this movie a chick- flick; but, I think its still funny and amusing enough that a guy wouldn't feel to bored with it.",This Is Where I Leave You

I went and saw this in the theater every night for 30 days. I felt it spoke to me. Living in Florida but being from Maine so the drive at the end meant something to me. It's a great gem of a movie. The acting is superb and I felt like they were all actual family and real friends. Definitely one to watch. I hope this helped you as much as it helped me. I also hope you will find this movie as entertaining and heartwarming and heartbreaking as I did.,This Is Where I Leave You
133,macspear24,Totally Unbelievable,3,10 October 2014,"Nothing rings true with this film. Not the characters. Not the dialogue. And certainly not he situations or the characters reactions to the situations. For this sort of absurdity I would expect to be watching Will Ferrell.There was one scene of emotional trueness between Jane Fonda consoling Jason Bateman. I would have like to have more of this, since the basic premise of the story is a family reuniting after their father's death.I might have chuckled once, I know for sure I didn't laugh. More likely my response was to say to myself, ""That's stupid."" I love family set pieces and thought the cast could deliver, but as they say, 'If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage.' For me, it certainly wasn't on the stage/screen.",This Is Where I Leave You

Not because it was about a family going through grief but because I was watching everything I could with Adam Driver in. What it gave me was unexpected. Yes I got Adam, and I enjoyed that element but it gave me far more. I found it funny, I found moments sad and poignant but ultimately it spoke to me. The way I felt about death, immediately after was reflected in so many moments. It made me feel better and it still does every time I feel a little low about life it makes me feel better. There is so much to take away from it and for all it's faults I take that from it.

135,sanda_mo-1,"Great cast, decent movie",7,23 October 2014,"This is not a typical Hollywood comedy (not that that is any guarantee of quality comedy these days though). It is offbeat and weird and uncomfortable...and if the book is anything to go by, it is supposed to be. Which is not necessarily a bad thing, just something many people did not expect it seems.The Altmans are your run of the mill, dysfunctionally functional family. The four Altman siblings (and their mom) are forced to spend a week together (something they're all ""thrilled"" by) sitting Shiva for their recently deceased father. Being together under one roof again they are forced to face not only their grief about the loss of their dad but also to come to terms with the problems and issues of both their past and present.It is a decent dramatic comedy about families, love and life, with a fantastic cast and fair amount of funny moments, yet it does fall short of the depth the book is able to reach in terms of character development. Adam Driver is a star on the rise, definitely an actor that keeps impressing with his acting talent in each role he takes on. Jane Fonda shines in the role of an uncomfortably progressive psychotherapist mom. The film is worth seeing for the ensemble cast alone. I feel it tried to be too many things at once and in trying to divide the screen time between the actors, it ended up falling short of the greatness it could've achieved.",This Is Where I Leave You
136,GandLNY,Well worth the time,8,17 August 2015,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It had an excellent mix of serious story lines, funny one liners and a few surprises. Yes you can argue that some of the story was convoluted, but that's the nature of wide audience fiction. Many wonderful actors sharing a movie so they each had less screen time than you might want, but that's a small fault. Have to really enjoy Jason Bateman and his droll frustration with life. Through in Fey, Fonda, Driver and you have a wonderful cast. Then add great supporting characters like Connie Britton and Kathryn Hahn, Stoll and Byrne and we end up with an enjoyable 90 minutes.",This Is Where I Leave You

139,gmclean-24636,A hysterical family drama.,8,24 February 2016,"In the movie ""This is Where I Leave You"" the Altman children (Jason Bateman, Tina Fey, Corey Stoll, and Adam Driver) gather in their childhood home to see out their father's final wishes following his passing. They are forced to live under one roof again with their mother (Jane Fonda). In their small hometown the children run into people of their past that they have grown apart from. Each member of the Altman family grieves in their own way and they come to important realizations along the way.Throughout the film the audience laughs and cries with the Altmans as they try and find their way after devastating news. This film incorporates well-know family drama, characters, and relationships that the viewers can relate to. Many viewers have experienced the death of a loved one and are able to find many similarities between the Altmans and their own families. I really enjoyed this film because I felt that it represented family dynamics in a small town perfectly. Also the actors make the audience feel apart of the family so much that the viewer thinks that they are going through the characters' journey with them. I would definitely recommend this movie for anyone that is looking for a funny film filled with loads of family drama.",This Is Where I Leave You

All humor attempts failed completely and it was a real sacrifice to watch the movie until the end. The serious scenes were a little better than the 'funny' ones, but that wasn't enough. Poor dialogues, poor acting, a waste of time.I trusted the positive reviews and now I am regretting having watched such a bad movie.

144,timothy-parr24,A pleasantly surprisingly good film,8,2 February 2015,It's surprising to see the low scores this film has received when looking over this website and others. For me this is a film made for those who are a little lost. A perhaps overly optimistic view of a large and complex family. Yet the film seemed to me to capture a sweet spot in my movie going heart. Flawed characters making the best of a challenging situation. I enjoyed watching them come to terms with their various situations and realising that however shitty life may appear. There are good things to appreciate. If you're looking for a quiet night in enjoying the nuances of a family probably slightly more messed up than the average. A solid soundtrack and a few moments that capturing human emotion with a unique accuracy then this is a film for you.,This Is Where I Leave You
145,ReluctantPhilistine,It Feels Like a Book,6,22 November 2014,"The newest film by director Shawn Levy is so packed with star power that it may come as a surprise that the most endearing and memorable character is a bold and unassuming toddler named Cole who traipses around the film carrying his training-toilet in tow. Whenever Cole feels the urge, which is often, he sets up his toilet wherever he is – in the yard, in the living room – and he does his business, to great comedic effect. The character is adorable, and his ambivalence is charming, and I suppose there is something to be said about the undying potency of scatological humor. But it's still a poop joke. In the same way, while ""This Is Where I Leave You"" is replete with A-list stars, witty well-placed dialogue, and snappy one-liners, the film unfortunately panders to the least common denominator, resulting in an entertaining experience but one that is ultimately bereft of the emotional significance that one would expect surrounding the death of a family member.""This is Where I Leave You"" is essentially a ""home-coming"" narrative. A dying father makes a last request before he passes away: That his wife and his four now-adult children sit Shiva for him, a Jewish tradition during which the family of the deceased gathers together under one roof to mourn for a period of seven days. A surprisingly youthful Jane Fonda plays the role of Hillary Altman, the matriarch of the family, who must insist upon the tradition to her modern self-absorbed children, Judd (Jason Bateman), Philip (Adam Driver), Paul (Corey Stoll), and Wendy (Tina Fey). The family agrees to live under the same roof for seven days in respect to their father's wishes, and much of the film derives its vitality from the awkward and uncomfortable situations that arise from the interplay between family members. But there is much more happening that just this.Each sibling also has their significant other to deal with, and each one is afflicted by some sort of relationship woe that they attempt to overcome in the film. Additionally, as this is a home-coming story, there are several old flames waiting to be rekindled in the sleepy home-town, each one accompanied by regrets and memories from the past. Confused yet?All told, there are no less than twelve central characters, and all are beautifully and remarkably brought to life by the talented writing of Jonathan Tropper, who not only penned the screenplay, but also the novel that it is based upon. But, it must be said that this profusion of characters is also the film's biggest curse.A surplus of characters can make a great novel, but difficulties arise when attempting to flesh-out so many multidimensional characters in less than two hours. The dialogue is laugh-out-loud funny at times, and the drama is real and affecting, which is a credit to the tight compelling performances of Jason Bateman, Tina Fey, and Jane Fonda, but many of the characters end up feeling flat not because of bad acting, but simply due to a lack of screen time. It often feels like there are simply too many characters to identify with. So when the tears inevitably begin to flow, it may be difficult to sympathize. We may want to, because the characters seem true and honest, but we can't, just because we don't yet know who they are. The film does have its funny moments, but some of the comedy in the film is exceedingly low-brow. In addition to the afore-mentioned literal toilet humor, there is an ongoing joke about Hillary Altman's new breasts, sexual blunders centered on a couple trying to conceive, and a stereotypical scene where friends bond with the help of marijuana, bringing to mind every film in which adults try to reconnect with their youth. There is nothing inherently wrong with this type of humor, but it is designed for a specific audience and movie-goers that appreciate a bit more subtlety or sophistication may be disappointed. This is unfortunate, because the film does many things well. There are no dull moments, the pace is satisfying, and the drama and comedy do mix well to create a film that is at times sentimental, and at times hilariously uncomfortable.But the film ultimately falters because it overextends itself. It tries to do too much with the time allotted. It is obvious that Jonathan Tropper can write compelling characters, but this nuanced complexity is often lost when diluted into a cast of characters equally nuanced and complex. Unfortunately, over the course of a hundred minutes, the characters feel like complicated and dynamic strangers, which lowers the drama to the level and superficiality of the comedy. It's endearing, and it's often comical, but in the end, it feels about as satisfying and as memorable as a well-constructed poop joke.",This Is Where I Leave You

147,tomcat1762,"Solid acting & directing, likable characters but . . .",7,12 October 2014,"the story is a bit contrived and a bit too long. Are we supposed to believe that the protagonist can catch his wife cheating and lose a parent on the same day, only to find out this same wife is pregnant a few days later? It could have used more character development up front via flashbacks etc. Then when Judd (Jason Bateman) gets back together with Penny it makes sense. However, Jason Bateman is excellent in the role despite the story's shortcomings. I know it's hard to tell five or more stories in two hours, so don't try. The story, although focused on Judd, tried to tell the entire family's history and it was too much of a stretch, and then it spent too much time wrapping up for the mega happy ending. The ""Big Chill"" has certainly had it's share of remakes, but only the original broke ground.

Was the end an after thought? It seems like someone said, hey I know,let's just throw this in without any foundation or real build up, maybe people will think this is interesting.

152,randomtitle,HEADLINE: Levy's Clichéd Family Dramedy Wastes Top Talent,3,3 February 2015,"Bitterly disappointed in this film. Love Bateman, love Fey, love almost every other member of this cast... in other stuff. So what's wrong with this flick? It's a hack's interpretation of crappy family dramedy (think ""The Family Stone""). Let's list off the elements: 1) Quirky/flawed characters who we're told are quirky/flawed rather than shown? CHECK 2) Way too many plot lines, compromising the ability of a mediocre director to hold it all together, i.e. ""pulling a Shumacher""? CHECK 3) ""Twists"" that really are wholesale yada-yadaing of integral plot details? CHECK (Note: This one was particularly egregious. Fonda's liplock of her secret lesbian lover in the movie's 3rd act comes out of left field and plays as COMPLETELY unmotivated. I generally roll with certain outlandish moments in film (think the entirety of ""Face/Off""), but this one made me blurt out, ""What the F***?!?!?""There are other issues but you get the idea. The producers did themselves no favors by advertising the film as basically a slapstick family comedy; when the trailers all include Fey cold-cocking Bateman's boss, you expect more ""Wedding Crashers,"" less ""Parenthood.""

155,mmart5000,This is a Great 90's Throwback Dialogue Movie,10,22 September 2014,"I saw all of the reviews here on this film before I watched it tonight. I was very interested in how polarizing it seemed to be.So I saw it and I have to tell you, I'm on the positive side. One of my favorite films of the year. I almost think you might have to have come from a very dysfunctional, fairly large family to really get the characters interactions. But the overall themes of loss, regrets, and mistakes in life I think will be relatable to most people.This really felt like a throw back to a lot of independent films of the 90's to me in that aspect. Like Kicking and Screaming, House of Yes, or If Lucy Fell. Or even Reality Bites. Just a cool story of people who are messed up trying to find a way to figure it all out.And the performances really make it. I knew Tina Fey, Jason Bateman, Timothy Olyphant, Rose Byrne, Connie Britton, and Jane Fonda would be great. But Adam Driver really stole the show.This is seriously a great movie for what it is trying to do. This year's Silver Linings Playbook.

This is a heartwarming story with genuine dialog between characters. Some of these conversations and interactions I have experienced firsthand. The cinematography captures the specific details that both add to the dialog and allow you to pick up more the second time around. The acting is very believable albeit a little over emphasized for comedy at times. The first time I saw this I had wished they rewrote a few of the lines, but after my second watch they seem fitting for the character and what they were going through at the time. I really did not like Phillip, and now I have come to realize he is that juvenile person frequently found in families.

Fast forward five years to me being 31 and having suffered the loss of my grandfather with a dysfunctional extended family thrown in and this film just hit different to the first viewing. For those saying it's unrealistic, I dare say you likely have functional families and/or haven't lost either the patriarch or matriarch of your family, because this movie is spot on - at least in my experience.

It shows the story of a family that comes together after a loss and their journey while trying to stay that way for a period of 7 days. Every single frame in the film was perfectly put together and was at the right place. All the characters in the film are very funny and likable in their own way. The performances were great too - everyone did their part well. Nothing seemed over the edge. It was a sort of mixture I would say. It was both witty and serious in a way; both simple and complex.

I read the book, Tropper does a great job of translating that to the screen with the right blend of people.Bateman is fantastic. One reviewer said that everyone is filled with flaws, but I thought the characters seemed extremely real. Imagine a member of your immediate family passing, and then sitting in a house with everyone else in the family for 7 days. Flaws are going to be shown. They will be plenty. This movie is about love. But it is about love for people that matter, even if you forgot who they are. Go see it!",This Is Where I Leave You

I immediately fell in love with this completely dysfunctional family.I don't really understand where all the bad reviews come from. To me this was one of the most hilarious movies I have seen in a very, very long time.

174,Scottaaa13,"Great book, adapts well to the screen",8,19 September 2014,"Being a fan of Jonathan Tropper, and this book, I was both excited and little nervous about seeing the film. Sometimes the big screen gets it, and sometimes it is a complete miss. I was pleasantly appeased with the film. They did a great job of adapting the book for the screen and keeping everything that needed to be kept. There were a few things character development wise that were left out, but it was nothing major, and its understandable when you have to tell the story in an hour and half. So coming from someone who loves the book, I also loved the film (not more than the book of course). The cast did a really good job, and some of them were exactly as I had pictured while I was reading. It can also definitely be enjoyed if you have not read the book. Just remember, it is a book adaptation and the book was written in 2009, and it was an original idea. Does it have similarities to other dysfunctional family movies, some yes, but it is its own story. Go in and just enjoy it. It is a fun, sometimes sad, comical, and relatable film. Though my crazy family and I have not had all of the situations happen to us. I was able to relate to the chaos of a family being together under one roof, and I think a lot of people will be able to. Don't over think it, just enjoy a good story! Is it a best picture contender? No, not at all, but it is still a good film and definitely worth the watch!",This Is Where I Leave You

It didn't help that a woman sat directly behind me during the trailers and started to paint her nails at which time I asked her to please stop and was told 'I'm almost finished"" From there it was downhill....

176,dgenefoster,Predictable and extremely boring; weak in every way.,1,19 September 2014,"It is difficult to think of a movie that I have seen in the last 2 years that I would consider worse than this one; couldn't wait for it to be over. With the exception of Jason Bateman, the acting was weak and the storyline too contrived. I hung in there hoping that it would get better, or at least more believable but to no avail. It felt like a project put together to give a few 'out of work' actors something to do that they could actually get paid for. This movie might have been worthwhile had they gone a little deeper into one or two of the characters instead of conjuring up so many dysfunctional situations. Wish I had not wasted my time or money on this one.",This Is Where I Leave You

This film smartly peels the layers and transparently reveals all about people running astray with their lives and emotions. It captures how families really are or maybe should be. Americans are all too good at bottling and hiding their real feelings and the result is vapid soullessness. Not with this film. It displays like European honesty ensuring every word drips viscerally from their tongues until the effects are felt. So reassuring in a country gone soft and dull. Amazing performances, sharply written and wildly funny, this film will pull tears, smiles and laughs.",This Is Where I Leave You

Pulling the tubes from her dead husband's body is a real life experience. The frustration of infidelity and infertility are real moments. Almost uncomfortable at times it pointed a light on my own childhood and the good times that were lost and forgotten among the bad. A very busy screen play with lots of sub-plots. Pay close attention and you will love this movie. If you only watch it on the surface, it is still enjoyable. Acting is admirable but casting might have found some better actors. Tina and Jane were both an unexpected surprises. They added a lot. I might watch it a second time after it hits DVD. I think I missed a lot because I wasn't expecting it. Kind of sneaks up on you.",This Is Where I Leave You
179,patrick-dehaan,"A well cloaked, vigorous social agenda movie",3,22 September 2014,"Pay close attention to the opening, a well crafted example of co-authorship requiring the viewer to guess who is the cuckold, who is the cheater and who is the paramour? Across the genders, no less; well, well done. Kudos to book author, screenwriter and film director for pulling this off skillfully. Unfortunately the movie devolves from there into a series of comic skits arranged around a plot as predictable as sunrise; the passing of an older parent/relatively new grandparent. His widow and offspring gather to mourn, resuming & reigniting dormant rivalries, jealousies and tensions suspended by adulthood and physical separation.The issues themselves seem designed to cover a long list of Liberal Progressive agenda items, all portrayed in a sophomoric, unrealistically pleasant way. In reality, less than half of them flaring up inside a week would tear most families asunder. Several varieties of ""justified"" infidelity with old neighbors and old flames, a juvenile, young stud with a rich, sugar-momma possibly bi-sexual cougar fiancé, a stressed unable-to-conceive sister-in-law who, frustrated with fertility treatment, throws herself at her former boyfriend & current brother-in-law to get pregnant. This poor married guy, prominent in the excellent opening, is himself dealing with serious life shifting developments launched at him without asking yet he remains calm and cool as he methodically beds the old neighbor's co-worker he hasn't seen in nearly a decade. Sprinkled throughout are overt and tacky sexual references, blatant disrespect for local clergy at a crucial somber life event, culminating in a seriously stupid episode of abandoning a religious ceremony to get high in an adjacent school classroom, setting off sprinklers, fire alarms and clearing the building, sending the congregation outside to witness the culprit Three Stooges, otherwise grown men, emerge soaking wet and high, all of it dismissed almost as a harmless prank.The ending revelation is certainly unexpected. It breaks the predictable series of family skirmishes leading to that point, for which credit is due however brings to a pointed head the Liberal Progressive social push the entire movie seems to have as its purpose. None of it is condemned or criticized, giving the otherwise funny-at-times movie a plastic feeling of pretentious illusion such lifestyles and philosophy do not produce, wrapped in the trappings of success and wealth much more likely in a traditional, less scandalous family setting and society.",This Is Where I Leave You
180,r_lowman-114-350899,Very Disappointing- Trite and Formulaic,2,23 September 2014,"This genre of film - a group of people who have significant history and are brought together by an event that impacts them all- rely on great script,creative casting and directing that creates chemistry and meaningful interaction.""This is how I leave you"" has none of these elements. The seemingly talented cast seem to go through the motions, speaking contrived lines and relying on set piece comedic elements that are not funny to begin with, a rabbi called ""boner"" and Jane Fonda's fake breasts are as good as they get. The script hardly rises above the level of a one -season sitcom. Characters and their stories are undeveloped. there s no sense of real relationship between these family members and certainly no spark or wit. This film fails miserably. Save your money and watch ""The Big Chill"" to see how it should be done.",This Is Where I Leave You

Jason Bateman was fabulous as was Tina Fey, Adam Driver and Jane Fonda. The way they played off of each other was fantastic and made for a very, very funny outcome. This family is pretty dysfunctional, but as the movie progresses, you suddenly realize you can picture your own family in the same absolutely hilarious situation!This movie really took me on an emotional roller coaster ride. I laughed, I cried and I even cheered at one point (Don't want to spoil it). As a matter of fact -- the entire audience cheered!! If you want to laugh and laugh and laugh -- go see this movie!

Each character has his/her own world, every little note of emotion is distilled with a touch of humor, and no one is better at that than Tina and Jason, as brothers and sisters. Plus there's Timothy Oliphant, who I totally adore. It's really about what life is, complex and complicated, and how we tend to mess it up even more. The rhythm is good, there's a sweet flow to it, just enough fun scenes and seriousness. Just let it go, sit down on a quiet evening when it's pouring rain outside, and enjoy the tears and smiles this movie will give you. It's human, and it feels good.",This Is Where I Leave You

185,bonniewsy,This story is a rediscover of family bonds during a time of tragedy,7,26 December 2014,"This is Where I Leave You the movie is not very different from the book. It very much keeps to the heart of the book, also because the screen writer, Jonathan Trooper, is also the author of the book.I feel the casting has been done perfectly, Jane Fonda is exactly how I would have pictured Hillary Altman (of Foxman in the books). Tina Fey is also great as Wendy, sharp and loving at the same time. Adam Driver does a great job at being the youngest brother, reminding me very much of my youngest brother (who to be fair is a lot less of a screw-up). His petulance and unyielding support for his family is well portrayed.However, like all books turned movies, you discover the characters at a deeper and usually more dramatic level in the books. I felt that Judd Altman journey was much better discovered in the book. The book spend the first 2-3 chapters taking you through Judd's disillusionment, explaining in detail his thoughts when he sees he's wife having sex with another man, in fact, having more adventurous sex with another man, He describes the sounds made by Quinn, different from any he has heard before and starts doubting his manhood. He also smashes a cake with burning candles on Wade's (cheating bastard) ass which lights his scrotum on fire. That was a scene i was sorry not to have caught. This scene formed the foundation of the book, of Judd's downward spiral but was glossed over in the movie, that was disappointing.Another story the was left out was the drama with the Rottweiler that resulted in Paul's downfall and the falling out between Paul and Judd. That was the story that showed how selfish, self-centered and blind to our faults we can be. Again, making the book a richer experienceNonetheless, the fights, the chaos, the love that each character eventually showed each other was well delivered in the movie. I'll give it a 7 out of 10.See my review of the book at http://allmyguiltypleasures.blogspot.sg/",This Is Where I Leave You

I am part of a dysfunctional family. This movie should've spoken to me in tongues, but instead, it was just trite. The acting isn't totally awful, but the story lines are just utterly unbelievable: 1. sister-in-law who can't get knocked up tries to seduce brother-in-law while huz is upstairs in the same house....really? 2. mom doesn't tie bathrobe tight and exposes breasts to her own son...uh, come on!3. entire house full of mourners hears an infertile couple, well, coupling on the baby monitor4. adults use the childhood nickname ""Boner"" to refer to the rabbi in front of congregants5. pristine E-Type Jaguar gets toppled and owner just walks away6. older woman gives $135,000 Porsche to her beau and walks awayI could go on, but the point is that the scenes that try to be funny totally flop. Even the getting high in the Sunday school classroom scene is totally unfunny, and nobody loves adults getting high more than I do. As another reviewer noted, the only funny scene is the lamest gag in the movie--little kid carries port-a-potty around to crap. The one gotcha is a surprise out of left field, but even that is raised, commented upon, and dropped with no real exploration. How can you make Tina Fey unfunny, Jason Bateman unlikeable (and un-cute), and Jane Fonda so bad?",This Is Where I Leave You

189,hasbroucklogan,Review: They Got A Lot More Than They Bargained For On This Visit Home,10,18 October 2016,"Sometimes home is the place you need to be. For the Altman family, coming home to mourn the death of their father was the start of healing for a family that didn't know it was broken. This Is Where I Leave You sets its bar high when it comes to best motion picture. ""For the next seven days, you are all grounded!"" Hillary Altman (Jane Fonda) addresses her kids upon their first official day of mourning for their father. Explaining their father's dying wish to have them all under the same roof, sitting shiva (a Jewish mourning period which lasts for 7 days and consists of family members receiving visitors while sitting low to the ground), there is no disobeying Mama Altman. A quick- witted family in which most members have no trouble baring all, you quickly see the siblings settle back into a comfortable camaraderie with each other, all except Paul who has some slight resentment about being the only one left to run the family business. You also see the issues each one is facing. The character of the storyline follows the most, Judd Altman (Jason Bateman) discovers his wife, Quinn Altman (Abigail Spencer) has been having a year long affair with his boss (Dax Shepard.) Not wanting to discuss the situation with his family, he finds that older sister Wendy (Tina Fey) keeps pushing him to spill the beans. Once news of the betrayal comes out, it seems as if everyone reveals their problems as well: eldest brother Paul's (Corey Stoll) inability to impregnate his wife, youngest brother Phillip's (Adam Driver) inability to fully commit to his much older girlfriend, and Wendy's distance from her always-on-the-phone-for business-calls husband creates a tense atmosphere in the Altman household. In between the small arguments and bickering, the siblings use humor to enlighten the frustrating twists and turns their lives are taking. The very open family showers the film with R-rated comedy much like what is found in Paul Feig's Bridesmaids. You won't find a whole lot of raunchy material here, however. Shawn Levy digs deep inside the hearts of all these characters to define each and every one using the actors and actresses awesome delivery of each line. Whoever did the casting was brilliant. Chaotic, tear-jerking, emotional and hysterical, This Is Where I Leave You is filled with problematic relationships and heartbreak that makes you question if you could ever find true love. With back to back issues, watchers really need to pay attention to fully understand the message behind this movie. However, you wouldn't be wasting your cash with this purchase. This Is Where I Leave You is easy to describe as a blessing in disguise.",This Is Where I Leave You

Either it be the modern society cliché or be the long lasting parenting this movie excels in every part. Gearing for the dad's funeral and reuniting the emotions certainly entertained me. The cast is flawless and I found every part should be clearly praised. This will certainly boost up for some family golden moments. The brothers and their differences, the eldest one being not so funny and the youngest one being the most naughty is what we all expect from the family pack, but the arrangements of their characters and the way they are presented will not leave you being bored at any instance. It has done a decent job in handling the old days, old days link-ups and has exactly shown their effects in the future when actually you need those to be back again. But I laughed hard in some scenes of Church or even more. So, the perfect blend of emotions, comedy, reality inside the family makes this movie a must watch.",This Is Where I Leave You
