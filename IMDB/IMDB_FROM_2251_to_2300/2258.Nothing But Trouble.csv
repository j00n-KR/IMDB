0,MartinHafer,As funny as a tumor,1,29 May 2005,"This movie has the distinction of being, perhaps, the only movie done by an SNL alumni that is even worse than NEIGHBORS (though it's like comparing which is worse--the Bubonic Plague or Ebola). Now I know that Dan Aykroyd IS capable of making awful movies (after all, I saw DR. DETROIT) but this...? Hmmm,....WAIT,...I just realized something--both of these films starred Aykroid!!! These, plus Dr. Detroit make him the obvious choice for WORST actor from the original cast of SNL. And,...do NOT think that Ghostbusters makes up for these other monstrosities!! It's not even close.So, what's the (ha, ha) plot of this laugh riot? Chevy Chase (who has participated in his share of crappy or mediocre flicks) and Demi Moore are driving cross country with some friends (who they are, I don't care) and they are arrested for speeding in a crappy little hole of a town. The insane and terribly unfunny judge is, believe it or not, Aykroyd (though it's almost impossible to tell under his outrageous and fake looking make up and prosthetics). The insane judge locks them up and they spend much of the movie whining (and why should THEY, since WE had to pay to see this bilge?!). Later, some annoying drug addicts are caught and dropped into a chipper shredder. And that, my friends, is the plot--aside from the hilarious (?) performances of John Candy as both a man and his twin sister (they appear to be identical twins--an impossibility as they are OPPOSITE sexes--I assumed one underwent sexual reassignment surgery).I defy any of the readers to come up with a less funny movie.",Nothing But Trouble
1,SnoopyStyle,deliberately annoying,2,12 December 2014,"Successful financial writer Chris Thorne (Chevy Chase) meets emotional lawyer Diane Lightson (Demi Moore). She wants to stop a land developer and he's willing to take her to meet him in Atlantic City. Obnoxious, wealthy Brazilian siblings Fausto and Renalda tag along. Chris gets lost and is arrested by Valkenvania police officer Dennis Valkenheiser (John Candy). He is brought in front of crazy old Judge Reeve Alvin Valkenheiser (Dan Aykroyd) and his weird mansion/courthouse.It's an ugly funhouse of deliberately annoying characters. Dan Aykroyd has nobody to blame but himself. He just goes crazy without anybody willing to tell him that this is disgusting and not funny. I hate most of these characters. If Chevy Chase is nicer, there is a possible rooting interest. However everything is so over-the-top ugly and unlikeable. I almost want to give it a pass for being campy but not every bad movie deserves that pass. Its worst sin of all is that it's not funny.",Nothing But Trouble
2,claudio_carvalho,The Aykroyd Brothers Should Have Made Research Before Writing Bullshit,5,21 August 2016,"In New York, the arrogant financial publisher Chris Thorne (Chevy Chase) travels in his BMW with his hot neighbor, the lawyer Diane Lightson (Demi Moore), and the inconvenient siblings Fausto Squiriniszu (Taylor Negron) and Renalda Squiriniszu (Bertila Damas) to Atlantic City for a lecture. The siblings asks to sight-see an old mining area and Chris makes a detour in New Jersey to the village of Valkenvania, Chris does not stop the car at a sign and are chased and arrested by officers Dennis Valkenheise (John Candy) and Miss Purdah (Valri Bromfield). They are brought to a bizarre mansion in a junkyard to the presence of Judge Alvin 'J.P' Valkenheise (Dan Aykroyd) that takes their IDs and locks them in a cell to be judged later. Then they are invited to have dinner with the judge and his family. The group tries to flee irritating the judge that imprisons Chris and Diane, while Fausto and Renalda are hunted down by Miss Purdah and Dennis. What will happen to Chris, Diane and the siblings?""Nothing But Trouble"" is a bizarre black comedy by Dan Aykroyd that does not work very well despite the cast. The non-sense story is unpleasant and not funny and the unknown Taylor Negron is awful. In addition, the Aykroyd Brothers should have made research before writing bullshit. They would learn that Brazilians speak Portuguese, and not Spanish; the stereotyped typical Brazilian rhythm is ""Samba"" and not ""Mambo"" (from Cuba); Christ and Corcovado is the same place and one of the Seven Wonders of the World. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Nada Além de Problemas"" (""Nothing but Trouble"")",Nothing But Trouble
3,lee_eisenberg,actors directing do occasionally seem to have trouble,5,1 July 2006,"I'm not sure whether to describe ""Nothing But Trouble"" as funny or gross. Portraying yuppie motorist Chevy Chase and hubby Demi Moore getting stopped for speeding and getting taken to the weirdest courtroom ever conceived of, director Dan Aykroyd really makes it look like he has a messed-up mind. Playing the nasty judge, Aykroyd looks like the older version of Jack Crabbe in ""Little Big Man""...as painted by Salvador Dali. John Candy, as the cop, is really the most interesting person in the movie, how he calmly says ""You're under arrest."" As for the issue of gross or funny, there are some scenes that probably will make you at least giggle, but considering that so many scenes literally resemble vomit, I wonder why Dan Aykroyd chose this as his directorial debut. I would say that they went a little overboard with the Bonestripper.No, it's not a terrible movie (it easily beats any Jean-Claude Van Damme movie for quality). Some of the gadgets in the house were actually pretty neat. But really folks, the cast members have all done much better than this.",Nothing But Trouble
4,paul_haakonsen,"If you don't stop, trouble comes a knocking...",6,22 December 2015,"This movie was great and enjoyable back in 1991 and still is so even today. There is just that something unique about the chemistry between comedians Dan Aykroyd, John Candy and Chevy Chase.The story is about four upscale people whom are caught for traffic violations in Valkenvania and are brought for immediate sentencing before the eccentric judge Alvin Valkenheiser. And soon the day turns into a real nightmare.While ""Nothing But Trouble"" is not the type of comedy that will split you open from excessive laughing, then there is just something Classic about the entire movie; be it the mood and absurdity of the story, the hilarious and outrageous characters, or the fact that Dan Aykroyd, John Candy and Chevy Chase were just a great combination, I do not know. But I do know that this movie is entertaining.The movie does bear itself as watchable more than once. And if you are a fan of Dan Aykroyd, John Candy or Chevy Chase, then ""Nothing But Trouble"" is a must watch.",Nothing But Trouble
5,JohnHowardReid,"Thanks, fellas! Thanks heaps!",9,17 August 2016,"Made on a forty million dollar budget (virtually none of which was recovered), which is all up there on the screen, this extraordinarily unpopular movie is most definitely one for the connoisseur. Dan Akroyd's admirers will enjoy it too. In fact, director Akroyd gives actor Alroyd perhaps a wee too much attention, but Chevy Chase has a good innings too, and I've nothing but praise for the super-lovely Demi Moore and prolific TV actress/writer Valri Bromfield, here making one of her few movie appearances. And as for the sets, to say they are mind-boggling would not nearly do them justice. The make-up people also deserve the highest praise. All the same, this is definitely a movie that will appeal mainly to the connoisseur and one wonders how any investors in their right minds would advance even a nickel to finance a movie like this, let alone forty million. If they had asked me for my advice, I would have told them they had no chance whatever of making a dime. But thanks a lot fellas! I really enjoyed this really bizarre movie anyway, and it didn't cost me so much as a cent!",Nothing But Trouble
6,BandSAboutMovies,Perfectly strange,8,2 June 2019,"You know how people always complain that Hollywood isn't doing anything new, constantly churning out CGI-filled remakes and comic book movies? They should really check out this bit of absolute insanity, one of the last all practical effects films, which is literally an auteur moment from the pure id of Dan Ackroyd.Nothing but Trouble started after producer Robert K. Weiss went to a movie with Dan and Peter Aykroyd. That movie was Hellraiser, as Weiss had a fractured rib and it hurt to laugh. Once the movie started, the three were shocked to see people laughing, which gave them the idea to create a horror comedy.Peter remembered an event where Dan was pulled over in a small upstate New York town, had to pay $50 and then endure a four-hour cup of tea with the town's justice of the peace. That started the process, with Dan using dreams - like the giant mutant babies - and the study of the ever-burning town of Centralia, PA.After John Hughes and John Landis turned it down, Ackroyd decided to direct and play two heavy makeup roles, which only added to his stress once filming began. Most of its $40 million budget secured Chevy Chase - who repeatedly screamed at cast members and would yell that he was more important than Ackroyd - and the movie's elaborate sets and effects.That said, it's been said that Chevy would call up various co-stars at night, after filming, to apologize for what he perceived to be stressed out behavior. If you ask me, that's the traditional behavior of an abuser. Billy Murray said it best. Medium talent.Luckily, Ackroyd had a great crew who rallied around him (one crew member even threatened to drop a brick on Chase's head) to make something really special. Or weird. It depends on your point of view. I actually love this movie, which is completely disgusting and disquieting, two things which I know made audiences hate it. Yet I must remain the champion of the films that are lost and forgotten.When financial publisher Chris Thorne (Chase) meets lawyer Diane Lightson (Demi Moore), he decides to invite her along on a trip to meet clients in Atlantic City. Joining them are the wealthy and oh so abrasive siblings Fausto and Renalda Squiriniszu (Taylor Negron, who is missed greatly in these parts, and Bertila Damas).After running a stop sign in the small village of Valkenvania and attempting to leave the scene of the crime, they're all arrested by officer Dennis Valkenheiser (John Candy, whose star power got this made) and taken before the town's judge, 106-year-old Alvin Valkenheiser (Aykroyd). After Chris offends the judge - I feel that this role may be the closest Chase came to playing himself outside of Community - he sends them all to jail.Meanwhile, a bunch of drunk drivers are sent to a murderous rollercoaster called Mr. Bonestripper while everyone else is invited to a horrifying dinner of sausages driven around on a model train. Soon, everyone is on the run, trying to escape the denizens of the town, like Alvin's mute granddaughter Eldona (Candy again) and the deformed Bobo (played by Aykroyd) and Lil' Debbull. Also: Digital Underground shows up.Again, for better or worse, this movie is all Ackroyd. The police badges, seen in the revolving frames on the judge's bench, are actual badges from his personal collection. He's been a lifelong police supporter, which is interesting given this film's conspiratorial tone that all of the cops are in on it.I'm of the belief that this film is a success. It's not afraid to be completely unhinged and blow through a budget - but it's all on the screen - using the set of High Noon to create the most lunatic setting for a film I've ever seen.The YouTube series Good Bad Flicks is a big inspiration for a lot of what I write. Check out their amazing breakdown of this film and how it was made for even more.",Nothing But Trouble
7,view_and_review,Wacky,6,25 March 2020,"This is probably the wackiest movie I've ever seen Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase in, and to have them collaborate on this, of all movies, was a bit strange. The whole thing was odd. The very idea that some small village in the middle of New Jersey exists almost like the Bermuda Triangle where crooks and criminals go in and never leave is something from a horror movie. Then, along with the strange characters in this village of Valkenvania, a music video breaks out from Digital Underground: shout out to 2Pac.This script was written by Peter Aykroyd, Brother to Dan Aykroyd. Peter wrote a couple of goodies in ""Spies Like Us"" and ""Coneheads,"" but this one seemed more like a teenage science experiment whereby he just mixed a bunch of random elements hoping for a grand explosion but getting nothing but a fizzle.",Nothing But Trouble
8,FlashCallahan,A pickle shooting train.....,8,22 February 2015,"A financial publisher, meets a spurned woman and agrees to take her to a business meeting, to meet up with her soon to be ex partner. On the way there, they run a stop sign in a tiny town in the middle of nowhere. They are arrested and taken to the local court. But all is not as it seems. The courthouse and the prison are a maze of booby- traps and deadly contraptions. Not to mention the seemingly insane Judge, his hatred for bankers, and his insufferable family.....Maybe it was my age when I first saw this at the cinema (14), or maybe it was due to fact that I saw the dreadful Soapdish just before it, but I always find time for this film, and its a perfect, silly film to watch every now and again.I'm not saying its a brilliant film, it's far from it, and Ackroyd's directing leaves a lot to be desired, but when you have a reliable cast like Chase, Candy, and the aforementioned Ackroyd doing what they do best, in a bonkers film, you can't help but love it.There is a little bit of a story to the whole silly thing, The judge hates bankers because a long time ago a deal was made and ruined the town of Valkenvania, but Ackroyd doesn't know what to do with the narrative, so a fun-house was created to fill in the cracks of the weak plot.But the town of Valkenvania, and the judges house, are just wonderful, and look like they were created by someone who likes a touch of alcohol. One liners are cringe-worthy, but coming from Chase, they sort of work, and Moore is just hilariously bad.Add Candy in drag, and a couple of what could only be described as blobs into the mix, and you have one of the most random movies to come out of the nineties.I like it, I can't think for the life of me why, but I always enjoy watching it.",Nothing But Trouble
9,Aaron1375,Bizarre comedy that works sometimes and sometimes fails badly.,6,3 February 2010,"I am going to go against the grain as I so often do especially when comedies are involved and say that this movie was somewhat funny and overall I liked it. A bit mind you, it is on the line of being a five and in the neutral zone for me, but I say it did enough for me to say it was a fair movie for the most part. I will also say there are some parts of the film that make me cringe and parts of the film that are kind of irritating as well. This film is about what happens when you get caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. A group including two guys and two gals are traveling and get pulled over by a cop who ends up taking them before a judge. He identifies one as a banker for some reason and that is the end of that, he does not intend for them to leave as I would say I was screwed when the floor opened up beneath my feet and I was sent to some strange room filled with squeaky toys. Well this is only the beginning as they then must dine with the freaky judge and his absolutely strange family. And things for the most part keep getting worse and worse for two of the people, as the other two a brother and sister make a run for it. The movie gets more and more bizarre from there as there are a host of strange characters and places to see as they continue to have nothing but trouble. Like I said, some of the comedy works and some of it does not. When it fails at times it fails big time. A lot of the actors play multiple roles too, and I have to say I did not really care for Candy as the daughter of the judge. I liked his cop character better and he departs the film fairly early. Aykroyd is rather good as the fairly insane judge and as the bizarre person that lives in the junkyard. Chevy Chase and Demi Moore do all right as the couple who must live through this mess. So it has a fairly solid cast. Could have done without the music video during part of it though.",Nothing But Trouble

11,thesar-2,Forget Trouble. Nothing is Good.,1,13 April 2014,"In 1991 – actually, starting back in 1988, I made it my mission to watch as many movies as I could. I loved going to the cinema and literally seeing everything. And yet, in early 1991, I decidedly avoided Nothing But Trouble.Damn, I must've been a smart kid.This movie was so richly bad, so incredibly awful, so repulsive and so spiteful of the human race, it should never had been made. Hell, it didn't know at any point if it wanted to be a comedy, horror or both and never settled in on any genre.Basically, Chevy Chase's Chris agrees to take both an obnoxious and absolutely appalling couple of nitwits and Demi Moore's Diane to Atlantic City from New York but get sidetracked when they run a stop sign. Apparently, this is the end all to all sin in this small town on the way to the Eastern gambling destination.Once they get caught and led to the local judge, the movie title kicks in.In honesty and all that is good, I watched this train wreck of a disgusting and horrifyingly bad movie because the hilarious How Did This Get Made podcast covered it and I needed to see it before I listened to their show.After seeing this mess, this repulsive pile of sh|t, get progressively worse – think Garbage Pail Kids: The Movie Part II, you truly wonder if any one, at any time, thought any of this was a good idea.But, if you must see this pointless, aimless and poorly written romp, at very least listen to the How Did This Get Made podcast following. At least you'd finally get a good laugh out of this time wasted.* * * Final thoughts: I remember the only two positives I saw during this: Demi looked amazing! and I was impressed with the 1991 technology. I mean, who knew they had GPS in cars in 1991?Now, think about it. Are those two positives worth wasting another 94 minutes of your life over?",Nothing But Trouble
12,bensonmum2,I despise every frame of this movie,1,28 June 2021,"Forget a plot summary - I refuse. I hate everything about this movie. I saw Nothing But Trouble either during its theatrical run or shortly thereafter and couldn't stand it. Watching it again 30 years later, my opinion hasn't changed - it's garbage.I watch a lot of bad movies that I will give the benefit of the doubt to, but not this one. Unlike some of the low-budget dreck I actually enjoy, this mess was made with a $40 million budget. That's right - $40 million! Other than salaries, over-the-top special effects, and a so-busy-it's-distracting set-design, I have no idea where the money went. I could guess . . .The blame for this disaster has to fall squarely at the feet of Dan Akyroyd - the writer, director, and star. Looking at his filmography, his best work has always been when he's playing second fiddle to someone like John Belushi, Bill Murray, or Eddie Murphy. On his own, you end up with something un-funny, repulsive, and nauseating.Don't waste your time. Nothing But Trouble is a film that I cannot recommend to anyone for any reason.1/10.",Nothing But Trouble
13,lost-in-limbo,Nothing but flagging boredom.,2,4 February 2007,"Financier publisher Chris Thorne and fellow neighbour/investment lawyer Diane Lightson are on their way to a seminar meeting in Atlantic City. After taking a turn off the New Jersey Turnpike they enter Valkenvania, where they're pulled over by a police officer for not stopping at an intersection. So they are hauled back to a junky looking mansion in the middle of nowhere, where they must stand trail in front of the Justice of the Peace Alvin Valkenheiser. They soon enough discover that this absurd madhouse won't let them go so easily for breaking the law. Oh, there's trouble! Sometimes there's bad, and then there's intolerably bad. Mmmm what a ploddingly disastrous fiasco in self-indulgence ""Nothing but Trouble"" turned out to be! I've always enjoyed the comical antics of Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd and John Candy, but on this occasion it's a feebly miserable venture straining for laughs and excitement. It's guilty as sin for not being funny and its supposed to be a flip-out comedy of extreme weirdness. I thought the one idea concept behind the pitch-black premise, wasn't bad and the visual playground of gimmicks had it moments. Instead of being an all out dark and disturbing broad comedy, it goes lightweight with the material that it just didn't feel right and the overwrought build-ups are too silly or gross that it has you rolling your eyes. So the ghoulish twist about it (that has that ""Motel Hell"" feel to it), is plain scary for all the wrong reasons. Dan Aykroyd (unrecognisable in his grotesque makeup) might play dual roles in the film, but he was also behind ridiculously wretched screenplay and gleefully disjointed direction. It was a messy vision that we got and he truly goes beyond with it all. It even takes time out to spin out a hip-hop tune midway through the film and this didn't help its already slack pace. The manic art-direction was fine and there are some nice camera angles on show. So, there were a 'few' reasonable aspects, but really these things are largely overshadowed by its goldmine of unpleasantness. Aykroyd's totally noisy and downright coarse performance is unbearable. Chase is his usual dryly-suave self with the occasional quick-witted response, but more often he looks awkward. If it weren't for a few of his one-liners and a radiantly gorgeous Demi Moore the off switch would've come into play. Moore is okay, without doing a whole lot. An also amusing Candy seems wasted (even if he too, had dual parts) and is the only one I feel truly sorry for in the cast. Though, again it just gets you thinking why and how they get involved in this farcical. I just don't know what to make of it. This doleful comedy exercise thinks it's funnier than it actually is and that's not a good sign when that's the case. Plain depressing on the part of the movie and that I bought it (quite cheap I might add). Ugh!",Nothing But Trouble
14,tabuno,A Different and Sometimes Fascinating Comedy,7,20 January 2019,"5 December 2009. Dan Aykroyd and John Candy are surprisingly the stand out for their performances and it was the typecast acting of Chevy Chase that weakened this movie in what was a fascinating balance of black comedy and Hudson Hawk (1991) eerie weirdness that doesn't quite create a consistently funny thriller. Overall, this comedy was off-beat and had a number of moments of creative fascination along with the more dumb, overacting but never terrible scenes. Unfortunately, this dark but never tasteless movie never was able to build on its premise with a completely satisfying plot ending. Candy's performance was one of his better acting jobs, playing a straight cop with a difficult role which he pulled off with panache. Dan Aykroyd's performance was almost unrecognizable and out of character, developed a dizzying different and captivating character.",Nothing But Trouble
15,sol-,Trouble in Mind,6,8 October 2017,"Pulled over for speeding in a small country town, a financial adviser and his companions are subjected to strange forms of justice at the mercy of an eccentric local judge in this bizarre horror comedy. The film was a commercial flop and was nominated for several Razzies in its day, but it is actually a more worthwhile movie than its reputation might suggest. The judge's manor at the very least is a magnificent feat of art direction, full of trap doors, hidden elevators, closing walls and a roller-coaster that ends with its riders being crushed to death (how they enforce the death penalty). Some of the zaniness comes off as weird simply for the sake of it, including two blob creatures that live in the nearby junkyard, but a fair amount of the dark humour works as the film focuses on the dangers of breaking the rules in places where the letter of the law might not always be applied. Balancing both comedy and horror, the film is never quite as funny or scary as it may have been had writer-director Dan Aykroyd chosen to just focus on one genre, but the great imagination he displays here makes it seem a shame that the film's negative reception caused him to give up directing altogether. The very mechanically wired courtroom and equally as wired dinner table are great, and Aykyrod is clearly having a lot of fun here, having cast himself in the scene-stealing role of the cantankerous judge.",Nothing But Trouble

The acting by all of these actors is very good. Aykroyd has a great performance and Candy is really wonderful in the movie. Chase and Moore are also very good. I think that they were excellent together. The music by Michael Kamen is good. The film is very exciting and its just so hilarious the entire time. This really is good comedy and in My opinion.

It's about some people being trapped in a weird prison castle fun house that's run by this ugly old judge, played disgustingly by Aykroyd. It's weird and violent and stupid. The whole movie was pointless and I don't see how Peter and Dan couldn't have been either toasted or baked when making this weird movie. Dan directed and co-wrote with his brother. The direction was terrible and just didn't look good. The whole movie was disjointed and the only part that was semi-tolerable was before we ran into John Candy as the cop. The Posistives: Chevy Chase and Demi Moore gave decent performances, under consideration that they had nothing to work with. John Candy was mildly amusing in drag as the horny grand daughter.

It's dumb, it's repulsive, it's juvenile. Your mouth will hang open in disbelief. It is not ""black humor"" as some assert. To be black humor, the script would have to contain at least one successful joke. The only person I have ever met who thought this was funny was a recluse/computer nerd with a bowl haircut; a guy who may have never successfully told a joke himself.If the script was typed on paper made from horse manure, I'd shed a tear for the wasted horse manure. Even a double feature of the idiotic, insipid ""Home Fries"" and ""Orange County"" can't match the sheer mind-numbing, awful, hallucinogenic stupidity of this excrescence. The only way Dan Aykroyd could redeem himself after this is if everyone who has seen this movie is allowed to give him a really solid pound on the head with a twenty-pound hammer.All copies of this movie should be placed in a burlap sack, sealed in a rocket and shot into the sun!",Nothing But Trouble
22,udar55,"Chevy, Candy, Aykroyd - what went wrong?",1,22 January 2007,"I recently took in this notorious misfire featuring Chase, Demi Moore, John Candy and Dan Aykroyd on cable. Multimillionaire Chris Thorne (Chase) heads out with three friends (including romantic interest Moore) on a road trip to Atlantic City. Deciding to bypass the Jersey turnpike, he takes a detour through Valkenvania, a depressed coal mining town run by 107-year-old judge J.P. (Aykroyd). Once there, the group gets stopped by the town's top cop (Candy) and taken before the judge, who proceeds to hold them hostage in his oddball town.A bizarre vanity project for Aykroyd (he wrote, directed and has two starring roles), this alleged comedy left me scratching my head. How can something starring Chase, Aykroyd and Candy be so unfunny? And who actually thought having John Candy in drag was a good idea? I guess Dan Aykroyd did. His script (based on an idea by his brother believe it or not) is so patently off the wall that one wonders how execs felt the need to finance this $40 million dollar project. The main action takes place in a house filled with weird Rube Goldberg-like contraptions and machines that chew up and spit out drug dealers (including a young Daniel Baldwin). But Aykroyd misses nearly every opportunity to capitalize on this weirdness. One would think the decrepit Judge character would latch onto the nubile Moore. Nope. Instead he decides to kill her as Aykroyd leaves the romance between Chase and an in drag Candy. To show how completely off base he was, Aykroyd included a musical number by flavor of the month rappers Digital Underground of ""The Humpty Dance"" fame (two years after they were considered cool; look closely for a young, clean-cut 2Pac Shakur in the group before he decide he was a gangster).On the plus side, the film does sport some lavish production values, even if the sets look more like something out of a horror movie. Seriously, I wonder what was being slipped into the soup at the commissary on the Warner Bros. lot during this time period. Within a year, the studio released three surreal, big budget comedy box office bombs (this, STAY TUNED and MOM AND DAD SAVE THE WORLD).",Nothing But Trouble
23,rivertam26,This should be a cult classic,8,5 April 2020,"This is another underrated horror comedy from yesteryear. The movie is just weird and wonky. Dan Akroyd wrote, directed and stars along with Demi Moore ( G.I Jane), Chevy Chase (Fletch) and the late, great John Candy (Uncle Buck) in dual roles. The movie concerns a smarmy yuppie (Chase), the girl he's interested in (Moore) a couple of foreign rich kids and an I'll fated road trip where they are pulled over for running a stop sign and imprisoned by a strange judge and his ghoulish family. They spend the movie trying to escape wacky traps and death. The movie is weird, imaginative and bursting with creativity. Its definitely not for everyone it bombed with critics and audiences alike when it was initially released. But it's aged quite well and is definitely deserved of being a cult classic.Budget: $40m

24,xredgarnetx,The worst?,1,6 January 2008,"Probably not. But it comes damned close. MONKEYBONE probably takes top honors. Dan Aykroyd, who must have been snorting cocaine nonstop while making this, directs and stars in a movie about a family who goes off course in New Jersey and ends up in the hands of a truly scary inbred family. Aykroyd plays a hanging judge with a diseased nose. John Candy plays a cop as well as a mute, lonesome lady looking for a husband. Some truly awful stuff ensues. I am sorry to say I saw this in a theater. With my wife, no less. Chevy Chase and Demi Moore costar as the ill-fated couple. It was clear by the time this was released (1991) that Chase was on the ropes, acting-wise. Moore's no great shakes in it, either. I always thought of this as an Aykroyd vehicle, much like Bruce Willis' ego-driven HUDSON HAWK. Aykroyd acts/hams up a storm, while everyone else around him seems adrift or bewildered. Stay far, far away.",Nothing But Trouble
25,aciessi,One of the worst movies I have ever seen,1,16 December 2013,"Take a moment to realize that a long time ago, comedy legends Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase made a movie so unspeakably bad that its almost impossible to watch. A movie so grotesque in nature that it just sits there on screen like turd burning in the hot sun. This movie is called, Nothing But Trouble, and its buried in cinematic obscurity, but for all the right reasons. Whats even more insulting is the fact that Dan Aykroyd actually wrote and directed this picture, as if this was the movie he was dreaming to get made. He must have been on some strong dope. Here, he plays a deteriorating old man with a penis shaped nose who stands as the justice of the peace of a rural northeastern town. Among his family is a duo of mentally challenged mutant toad- humanoids and John Candy in drag. Not to mention, the whole area surrounding them is a toxic waste dump complete with dead corpses. Essentially, you are looking at a parody of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, minus everything that could have been potentially funny about a Texas Chainsaw parody. Its pure bunk, plain and simple. For those of you who are fans of this picture, God bless you, because I couldn't find a damn thing likable about this putrid mess. Yes, I know its supposed to be surreal and gross. If they wanted to really do that they should have hired David Lynch.",Nothing But Trouble
26,aesgaard41,Nothing but Dan Aykroyd -,3,17 August 2015,"Have you ever watched a movie that seemed great at the time, but by the eighth or twelfth viewing, it starts looking worse than you thought it was? I love Dan Aykroyd. He was and still is one of my top ten favorite talents to emerge from ""Saturday Night Live."" However, as far as being able to write, produce, direct and star in a film, he might have bit off more than he could handle. I saw a portion of this movie for the first time around 1995; it was the scene where Chevy Chase is tried before the judge, found guilty on trumped-up charges and sent through the roller coaster from hell to his death. That was it for me. I never knew what happened next for several years. What happened before that? Where did it go from there? I had to know. Some years passed, and I found the movie at the local library. (Yes, libraries actually rent movies, and they do it for free.) It turns out what I missed was Chevy Chase as a successful stock broker meeting Demi Moore, a really hot lawyer, and that's basically where things spring board. It starts out dull and boring and leaves you waiting to get into the plot. Chevy wants to take Demi out for a long drive down the coast to be alone, but in walks the late Taylor Negron from ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"" and his girlfriend to horn in on the trip and pretty much get on everyone's last nerve, including the audience. They don't even have a purpose in this movie and are quickly shuffled out twenty minutes later after serving their purpose. After pressuring Chevy to break the law and get them all arrested, they all get dragged up before Dan Aykroyd in very heavy (and I do mean VERY HEAVY) prosthetics in a courthouse in the middle of several acres of junkyard surrounded by a moat. While this fat-suit gimmick worked out great for Eddie Murphy in ""The Nutty Professor,"" Aykroyd uses it to become as gross, obnoxious and unappealing as possible. It's just not funny or really integral to the plot. The house and junkyard with its various ""Addams Family"" hidden room aspects are more intriguing, but we never see much of it. John Candy plays the judge's nephew, the only normal person in the judge's family, but Candy also gets stuck playing double-duty as his overweight and homely sister in a role that is both disturbing and uncomfortable for Candy. It's supposedly played for laughs, but it's not funny. The rest of the movie is pretty much about Chevy and Demi trying to escape with Chevy getting trapped into a marriage with the homely fat niece and sent through the aforementioned roller coaster to his death. Luckily, it conks out before truly chewing him up. Unfortunately, he's basically sleepwalking through the scenes and phoning in his dialogue without the energy or personality of Clark Griswold. Demi Moore tries playing her role straight, but it is not hard to see she's completely confused and dismayed by the script that isn't very funny and is actually frequently disturbing. It's basically ""Deliverance"" as a live-action horror cartoon, and it's not really helped by a disconnected musical interlude by a group I'm told calls itself Digital Underground. I'm never heard of them either, but they're the only good thing in this movie even if it gets disturbing to watch two young beautiful ladies rub up against Aykroyd in his fat latex old man costume. If this movie is what we can expect from the unbridled imagination that is Dan Aykroyd, all I can say is Thank-God for Harold Ramis for keeping him restrained enough to create ""Ghostbusters.""",Nothing But Trouble
27,Maziun,Not one bit funny,1,21 June 2014,"Based on Dan Aykroyd's personal experiences. In 1978, he was pulled over for speeding in a rural town in the Northeastern United States. The police officer took him to the local Justice of the Peace in the middle of the night for a trial.It's a sad thing when movie with such comedians as Chevy Chase (""National lampoons vacation"") , Dan Aykroyd (""Blues brothers"") and John Candy (""Planes , trains and automobiles"") doesn't have even one funny thing in it. I like black humor , I love ""The Addams family"" and I consider myself to be quite open minded person. However this terrible movie pretty much killed career for anyone who appeared in it. Yes, it's that bad.I could say that there are some good things in this movie- Demi Moore (""Ghost"") is pretty and the set decoration is nice. However watching this movie is as enjoyable as hitting wall with your head . Wait  Hitting the wall with your head is MORE ENJOYABLE than this I pretty much erased the movie from my memory just to keep my sanity. I don't recommend it to anyone, even to people who like weird kind of humor. There is no humor here people . Unless you think that John Candy dressed as a woman is hilarious.Interesting thing – This is Tupac Shakur's film debut.

I've revisited-it once since watching-it in the theater, and it's still as bad as I remembered.Slightly entertaining sight gags nearly, and I mean NEARLY make it passable.A cast that includes Akroyd, Chase, and Demi Moore drew us in, but I remember the entire audience(at least the one's I heard) being quite disgruntled with this odd and unfunny mess of a movie.I'd pass. 34/100",Nothing But Trouble
29,DarthVoorhees,"Love it or hate it, you'll never be able to forget it.",7,30 April 2021,"'Nothing but Trouble' has enjoyed an infamous reputation as an all-time stinker. I have to disagree because it seems as if this film is able to boil passions so it must be of some worth. It certainly doesn't surprise me that people hate it nor does it surprise me that it has a cult following. 'Nothing but Trouble' is a movie that makes the boldest of choices and I kind of love it.This is a Trojan horse of a movie. The great Dan Aykroyd was able to leverage his reputation to get to make whatever he wanted. Warner expecting another 'Ghostbusters' were treated to something else entirely. Instead of a quirky special effects comedy we got something ugly and twisted. The question becomes do we credit or condemn Aykroyd. I fall somewhere in the middle. 'Nothing But Trouble' advertises it's self as a horror-comedy in the tradition of 'Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein'. I'm sure you would predict walking in that Aykroyd would succeed at the comedy and have trouble with the horror but the opposite is true. Any joy one gets out of 'Nothing But Trouble' will come from embracing it's macabre bizarre qualities and not it's humor.This is a film cast with comedy heavy hitters but it doesn't have a laugh in it. I don't think the talent is wasted though. Chevy Chase, Demi Moore, and John Candy are never tongue in cheek when the film puts our characters in danger. They all play the horror straight. Aykroyd is insanely over the top. He is obviously hamming it up but even this doesn't hurt the film. It's loud in the right way.You would think a horror-comedy not being funny would be a fatal flaw and some may argue that it is. What Aykroyd gets right through is the horror. This is one of the most colorful horror films of its era. It has a personality and visual style that is so striking that it stays with you. Aykroyd spares no expense to bring his twisted imagination to the screen. Tobe Hooper or Wes Craven could never get the resources and money Aykroyd was able to. The setting is a character it's self. The mansion and torture devices are intricate to the last detail. This film is a triumph of set design. It should have been nominated for an Academy Award.'Nothing But Trouble' is anything but bland. If the main goal of a horror film is to disturb then 'Nothing But Trouble' is a resounding success. Who can forget the infamous hot dog scene? Or Bobo and Lil' Debbil? I've read reviews comparing it to a nightmare and yes that is accurate. I can't help but take a little pleasure in the fact that Aykroyd snuck it through.",Nothing But Trouble

32,bregund,Just like a bunch of spiders in a birthday cake,10,24 May 2003,"I love the production values of this film.  The setting is amazing, because the house is surrounded by acres of old junk.  The production design is fascinating, because it is a mixture of various nineteenth- and twentieth-century art, advertising, pop culture, architecture, furniture, machinery, folk art, and household products.  Dan Akroyd, unrecognizable as the elderly Judge Valkenheiser, gives a mesmerizing performance.  My favorite part is when they're eating ""Dutch country heifers"" (hot dogs) and Akroyd says:  ""Here's how I like 'em, and I suggest you eat 'em the same way.""  If ever a movie captured the unpleasant juxtaposition between the normal world and the abnormal world, it would certainly be this one (with the dining scene in Eraserhead coming in a close second:  ""They're new!""). 
The above things are the only good parts of the film, while the rest of it is just plain silly.",Nothing But Trouble
33,frankfob,About as bad as it gets,1,27 January 2003,"Dan Aykroyd supposedly has an affinity, almost a fetish, for collecting bizarre little gadgets and oddities that don't serve any particular purpose other than just to sit there so he and his friends can goof on them. After seeing this movie, I can believe that, because that pretty much describes this movie to a T. ""A good cast wasted"" is an understatement; EVERYTHING is wasted here--time, film, you name it. The paper the script was written on would have served a more useful purpose in wrapping fish--which may well be exactly what happened, because my God does this thing stink. The whole movie is one long Rube Goldberg contraption, except that, unlike Goldberg's gizmos, this isn't amusing, funny, clever, or anything else other than painful. I've often wondered after seeing a particularly headache-inducing piece of cinematic bilge if the people who made it had any idea of how bad it was going to be when they were shooting it. After seeing this, I can't believe that anyone who participated in this atrocity didn't know how bad it was going to be BEFORE they shot it. Maybe they figured, ""Hey, it's Dan Aykroyd, he'll think up something funny."" That's like being told you need brain surgery and that your surgeons are going to be Johnny Knoxville and Tom Green, and figuring, ""Well, that's OK, they'll learn brain surgery before the operation.""The only even remotely amusing bits in this movie belong to John Candy as both a cop and his sister (!), and that's due solely to Candy's ability to make a silk purse out of a sow's droppings.

35,Scott_Mercer,Sigh...,8,3 January 2005,"I just don't get it. I really don't understand how people can claim to appreciate black comedy or horror-based comedy, and still degrade this film. This is quite a well-made horror-comedy with a really great idea at its core. I just fell in love with the whole concept of Valkenvania that Ackroyd created: a diseased, toxic junkyard of a hidden backwater so cut off from modern society that they haven't even heard about the Declaration of Indepence yet, and they're still operating under English common law that pre-dates the Magna Carta (!) (Maybe I just like it because I'm from New Jersey.) That's damn clever, people. Stop whining. The script had a lot of intelligence behind it.How about the horrible decrepit mansion/courthouse/funhouse with all the cool hidden rooms and stuff? How about the carnival ride/abattoir? How about John Candy in a dual role playing his own sister? What about an appearance by Digital Underground where they get stuck at the mansion and PERFORM THE HUMPTY HUMP? COME ON! Great jittery fun, people. If you don't appreciate this film, go back to watching movies with Madonna in them. That's what you deserve.I hope anyone with a brain reading these comments will realize that when they come across a misspelled post stating ""this was worse film ever"" that the person making the post is illiterate and has no credibility at all. If you enjoy Black Comedy (one poster compared this to Monty Python, who do occasionally trade in the humorous aspects of gore and viscera, and I think it's an appropriate comparison) at all, or Horror films, and you haven't seen this film, you shouldn't run away from it. Give it a chance. I believe I've even seen it for sale for about five bucks at the local Megalomart. It's worth five bucks, penguins. Really, it is. I promise.

So much talent in the cast and the talent is allowed to cut loose. Ackroyd's Judge character is one of the funniest performances I have ever seen. Chase and Candy are also amusing. The story involves a group of big city types that take a wrong turn on the way to Atlantic City and end up in a hellish community that time has forgot. However, let's face it, this is a comedy, story is of minor importance. The sole purpose of the story is to create a setting where comedic giants can best apply their trade and that is what happens.

I cannot believe the terrific, rave reviews for this movie. I also saw a number of other awful reviews too, so I guess my thoughts on this film are not alone.""Nothing but trouble"" was awful and sickening. It star Chevy Chase and Demi Moore who decide to go to Atlantic city for the weekend. Two other Spanish colleagues of thiers, but not quite friends, invite themselves againced Cheve's will to tag along last minute. On route, the guy colleague Randy, an arrogant jerk, persuades Cheve to take a shortcut and also to speed. Randy gets pressuring about it. ""Come on man, you have a BMW, act like it!"" Then they drive through a mysterious dusty looking ghost town. While passing through it, Cheve unknowingly runs a stop sign. Cop John Candy sees this and starts pursuing them. When he stops them, he orders them to follow him. They follow him into a very strange and erie area and up to an ancient looking dilapidated creepy old house. Inside the house is even creepier. It's filthy, cluttered, and mothball eaten with bizarre looking gadgets and accessories.Then they meet the judge. From this point onward in the film is nightmarishly horrible. The part of the film leading up to this point was not too good itself, but now the film turned dreadful, disgusting, and scary. But not scary in a good horror movie way. Scary in a sick, vomit inducing, mentally traumatizing way. The judge, played by Dan Aykroyd, is one sick, evil, disgusting thing. He sends many of his ""defendants"" onto a conveyor belt which carries them into a flesh stripping, murderous machine called bonestripper. The machine even shows bones being shot out of it after people were sucked into it. There are other freaky, scary traps in the house too. Then there's the creatures of the house itself. The Judge's nose looks very much like something you really don't want to see on a man's face, and that image itself has giving me nightmares and literally made me vomit, literally! Then the judge can also pull parts of his body off and on again. Then there's these two hideous freak fat creatures that live right outside the house in the dumpyard. Then there's the moat which is literally raw sewage. Then there's the hotdogs the judge forces his guests to eat for dinner. And the hot dogs are made of, well I'll just say too words. Bonestripper.

46,Ziglet_mir,Because I had trouble going to sleep last night feeling the most unsettled I've been in a very long time.,9,18 March 2017,"The majority of reviewers and people are wrong on this one by several miles.Talk about a fever dream. Or if David Lynch made his own wacky version of Beetlejuice meets Planes, Trains and Automobiles meets Deliverance. Sure, there were funny moments from a film that has nothing but comedians in it, however, there are moments that take what is bizarre and goes seven steps further. I think all of us have heard and seen of horror turning into comedy, but in my experience it has been very rare to find comedy turn into horror... and done excellently. I understand why so many people don't like it, and apparently Siskel hated it too, but this isn't a poorly made film. Dan Aykroyd proves he has some directing chops by creating a goofy yet horrifying landscape in the Pennsylvannian/NJ/NY back roads. We always choose to judge a movie by how good it makes us feel, while we think we are in for a comedy here with Nothing But Trouble we are deeply mistaken, and I think plenty of people rate this film so low because they expected much differently. People who hate this movie I can guarantee feel the same way I do now after watching it. They feel uncomfortable; unsure of what they just watched and can't get the disturbing images of some of the characters out of their heads (shout out to you Bobo and Lil' Dubbel). It's like being in a world you wish never existed; like I said before a nightmarish fever dream that continually gets more surreal as the movie goes on.Chevy Chase proves to be a fantastic straight man in an absurd world. Aykroyd and my man John Candy pulling in double duty for the most terrifying roles in what must be ages, because let's face it, I never thought I'd be saying either of those two would play anything terrifying. Aykroyd takes control of the screen as does Candy when scenes call for their presence. Demi Moore is solid as Chase's romance interest, and Taylor Negron (very over the top) is great in his small role.If you love dark comedies or even slightly enjoy them, this is for you but as many people on the handful of reviews I've already seen have said: this makes ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Deathtrap"" and ""Heathers"" seem like Peewee's Playhouse. The only other dark comedy that has made me feel even this closely unsettled is ""Very Bad Things"" (1998). The last film in general that has affected me anywhere close to this unsettled was probably ""Come and See"" (1985), but this my friends, this film takes the cake.Another comment I read off of YouTUbe which summed this film up completely was: ""I used to think Stephen King was out of his mind, but Aykroyd just speedballed him.""This movie gets a high rating from me, near shy of a perfect score for an amazing cast, getting something I was completely not asking for (in the best way), and having so many lucid feelings after watching something I thought people had pinned correctly as cinematic garbage.",Nothing But Trouble
47,npjy83,Awful,2,25 July 2019,"I only gave it an extra star because of the cast. The film is awful and storyline is embarrassing. Unrealistic and pointless.

48,Film Dog,Proving critics aren't always right.,9,5 April 1999,"Critics hated it, I loved it.  A really offbeat film which takes place in the New Jersey waste belt.

49,IndridC0ld,A cult classic on dope!,10,19 January 2015,"How this movie became known as a quintessential flop is quite beyond me. Then again, when I consider some of the movies that have garnered ""best picture"" Academy Awards, the whole flawed process of rating movies becomes clear. There is simply no accounting for taste. For example, consider that, the overlong, pretentious, and painfully boring, Chariots of Fire, actually WON the Best Picture award, and yet all the film gave me (and MANY others) was a bad headache. To each his own.So, on to my review. I never saw this picture when it debut in 1991, but I clearly recall watching its HBO premiere. I found it to be one of the finest examples of really dark comedy that I had ever seen. The wonderful serendipitous circumstances which allowed Mr. Ackroyd to secure the services of top notch talent like Moore and Chase only served to make the movie seem all the more ""believable"" and satisfying. I'm sure that all of the headliner performers felt like their agents had consigned them to apply their considerable talents to, what can only be described as, the ""circle of hell"" that Dante might have envisioned for the bloated egos of self-aggrandizing film stars. The look on Chase's face when he imagines the judge's nose transformed into a penis is so authentic that I was convulsed with laughter. And who can forget that priceless card game between Demi Moore and the delightful ""Little Devil and BoBo."" Surely Ms. Moore has experienced similar feelings while surrounded by adoring male fans queuing up to the very edge of Hollywood's famed red carpet.What makes this film even more of a gem is that we, as the audience, KNOW that this was probably not what the actors believed that they had signed up for. It plays as humorously as if, say, Lawrence Olivier had been contracted to star as ""Mr. Hand"" in Fast Times At Ridgemont High. To their credit, all of the actors are in fine form, and do deliver their very best to the insane plot and dialog. And that, in a nutshell, is why this film belongs on any film buff's ""must see"" list. It's not ""Hamlet,"" but it delivers solid (if extremely dark) comedic entertainment.",Nothing But Trouble
50,varminttank,Cult classic masterpiece,10,22 March 2020,"When I was a kid this was a movie I watched a bunch of times.. now as an adult I watched it again and remember why I liked it so much.. if you like old school Actors. Chevy Chase,John candy,Dan Aykroyd Demi Moore.. well should I say anything else this movie is very weirdly entertaining",Nothing But Trouble
51,spencer-w-hensley,Not for all tastes and unfairly underrated,6,15 April 2021,"The only film directed by Dan Aykroyd to date is this very dark, strange and completely misunderstood and underrated comedy.I think the reason for its poor reception is comparing this to all of the other movies the cast had done to that point.Chevy Chase the films main star made many good films such as Caddyshack, the Vacation series, Fletch and Funny Farm.Aykroyd of course was huge off the success of both Ghostbusters pictures, John Candy had done Planes, Trains and Automobiles, Uncle Buck and even had a cameo in Home Alone the highest grossing comedy of all time at that point.And then of course Demi Moore had just finished Ghost which was a huge smash hit so it would only be fair to expect with this cast and Aykroyd directing that this would be a film of similar quality.The thing is many dont understand that as a screenwriter Aykroyd has been known to have very far-fetched ideas to which many directors have to say they cannot be filmed.He apparently directed this movie after his buddies John Hughes and John Landis turned it down even though he didnt want to he knew it was necessary to get the film made.Aykroyd's direction I feel is the main reason people misunderstand this movie. Keep in mind he also wrote this movie and played two large roles requiring heavy amounts of makeup. He also took every suggestion to heart from the cast and crew which resulted in some strangeness to say the least.At one point he had monitors for his actors to view their performances and allowed them to make changes they saw fit and that is where I think the performances look different from any of the main casts other films.Chase looks bored out of his mind as if he thinks the movie sucks and just wants a paycheck. We know he can show range when he wants to (Funny Farm is a great example of this.)Aykroyd gives the best performance in the movie as the Reeve and provides some laughs.Candy looks like he just wants to do his best for his buddy Aykroyd but in his role as Dennis the police officer he seems depressed and is really the only voice of reason. He also is in drag as Aykroyd's granddaughter who has affection for Chase. This performance is actually pretty funny.Moore comes across extremely ambitious. Like Chase it seems she is aware that this movie is not the best fit for her talent but nonetheless she does her very best to work with the material she has and does well with it.In order for this movie to be enjoyed you have to forget that this talented cast made better movies before and in the case of Moore especially since and just enjoy it as a pretty crappy movie that's actually fun because it is so bad.That's why I like this movie. It truly is the definition of a so bad it's fun movie. I think Aykroyd as director felt there would be an audience out there that would appreciate this movie as such.This is not Vacation, Ghostbusters, Planes, Trains and Automobiles or Ghost.It's a funny quirky movie that is a lot of fun just for being so weird.Go into it with that expectation and you should have some fun.It's the kind of movie I like to watch on a bad day and have some laughs from its sheer quirkiness.",Nothing But Trouble
52,Herbest8,A bizarre masterpiece,10,15 May 2009,"In this truly bizarre film, Chevy Chase stars as Chris Thorne who takes a wrong turn off of the New Jersey turnpike and winds up in a hellhole town lorded over by a psychotic and sadistic judge played to perfection by Dan Aykroyd.This is just a weird film. You have some of the most jaw dropping visuals ever put to film, truly imaginative characters and one hell of great song by Digital Underground (look fast for Tupac Shakur). Although it takes it's time getting started, once it does it never lets up. When you come to the last scene, you will be rolling around on the floor laughing.If nothing else, the movie comes close to showing us what the original version of ""Ghostbusters"" would have been like. You have Chevy Chase (offered to play Egon) John Candy (offered to play Louis Tully) and Dan Aykroyd (Ray Stantz) all playing major roles. You even have Brian Doyle-Murray popping up in cameo. Come to think of it, this is ""Ghostbusters"" crossed with ""Beetle Juice.""Bottom line, this movie is a masterpiece of the macabre. OK, it's not in the same league as ""Gone with the Wind"" or ""The Wizard of Oz"" but for a bizarre, weird and flat-out laugh riot this movie stands tall.",Nothing But Trouble

54,DMP-2,This a great film,9,2 December 2000,"I will admit that movie is not very funny, even though it's supposed to be a comedy. Its actually a great Adventure-Suspense film. When you watch it you gotta focus on the story its pretty dreary, forgot that is labeled as a comedy, because in truth it's not. It's plot is almost identical to House of A Thousand Corpses without all the gore.Dan Aykroyd also gives in my opinion the best performance of his career as Judge J.P. Valkenheiser, he also does an ample performance of Bobo Valkenheiser. Chevy Chase was excellently cast for this film, probably his best film since Fletch! (1984) (although I've only seen him in National Lampoon's Vacation Series (1983-1997), Fletch! (1984), and Man Of The House (1995)",Nothing But Trouble
55,Theshapeshifter,"""You're going to make me swim through toxics!""",9,3 January 2006,"When I remembered this movie some time ago, I remembered that it was a grim comedy with very little sensible humor. The thought of a senile old man who had a weird-looking nose and who put traffic violators to death seemed very sadistic and too maddened for my taste. Even more so was the concept of a pair of distended children who were six-some-odd feet tall and who were riddled with body hair!All that changed subsequently after I had watched it again. When I watched it a second time, it seemed massively funny, and it had a morbid, but hilarious sense of humor. For instance, the performance-slash-cameo appearance of Digital Underground performing alongside with a keyboard-riffing Dan Aykroyd or the scene with the demented dinner from the tenth level of hell was too funny not to miss!The plot is patchy, but still is good. After a mishap occurs, four city slickers end up in a forgotten town under the heinous rule of an old-as-dirt judge with a sadistic sense of justice. The four city folk must escape the deranged old judge soon...or perish.Finally, to all the people who thought that this film was gross and misanthropic, I must concur, but with a very large and humored grin on my face!",Nothing But Trouble

I watched this movie on cable, waiting for it to pay off in some way. I mean, it HAD to get better - no one would intentionally make a movie this thoroughly unredeemable. In the end, I felt like I needed a long hot shower. It's been years, but it still hasn't washed off yet. The title has become a word used to mean ""the very standard of badness"" in any topic with friends familiar with the film. An irony: This movie would fit right into a segment of Leonard Pinth Garnell's ""Bad Cinema."" Those familiar with SNL know of what I speak.Some may very well like it. To them I say enjoy yourselves, but please do not actually recommend the film to anyone. You'll just cause further pain and lose considerable respect from your peers.",Nothing But Trouble
57,nvjs,"A strange hybrid of ""Twilight Zone"", ""Wizard of Oz"", and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""",7,5 July 2012,"I firmly believe what hurt this movie, was what Dan and Peter Aykroyd thought was funny. The humor is my kind of humor, dark, a bit macabre and a bit of gross-out humor. It simply was too strange to appeal to a wide audience. Supposedly the whole ""plot"" of being pulled over for speeding happened to Aykroyd in the late 70's in New England and he thought it was funny enough to warrant a comedy feature. Well, it didn't work out so well. It might have fared better as a scene in another movie entirely. I thought the scene where they drive through the back country to coal mines and junkyards was a bit eerie since it reminded me of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". And I don't believe it was intended to be creepy! The idea of a 100+ year old running a backwoods courtroom with absolute power in his own fiefdom does make for a good backdrop. In the horror genre! Why I like about this film is that Aykroyd reminds me of so many old timers who're vets of law enforcement and as such it hits close to home for me. Additionally,the archaic metaphorical anecdotes are so un-intelligible and odd, you can't help but laugh at the JP's posturing and conviction of it all. Daniel Baldwin's bit gives another comedic attempt, the outcome is almost not funny had it not been so light-hearted. This is why I think it failed. No one knew quite what to make of it. Too strange and surreal to be funny and too light-hearted and senseless to be a horror. If this were a spoof of say... Judge Ed Koch, it might've worked.Essentially, if you enjoy it, you might feel guilty for doing so.",Nothing But Trouble

Certainly some imagination at work here! A truly horrifying world is created, and a nightmare world it is. The film has a sense of style, and in its odd way is true to itself. The realization of a vision.That aside, I fear the acting job is by and large perfunctory. Ms. Moore and Mr. Chase are rather puffed up with their egos, and deliver throw-away performances.

The perfect premise for a disturbing slasher flick in a demented carnival of horror.But...this effed up situation is ruined by slapstick, bawdy humor, and Chevy Chase's irritatingly dry, caustic snark that just makes you want to smack him.The two genres are not mixed effectively, and the entire movie comes across as disjointed, bizarre, and just not that well done. The different comedic styles of Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, and John Candy do not meld with each other, let alone the horror situation, and none of the actors have chemistry together.It certainly is the only movie really like it, and may be worth watching based on the strange factor alone.

None of the actors and jokes that they uttered were funny in the slightest and it was too bizarre to be called tastefully artsy. The two obese baby-like men were the worst. They were simply unnecessary, not to mention too disgusting-looking to watch. Dan Akroyd usually writes some pretty funny stuff, but this was a failure for him. I swear, I can't remember one funny joke. I never thought Chevy Chase was that funny and he certainly isn't in this stinker of movie. I felt like Demi Moore was simply THERE: a pretty mannequin who never says anything worth listening to. In fact, the entire ensemble felt like props. It was a movie that proved Chevy Chase, John Candy, and Dan Akroyd's careers were failing. Also, the part where the really old man eats the grotesque and so-horrible-it's-inedible hot dog left me feeling sick for days. It still makes me feel sick when I think about it.

65,Machiavelli84,It is what it is,5,14 May 2017,"When we look for pieces of nostalgia from our childhood and rewatch them as adults, reactions can vary. I've found some movies from my childhood are EVEN MORE enjoyable in adulthood (for example, ""The Last Unicorn""). I've found other films, while the flaws are a bit more obvious, are still a lot of fun to watch (for example, ""Little Monsters""). Other movies... well, come out a tad bit disappointing. This was one of them. I remembered watching it with my parents as a kid. A lot of the goofiness was amusing to me, and the peculiar aspects of the film struck a chord with my childlike mind. This was different when viewing it as an adult.This film received a lot of criticism when it was released, and to be perfectly honestly, a lot of it wasn't undeserved. The plot feels rushed, and comes across like it's just trying to get an excuse to move the characters to Valkenvania as soon as possible so that the weirdness can begin. With the sets (including the infamous bonestripper) and bizarre characters (including Dan Akroyd in another role as an overgrown baby), this movie is trying REALLY hard to up the surreal factor. I can see why it appealed to me as a kid; in fact, one might argue the movie comes across like it's trying to be a Rust Belt version of ""Labryinth."" The problem is a lot of times the film's humor relies on the weirdness, and the jokes can range from moderately funny to flat. (Strangely enough, most of the laughter for me came from the scenes with Fausto and Renalda, especially that ""Flipper's dead?!"" line.) Some parts of the movie also don't make any sense - for example, if law enforcement is behind the judge, why send literally A HUGE AMOUNT OF STATE TROOPERS out to Valkenvania just to prove this?That being said, is this the WORST movie ever? Not at all, and in that respect I think some film critics (eg., Roger Ebert) were WAY too harsh on it. All of the actors do a decent job in their role: Chevy Chase plays the usual snarky character he was often doing in the 80's and early 90's, and of course John Candy is great in any role he's in. Yeah, it feels like they could have fleshed out the world of Valkenvania just a bit more rather than hop from one weirdness to the next, but what you see is still interesting. It's a pity Dan Akroyd didn't go on to do any other, more refined personal projects.So no, I wasn't as amused by this as I was when I was a kid, but I wasn't bored either. It's worth at least a one time viewing.",Nothing But Trouble

67,magus-4,Brilliant absurd dark comedy adventure.,9,11 March 2007,"I first saw this movie about ten years ago and has haunted my mind since then. Was happy to have found the DVD yesterday. Watched it again and was equally amazed by the huge amount of over the top details and twists. I remember watching it, not knowing what I was looking. missed the first ten minutes I think. So it was only until after the end I was enlightened about Dan Aykroyd playing both the judge and one of his creepy grandsons. That discovery only added to my delight about this movie. Because it was yet another surprise. And this film is full of twists and surprises. It keeps getting wackier and wackier. Every time you think you got everything down something happens that you couldn't have imagined. It gets gross, it gets creepy and definitely uncomfortable, it gets absurd. --SMALL SPOILER-- For example The party that has been arrested is offered a dinner (this sounds nicer than it actually is). First they serve grey looking big sausages. Then the middle of the table changes into a model train track and you can't believe they actually made that. Then the train starts to run by with all kind of sauces like ketchup, mustard etc. The judge, who looks really awful, demonstrates in a very distasteful way how to add ketchup to your sausage. It makes you feel nauseous. And just when you think you've had it, there is a shot of Chevy Chase looking at the judge's nose and he sees the glans of a penis. --END OF SPOILER-- Maybe I have a strange sense of humor or enjoy movies for a different reason than most people, but I really liked the creativity, the attention to detail, the surprises, the over the top story, and the nice finale. The set designers must have had a vivid fantasy because there are some set pieces that are truly incredible (all kinds of gadgets, but also the exterior of the judge's house). I think Dan Aykroyd is brilliant as the judge. I would say all other parts are supporting roles. I would put this movie in the same category as Shaun of the Dead. A kind of horror-comedy-adventure. Although I think Shaun of the Dead includes more belly laughs. And the comedy in Nothing but Trouble is more dark. If you're looking for a National Lampoon kind of comedy, skip this movie.

75,Arsenic Drone,I am horribly sorry I ever saw this movie.,1,21 March 2002,"I watched this movie on TV at least five years ago, probably more.  What a mistake.  I still remember how terrible it made me feel.Recently I remembered seeing a movie that made me feel like crap for the rest of the day, so I looked around for it.  I couldn't even remember who was in it quite right (I looked through almost all of Steve Martin's movies before finding he wasn't in it - I was thinking of Chevy Chase's character), but I knew John Candy had some kind of really screwed up role.  In fact, he had two, one of whom was a revolting, odd woman who Chevy Chase is condemned to marry.  I looked through a bunch of Candy's movies and... aha!  Here it is.  Now I can tell you not to see this movie, assuming you don't enjoy feelings of intense misery.The actual details of the plot are hazy in my memory, and really they aren't important in what I have to tell you.  A quick summary will do.  Basically Chevy Chase and Demi Moore get arrested by Dan Aykroyd (who's a cop and a judge and a bunch of other things, I think) in the middle of nowhere, and they're taken to Hell on Earth.  Aykroyd makes them stay in his demented house, which is designed to make being alive as unenjoyable as possible, just like this movie.  He tries to absorb them into his family, and basically makes it so they don't have a normal waking moment where their surroundings let them be themselves.  Chase and Moore pretty much spend the movie trying to escape, roaming through what looks like either a wasteland or a house from a surrealist film (except that it's set in rural America), being beaten down the whole time.Perhaps it started when I saw this movie, perhaps not, but the thought of being trapped in a place with no contact with the outside world, and only a few unbearable people to live with, really scares me now.  After watching this movie I had a braindead feeling.  Maybe you know what I am talking about.  If you watch the movie you will learn.  It's a sort of fuzzy, unhappy feeling, where your mind just goes blank and the world seems like a terrible place to live.  It felt kind of like the time I had a bad case of the flu, when I could only barely tell what was going on, and my hands felt prickly for hours.  Except that the flu gave me something to measure sickly feelings against, and this movie only serves to numb my mind once again every time I recall it.Not only would I not recommend seeing this movie, I would advise that you don't see it.

With a cast like this, how could this movie possible be bad? If you haven't seen it, there's probably a good reason.Without going into an attempted plot analysis, because the actual plot of the movie is a few people trying to escape a crazy junkyard/bunker/haunted house while attempted ""dark humor"" and a few slapstick gags are supposed to be enough to make up for the lack of a back story. To sum it up, you see Dan Aykroyd in some horrible makeup that makes him look like old and disgusting. Without warning there are two fat guys in slimy fat suits who, according to the movie, were kicked out of high school for being too fat. But for some reason they run around in underwear and talk like babies. It might sound funny when reading the description, but it isn'tat all.Then you have John Candy in drag for no reason except to waste a few minutes with the usual ugly-cross-dressing-man who make comedic passes at one of the stars. While they try to distract you with this, the movie tries to force a ""spark"" between Demi Moore and Chevy Chase which never works at all and also has no back story to make these character slightly real.Most of the way through the movie you feel dirty and ashamed that you're watching such a bad movie. But there is a silver lining: Digital Underground.Completely out of nowhere, Digital Underground shows up at this deserted fortress thing that is supposedly within about 45 minutes of New York City, yet is down some deserted dirt road miles outside of a very small town—this road at one point was described as being parallel with the interstate, yet people get lost there all the time. Furthermore, one part of the movie reveals that all these famous missing people were killed in this crazy junkyard/madhouse. The even find Jimmy Hoffa's ID. So this middle of the nowhere place somehow manages to secretly arrest and/or kill hundreds, if not thousands of people over the years, but no one ever noticed? But luckily, Digital Underground shows up in the courthouse. They say they are musicians, and Dan Aykroyd, as the insane old judge, tells them to play for him. Now this movie turns into a short music video for Humpty Hump and Tupac. They do a nice performance, despite the fact that at one point Ayrkoyd's character is playing some kind of old organ for a solo. The sheer randomness of this music video, along with the complete horribleness of the movie somehow wormed its way into my brain until I decided this movie is awesome and worthy of encouraging other people to watch.DISCLAIMER: If you watch this movie, do not blame me for the time you wasted.

A dream that you retain a slight nauseous feeling from; like you vaguely remember your sister being naked in it or something.Alone, NBT could be seen as some brilliantly avant-garde misfire. But when placed in context with The Burbs, Beetlejuice, Gremlins and Ghostbusters, you can see what they were going for; a popcorn comedy with horror elements, nothing more.It's hard to believe the studio didn't shut this down during production. I would assume that Aykroyd repeated again and again that Ghostbusters looked like a train-wreck on paper but was a smash.NBT shares some Jungian thematic elements with The People Under the Stairs and Flowers in the Attic, all films about inescapable labyrinthine houses and villains with perverse and mostly unknown motives. The sanitized, focus grouped, cookie cutter Hollywood we have today is a result of insane projects like this, and an effort to not repeat them.As Roger Ebert used to say, it takes a talented filmmaker to make a truly bad film.

If you like the three movies mentioned in the summary, you will probably like this movie. This is Dan Aykroyd's baby, written, directed, and starring. Aykroyd's characterization of the ""Shire Reeve"" (origin of the word Sheriff) totally makes the movie, as does Mr. Bonestripper, souped-up police cars, and John Candy playing against type as the nice-but-tough Chief Constable. Some really amazing sets here, pre-CGI. In my opinion this movie has only two weaknesses: 1. It's a little slow getting started with a protracted dinner party prologue, and 2. The two giant mutant baby grandchildren that live out in the junkyard are just too cartoonish, and not funny at all. But the rest of the movie is great, well worth your while.

It seems so much shorter to me than it's actual playing time. Playing time is what it's all about. This hilarious, Gothic comedy is a non stop ride of action and sight gags. The dialog is pertinent to the story, well spoken and never lost under an onslaught of music or special effects. Speaking of music, The Digital Underground segment is inspired, showing that cultures can coexist in the spirit of fun. The cast is entertaining to watch. Chevy Chase playing it straight, proving he can really act. Demi Moore as lovely and accomplished as ever. The late John Candy believable as a man caught in the family trap, and hilarious as his sister. Dan Aykroyd taking hours to get into make-up, at a point in his career where he obviously did not need to resort to such masochism to prove his worth or talent. The story has many surprises the first couple of times through. It does not seem like a rewarmed version of anything else. It comes off as fresh and inspired. The set is as original as anything I've seen. I love the gadgets, the props dept. kept it believable. I find this movie worth watching a couple of times a year, but no more often than that, laughs work best if they take you by surprise.

It certainly does not belong there, with some of the most fabulous sets and set pieces I've ever seen in any movie, and truly greatest ensemble slap-stick choreography this side of the Hal Roach Studios.

As a fan of black, twisted comedy, I actually enjoyed this bent, twisted film.It is true this isn't the type of stupid, slapstick juvenile humor that many people were expecting from this group of actors. It isn't a laugh-out-loud ""ha ha"" kind of film. The humor comes in strange juxtapositions, irony, satire, and the type of grossness associated with any horror film (e.g. dead bodies, bones, creepy houses, cannibals, etc.). I thought overall the film was amusing, with some very funny, yet also some very uncomfortable, moments (as in any black comedy). The dinner party with the condiment train, and the Brazillionaires swimming the toxic river that ""smells like Sao Paulo"" made me laugh, and I enjoyed trying to figure out all the junk in the house (a very cluttered mise-en-scene, indeed).The film struck me as a bizarre cross between a demented ""Alice in Wonderland/Through the Looking Glass"" and ""The Addams Family"" (esp. the original New Yorker cartoons, far more disturbing than the films), along with some ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" thrown in (as well as any other film with psychotic, mutant families in a rural area who capture people and subject them to torture, such as the original ""The Hills Have Eyes""). I would agree it has some of the sensibility of Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" series; it also reminded me at times of the old midnight movies we used to see when I was younger (especially ""Eraserhead,"" ""A Boy and His Dog,"" ""The Corpse Grinders""--a truly bad movie by the way--and ""Pink Flamingos"").Those who think I am stretching on the Alice connection should consider that basically the characters go into the rabbit hole (or through the looking glass) into a strange alternative, topsy-turvy world based on a 16th century charter (hence the ""shire reeve""), with its own ""Tweedledum"" and ""Tweedledee"" (the arguing twins Diane finds outside the house). As in Wonderland, this world operates according to its own medieval logic, where those who are deemed evil (including bankers), take a ride on the death-bringing ""Bonestripper"" amusement-ride-from-hell, while others are somewhat arbitrarily released if they amuse the judge. It has a twist you can spot a mile away (that's part of the fun, actually), and an ending clearly alluding to Looney Tunes cartoons.I think those who really disliked this film or were disappointed in it probably didn't ""get it""; maybe some of those responding here were just too young when they saw it (I can see where it might give someone nightmares, despite its low blood-and-gore factor). In my view, those who marked it as ""the worst"" must not have seen a huge number of films, as this certainly isn't the worst film ever made by far (Both ""Ator"" films come to mind, as well as ""Manos, the Hands of Fate""). I could name about 100 other films, just from the U.S., that qualify as true turkeys, far more horrid, or dull, than this film, but for the sake of space, I won't.

Instead what I realized is that I had just wasted a good portion of my life watching it, and that it truly was an incomprehensible pile of crap. And I don't think that it was just because ""I didn't GET it.""To each his own, but dang this was just wicked bloody awful. Not funny and very disturbing (and not in that fun ""After Hours"" disturbing way).Really. Just a bad movie.

112,mplath5,Maybe 10 Years Ahead Of It's Time?,8,10 December 2006,"It has Demi, Chevy, John Candy, Dan Ackroyd and a Beamer in it. Who wouldn't be jealous? No wonder it was nominated for almost all the 'Razzie' awards. JollyWood and most of the critics weren't ready for a movie like this in 1991. Taylor Negron & Bertila Damas were excellent & funny in this also. The negative critics can just go watch it again and again until they bring themselves up to speed. (Maybe it was Dan's nose?) The picture gets off to a slow start and Demi may have had to do her best in a genuinely tacky role, but once they get to Vulcanvania it starts to get real funny. Digital Underground (w/Tupac & Shock G) are hilarious trying to hold it together when they first see Ackroyd as the judge, as well as the crew Daniel Baldwin was with. I really enjoy the bizarre and humorous. As an added factor the Rube Goldberg type mechanizations were an absolute hoot.

This movie was a bomb at the box office probably due to the dark and creepy undertone ever present in the file. A car full of NYC socialites are on a road trip when they are pretty unjustly imprisoned in a creepy mansion surrounded by mounds and mounds of junk that were once the property of all the perpetrators (perhaps innocents) that came before. Chevy Chase has a sarcastic humor similar to roles you've seen him play in the past. Demi Moore proves she can play comedy. John Candy's character is jaded in this film so he does not bear the warmth you're used to. Aykroyd is brilliant as the Village Reeve (evil judge). This movie was written and directed by him. With haunted mansion-esque trap doors, slides, and secret passages; you will be entertained and kind of creeped out. The roller coaster is the best, though. Check it out.",Nothing But Trouble

In my opinion, this movie wins the worst movie with the best cast award. Chevy Chase? Dan Aykroyd? John Candy? and Demi Moore? We have all come to expect a lot more out of these guys, and I was more than disappointed here.The story was basic, but it was pretty original, and the concept is actually pretty funny. But the delivery and the jokes just couldn't cut it. I sat there half the time wondering why there were so many strange and weird characters throughout the whole thing. Of course you can go overboard in movies, but when you do, it should at least make sense.Over all, incredibly disappointing, especially from such a talented group.",Nothing But Trouble

This review is for Nothing But Trouble - and underrated gem of a movie that came out into the early 90's.Apparently loosely based on a true story, the movie stars Dan Akyroyd (it's also directed by him as well), Chevy Chase, Demi Moore and the always great and (it pains me to say this) late John Candy.Chevy Chase and Demi Moore play a couple who end up in the town of Valkanvania after having a run in with the police, and the end up at the judge's house where they meet the crazy J.P Valkanheiser and Bobo and Lil Debul as well as the police cop's sister Eldona (also played by John Candy).The judges house is filled with all sorts of kooky mechanical devices, and all sorts of hijinks insue in this.A lot of critics tend to bash this one on the grounds of it's plot, but it's supposed to be weird because it's a black comedy and it doesn't have to make sense for you to enjoy it.I heavily recommend watching this movie.",Nothing But Trouble

I couldn't wait to walk out of Gosford Park, and it got 4 stars, nominations etc. I do think I am a pretty harsh critic of a movie, and I liked NBT. I thought it was funny, and have it on DVD and watched it over a few times, and still get laughs. I thought it was original, had good one liners, and I would never have known that was Ackroyd in that makeup. Chase, Candy, and Negron at at their best. I found out where they buried Flipper, and was entertained for most of the duration. Look for a young Tupac wearing a Yankees jersey. Humpty-hump was funny, and I am certainly not a rap fan. Its not an 8 star movie, but its certainly better than a 3.7. Check it out for yourself, when your in the right mood.",Nothing But Trouble

He kills more people then Texas chainsaw massacre in this movie. But it's so funny you don't even realize he's a killer but he does only kill bad people in a way. In all such a fun movie and Chevy chase has the best one liners. They got the best comedians for this movie. The late and great John Candy dosnt only play one good charecter but 2.

""WTH was all that about LOL !"" And you and that person are like in a cult following...then go on your own way. I happened upon it when John Candy died. I made it a point to view all of his movies. He plays two characters in this movie. I can say one thing, it was very original, and doubtful anything like it will be made again.

Here Chase and Moore get into nothing but trouble(thus the title) when they get a speeding ticket and are taken to Judge Alvin Valkenheiser's house, which isn't your typical house.

Family tries to make them into sausage. There's the movie. I have no idea what the actors were thinking - this isn't a comedy, it's a crappy remake of Motel Hell (which itself is a bad movie anyhow).

I will probably end up watching it again to make sure, but then a week later I'll be wondering again.As evidenced by many comments and my own personal experience, this film obviously has some strong hypnotic power that infests the viewer's mind. Maybe the Aykroyds have a plan, like for world domination via secret message implantation in our minds.

129,tnt80808,Nothing but flak,8,22 June 2010,"This movie gets a lot of flak and yes it is silly, nonsense even, but you have to remember this is an 80's style ""screwball"" black comedy. If you were expecting deep story lines and involved, fully developed characters then you clearly didn't read the title let alone the back of the box! And another thing about this movie....comedy is not entirely the word that best describes it. 'Nothing but trouble' is pretty damn scary when you really think about! The whole family are psychopathic, the setting is like a twisted fairground from hell and the sense of isolation is actually quite uncomfortable. As for the ending, and maybe this is just me, but I think this has one of the creepiest endings of a film from it's time. The end is far scarier than most of the laughable ""horrors"" from the late 80's early 90's.I recommend you give this movie a chance, especially if you grew up through the 80's (younger audiences probably won't get the 80's kitsch style) Just don't expect anything other than tasteless madness. bear in mind this is a movie that has a pickle-firing train (yes you heard me right) and a judge with a nose that looks suspiciously like the business end of a mans baby maker!

The last scene with Chevy Chase on the couch gave me chills, I actually felt embarrassed for him. How could so many talented people make something so talentless? The make-up is horrible. There are NO jokes in the movie. How can a comedy have no jokes? If there was a refund counter to get that 90 minutes of my life back, I would demand it and ask for interest.

131,flickmanic,"Laying the Foundation for ""It Came From Hollywood - 2""",3,14 December 2006,"It's interesting to read so many comments about this film which start off something like, ""ok, it's not a classic"" or ""not Oscar material,"" etc., then go on to praise it in a backhanded fashion. I admire Dan Ackroyd's work and think this film had a great premise and promising cast, although Demi Moore's character just seemed around for the ride. Reading between the lines, most preceding reviews seem to reflect disappointment that it didn't achieve its potential. In retrospect, Nothing But Trouble would seem to work better as a dark comedy, akin to the original ""The Ladykillers"" or ""Dr. Strangelove."" It ends up like a series of loosely connected skits with which Ackroyd can't decide whether to go for horror or humor; trying to both effectively seems beyond him (perhaps beyond anyone using this material). The violence and grim surroundings juxtaposed with goofy characters and garish colors all add up to a mess. Perhaps a result of too many components. Actually, it might have worked better as a long-running half-hour sitcom. Good thing there's cable and DVD's. Perhaps the cornerstone of a sequel to ""It Came from Hollywood!"" Now that would add irony!!",Nothing But Trouble

It was airing on Encore and decided to tape it, however I was a bit hesitant to do so. Looking at the reviews to the film by critics and other non-professional viewers I almost decided to take the film off of my list for good.It all changed after I saw it.I have to admit that this movie is no Gone With the Wind. It isn't a movie that will be adored through the ages and will stand the test of time. It took me a little while to get it. The movie is a black comedy without comedy in it. The comedy comes from the entire situation. Chase and Moore are put into this situation that is so surreal. That's the beauty of it. The Aykroyds are two extremely creative people and no other person could have possibly come up with a story of this magnitude. The sets are amazing, the makeup is great, and the script is original and creative. 7/10",Nothing But Trouble
133,jwhouk,Bad bad bad bad bad,1,11 October 2005,"Oh my oh my, where to start? This thing was more disjointed than a yoga instructor's convention in Fort Lauderdale.It isn't exactly a comedy, because of the near ""Deliverance""-like attitude of the ""Judge"" (played by Akroyd in a rubber suit reminiscent of Jabba the Hut), but it isn't a horror flick because (unfortunately) no one dies. It fails on both ends.About halfway through, you swear that Akroyd dragged Candy, Chase and Moore into this because they thought it would be ""a feel-good movie"". Truth is, it is painfully obvious to the viewer that whoever wrote the screenplay didn't actually finish it.The bathroom humor and just plain grossness of Akroyd's character is too much, and the combination of Chase and Moore just does not work here. Candy comes off too smarmy, and having him play his ""sister"" in this thing is ridiculous. And Demi, playing cards with two ultra-repulsive ""children"" of the ""Judge"" character... the phrase, ""biggest waste of talent since Tom Hanks in Bosom Buddies"" comes to mind.

134,drewrhutchinson,A mind is a terrible thing to waste on this one if you watch it,1,18 April 2011,"This is Dan Aykroyd and John candy 4th movie together. First they were in 1941, then Blues Brother which happened to be one of my favorite and I give that one a 10 star rating, then The Great outdoors and then this. Chevy Chase play a guy named Chis who happened to be a very nice guy who one night while waiting outside of a New Jersy hotel and meets a very nice and pretty girl played by Demi Moore. They meet up, have a very nice and classy dinner and go and have a relaxing time in his room. The next morning the both decide to take a nice trip and also take along 2 yuppy couples who are also a bunch of wyners. The 4 of them leave the hotel and end up getting on the The turn pike to New Jersey and the next thing you know they end up taking a wrong turn and end up in this tiny creepy dry ghost town call Valkrey. Think of this as National Lampoons Vacation meets Beetlejuice. After they enter the town.They get pulled over by a police officer named Dennis played by John Candy. In 1991 John Candy play a cop in 2 movies. This and Only the loney which was way better then this. So officer Dennis decides to take the 4 of them to a creepy haunted mansion and they meet this like 180 year old judge named Alvin who is also a very creepy guy and if you didn't know that his nose is supposed to look like a human penis. He decides to sentence the 4 of them to spends theirs lives in the basement of the mansion. Everything in this movie is weird, disgusting and has no point of view. The rest of this movie about trying to escape which you should be doing from watching this movie. Candy also play Dennis overweight sister who does not talk in this movie. akyrod also plays this big fat baby named Humpy who is knda like Baby Huey.Food for thought: I happened to have a very good taste in movies.

Let's face it, Chevy Chase or Demi Moore are enough to kill a movie on their own, I assumed that pairing the two of them up would result in something than man was not meant to sit through.  After winning a free video rental though, I decided that it couldn't be THAT bad, and decided to give it a try.It's twisted, sick, involves a suspiciously large number of people with the last name Aykroyd, and is now one of my ten favorite movies. Not exactly high cinema or anything, just the sort of movie that used to be shown on a Sunday afternoon as a nice little escape from reality.Don't immediately dismiss this movie because of some of the reviews people have written about it, after all, there are people out there who still maintain that Titanic was one of the most sappy pieces of tripe ever churned out by Hollywood (myself among them).

I admit, I was expecting a lot more old school comedic humor between Dan, Chevy, and John but I was pleasantly surprised at the end of the movie how much I enjoyed their individual performances. Also I must mention that Demi did a great job too! I was certainly expecting her to be the one to hose the synergy between the fellas but she was great. Heck, I even liked Humpty and 2 Pac!!!

I don't have nightmares resulting from anything happening in the film itself, but from actually being in the room as this film was playing on TV.There has never been a poorer actor than Chevy Chase. Sure he did well in Fletch and Vacation, but seriously, when you see that Chevy Chase is in a movie, doesn't it just make you want to move to Lancaster and become Amish? Secondly, the entire film takes place in some sort of dump and Dan Ackroyd, the king of all schlock, plays some sort of centenarian judge with no teeth. It kinda reminded me of Strom Thurmond, but uglier and less funny.That should be noted... this thing is purportedly a comedy. I did not laugh once throughout the entire running time of this film. I was consistently grossed out, and I believe this was unintentional on the part of the filmmakers. This film was just so terrible, thinking about it makes me nauseous.

Given your choice of putting this tape or DVD in your player or watching a test pattern on the TV you should pick the test pattern. The characters, as I remember, are not at all real.

Watching this movie, I know exactly where the inspiration came from. It is basically a caricature of an old ""coal town"" in Pennsylvania. The honorable reeve is identical to the stereotypical ""pennsylvania dutch man"". If you are from PA, you will love the film. If you are from somewhere else, this movie will show you why you should never move here. It's all about the details in this film. The local meat markets sell garbage that is similar to the hot dogs, and the junk all over the yard is another PA dutch characteristic. Check this movie out, and go into it with an open mind.",Nothing But Trouble

This it's the first time I'd seen it because I first saw it in 1992 when it just came to weeky rental and at the time it became one of my childhood fav's. Then early this year I saw Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 on DVD at a friends house and it made me thinks about this films....I now realize because this was largely a spoof of TCM2. Yeah and this film it a quite entertaining adventure of that horror comedy fans should get a kick out of.Directed & written by Dan Aykroyd, staring Chevy Chase, Demi Moore, Dan Aykroyd and John Candy. This film lives up to the comedy cast's reputation and should be quite a hoot to many viewer with is twisted sense of humor. It's a surreal thrill ride though bizarre visuals and and ride the processes your meat and spits out your bones.If you like this film I would also recommend Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 which is actually a better film that is even more of the surreal this, however it should be warned that TCM2 has a fair amount of gore so it may not be for all viewers.Over all I'm impressed, so I give this film an 8/10",Nothing But Trouble

NOTHING, none, nada, zero. I did not feel sorry for the actors as many people did-; I felt disappointment and frustration towards them.

It's a harmless, mindless romp through an amusing storyline played out by the witty rapport of the core characters.  The sight gags and slapstick,  while cliche' and childish,  are sure to bring a slight giggle.  What's more fun than a judge who's idea for a great execution is dumping the accused in a rollercoaster called the ""Bonestripper?""  (Complete with Damn Yankees theme music,  no less.)

Somehow, the characters portrayed in the movie seem strangely familiar, and this can even be unsettling (where have I seen them before?).

Variety says, ""Astonishingly poor effort...the longest 94 minutes on record.""  Ken Newman, of 'Sight and Sound,' claims this was an ""absolute failure as a comedy...""  This is truly and without exception or doubt the worst film ever produced.  I have encouraged many to see this film if for no other reason than to know just how awful a film can truly be. Ironically, the film was written by an arguably intelligent team (the brothers Aykroyd) and starred four usually reliable actors:  Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Demi Moore, and the late John Candy.  How then could a production go so disastrously wrong?  You really have to see it to believe how bad it is.  The ONLY redeeming quality (the ONLY reason I could even give it one point other than the fact that IMDB won't let you give it a zero) was the entertaining scene where Digital Underground performed in the courthouse.  That's it.  That's the only possibility of redemption in the worst film ever realized in American cinema.

I commended him on his choice when I saw the cast of characters.We watched the movie with a growing sense of horror, and at its completion, neither of us said a word for a good 20 minutes.  We rewound the tape and were half way back to the video store to drop it off before either of us said anything.  We each were afraid that the other might have actually liked the movie!  Finally I tentatively said ""Um... that wasn't so good..."" in response to which he burst out ""It was AWFUL!!!""  And so began the reviling of this steaming turd of a film.One of the worst movies ever made.  It tops my all time worst movie list, with only ""Very Bad Things"" even remotely approaching it.  To this day we both still occasionally discuss that fateful night and the abortion of a movie we witnessed on the screen.  The memories are painful but we feel that we need to talk about it openly as part of the ongoing healing process.As Leonard Maltin says in his review: ""BOMB.

By far the worst 25 minutes of a movie I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. That's right, I said 25 minutes - when Dan Akroyd pulls his nose off his face and eats it at the dinner table, I believe that is an ender. The only thing I regret more than watching 25 minutes of this travesty of a movie is not having the good sense to leave somewhere between minute 3 (when the opening credits probably ceased) and minute 10.

If you don't find at least that funny and the set amazing, then I don't know what's wrong with you.The ""supper"" scene is pure hilarious-ness. John Candy in drag dishing out the nastiest looking ""hot dogs"" ever, Dan Akroyd as a whacked out super ugly old crazy judge with a dick nose at the head of the table doing the best crazy weird old man I've ever seen, and Chevy Chase as a diner.

All of the jokes fall flat. I have to agree with the many other comments I've read: it's painful. I'm terribly frustrated by this film. I watched and felt embarrassed for the actors.

BUT, a slight but significant group says that it is one of their favorites. This movie is not as bad as they say.  In fact, it doesn't even approach bad. In fact, it is one of my all-time favorite comedies.Dan Akroyd's performance as the demented judge is hilarious.  The parodies of po 'white kitsch are dead-on: industrial folk-art, warm Hawaiian Punch served with dinner, Lionel trainsets serving dinner condiments. Sometimes, Akroyd really takes off with his character and delivers hilariously colorful monologues.  They are so convincingly absurd, even if you've never encountered backwater coal town judges before (who has, really), you just KNOW that he has somehow psychically funneled the souls of dozens of them and run them through his comedic prism.Believe me, this movie deserves so much more credit than others here give it.  I know that my taste is not *that* bad.  I give it a 9/10, because some of the puns are a little bad (""Folk art? Folk 'em!"") but Mr. Bonestripper is so utterly and absurdly funny that it would have made up for even 100 bad Chevy Chase puns.  And Chase, I think, plays his part effectively, somewhat more seriously than I think others here were expecting.

The film 'Nothing But Trouble' is a classic comedy film which shows the creativity, and talent of its cast. A dynamic film which is both fun, entertaining and interesting. I admit, it has a simple plot but in its simplicity there is humor. Entertainment does not always have to be high-brow, or filled with controversy.

So many people crap on this movie because it isn't lightly humorous (i.e forgettable) or profound. Once again, it isn't supposed to be. It's like dismissing Led Zeppelin because it isn't as good as Beethoven. If you compare Nothing But Trouble to other dark, twisted movies, you'll find that it's pretty entertaining.

First and most importantly I cannot understand why so many people think this movie is gross or has parts that are ""hard to stomach"". MAN UP! The scene in Apollo 13 where the guy pukes in space is more grotesque than anything in Nothing But Trouble. In my opinion this movie is pleasantly bizarre and random. I loved the fact that it starts out like very much like any old movie (the only part that many of the film's most critical reviewers seem to like) and turns into something you would never expect at all. I know I was totally surprised when they end up in that mansion with that crazy old judge. Its like a crazy dream in a film. Set design was awesome.I think many people just don't understand the humor used the film. I've noticed that many people who have given the film negative reviews have stated ""the only funny part is when...."" - and then each person lists a different scene, each equally amusing in my mind. At times the Shire Reeve is hilarious, saying the weirdest things. ""This is worse than a week of yellow s***storms."" ""MA SKUNK!"" ""wheasey peasey *strange whistle sound*"" and his nose even turns into the tip of a penis during the hot dog train scene (if you happen to catch it as it is only for a brief second)It seems the more times I watch it the funner it gets. I think I like it so much for the same reason most people hate it so much. Because it is unorthodox and isn't just the same old run-of-the-mill romantic comedy. It stands alone in my mind as one of the most uniquely entertaining films of its time. I made all of my friends and every girlfriend I've ever had watch it and most seemed to like it.Don't get me wrong, I am taking it for what it is. It has its flaws. Chevy Chase did kind of sleepwalk throughout the whole film. Demi Moore looks terrible and plays a character that is unfunny and somewhat irritating at times. I think most people just expect way too much from this movie once they see who is in it. If at all possible the best viewing scenario for this movie would be to forget about WHO is in it and to try not to expect to see Uncle Buck, or Clark Griswald or a reenactment of the movie Ghost.

It show the funny side of Hollywood.  Just like Harry Potter.  We know it's not real, but come on this Movie ""Nothing But Trouble"" was funny and well done by many great actors; such as Chevy Chase and the Late Great John Candy.  This is a Comedy/Fantasy movie.  John Candy was playing as himself, funny, serious and believing. Chevy Chase did great with his National Lampoon attitude.  Demi-Moore got to play the hot girl and funny, like always.  Dan Ak. got to play the funny, disgusting judge.  They did a very good job in directing.  If you don't like it.  TOO BAD.  Leave positive about the movie.",Nothing But Trouble

I would hope not, but Dan Aykroyd apparently did and thus Nothing But Trouble exist. This movie is disturbing and watching it is like having food poisoning in your eyes. Worse things have happen to me other than seeing this film... on second thought, no they haven't. If there is a God and if that God is just, Aykroyd shouldn't assume that being in the Trading Places and Ghostbusters will save him from fiery pits of damnation. My nightmares would watch this movie and say, ""Damn, that's some pretty messed up stuff!"" The highlight of this film is probably the opening credits. It's the one part where the viewer still remembers what happiness is.",Nothing But Trouble

Bad acting, terrible script, mutant relatives?, John Candy as a woman, it goes on. Digital Underground performing was about the only worthwhile scene in the movie. I wish I could sue the studio to gain back those two hours of my life. In the pantheon of bad movies, this edges out Caddyshack II, Cannonball run (at least that was a lot of actors making fun of themselves), and anything with Stephen Seagal or Van Damme. Now, I must admit to never having seen Gigli, so someone will have to tell me if that is worse. I guess it is true that some people can get anything made into a movie.",Nothing But Trouble

I don't why it's got such a low rating, it's not ""Shane."" or something like that. This movie is supposed to be a far-out, macabre comedy, and that's exactly what it is. Dan Aykroyd's idea of a criminally insane small town judge who rules with an iron fist and will run you through his ""Bone Stripper"" if he takes a personal dislike to you is a take-off of the old stereotype of the crooked small town sheriff who goes out of his way to hassle people from out of town. Having a 6'4"", 300 lb. daughter to marry-off (John Candy) was a brilliant touch. This ain't Ben Hur and it's not supposed to be.Worst movie ever? You gotta be kidding me! A literal sea of bad comedies have been made but this isn't one of them. Most movies don't even keep my attention the whole way through because they're so bad, but this one did. Something tells me that criticism came from someone who works in the legal or law enforcement field, and it hit too close to home.I think that one of the best parts of this movie was Chevy Chase. He's always very funny and he's pretty much the same no matter what movie he's in. He is easily one of the most talented of the original SNL cast, and I have enjoyed all his films. Fletch is another great one.",Nothing But Trouble

As someone else stated, its a great ""Chevy Chase Cult classic."" You have to know what you're getting into, I mean its an early 90s comedy. If you go in expecting comedic genius, of course you're going to be let down. But its an enjoyable movie, if you enjoy 80s/90s comedies. If not, I suggest you look elsewhere, and stop rating/reviewing this movie so low. In all honesty, your reviews just make you sound like some pompous jerk. Personally, I love this movie.

One of the most frightening comedies I've ever seen. Dan Ackroyd is deep in disturbing makeup as the rural judge from hell. His performance as the mad ""Reeve"" that runs the ""Shire"" of Vulkanvania should not be missed. All the bad things you hear about New Jersey apparently originate from this Vulkanvania. Chevy Chase and Demi Moore are fish out of water thrown into an oil spill. The humor is quite dark and often over the top. Madness reigns over the ""fun house"".

My wife and I watched this and kept hoping it would get better and it never did, it just got worse.

What ensues is Chase and Moore getting caught in a twisted funhouse of doom witch also doubles at a courthouse.

I find this flick amusing, imaginative with good performances. So why was this film an ultimate flop at the box office? I didn't watch this picture because of any special actors who play in it. I believe a reason for this one being a flop is that people have a certain expectation if movie stars they love are performing...They are frustrated when they don't recognize Dan Aykroyd in make-up, when John Candy plays entertaining but without being overly funny and when Demi Moore is not as heart-wrenching as in 'Ghost'. That is and will be always an issue if you are a filmmaker for instance and have stars in your picture. They pull away quite some focus from the rest of the movie...Also, this film is a little gross at times and maybe for a big budget comedy people where not ready for that yet. I'd say this film was ahead of its time. One prove for that, supposedly 'Nothing but Trouble' has achieved a little cult status over the years.",Nothing But Trouble

Don't even watch it for free. There are much better ways to spend 94 minutes of your life. For example: watching paint dry or grass grow.Of course if you're a complete masochist, go right ahead.

On their way in the middle of nowhere Chris runs a stop sign, instead of getting a ticket, they are arrested and taken to the local court, but all is not as it seems. Judge Alvin 'J.P' Valkenheiser runs his court a little different than most, the death penalty is often used for traffic infractions. Trying to escape Chris and Diane run into many booby traps and many other crazy things. This is one of my all time favorite funny movies. You cant beat the combination of Dan Akroyd, John Candy, and Chevy Chase. Akroyd's character Judge Alvin 'J.P' Valkenheiser, makes this movie a great one. If you have not seen it, it is a must watch. It has become somewhat of a cult classic, and I see why. The story involves a group of big city types that take a wrong turn on the way to Atlantic City and end up in a hellish community that time has forgot.

(I bonded with a roommate in college over the fact that both of us thought this movie was the worst ever made.) Not only is the story line corrupted with inaccuracies and absolutely unbelievable paranoia, the scenery is disturbing and amateur. John Candy somehow plays a giant baby (excuse me, TWO giant babies) who play in sort of tire yard?

Chevy Chase is really funny with his sort of smart-ass, dry wit, probably his best performance after Christmas Vacation. From the movies I've seen Demi Moore in, this ranks as her best and shows that she can do comedy. Dan Akroyd and John Candy each pull double duty in this one and do it well- I couldn't even tell the second character Dan was playing until the credits rolled. The sets are unreal- from the junkyard (complete with piles and PILES of random junk and the Baby Huey-esquire Lil' Debil and Bobo) to the house of the honorable judge, it's hard to believe they actually put this together.

Then there is the junk yard that is filled with everything you could possibly imagine and two extremely scary/funny/obese brothers don't belong in their family and want to help, but are completely under the judge's control who will blow your mind.

After the impulse purchase, I was having a little buyer's remorse from reading the overwhelming negative reviews on here. I was questioning my choice and asking myself ""Was it not as funny as i remembered?!?"" I just finished watching it and my post-purchase trepidation was a waste of time and energy. Was it the funniest thing on the planet? No. Did it entertain and make me chuckle. Yes. Was it worth the four bucks I paid for the DVD? HELL YES!

My Dad and I ended up walking out of this movie. To put my comments in context, the only other movie I've walked out of is ""The Crow"". I've enjoyed all of the other movies that I've seen with these actors. I'd really like to get into specifics about why I rate this movie so low, but I'm afraid I'd give away some spoilers.

When taking a detour through a crazy looking town named Valkenvania, Chris mistakenly runs a stop sign. His punishment is staying in this terrible old mansion. Dan Akroyd plays this crazy judge who keeps him prisoner. The whole movie is Chevy Chase and Demi Moore trying to escape from the mansion.

203,burnmps,Unconventional Comedy That Gets A Bad Wrap,7,30 June 2007,"I look up all of the movies I watch on IMDb, and I'm surprised that this one is so disliked. I think the main reason is that with a cast of such comedy legends as Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd and John Candy, people were expecting a more conventional comedy. Most of their audience was probably expecting something along of the lines of ""The Couch Trip"", ""Delirious"" or ""Fletch"". I think people like me, who appreciate campy horror films like ""2001 Maniacs"", ""The Butcher"" and any of the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" series, are more likely to find some humor in this film.Thanks to the remarkably bland title, I had no idea that this was a comedy with a horror twist when I found it on a cable channel. The completely pointless start of the film, which involves a party and some sort of talk of some sort of business deal, also doesn't hint at what the film is really about. It isn't until the protagonists get arrested that all of the fun starts.What follows is something in between comedy and horror. It skews more towards horror, with tons of gross-out scenes thanks to Dan Aykroyd's various grotesque characters. There are tons of bones, but not a lot of blood. Unlike conventional horror movies, where body-counts are generally in the double digits, only one group of ne'er-do-wells end up slaughtered over the course of the film. Even the two annoying ancillary characters who are along for the ride, who would be dead meat in any real horror film, end up getting a reprieve and a happy ending.By far the strangest part, and my personal favorite, is the musical performance in the middle of the film. When I saw a limo pulling up in a scene halfway through the film, I thought, okay here come some more victims. I was surprised to say the least that the occupants of the vehicle turned out to be the entire Digital Underground crew, including the instantly recognizable Shock G (aka Humpty Hump)! Instead of being murdered, they all perform a song (unfortunately not their one major hit, the far superior ""Humpty Hump""). You can even see the late-great Tupac Shakur as one of the members of Digital Underground, before he started his solo career. I would recommend this film to anyone just for this surreal moment, but if you have no idea who Tupac or Digital Underground are then you probably won't enjoy it as much.After a few fake endings and the actual goofy cartoon ending, the movie is over. All in all, it doesn't have that many laughs, and it's definitely not scary, but it is rarely boring. The Digital Underground cameo is excellent and the cast plays their roles well. This is certainly not the best movie I've seen, but I would rank it better than any bad comedy and most bad horror movies. In fact, I'd say this film is just a few buckets of blood and a few crazy gross-out scenes away from a cult classic.",Nothing But Trouble

I love all the actors and actresses in this movie especially Dan Aykroyd and John Candy. If there was any kind of hidden message or if this was some kind of parody, I didn't see it. All I saw was a waste of good comedy talent on a really bad story line. With that in mind I fin it hard to believe that anybody who likes the entertainers, liked this movie.

Along the way they take a detour which puts them in an old forgotten mining town. Chevy fails to stop at a stop sign and the local cop takes them into the judge. The judge is played by Dan Aykroyd. For reasons unknown and unexplained the judge is 106 yo. The entire movie is a twisted mix of circus freak garbage and mindless odd ideas. There is no plot, there is no character development, there is no end to the stupidness. It is hard for me to imagine what each of the top actors was thinking, to agree to appear in this film. As I watched I prayed that the movie would soon begin to make since. But instead, the movie abruptly ends at ""THE END"" and I was left sitting on my couch looking up at the clock, wondering where my evening had gone.
