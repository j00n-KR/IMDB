0,Leofwine_draca,All-too-familiar mood piece,6,28 July 2016,"OUT OF THE FURNACE is a simmering story of revenge, betrayal, and murder, brought to life via a couple of volatile performances from the leading actors. Altogether it's rather familiar story and one which has been done time and time again in the cinemas, but then this film isn't really about the story at all but rather the mood, the ambiance of the thing. The director's goal is to realise some of the simmering tension of the likes of BADLANDS, charting a ruthless small town America where death and destruction are just around the corner and people are happy to turn a blind eye to such events in their midst.I was a bit disappointed with the lack of story in this film, which seems to drag out the most basic plot ingredients to double their real length. However, the performances more than make up for it. Christian Bale is saddled with what amounts to a rather basic character as the lead, but he does very well with it (unsurprisingly) and is 100% realistic. Casey Affleck is more of an actor I can take or leave, and I found I didn't really care about his predicament. However, Woody Harrelson is the scene-stealer here, portraying a man full of bullish aggression, a guy who you can feel the hatred coming off in waves. He's completely scary, the sort of person you would pray at never having to cross paths with in real life, and his performance alone gives this film an extra star.",Out of the Furnace
1,SnoopyStyle,Slow Tough Grinding movie,7,20 December 2013,"Russell Baze (Christian Bale) is a hard working responsible guy who's always bailing out his more irresponsible brother Rodney (Casey Affleck). One night, Russell accidentally kills some people while drunk driving. He gets sent to prison and loses his girlfriend Lena (Zoe Saldana). Meanwhile, Rodney starts fighting for money, and gets caught up with a criminal madman (Woody Harrelson). When Rodney goes missing, the police (Forest Whitaker) can't do much to help, and Russell takes matters into his own hands.This is a tough grinding movie. Christian Bale and Casey Affleck are both doing good downtrodden characters. Woody Harrelson is surprisingly good as the menacing drug lord. It is slow, but there is always something or someone interesting in the scene. It never comes to a stop. It's more of a slow burn with moments of intense fury. Be warned, this is not an action movie.",Out of the Furnace
2,Horst_In_Translation,Two hours edge-of-seat stuff,8,16 September 2014,"I would not say that the writing was revolutionary or that any of the acting performances from ""Out of the Furnace"" were particularly outstanding, but you know when a film has Christian Bale, Forest Whitaker and Woody Harrelson in its cast, you will get an expert approach. And it is true. This is a truly great thriller that had me on the edge of the seat from start to finish. Especially that final chase scene with Bale and Harrelson, the last 15 minutes or so, were incredibly intense. There's probably not many out there who can do badass villains as great as Woody. The introduction scene nails it right away and we see who the bad guy in this film is in impressive manner. This helped the movie a lot as it takes quite a while before Harrelson's character reappears again as the film early on focuses on the relationship between the two brothers.Bale is the central character in this film and we watch his emotional turmoil when he has a car accident with a child, when he loses his dad, his wife and finally even his brother. In the end, he has nothing to lose anymore and that is probably why he pulls the trigger to get his revenge. Also he was probably sick of Harrelson's character tricking the police just like it happened before when they came to arrest him and he was already long gone. Strangely enough, the cop who is on his brother's case is the new man of Bale's character's wife. It is probably a bit unlikely to happen in real life, but added some nice spice to the story. Casey Affleck did not totally convince me here, but I am not a great fan of him anyway, so that may be just me. The whole change-of-mind plot before he takes off for the fight confused me a bit and the letter that this would be his last fight did not make much sense to me either.Willem Dafoe is always fun to watch too, even if his role is fairly forgettable here. He is merely used for storyline purposes as a bridge between Affleck's and Harrelson's characters. Another thing I liked was the urban background here. A small gloomy town that lives from steel industry was a nice choice and created a good frame for all the action, not only because the final scene happens right at the steel mill. The fight scenes I personally did not find that interesting, maybe because they centered around Affleck's character, but they still were only a bit of a sideline for the character's relations and interactions. By no means, one could classify this as a fighting movie.Finally, I would like to say that I preferred Bale's performance here a lot over his Oscar-nominated turn in ""American Hustle"". In ""Out of the Furnace"" he shows raw emotion and does not just show up as some kind of caricature character in heavy makeup and costume. There he is substance. Here, he is style.",Out of the Furnace
3,Prismark10,Darkness on the edge of town,5,7 June 2019,"Out of the Furnace is a slow burn, art house revenge drama. It has brooding actors but a story that is so derivative. The moment early on in the film when Woody Harrelson has words with Christian Bale, you know those characters path will cross again.The film opens in 2008 after the financial crash. Director Scott Cooper wants to hark back to the films of the 1970s, there is a direct homage to The Deer Hunter.Set in the steel mills of Pennsylvania. Russell Baze (Christian Bale) is a decent hardworking guy who is always bailing out his wilder younger brother Rodney (Casey Affleck.) Russell's life shatters after a drink drive accident where a child is killed. He goes to jail and loses his girlfriend Lena (Zoe Saldana.)Rodney a war veteran who has done several tours in the middle east, gets involved in bare knuckle boxing for money. His fixer Petty (Willam Dafoe) reluctantly gets a fight with some hillbillies led by the psychotic Harland (Woody Harrelson) who he is in debt to. Rodney has to take a fall in the fight so Petty can clear his debts.When Rodney goes missing, The Baze family have to take matters in their own hands.Despite earnest performances from some of the cast, the story is vacuous and meandering. Harrelson's character is a cartoonish villain.Cooper wastes some of his actors. There is nothing here for Forest Whitaker who is an Oscar winning actor. Sam Shepard fares worse, he has less than nothing and he is now dead. I wonder if Cooper wakes up in the middle of a night in a sweat thinking that he had Sam Shepard in a movie and totally wasted him.",Out of the Furnace
4,nogodnomasters,LET ME MAKE THIS RIGHT,8,20 October 2018,"Russ Baze (Christian Bale) is a blue collar worker in a mill town working at the local furnace in North Braddock, Pa. His father (Bingo O'Malley) is in his death bed, have given his life to the mill. Russ has a girlfriend Lena (Zoe Saldana) who lives with him. His brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) has a gambling problem and owes John Petty (William Dafoe) a bar owner who also sponsors unlicensed fights.Russ becomes a guest at the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections after a drinking and driving accident. His dad dies, girlfriend leaves him and Rodney comes back from Iraq with some mental issues, but still owes John Petty. Rodney participates in the fights and becomes involved with the ""Jersey mountain inbreeds"" of which Harlan (Woody Harrelson) is the worse with his own anger management issues and sense of ethics. This does not go well and forces Russell to get involved to the dismay of local police chief (Forest Whitaker) a man who is now living with Lena.The acting was good. Woody Harrelson could have been on the screen more for me, but it appears they maximized his minor role with the opening scene. The film was more drama than the action thriller I was hoping for. Christian Bale's character was slow and thoughtful, yet he found himself in the kind of trouble generally reserved for those who are less so.Very good second effort for director/writer/actor Scott Cooper.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",Out of the Furnace
5,kosmasp,Slow Burner,9,15 August 2014,"No pun intended with the summary line, but you should be aware that this movie is not out there to woo you in. There might be an outburst of violence at the beginning, but it's only there to remind us of a character and his ""range"" so to speak. The movie itself is really quit quiet and relies on the actors and the tension that is build especially between two brothers who are different indeed, but love each other nonetheless, as brothers should.The movie is about loss. Be it of control, of people around you, of destiny itself and much more. It is also how you continue from that. Or maybe not. The actors are amazing to say the least and carry the movie. Actually elevate the movie. The screen presence from everyone involved is phenomenal. Be it good guys or bad guys. If you don't mind a movie that is not action packed, this thriller might be for you",Out of the Furnace
6,classicsoncall,"""You let me worry about who's a nasty son of a b....""",8,26 October 2014,"I'm really going to have to watch a comedy or two. The last movie I saw was ""August:Osage County"" and that was pretty intense too and no fun at all, even if a well done picture. Sam Shepard must have that kind of effect on films, he was in that one too.I had a close friend that used to talk about Ramapo, as in the 'you don't want to go there' warning that this film mentions. I think it was Willem Dafoe's character John Petty trying to talk Affleck's Rodney out of going there for a bare knucks match. The reference to 'inbreds' was part of the equation that my acquaintance alluded to; I think the term Jackson Whites was used, but beyond that I have no knowledge. Ramapo is not far from where I live, but I've never been tempted to venture there, now it's a sure thing I won't. The depiction of Harlan DeGroat's (Woody Harrelson) house and the low-lifes that zoned out there was an effective illustration that some people actually prefer to live like cockroaches.In the picture, Harrelson's character confirms his disassociation from humanity by declaring - ""I got a problem with everybody."" Knowing this about him sets up the inevitable confrontation that must take place when Russell Baze (Christian Bale) learns of his brother's (Affleck) disappearance, and later his death. Bale's performance as usual is stellar, affecting a quiet desperation but resolved to finding some measure of grim justice for his brother. For Harrelson's part, I think he's cementing his appeal as one of film's most notorious bad men.I don't know if this is actually the kind of movie one recommends as opposed to making others aware of for it's intensity and depressing atmosphere. The story and characters are grim and there aren't any light spots that I can recall. But the movie does offer a different slice of life that exists in some subterranean corners of the country where hope and despair often live side by side.",Out of the Furnace
7,rmax304823,Even The Frying Pan Is Better.,6,28 May 2017,"One of the Baze brothers, Christian Bale, is sent to prison for his involvement in a fatal traffic accident. His beautiful girl friend, Zoe Saldana, an impressive actress, hooks up during his absence with the well-meaning local police chief, Forest Whitaker, so she's lost to him. Moral: If you drink, don't drive. Don't even putt.His younger brother, Casey Affleck, joins the army and is sent to the Middle East. He returns shattered by his experiences in combat and is searching for some way out of the battered old industrial town of Braddok, Pennsylvania. Affleck chooses bare knuckle fights in remote places where the rules, if they exist at all, resemble those of cage fighters. People bet on one or the other and make or lose money. I don't believe there are such underground fights, any more than I believed that ex soldiers would play Russian roulette for money in ""The Deer Hunter,"" which this film in some ways resembles. But let it go.The small town fist fights in Braddock are for nickels and dimes. It's up in the Ramapo Mountains of New Jersey, a five hour drive, that the real money is to be made and that's where Affleck wants to go. His de facto manager, Willem Dafoe, does what he can to discourage him. The network up there is run by the brutal Woody Harrelson, looking just fine as the most soft-spoken and menacing looking villain you can imagine. Affleck insists. Both he and Dafoe pay the price of riding on the wild side.This activates the glands governing the revenge motive in his brother Christian Bale. The two brothers shared the same house in Braddock but while Bale joined the community and attempted to make up for his traffic accident and shed his ex-con identity, Affleck was always restless. Whitaker the cop is doing what he can to assist the Jersey police but how much can he do from shabby Braddock? Bale apparently cooperates with the New Jersey police in a raid on Harrelson's den of iniquity but, surprise! Although we see Harrelson shooting up and whooping in his crack high and the police bust through the door, rifles raised, shouting ""Police!"", it turns out that the cross-cutting was deceitful because the cops were raiding an empty house. Harrelson was in another dump somewhere, straight out of ""Silence of the Lambs."" Well, what is there left for Bale to do except to lure Harrelson down to Braddock -- easy enough because somebody in Braddock owes him a great deal of money -- and take care of the situation himself by killing Harrelson himself, even while Whitaker shouts from a distance, ""Don't do it. Drop your weapon!"" He doesn't just shoot Harrelson dead. They have a ferocious fist fight first, one in which Harrelson despite being bashed over the head with a rifle butt, manages to pin Bale down and injure him by bopping foreheads. I hate that cliché because it violates Newton's third law. It should damage both foreheads equally.But Bale winds up on his feet, rifled aimed at the now supine Harrelson, and deliberately shoots him through either the upper thigh or the genitals with that hunting rifle. Harrelson howls with pain, climbs to his feet and stumbles away. Bale lets him get about 50 feet away before putting another bullet through his kidney. Harrelson, all bloody and lurching like a drunk, walks away into a grassy field, probably dying. This is the point at which Whitacker arrives and tries to dissuade Bale from finishing the job. No dice. At about 100 yards, Bale puts a third bullet through Harrelson's back. The victim staggers forward for a few seconds before dropping on his belly, spitting blood. Bale squats next to the dying man, whom he's never met, and asks, ""Do you know who I am? I'm Rodney Baze's brother."" Exit Harrelson.Let me get socially scientific for a moment. It's an occupational disease. The ending isn't really satisfying. Bale, who has been a nice guy throughout the film, the kind of guy so ridden with guilt that he places a bouquet at the site of his traffic accident to commemorate his victims, becomes a wily and deliberate murderer because, I guess, blood is thicker than the Criminal Penal Code or something.In sociology, the family is a primary institution, meaning it's the one you interact with on a daily basis and owe allegiance to. Cops are secondary institutions, like hospitals, banks, or DMV offices. They're at a remove from the family and in developed countries, secondary institutions have assumed many of the responsibilities of primary institutions, although how much they should interfere in family life is a matter of debate. That's why cops find ""domestic disputes"" so tricky and troublesome. That's why some of us want families to pay for their own health care out of their own pockets.In this film, Bale throws off the valid authority of Whitaker, representing the secondary institution of the police force, and devolves into a murderer prompted by blood allegiances, while the police could manage the situation with authority and no fuss. He's gone back to the rude values of the Hatfields and McCoys. Of course we all glow with satisfaction as the demonic Harrelson gets his just due, but it's not Bale's job to bring that about. Now Bale is a deliberate murderer, regardless of motive, and can expect to revisit the slams and have a long, long time to do penance.Nice photography in and around Braddock, a steel town that is now largely black and has become dilapidated after the collapse of the steel industry. In 2000, the per capita income was $13,135. That's pretty damned low, almost as low as mine.",Out of the Furnace
8,paul_haakonsen,Generic storyline saved by fantastic acting...,6,10 August 2014,"""Out of the Furnace"" was actually a surprisingly nice movie, given its synopsis which didn't really sell the movie all that well.The storyline was compelling, albeit a bit stereotypical. Russell (played by Christian Bale) and his younger brother Rodney (played by Casey Affleck) live hard lives, and when Russell is thrown a curve ball and end up in prison, life becomes even harder. After having served time, he comes back to find his younger brother performing in staged fights for money. And when Rodney makes John Petty (played by Willem Dafoe) set up a fight through Harlan DeGroat (played by Woody Harrelson), Rodney is in over his head with a fatal outcome. Set out to avenge his brother's killer, Russell have to unravel the fight ring to get to DeGroat.Despite a fairly generic storyline, then the acting talents on the cast list really carried the movie quite well. And they have some really great names to star in this movie. This is really one of Christian Bale's better movies, because he really has given himself into the role here and it shines through on the screen. But Woody Harrelson was really also quite at home in the role as the cold-hearted DeGroat.One of the more memorable scenes in the movie was when the police were storming DeGroat's house. The way that was filmed, and with the way Harrelson was fixing, that was just phenomenal.""Out of the Furnace"" is a movie that is well worth watching.",Out of the Furnace
9,blanche-2,depressing film,6,26 December 2015,"""Out of the Furnace"" is a 2013 film starring Christian Bale, Casey Affleck, Woody Harrelson, Zoe Saldana, Forest Whitaker, Sam Shepard, and Willem Dafoe.Reminiscent of the Deer Hunter, it's the story of two brothers. Russell Baze (Bale) works in a virtually dead town (which looked like Pittsburgh to me), while his brother Rodney (Affleck) is off doing tours of Iraq. He does four in all.Russell is involved in a terrible car accident while drunk and is sent to prison. When he gets out, he realizes that Rodney has been engaging in bare-knuckle fighting for John Petty (Dafoe). He owes a lot of money, and when Russell asks him why he doesn't do another job, he indicates it's because he can't make enough. Actually he's filled with anger and too restless to do anything else. The mill, where Russell works and where Rodney could work, is responsible for their father's slow dance from cancer.Rodney pleads with Petty to get him a real fight in the mountains, where he will have to take a dive for Harlan Groat (Harrelson). The movie begins with an example of Groat's violent nature (Petty refers to him and his gang as ""the inbreds""). Rodney is badly beaten. He never returns home. Russell wants to find out what happened. The police, led by Chief Barnes, took up with Russell's girlfriend (Saldana) while Russell was in prison; nevertheless, both he and Lena care deeply about wanting to help him and also keep him out of trouble.This is a story that says several things - this country doesn't take care of its veterans, this country doesn't care about all the people eking out a living due to industries closing down, and that many people are left with nothing -- no American dream, just emptiness. The saddest thing of all is, the movie is right.The big rule in screenplays today is that you have to come to the action point within the first ten minutes or so. There is no art of the buildup - example, in the film San Francisco, the earthquake took place in the last half hour. Today it's the first thing we'd see. Those pesky little people called characters? We'll flesh them out some other time.The director, Scott Cooper, fudges by giving us big action right in the beginning, then the rest of the film meanders on slowly and without a ton of dialogue. I did thing most of the characters, particularly Russell, Barnes, and Groat came through well, in part thanks to wonderful acting on the part of all three. And one is able to surmise certain things about Rodney. But somehow it isn't enough. We don't know much about Russell's relationship with Lena, Rodney with his father, the dynamic between the brothers - there is just something missing.The ending is somewhat ambiguous, though the director explains it if you care to read about it. It's a tribute to a classic film and also signifies a man, alone, with everyone he loved gone along with this prospects. Cooper wants us to have hope regarding the character and therefore hope for all of us. I'd like to. Don't know if I can.",Out of the Furnace
10,searchanddestroy-1,The deer hunter,8,11 June 2018,"OK won't make it too long; just to say that some accents here remind me Michael Cimino's masterpiece: Pittsburgh vicinity, steel factories, deep America, war veterans, unemployed people, darkness, and a deer hunter scene. Besides, that's for me a true film noir.",Out of the Furnace
11,LeonLouisRicci,MiscastingTypecastingArtificial,6,9 April 2014,"If You want a Clear Cut Image of just how Bad an Actor is Casey Affleck, just put Him next to Christian Bale, Woody Harrelson, and Willem Dafoe and the Case for Casey is Closed. But that is not the Least of the Problems in this Facade. The Only Thing that Rings True is the Locations and it does not take a Good Director or a Good Cinematographer to Pull that Off.All that is Needed is a Camera and a Tripod and the Landscape does the Rest. It is Rundown, Worn Out, Colorless, Out of Time, and Downright Depressing on its Own. So no Great Shakes there. Now, the All-Star Cast (minus Affleck of course because it is a stretch to call him a star, more like a nepotist placement from the bush leagues among the real professionals). Christian Bale seems Slightly Miscast although His Talent is Effortless, Woody Harrelson is OK but this is Hardly a Stretch for a Natural Born Killer, and Willem Dafoe and Forrest Whitaker go through the Motions with not much Distraction. But it is the Script and the Heavy Handed Effort, and the Not Well Researched Template that Exposes this Film as a Poser. The Drug Deal and the Bare Knuckle Bouts are Embarrassingly Staged.Overall this one Fails more than it Succeeds in its Tale of Crumbling Towns and Crummy Backwoods Clans. Not a Complete Waste but its Flaws are just too Glaring to make this Resonate as a Sharp Slice of Life Film.",Out of the Furnace
12,zardoz-13,Electrifying But Depressing Drama About Brotherly Love,8,14 December 2013,"Imagine a movie that crosses the setting and the characters of ""The Deer Hunter"" with the bare-knuckled brawls of ""Every Which Way But Loose"" but altogether shuns any kind of comedy. ""Crazy Heart"" director Stuart Cooper has fashioned one of the more gripping but unsavory epics of the year with ""Out of the Furnace"" and he employs symbolism to underscore his points. Nothing about this bleak, brutal, blue-collar melodrama concerning two woebegone brothers struggling against hard times will make you feel warm and fuzzy. Indeed, Cooper and co-scenarist Brad Ingelsby stress austere reality over feel-good fantasy at every turn in the plot. Everything that can go wrong does go wrong for everybody. ""Out of the Furnace"" puts its heroes, villains, and victims through a grim gauntlet. Meantime, nothing happens here that couldn't occur in real-life. We watch as Christian Bale scrapes paint off his father's house and cleans leaves out of a gutter. Neither Bale nor his co-stars perform million dollar stunts, and the characters are not indestructible. Cooper springs at least two major surprises in a depressing narrative that is never boring but often formulaic. One of our heroes claims that he only needs one more fight to straighten things out for him. Rated R for strong violence, language and drug content, this is the kind of movie that neither spawns merchandise nor sequels. Essentially, ""Out of the Furnace"" focuses on the bond of brotherly love between a steel mill welder and an Iraq war veteran who encounter more than their share of suffering at the hands of a sadistic, bare-knuckled fight promoter played with chilling intensity by Woody Harrelson who is cast as a man that sells methamphetamines.Russell Baze (Christian Bale of ""Batman Begins"") earns his living as a welder at a West Braddock, Pennsylvania, steel mill. He sleeps with an African-American babe, Lena Taylor (Zoe Saldana of ""Colombiana""), but they show no interest in holy matrimony. Russell's elderly father is slowly dying, and his uncle, Gerald 'Red' Baze (Sam Shepard of ""Mud""), often pays them visits. Russell's mother has been dead for a long time, while his younger brother, Rodney Baze, Jr. (Casey Affleck of ""Good Will Hunting""), serves Uncle Sam in the military. Rodney has survived four tours of duty in Iraq, and the experience exerts a terrible toll on him. Rodney is as fearless as he is foolish. Eventually, Russell tries to persuade Rodney to work at the mill. Unfortunately, Rodney has seen too much violence in Iraq. The first time we see Russell and Rodney together is when Russell finds his younger brother at a betting parlor. Rodney, it seems, has blown money again on a horse race. Ironically, he was told to bet on a particular horse. Now, everything has gone really bad because he borrowed the fifteen-hundred dollars that he lost from John Petty (Willem Dafoe of ""Spider-man"") who is up to his ears in shady dealings at his tavern. Russell and Rodney are pretty tight as siblings go. He cares so much for Rodney that he shells out his own hard-earned bucks to decrease Rodney's debt, but he swears Petty to silence. Since he is so deep in debt to Petty, Rodney has taken on illegal, bare-knuckled, boxing bouts. Trouble is he cannot take a dive when Petty tells him to lie down. You see, once Rodney has been clobbered enough, he gains a second wind and then usually demolishes his opponent without a qualm. Despite all the fights he has waged for Petty, Rodney is still bogged down in debt. Finally, Rodney decides to fight for one final time, but he wants to fight for much higher stakes. Rodney has heard about a man over in New Jersey who has bouts where he could earn big bucks. Reluctantly, Petty takes him to meet Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson of ""Zombieland""), and they arrange a fight. Problem is Rodney forgets who is supposed to win. Russell is worried sick when he doesn't hear Rodney, and our hero challenges North Braddock Police Chief Wesley Barnes (Forest Whitaker of ""The Butler"") about it. You don't see ""Out of the Furnace"" to escape the woes of everyday life. The characters battle virtually impossible odds and suffer despite their valiant efforts. Director Scott Cooper gives neither his characters nor his audience a break in this tragic character study. Doom and gloom are the order of the day. Nevertheless, despite the humorless aura of tragedy that pervades this harsh film, ""Out of the Furnace"" is a strong film. The symbolism is awesome, and Cooper likes to cross-cut between the actions of different characters to comment about their plight. While Russell and Red are skinning a deer carcass, Rodney and John Petty find themselves at the mercy of pitiless Harland DeGroat. Despite the disheartening subject matter, Cooper has assembled an impressive cast that includes Christian Bale, Woody Harrelson, Casey Affleck, Willem Dafoe, Zoe Saldana, Forrest Whitaker, and Sam Shepard. The acting is believably natural, and nobody has been miscast, least of all Harrelson. The worst thing is the way that talented thespians like Saldana, Whitaker, and Shepard are relegated to largely peripheral roles. ""Doom Generation"" production designer Thérèse DePrez and Art Director Gary Koslo deserve Oscars for the authenticity of their sets. These sets appear too genuine to be prefabricated, and ""Silver Linings Playbook"" lenser Masanobu Takayanagi makes everything appears lived in and ultra-gritty. The America that we see here is wallowing in decay. If you prefer your movies with unrelenting realism, you'll exit ""Out of the Furnace"" searching for antidepressants.",Out of the Furnace
13,george.schmidt,Blue-chip cast buoys a tense vengeance drama,8,7 December 2013,"OUT OF THE FURNACE (2013) *** Christian Bale, Casey Affleck, Woody Harrelson, Zoe Saldana, Sam Shepard, Willem Dafoe, Forest Whitaker, Tom Bower. Well-acted tale about two close-knit brothers (Bale and Affleck) who find themselves at opposite sides of the law in varying degrees and a heated showdown of vengeance with a vile drug-dealer (Harrelson in full bad-ass mode). Filmmaker Scott Cooper (who co-scripted with Brad Ingelsby) lets the tension tighten masterfully while his blue-chip cast emotes with perfection particularly the slow-boil Bale and trip-wire implosion of Affleck.

14,neil-476,"Well made, but depressing and dispiriting",7,7 February 2014,"Brothers Russell and Rodney Baze live in a rough(-ish) part of industrial Pennsylvania. While Russell is in prison for vehicular manslaughter (deriving from baling Rodney out of gambling problems), Rodney gets even deeper into problems, culminating in his taking part in illegal bare knuckle fighting. This results in him participating in fights organised by Harlan DeGroat, who hails from one of those remote areas where law enforcement has no foothold. Things get bad. Things get dirty.The performances - Christian Bale, Casey Affleck as the brothers, Woody Harrelson (in particular) is the violent, reptilian DeGroat, plus the support - are all excellent. The problem, for me, was that this movie, saddled with an unnecessary subplot concerning Russell's girlfriend (Zoe Saldana) is rather slow and unremittingly glum. None of the characters are very likable, and none of what happens has any warmth or light in it. It's all rather one-note, and that note isn't one which lets you leave the cinema feeling anything other than somewhat depressed.And it has a completely mystifying final shot.",Out of the Furnace
15,Uriah43,Dark and Moody,7,1 April 2015,"""Russell Baze"" (Christian Bale) and ""Rodney Baze"" (Casey Affleck) are two brothers who live in a small town on the outskirts of Pittsburgh. Rodney has just returned from a tour in Iraq and suffers from emotional trauma while his older brother Russell is content with a decent job at the local steel mill and a steady relationship with ""Lena Taylor"" (Zoe Saldana). Unfortunately, things take an immediate turn for the worse when he is involved in a fatal car accident and is sent to prison for driving under the influence. While he is serving time Lena moves in with another man and his brother becomes indebted to a local bookie named ""John Petty"" (Willem Dafoe) . As a result he decides to repay his debt by competing in an illegal boxing circuit. One thing leads to another and soon both John Petty and Rodney end up having to deal with an extremely notorious criminal by the name of ""Harlan DeGroat"" (Woody Harrelson). Now rather than reveal any more of this movie and risk spoiling it for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a dark and moody film which I thought reflected the essence of life in the so-called ""Rustbelt"" to perfection. I especially enjoyed the performances of Woody Harrelson and Christian Bale who seemed almost tailor-made for their roles. Having said that I thought the ending could have been drawn out a bit more as it was much too short and ambiguous. In any case, I rate this movie as above average.",Out of the Furnace
16,ferguson-6,And Into the Fire,7,14 December 2013,"Greetings again from the darkness. Who in the world thought this would be the right time to release this film? Between holiday shopping and the new release schedule chock full of Oscar bait, dropping this hard-edged little film into theatres was box office suicide. And what a shame that is because there is definitely an audience for this exceedingly well acted snapshot of 2008 Rust Belt misery.The steel mill town of Braddock, Pennsylvania was once thriving, but is now on life support ... just like the father of Rodney and Russell Baze. Casey Affleck plays Rodney, the brother who viewed enlisting in the Army as his way out of Braddock. When we meet him, he is about to leave for his 4th tour in the Iraq war. Rusell (Christian Bale) is the more grounded, trying to do right brother. Russell dutifully works in the mill while trying to make a life with his girlfriend (Zoe Saldana).Since life never hands folks in these towns a break, Russell ends up in prison, Rodney's fourth tour leaves him scarred physically and emotionally, the dad dies, the girlfriend bolts, and the sleazy drug and crime world congregate right on top of the brothers' heads. Rodney goes deeper into the ugly world of bare-knuckle fighting world in an attempt to pay off his gambling debt to a local crime head played by Willem Dafoe (in yet another reptilian role). If you think cockfighting is merciless, the bare-knuckle fights held in backwoods Appalachian Mountains make that look like child's play ... and no tamales! The film is at its best when the nastiest of all these characters is on screen. Woody Harrelson plays Harlan DeGroat, the soulless crime and drug lord of the area, who also runs (and fixes) these brutal fights. Harrelson is at his most menacing here, and even has Dafoe's character a bit jumpy. Harlan DeGroat has no redeeming values, and admits to having ""a problem with everybody"".The story itself is quite predictable, but Bale, Affleck and Harrelson keep us glued to the screen. Zoe Saldana, Forest Whitaker and Dafoe have moments, but mostly their characters are underwritten here. Sam Shepard adds immediate blue collar royalty as the uncle of the Baze boys. Director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart) re-wrote Brad Ingelsby's script, and it suffers from leaving us wanting more in regards to background and makeup of these characters. Still, the strong performances keep us engaged and make this grimy, hopeless world something we can't turn away from.",Out of the Furnace
17,anaconda-40658,Bale Fires Up.,9,13 January 2016,"Out of the Furnace (2013): Dir: Scott Cooper / Cast: Christian Bale, Woody Harrelson, Casey Affleck, Zoe Saldana, Willem Dafoe: Tense thriller about vengeance and regret. It stars Christian Bale as Russell Baze who works at the steel mill. His father is on his death bed but his uncle keeps close ties. Casey Affleck plays Rodney Jr, Russell's younger brother who served time in Afghanistan and now is involved in bare knuckle fights for cash. A car accident puts Russell in prison when alcohol is the factor. While there his girlfriend leaves him, his father dies, and Rodney becomes involved in an underground fight club where he and his booker end up dead at the hands of a ruthless meth dealer, played by Woody Harrelson. The rest of the story regards Russell's search for answers regarding his brother's death. What is intriguing is that law enforcement seem unable to do sh*t while the guilty slips away. Director Scott Cooper switches gears here after his award winning Crazy Heart. Bale delivers one of his greatest performances as someone guilt ridden by a drunken accident and now has nothing to lose when vengeance seems the only answer. Harrelson is equally awesome as a psychopath of no remorse or reason even when the barrel of a gun is seeking him out. Casey Affleck steals scenes as crazed Rodney Jr whose options are running out. Zoe Saldana plays Russell's understanding ex-girlfriend who moved on. Willem Dafoe plays a bookie who ends up caught between loyalty and betrayal in the wake of consequence. Well crafted film about the disease of hate and revenge and its subduing poisonous blaze. Score: 9 / 10",Out of the Furnace

His legit brother played by a sympathetic Christian Bale makes some unfortunate mistakes of his own and then has to avenge his brother. Woody Harrelson the villain is made to look white trash enough but somehow he's always the good guy or comic relief so he isn't convincing enough for the part.

Essential information is absent where it should be focal in order to make this story more poignant.Russell Baze (Christian Bale) and his younger brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) live in the economically-depressed Rust Belt (some of the buildings indicate Reading, PA), and have always dreamed of escaping and finding better lives. Their father (dying) and uncle Red (Sam Shepard) live at the poverty level, Russell's only happiness is his relationship with Lena (Zoe Saldana). Rodney is serving separate deployments to Iraq and his mind is being irreversibly damaged by the war. An auto accident in which Russell (who has been drinking) includes a fatality and lands Russell in prison, unable to care for his dying father, losing Lena, and unable to support Rodney's debts. Rodney, unable to tolerate working in the mills associates with the strange John Petty (Willem Dafoe) who arranges and fixes fights. Desperate for income Rodney agrees to become involved with one of the most violent and ruthless crime rings in the Northeast, a crime ring run buy the grossly disgusting and malevolent Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson) - a mistake that will cost him everything. Once released, Russell must choose between his own freedom, or risk it all to seek justice for his brother.The cast is uniformly excellent – Bale, Affleck, Harrelson, Shepard, Dafoe, Saldana, and Forest Whitaker as the confused sheriff. The story is consistently dark in message and in cinematography, though the compassion and commitment within family is palpable. It offers some fine comparisons between PTSD effects from the constant misuse of soldiers in the Middle East and the chronic fatigue of poverty and crime in the depressed sector of America that used to be the pot of gold for industry. It is concerned with revenge that seems to have trouble finding a focus – so much of the world is out of focus for these tragic characters. This is a raw look at today.

Bale's performance of a good man, which is shown through his actions is forged via Out of the Furnace into making some bad and harsh decisions. Harrelson is Bale's anti thesis.

The film begins most effectively, but slips considerably in the second-hour, due to an erratically written Screenplay.

'Out of the Furnace' Synopsis: When Rodney Baze mysteriously disappears and law enforcement doesn't follow through fast enough, his older brother, Russell, takes matters into his own hands to find justice.'Out of the Furnace' works hugely in its first-hour. The sequences involving the brothers are wonderfully executed. Even the brutal fight-scenes/killings are gut-wrenching. But, the second-hour is problematic. The pace drops & the fight between the good and bad, isn't arresting enough.Brad Ingelsb & Scott Cooper's Screenplay is erratic. It offers an excellent first-hour, but a disappointing second. Scott Cooper's Direction is impressive. His handling of this brutal-thriller, is indeed commendable. Cinematography is grim. Editing is mostly crisp. Performance-Wise: Christian Bale is the life of the show. He delivers his strongest performance since 'The Fighter'. He essays a difficult part with utter brilliance. Casey Affleck, despite limited screen-time, does very well. Woody Harrelson does an okay job as the villain. Willem Dafoe is in complete form this time around, while Zoe Saldana is first-rate. Sam Shepard & Forest Whitaker are fair. On the whole, Though well-made, 'Out of the Furnace' doesn't reach the dizzy heights it could've.

It's a character driven movie that goes in a very subtle direction with a bit of thrilling areas near the end. The acting overall is topnotch, Christian Bale is the lead. But Casey Affleck also put on a emotionally driven performance. I wasn't too sure about the message of this film, but it does get pretty darn depressing, while watching a decent man trying to do the right thing and live honestly. It just sucked to see the guy get screwed over constantly. While his environment and the bad guys just crushing him. Watching this movie was like watching a more realistic and better acted version of ""Falling Down"". Overall, this is a performance movie.

23,Hellmant,Critics really baffle me sometimes!,8,14 December 2013,"'OUT OF THE FURNACE': Four Stars (Out of Five)An exceptional cast highlights this character driven crime drama directed and co-written by Scott Cooper (who also wrote and directed the critically acclaimed 2009 country music drama film 'CRAZY HEART'). Cooper rewrote the script, originally titled 'THE LOW DWELLER', by Brad Ingelsby. The film was originally set to star Leonardo DiCaprio and be directed by Ridley Scott. They stayed on as producers when the film was handed over to Cooper and Christian Bale (as it's lead actor). Bale plays a mill worker in an economically thriving town who must take the law into his own hands when his brother goes missing (and violent hillbillies are behind it). The cast also includes Woody Harrelson, Casey Affleck, Sam Shepard, Willem Dafoe, Forest Whitaker and Zoe Saldana. The movie is not only well acted but completely involving (from start to finish); it's another successful film from Scott Cooper.Bale plays Russell Baze, a mill worker (following in his dying father's footsteps) who lives in the Rust Belt. He and his younger brother Rodney (Affleck), who's an Iraq war veteran, have always dreamed of moving out of town and leading better lives. When Russell goes to prison for a drunk driving accident Rodney gets himself further into financial trouble, through gambling and fighting (for money). Rodney is too proud to go to work at the mill and doesn't know how to throw a fight (like he's supposed to). When he and his bookie friend John Petty (Dafoe), who's been financing Rodney's ventures, get into trouble with a hillbilly crime boss named Harlan DeGroat (Harrelson), and go missing, Russell risks everything to seek justice for his brother. Critics really baffle me sometimes! I truly can't understand why they love some movies and hate (or at least dislike) others. This is one of those movies that seems (to me) like anyone with an admiration for film (and is entertained by them) would enjoy. The acting is all more than decent (especially Bale), the characters are all interesting and well thought out and story is totally involving (from start to finish). Cooper's directing and script are also excellent (once again). So what's not to like here? For me it's a no-brainer: it's a good film.

25,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"A film with strong material, but not the best direction to guide it in",7,23 September 2014,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningRussell (Christian Bale) and Rodney Baze Jr. (Casey Affleck) are two brothers living in a deprived mill town in the north east of America. Yearning for a life beyond the walls of the town's sulphur mill, Rodney heads off to fight in Iraq, while Russell heads off to jail after a tragic road accident. Upon their return home, they are both bearing their respective emotional scars and are both struggling to cope in the tough economic times they have found themselves in. However, Rodney appears to have gone down a dodgy road, and become involved in fist fighting competitions, organised by ruthless redneck Harlan (Woody Harrelson), much to his brother's dismay, plunging the siblings in to a devastating spiral of destruction.After his directorial debut, the Jeff Bridges western Crazy Heart, director Scott Cooper has paired two big name modern day Hollywood hot shots and allowed them to work their magic with this downbeat but no less engaging drama/thriller. It's bleak depiction of a section of America most people probably don't want to admit still exists, and some of the undesirable inhabitants that lurk there, sets the tone for an intriguing blend of thrills, tears and tribulations.The younger, trendier leading stars aside, there's also some interesting veteran performers on display as well, in the shape of Harrelson as the villain, and Willem Dafoe (who hasn't been seen in a while) who are each given enough good material to work with and feel a part of it all. Far from being a run of the mill 'brothers united' film, this is an exploration and an examination of what being victims of fate and circumstance is like, and the instances when there is an inevitable tragedy just round the corner. Somehow, though, even with all this potential for an explosive film, it just never feels like it's got the best idea how to guide it all, and so it's never able to make the best use of what it's got.It's far from a bad film, though, still with a lot of interesting ideas and powerful themes on display. ***",Out of the Furnace
26,g-bodyl,The Springsteen of Cinema!,9,13 January 2015,"If there was anything or anyone to compare Out of the Furnace with, it would be ""The Boss"" himself, Bruce Springsteen. Both his songs and the movie have themes about the working class and the misery they are put through. The film is well-acted slow-burn drama, though it's depicted as a thriller in disguise. Now the script is not the greatest, but this is fine storytelling here or I shall say the basis of the story. At first, I found the ending quite weak. But thinking about it afterwards, it is an ending designed for open interpretation. The film is not overly violent and there are not many action scenes, so be prepared for a movie that takes it time to tell the story.Scott Cooper's movie is about a man named Russell Baze, who lives in a small town in Pennsylvania working a useless life as a steel worker. He has a fiery brother who recently came home from a tour in Iraq. After his brother, Rodney disappears under suspicious activity, Russell decides to take the law in his own hand as he takes it upon himself to find Rodney.There is no resisting a film that has such a fantastic cast. Christian Bale as Russell is very, very good. He has such a moody presence, but it is made clear that he is a caring person who is affectionate for his family despite all his hardships. Casey Affleck is excellent as Rodney, who has a passion for fighting. Woody Harrelson is fantastic as the main villain who has quite a few powerful scenes, especially that opening scene. We get some supporting turns by Sam Shepard, Zoe Saldana, Willem Dafoe, and Forest Whittaker(his accent sounded off though).Overall, Out of the Furnace is an excellent, underrated film that shows how hard life can be for the working class. The film is full of fine performances and great directing. The script itself is a bit clunky, so we should be thankful for such a cast. The film had been advertised as a revenge thriller, so be prepared for something a little different. A slow-moving, but thought-provoking drama this film is. Springsteen would have been proud of this film as their ideals are the same. I rate this film 9/10.",Out of the Furnace

Pearl Jam's 'Release' has some peculiarity in it and it perfectly opened/closed the credits.Christian Bale, suited up as a mill worker, kinda goes extreme with his character. His portrayal of that dull, quiet country lad is very good in one scene and very unresponsive in other. His character depth is quite well... what the story is all about. Casey Affleck is going higher in my list, and so is Forest Whittaker. Coming to the story: it is a typical, off-grown revenge story with a dark dusk all over the points. The plot is haphazardly stitched together where sequences are detached to each other. Perhaps, the makers failed to foretell this would indeed detach the audience from the film, too.It is slow... snail-paced slow, but for a theme like this, it is only an asset. The action is pretty good and I memory-photographed those sniper sequences. Riddled with life issues, the characters go their own ways and the consequences are stacked up which makes the last 20 minutes of ""actual thrills"" the whole film delivers. There is not an iota of newness in the film, except I relished watching Bale directed nicely. For the nth time, of course.BOTTOM LINE: Nothing focal to deliver.

Everyone says Ben Affleck is the worst actor ever, but he's okay to me. His brother Casey is the most annoying actor I have ever seen. No offense, but I hate everything from him, talking to acting exasperates me. Though he had a very nice role in here, but did not last long.Not to forget to mention Woody Harrelson. A story like this requires a powerful negative character so he filled that spot with a stunning performance. I can say Bale had a prominent role, but Casey and Harrelson, who made this movie happen. Without those two characters, Bale would have been useless. So the combination of these trio were the movie's main focus. Saldana was not required, she appears only for a few minutes, in one of a scene it was strong which came very handy.It is the story of two brothers. It was depicted with the backdrop of a small town's poor economy where most of the men are out of the jobs. They have to create opportunity by themselves if not escaping from there is the solution. It is not a story with moralities, but about the love, pain and ultimately a revenge. Convincing story for interconnecting characters with intense scenes everywhere.

35,zkonedog,"Nothing That ""The Fighter"" Didn't Cover",5,5 March 2017,"Have you ever seen one of those movies where all the pieces are present but it just doesn't gel together like it should? ""Out of the Furnace"" is exactly that type of film. It SHOULD work, but it doesn't.For a basic plot summary, this movie centers on the events of two brothers. Russell Blaze (Christian Bale) is a factory mill worker representing the American ""everyman"" trying to survive in an economically depressed area. His job is no prize, to be sure, but it keeps him living. On the other hand, brother Rodney (Casey Affleck), a military veteran home in between deployments, doesn't quite share the views of Russell, not wanting to toil in a mill and turning to the bottle and gambling as a result. When Rodney (an accomplished street- brawler) gets in trouble with Harland DeGroat (Woody Harrelson), leader of the intimidating in-bred Appalachian mountain folk, not even the police will stage a rescue. It is up to Russell to see that his brother is taken care of.There are two primary factors that render this film decidedly average:First, it's themes are far too similar to other Bale films like ""The Fighter"" and even, albeit to a lesser extent, ""The Machinist"". Both are better flicks than this one, so it is tough for this piece to carve out its own place.Secondly, the casting (and directing from Scott Cooper) is so uneven. Bale is not nearly used to his full potential (one has to let him emote more), while other great actors like Forest Whitaker and William Dafoe are given bit roles unbecoming of their on-screen statures.Actually, the crown jewel of the entire film is Harrelson's DeGroat. From the opening scene of the film, it is clear that this is one of the most reviled villain characters to ever be put on screen. He steals every scene he is in.Thus, if you haven't seen any previous dark works like this (or any previous similar Bale roles), this movie might be a little better for you.

36,Floated2,Intense Gripping Drama,7,24 December 2014,"Out Of The Furnace is as you'd expect from such a talented cast, the performances are excellent. Bale convinces as a kind-hearted man pushed to the limit after trying to do the right thing, while Affleck is superb as a weak-minded thrill-seeker whose hot-headed temper draws him inexorably into trouble. Similarly, Harrelson is gloriously evil as Harlan, clearly relishing the chance to create someone truly horrifying (his brutal introduction sequence is the most memorable scene in the film), and there's strong support from Dafoe (who does unexpectedly sympathetic things with what could have been an extremely one-note role), though both Whitaker and Saldana are conspicuously under-used - indeed, the relationship element features so little that it might as well have been dropped altogether.With such a talented filled cast, we are lead to believe had the script been more concise the overall tone of the film would have came out as a better final result. There appears to be a missing element in the film which could have elevated this film far greater. Out Of The Furnace is a solid gripping drama but there are several parts which drag on, and are not needed. The pacing is one area which is a part of complaint, where it can feel very slow and long awaited at times. The ending of the film can seem somewhat of a disappointment, as we are just left with a mis conception. I would have enjoyed a better ending.",Out of the Furnace
37,eddie_baggins,Some great acting turns lost in a uneven story,6,28 July 2014,"Out of the Furnace is that strange film beast, a film that consistently threatens to ramp it up to another level only to fall back once more onto an unfocused and convoluted plot. Director Scott Cooper's follow up to his adequate hit Crazy Heart is a frustrating watch on many an occasion but due to some quality acting turns is a film still worth checking out despite its failed potential.Coming out of the furnace and quickly back into it upon release, it's easy to see why Out of the Furnace failed to resonate with either critics or a general audience. Cooper and screenwriter Brad Ingelsby have gathered together a bunch of very interesting players in the film yet fail to capitalise on any of them with an overabundance of story threads and a plotting of the story that gives the film an awkward pacing. Lost in an over complicated story is a great turn by Casey Affleck as internally affected ex-soldier Rodney Baze and another stunning turn from Woody Harrelson who seems to be carrying on with his True Detective form here as redneck crime boss Harlan DeGroat. It's in the films other players and story strands that Out of the Furnace's problems become more evident.Christian Bale as lead Russell Baze is a solid presence in the film and Bale always delivers in some way or another but Russell is a strange character though that we never truly feel an affection towards him the way in which we need to and his relationship with the severely underutilised Zoe Saldana as Lena who like the great but short shifted Willem Dafoe as low level crime player John Petty needed some more screen time and their arcs just never play out into a satisfying whole. The film needed a tighter focus on its main story and a large plot point of Russell ending up in jail seems utterly pointless in a tale that seemingly already had the goods needed to flesh out a satisfying journey. Another frustration within the film is constantly missed opportunities to pack emotional punches and the film miscues moments far too often with only a scene between Bale and Saldana at a bridge encounter showcasing the emotional heft needed to do so.With some stand out singular scenes and with some fantastic if underused acting turns by Harrelson, Affleck and Dafoe and a fine anchoring turn by Bale, Out of the Furnace is a quality drama that should have been so much more. With an extremely talented cast, a fine director and with a story ripe for potential, it's a shame the films ending is such tripe and that the movie gets so lost within itself and therefore loses us the audience far too often.3 scrape's of the dinner plate out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Out of the Furnace
38,leonblackwood,Average revenge movie! 5/10,5,9 June 2014,"Review: I found this film extremely slow and in some ways, a little boring. It takes about an hour into the film before anything really happens, and the showdown at the end was quite disappointing. All of the performances were average, even though there are some top class actors in the film, but I lay the fault on the director who could have produced something much better with the material. We've all seen this type of movie before, were the younger brother gets himself in trouble and it take the bigger brother to help him out, so the concept wasn't that original. Personally I found the movie a bit of a drag and it really didn't have to be nearly 2 hours long. Disappointing!Round-Up: Harrelson played the paranoid nutcase, extremely well and the movie only really picked up when he was on screen. Christian Bale's role was quite basic with no thrills, but the chemistry between him and Casey Affleck was believable. Whitaker and Saldana are hardly in the movie, but they did add some drama to the film. There was a touch if intensity which made the film watchable, but the director wasted a lot of time on unnecessary footage which could have easily been left out of the final cut. Judging by the money that the movie made, I wasn't the only person who was disappointed.

Four-tour Iraq war veteran Rodney on the other hand, cannot work. A simple life to earn a living does not stimulate his mentally scarred mind. He owes money to a bar owner who incidentally runs illegal underground fights. He yearns for a lucrative brawl. A punch-up that would earn him enough to survive. An arrangement with sociopathic drug dealer Harlan DeGroat comes into fruition. The fight of all fights.Rodney's brother Russell, whom lives happily with his girlfriend and works at the steel mill, attempts to steer his younger brother down a more sustainable path. Too little, too late. Rodney winds up missing. Russell, ignoring the advice of police officials, takes matters into his own hands. And thus begins Cooper's dramatic thriller of disorderly brotherly affection. A feature astoundingly mean-spirited with its violence, drug use and inconsequential characters, yet undoubtedly engaging.It's a narrative illustrating contrasts and similarities between two individuals who share a ferocious bond. Russell's focussed and mindful solitude producing a disconcerting sense of edge, whereas Rodney's bombastic frustration proving to be the catalyst for the concluding vengeance. With various scenes playing identically, with differing nuances for each brother, indicating their likeness. At its core, Out of the Furnace is a simple revenge tale in the midst of modern societal issues. That's because it is.However, what truly elevates the dramatic endeavours of Cooper and Ingelsby's screenplay is the cast. A star-studded cast withholding bountiful talent. Bale, Affleck, Harrelson, Whitaker, Shepard, Saldana and Dafoe. Each performance offering a unique morality and interaction into the escalating scenario of Rodney's disappearance. Bale and Affleck in particular showcasing a vast amount of range and solemnity. The problem with this extensive cast, is that several of them become secondary to the plot. One or two even sinking to tertiary levels of wasted opportunities. Saldana's character is a reminder of the joyous life Russell once had, yet is rarely used at all. Her humanity is a vital dimension for the other characters to inhibit, however is only used to further infuriate Russell when revealing her pregnancy with the also underused Whitaker, to which lacked chemistry.The overwhelming testosterone-fuelled masculinity needed feminine relief, and unfortunately that wasn't present. Despite a near two-hour runtime, the plot is considerably disjointed in the first act. Huge cuts occur between Russell intoxicatingly killing occupants in a car and his incarceration for vehicular manslaughter, and the revelation of his father succumbing to illness. It offers a window of hopelessness, unable to act upon the world outside, yet these pivotal moments of emotionality were removed entirely to make space for the bulk of the feature. A thriller is built upon characterised foundations. Remove that, and an unrequested neutral standpoint floods the emotional investment towards the scripted characters. Oh, and the plot convenience of the mobile phone ""accidentally"" calling a voice mail that the police would then use to investigate Rodney's disappearance? Just no.Cooper's straightforward revenge thriller is an unsympathetic tale that never backs away from the burning embers its title suggests. However, much like its drive-in cinema showing of 'The Midnight Meat Train', the cast are unable to elevate the simplicity of its script, creating a functional if occasionally underwhelming feature in the process.",Out of the Furnace

There is some violence and action in Out of the Furnace, but what I liked most are the atmosphere and/or tone of the movie and the characters. Christian Bale and the whole cast did a fine job here.

41,matthewssilverhammer,An authentic and good-looking film that rings completely untrue in its characterizations and script,4,14 December 2013,"It's unfair to label ""Out of the Furnace"" a bad film. It's well shot. The setting is effectively imposing and formidable. The performances are nuanced and engaging. The sense of time is easily understood. Unfortunately, the positives end there. While it's an authentic and good-looking film, the lazy, heavy-handed script offers very little originality and rings mostly untrue. ""Furnace"" could be accurately described as ""gritty"", a genuine look at blue-collar, lower-middle class people. It's a fairly simple ""good guys vs. bad guys"" revenge film that avoids melodrama by instead opting to be boring. As it slowly plods along, it becomes increasingly clear that it has no interest in allowing us to infer anything about the subtler points of the story. The emotions it forces on us are manipulative and unnatural, and the dialogue is so heavy-handed and full of clichés I felt I was watching a student film. And the score.ugh. Is there a more uninspired way of saying, ""THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT NORMAL FOLK"" than to have Pearl Jam playing throughout? The high-points are the performances, making this film more than a waste. Bale continues to prove he is our generation's Deniro, deftly bringing subtlety and gravitas to every role. Affleck is proceeding to best his more famous brother, Ben, in every role. Saldana is great, and hopefully will be given better material someday. Unfortunately, there is very little for any of these guys to work with here. So no matter how powerful the movie seems to think it is, the mediocre writing and poor direction prove otherwise.",Out of the Furnace
42,imseeg,"Bleak, hardhitting and depressing portrait of one man's struggle to release his inner deamons...",9,9 January 2019,"Highly recommended raw drama, but only if you can stumach a bleak, violent and depressing story about human self destruction, in which Casey Affleck plays the part of a bare knuckle fighting war veteran who is torn apart by his inner deamons. Christian Bale plays the part of his big brother who is trying to steer Casey towards the right path, away from his self destructive behaviour.One of the most bleak, hardhitting and depressing portraits of one man's inner daemons I have seen in years. Definitely NOT suited for those who like to be entertained, because movies dont get any darker and depressing than this. What is especially impressive (although devastating simultaneously) is the brilliant true to life acting performances by ALL actors involved. Magnificent direction by Scott Cooper as well.Some movies just leave me speechless at the end. This is one of those. Having just watched ""Out of the Furnace"", the classic ""Deer Hunter"" comes to my mind, because it has got the same awe inspiring destructive impact. Despite all the bleak and cruel violence, this movie has got a pulsating righteous heart for wanting to save those who are beyond saving. Because of that uplifting characteristic watching ""Out of the Furnace"" becomes invigorating.",Out of the Furnace
43,Vartiainen,"All the right elements, not the right mix",5,14 June 2014,"Out of the Furnace starts out great. Christian Bale has once again been fitted with a perfect character for him and Russell Baze's blight, despair and honour shine clean through his performance. Add in Woody Harrelson, Forest Whitetaker and Casey Affleck and you have a very strong cast in your hands. The director is also at the top of his game when it comes to atmosphere, human emotions and sheer mood of bleak despair where people still struggle and trust in family. Very good first half and I was genuinely interested to know how the film would resolve itself.Alas, coming up with a good ending is hard at the best of times and this time the story fumbles badly when it comes to providing us with a satisfying resolution. The line between heroic badassery and cold- blooded killing is sometimes very thin and this film doesn't quite land on the right side of that line. The whole third act feels detached and false to the mood of the first two acts. There's no heroism and honour, just revenge fantasies.That being said, it's not a definite flaw, rather a decision to go with the more unpopular choice. Personally it wasn't for me, but I enjoyed the first half very much, the characters until the very end, the film had some very good moments and even the ending was tolerable.

44,BeneCumb,"Dark and oppressive, with splendid acting",7,29 December 2013,"Topics like fights for pay, related crimes and revenge for someone close to you have been used in hundreds of movies over the decades, and only new angles and/or fine acting are able to provide additional value. The latter is definitely in place - all actors, main and supporting, give memorable performances; of them, Christian Bale as Russell Baze spends most time on screen. As for the plot, its pace is somewhat hectic, and some elements (prison-related, above all) do not supplement to the logic of actions. There is also much misery around, none of the characters has bright prospects, and activities are not planned for the sake of future, but just to get even with the past... In relation to preceding scenes, the ending is too slow, although ""the"" moment was unpredictable.In my opinion, Out of the Furnace is a decent thriller with great performances, and most appropriate for male audiences.",Out of the Furnace
45,dfranzen70,Relentlessly downbeat but still compelling,7,9 December 2013,"Out of the Furnace is, as advertised, a grim, gripping tale of two lower-class brothers trying to raise their heads above water. It's exceptionally well cast, but it trods over some well-worn ground and is an almost-relentless portrait of desolation, isolation, and depression. Christian Bale plays Russell Baze, an ironworker in the local steel mill. When Russell is sent to prison following a supremely tragic event, his younger brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) is left to his own devices - such as bare-knuckle fighting and betting on ponies - while helping to take care of their invalid, dying dad. The problem is that Rodney finds himself very easily in hock to the local crime lord, John Petty (an epic performance by the underrated Willem Dafoe); Rodney doesn't want to work in the mill, doesn't want to do actual work, does want to fight. But he's not terribly good at throwing the fights, thus placing him even further in debt to Petty.Shortly after Russell gets out of prison, Rodney disappears. The Pennsylvania cops have an inkling where he might be - he's across the state line, in New Jersey, where the mountain folk don't take kindly to strangers in their midst; they're always a few steps ahead of the law, and folks being close knit and all in the community, the police can never seem to find anyone to cooperate against the white-trash bad boys of the mountain, led by one Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson).Like The Fighter before it, Out of the Furnace features two down-on- their-luck brothers, one smart and one sort of shifty, although here Bale switches it up and plays the smart one. It's a movie you've probably seen before. When the police appear to be impotent in finding out what happened to Rodney, Russell takes matters into his own hands to exact his revenge.The performances are worthy of acclaim. Bale and Affleck show excellent chemistry with each other, although Affleck's half-whiny/half-nasally voice grates after a while. Dafoe is nearly flawless, and Zoe Saldana (as Russell's girl), Forest Whitaker (as the local sheriff), and Sam Shepard (as Uncle Red) offer plenty of grit (in Saldana's case, charm) and charisma. But it's sort of an obvious movie. It has an obvious villain, an obvious (anti)hero, and an obvious denouement. The script, by director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart) and Brad Ingelsby, tosses no curveballs and offers no mystery. In short order, the plot points align, and the only thing for the viewer to do is wait the movie out. Still, Bale's so effective that even the pedestrian story becomes compelling to a certain degree. But it's telling that for a movie called Out of the Furnace, it takes a good hour before we even see anyone in a furnace.",Out of the Furnace

Christian and Casey are brothers that are living in Pennsylvania. Christian works in a steel mill, working in a furnace. Casey just got back from the Middle East, after serving 4 tours. Zoe is Christian's girlfriend. After an accident that results in the deaths of 2 people, Christian goes to prison. Casey gets tired of trying to get a regular job-he does not want to work in the steel mills like his brother and father-and gets involved with Woody, an illegal bare-knuckle fight promoter. Woody also deals in drugs and looks like a typical redneck hillbilly but is from New Jersey-I guess they have redneck hillbillies in New Jersey, too. When Christian gets out of prison, his life turns into a country/western song; his girlfriend left him, his father died, his brother just disappeared. The only thing left for Christian to do is to try to straighten out his life and get some kind of closure. The only problem is that the previews made it look better than it actually was. It was slow in parts, and the ending left some things unresolved. I do remember hearing a Pearl Jam song-Release. It's rated ""R"" for language, violence and drug content and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes. It's not one that I would buy on DVD. It's not interesting enough to rent, either.

47,meeza,More ins than outs here!,8,2 January 2015,"Director Scott Cooper's ""Out of the Furnace"" is a dark but powerful movie about a big brother's determination to seek vengeance on those that hurt his younger brother. It is set in a working-class steel town in Western Pennsylvania. Christian Bale stars as Russell Baze, the steel worker big brother who does time in jail and upon his release, he discovers that his more rebellious younger brother Rodney is in hot water. Casey Affleck portrays Rodney as a hard-edge who has returned from a tour of duty in Afghanistan and gets caught up in the underground fight game. Rodney, unlike Russell, does like to tussle but sometimes too hard, and his determination to make money ends up being his downfall. Did I say too much? Oops! Sorry! Didn't mean to shoot a spoiler out of my linguistic furnace. Woody Harrelson co-stars as the villainous Halan DeGroat, who is involved in illegal setups of the underground fight circuit; not to mention hard drugs, domestic violence, assault & battery, and murder; so yea Harlan is a model ""the goat"" of any town with his evil ways. I credit Cooper for giving the film it's murky but realistic perspective of a steel town and its citizens. Bale was fantastic as usual, and Affleck provided some good punches in his supporting role. And let's not forget the Woody; Harrelson continues his impressive career with another solid performance. So yea, the furnace is hot here; so get of your furniture and into the streaming or Netflix furnace, and get into ""Out of the Furnace"". **** Good",Out of the Furnace
48,alindsay-al,An average dramatic film,5,31 August 2015,"This is a film I have wanted to see for a bit and even though this film had some positives but it is completely average. The premise of the film sees a couple of brothers trying to survive as their lives continued to be made worse. Christian bale is a fantastic actor and he does a great job in this film. This character isn't as lovely or animated as his previous characters but he does a great job of selling the emotion of the character and the pain he goes through. Woody harrelson is the villain of the film and he does a really good job of convincing people that he is a real meth head that is a piece of garbage. It is uncomfortable seeing everything he does in this film. Casey affleck is also really good in the film as bales brother, he is probably the most damaged character in the film and delivers probably the best scene in the film. Willem Dafoe and forest Whitaker have smaller roles in the film but were both really good in their roles. The story just didn't really have any meat to it, the relationship between the characters didn't completely work. It just felt like watching one guys world crumble and nothing else which was a bit boring to me. The script had some alright dramatic moments but sometimes it doesn't hit the level that it should and there is no good humour at all. The style was pretty generic and it didn't help make any of the situations better and it actually felt like it was more of a distraction sometimes to the plot. Plus this film was just pretty boring to me. Overall this film is pretty boring and dull and not memorable.",Out of the Furnace
49,estebangonzalez10,"Excellent performances, but weak and manipulative screenplay",5,15 January 2014,"""Am I supposed to be scared of him because he sucks on a lollipop?""I had high expectations for Out of the Furnace considering it had a very strong cast and I enjoyed Scott Cooper's previous film, Crazy Heart, but I was really disappointed with this movie which never managed to engage me and had some serious pacing issues. The depressive tone of the film and the dark atmosphere was a bit over the top and the story also has many manipulative moments. The performances were solid and actually make this film worth the watch despite its many flaws. The tone of the film reminded me a lot of Prisoners, but that movie worked much better and was way more engaging. This isn't your typical revenge movie, I wouldn't consider this an action film or a thriller; it's more of a drama about this economically depressed town where two brothers are struggling to find a way out and move on in life, a life which hasn't been very kind to them and has dealt them some terrible cards. Many may argue that the performances were enough to save this film, but for me the weak script brings it down by making several scenes feel forced and out of place.Russell (Christian Bale) and Rodney (Casey Affleck) are two brothers that have grown up in economically depressed Rust Belt, Pennsylvania. Russell has followed his father's footsteps working at the local steel mill and seems content with his life as he cares for his ill father and finds comfort in his relationship with Lena (Zoe Saldana). He also looks out for his brother who gets into small gambling debts with John Petty (Willem Dafoe) and ends up paying off those debts for him. Russell's life takes an unexpected twist one night when he suffers a car accident killing a child in the other vehicle. He is sent to prison for five years while his brother who served in the Iraq war comes to visit him. They both go through traumatic experiences, but when Russell is released from jail he is determined to turn their lives around despite that he no longer has the comfort he had in Lena who has left him for the local sheriff, Barnes (Forest Whittaker), and his father past away during his time in prison. To make matters worse, Rodney has entered the underworld of street fighting and got involved with a violent crime ring leader named Harlan (Woody Harrelson). When Rodney goes missing and the police can't seem to do anything about it, Russell decides to take things into his own hands and avenge his brother.Christian Bale and Casey Affleck both give great performances. Bale's character, Russell, is portrayed as a very nice guy who seems to be a victim of the circumstances that surround him. I think he was portrayed in a far too light way, so the audience could identify with him and feel sorry for what he was going through. Harrelson also looked menacing as the villain, but at times his character was also a bit too cartoonish and always tried to have some funny remark. These elements didn't play out too well for me considering the dark tone of the film. The cinematography was really good and it did capture that depressing mood very well. There is one specific scene where I can point out how manipulative and forceful the story was trying to be and it has to do with the moment in which we discover Rodney's fate while Russell reads a letter that he has left for him telling him how he is planning on changing his life and is convinced that this will be his last fight. That was just an example of how manipulative the screenplay was trying to be and I found several moments like that. Instead of drawing me in, it only took me out of the movie. The film was gritty, but I just didn't like the way in which they tried to trap the audience. It may have some important social commentary and interesting metaphors, but those forced moments took me out of it and made me feel it lacked substance.",Out of the Furnace

51,juneebuggy,Average despite the talented cast,7,20 July 2016,"I found this film kind of average despite the uber talented cast. It has a gritty dark and menacing tone and is ultimately a tale of hard luck and revenge but it also tended to get kinda dull and plodding as well as going exactly where I was expecting it to, so somewhat predictable as well.The cast is about the only thing that makes this worth a watch, yes Christian Bale is phenomenal but I was also left really impressed with Casey Affleck who puts his all into his role as a small-town blue collar kid returning from (another) tour in Iraq, struggling with PTSD and going after that ""one last fight"" to clear his gambling debts.Woody Harrelson also wows. What a piece of work he is, instantly hateable here as the ruthless and violent leader of a crime ring. When Affleck goes missing his older brother (Bale) -fresh out of prison- becomes determined to find him even though the police (Forest Whitaker) have warned him not to get involved.A couple of scenes did stand out for me; the one on the bridge where Bale says goodbye to (Zoe Saldana),Bale and Uncle (Sam Shepard) hunting the deer as Affleck heads off to fight night and of course the final will he/won't he showdown in the field with Chief Whitaker watching.I did find the social commentary aspect interesting, the small steel mill town that's seen better days.

52,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Bleak, crushing",8,8 April 2017,"While not quite in the pantheon of powerhouse that the filmmakers intended it to be, Scott Cooper's Out Of The Furnace is still a bleak, devastating picture. This is a film about endings, and not resolute, satisfactory ones either. Set in a borderline derelict mining town somewhere in the rust belt, industry has come to a grinding halt, giving way to the inevitable rise of rural crime, spreading like a cancer across land that once flourished and prospered. Every character in the film meets their bitter end somehow, and what's fascinating is that earlier in life they all could have been more whole, and come from some other, brighter genre film, but the lives they've led set them on the same course as their county, and one by one we see them reach the last bend in the road, and the light in their life unceremoniously flicker out, leaving a cold shell. If I'm making this sound depressing, I'm doing my job well. This is a soul crushing film, with no light at either end of the tunnel and all glimmers of hope already extinguished before the opening titles even show up, so just make sure you have Finding Nemo or Wallace & Gromit queued up next in line if you give it a go. Opening with a prologue that leaves a bad taste in your mouth, you know right off the bat what you're in for, as we're introduced to Woody Harrelson's Harlan Groat, an absolute monster who runs everything from underground fight clubs to an intricate web of meth trade in the region. Groat is at odds with steelworker Russell Baze (An implosive Christian Bale), a hard man with anger issues just looking for an excuse to get fired up. Russell's brother Rodney (Casey Affleck in the film's best work) is a broken Iraqi war vet who got on the wrong side of Groat's gang, and has since disappeared. Since the law won't venture into the near mythic backwood hills where Groat skulks, Baze goes vigilante, waging personal war and raging against a light that has long since gone dead. This is a big cast we're looking at here, and some of the subplots either distract from the main show or just seem like overkill, like Zoe Zaldana as Russell's ex who has since shacked up with the local Sheriff (Forest Whitaker), or an underused Sam Shepherd as his uncle Red. Willem Dafoe has a nice bit as a seedy but sympathetic local gangster though, it's always nice to see him, as well as Tom Bower as the salt of the earth bartender. It's all about Woody and the danger he brings, he's terrifying in the most mundane of exchanges, and lethal when he gets worked up. The feeling of economic decay follows him like a noxious cloud, his brittle ruthlessness a mascot for the hard times that many a town in the US has fallen on in recent years. One need only look at the poster to see the obvious and intentional shades of Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter, and though the film wears its influences on its heavy flannel sleeve, it finds its own dark, despairing poetry, and leaves you gutted in the final, anticlimactic frame.",Out of the Furnace
53,aharmas,Gritty Tale of Modern America,9,9 January 2014,"If you see Christian Bale is part of the cast, you must be sure there will a strong performance, and when the performance pairs with tight direction and a decent screenplay, sparks will certainly fly. ""Out of the Furnace"" gives Bale, Affleck, Harrelson, Zaldana, and Whitaker another chance to prove their worth as character actors. Filmed in a style that leaves very little hope for nothing but the bleakest of emotions, each of the characters in this story must face the consequences of actions and/or fate. At the center is a pair of brothers who are dealing with economic realities and the effects of political events. One has pretty much grown accustomed to a simple life; the other struggles with the demons that he has encountered and now corrode his soul.Following a short introduction, the events start rolling, and one of the brothers finds himself in jail, leaving his younger brother without emotional support. It might be lack of communication or just the way events unfold, but tragedy soon strikes, and the dark realities of this small communities come forward, threatening, destroying, leading to an explosive and devastating conclusion.Bale is an intense and hard working individual who sees his world fall apart as his brother finds himself in the middle of a nasty money transaction. His only way out is to get involved with a community of very disturbing group of criminals. As another character mentions, it's best not to get involved because these people don't give up until they get what they think they want. Harrelson is the leader of this group of violent hoods, and he is the perfect embodiment of evil and menace. He is very comfortable using a gun to get what he wants.The best part of the film is watching the disintegration of Bale's world, and how he decides what drastic steps he must take to resolve his conflict. Moral ambiguities are left aside, and the hunt begins. The ending will both shock and probably satisfy the audience, and its impact carries great weight as delivered by Bale's performance.

54,peterp-450-298716,Why didn't they nominate Bale for this part ?,7,14 March 2014,"""Am I supposed to be scared of him because he sucks on a lollipop?"" If you're expecting a hard-hitting action movie, then you'll be disappointed. This film is tough, but not in a physical way. It's a dark, depressing and hopeless portray of a moribund industrial city. A slow moving movie that tells the story of the brothers Baze. Russell is the one who tackles life in a conventional way by going to work himself to the bone for a meager wage in a steel factory. Rodney is the energetic U.S. marine who has already done a few tours abroad and clearly suffers from that. He doesn't want to have an ordinary job. He rather borrows some money at a local bookie and gambles on horse racing. Either he tries to collect a few dollars by participating in illegal organized fist fights. However, he has a problem and that's his sometimes emerging rage that makes him forget the precise instructions.Christian Bale plays an outstanding role here and should better have gotten a nomination for this part instead of the one in that dreadful movie ""American Hustle"". He radiates an intense tranquility and also tries to calm down his brother. The only thing I was wondering is whether he had a criminal past. The love for his girlfriend and his father, who's in a critical condition, seem truly sincere. It is a man whose eyes say everything. The fatal accident he caused made him spend some time behind bars. But even that won't break him. The day he's released and the meeting with his girlfriend, who meanwhile left him, are two strong snapshots in the film.Casey Affleck is the opposite. A cauldron of pent-up anger and frustration that arose during his missions abroad where he experienced stuff he can't talk about and so he bottles up these certain situations. He plays it so amazingly well. The restrained anger relative to his brother. It's someone with a short fuse who is about to explode. And he does that during the fights. Until he gets involved with a community that lives in the mountains and who have their own laws.The interaction between the two brothers is magnificent. They are well attuned to each other. The older brother who does all the effort to keep the younger rebellious brother on a short leash. Even repaying his debts he made with gambling . That the respect for each other and the brotherly love is mutual is evident. The frequent visits of Rodney in prison is prove of that. Also the excuse note Russell gets after they had a feud, makes that clear. Russell isn't realizing that he'll never see his brother alive again.Woody Harrelson plays the dangerous DeGroat in a masterly way. The opening scene at the drive-in makes it clear that he's a psychopathic violent person who fears nobody and won't go out of the way for anybody. The devilish grimace and sly sophisticated smile fit perfectly with him. Same traits as his character in ""Natural Born Killers"". Woody has the stature and the attitude to play such a character. He sometimes actually looks fairly friendly with his winning smile, only to change into a deadly person in a flash.The acting performance of Forest Whitaker wasn't that great. The moment he tells Russell the news about his brother, was truly abominable. However I think Forest is a brilliant actor. An off day probably.I can imagine such dreary and petty towns exist in the U.S. where people are struggling to survive and even retreat into isolation, to found an independent community where crime and violence is normal. Besides the fact that this is just an ordinary revenge movie it also has other elements that don't have anything to do or add to the main theme, but are subtly worked out to fit into the complete story. The only disappointment was the end. If I was Russell, the retaliation would take a long time.""Out of the furnace"" is a story about people who fight. Fighting for an income. Literally and figuratively. And the dilemma to take the law into your own hands or not. The sweet revenge. In the end I thought it was a top movie.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",Out of the Furnace

Such should be considered odd since each cast member has a familiar face, but then you see the movie and begin to understand.Characters & StoryThe story of Out of The Furnace focuses on the steel mill town raised Baze brothers Russell (played by Christian Bale) and Rodney (played by Casey Affleck). Russell is a man who does as his family has done for generation, work at the steel mill then go to your loved one, of which for Russell is Lena (played by Zoe Saldana). Rodney, on the other hand, works for the military seemingly to escape the family pattern of working in the mill, but ends up only trading boredom and stability for the gruesomeness of fighting in the Iraq war.These two lead us on a journey in which we watch them both fall, and while Russell is given the chance to stand back up after a drinking and driving conviction which puts him away, and causes him to lose Lena to local officer Wesley (played by Forest Whitaker), Rodney finds himself relying on assistance to stand on his own. You see, while Russell was away, Rodney had to deal with their dad dying as well as mounting debt which seemingly the military wasn't helping much with. So this leads to him turning to local shark John Petty (played by Willem Dafoe) who he throws fights for.However, once Russell is out, and back at the mill, Rodney eventually figures that he minas-well give into fate, but not before one fight to wipe his debt. Enter Harlan DeGroat (played by Woody Harrelson) a Jersey drug dealer, with a penchant for violence. He changes everything for the story by taking out a few characters and getting on Russell's bad side, and despite Wesley saying he got things handled, Russell decides to play vigilante leading him to face off with Harlan.PraiseHonestly, when it comes to praise I think more so what is praise worthy is the marketing of the film than maybe the film itself. The reason I say that is, the trailer is quite good and paints Harrleson as a compelling villain, Bale as a do-it-yourself type hero, and then Affleck seems to be the dumb kid brother who seemingly looked to his bro to be a father figure. Then when you add the Affleck interview on Real Time you are given the idea that perhaps Out of the Furnace may include Affleck portraying a strong military character dealing with multiple tours and the PTSD which comes with them. But, unfortunately, while Affleck's Rodney does bring his background of working for the US military into play, it is more a subplot than something really focused on, as it should in my opinion.CriticismAnd really, considering how ripe the time is for such a story, it really is a shame because the rest of the movie, outside of Rodney's subplot, are overdone soap opera story lines. All the while, you have Rodney here who, I think, would have made a better focus for the film and I'd even say that it would have been a good film if the focus was on Rodney's life and Russell was just there to show what type of life he was trying to escape from. I mean, they could have kept his gambling issues and what have you, but considering that America has not yet been flooded by a huge amount of stories, at least that I know of, featuring veterans coming from the Iraq war, this could have been the one which set the precedent. For, as of now, seemingly most of the film featuring the current, or recently ended, wars of American history have painted themselves as action movies. Meanwhile, outside The Invisible War, which focuses on the friendly-fire of soldiers raping their comrades, there aren't too many movies out there explaining, or portraying, the other horrors which turn scrappy and joyful young people into those who seemed to have aged 20 years.Aside from that comment though, my main issue with the movie is that everyone is pretty dull. Bale tries to show that he can be more than the former Batman, but ends up playing a vigilante anyway, just without the voice effect; Whitaker, for those who follow his career, reminds you that outside of the big films like The Butler or Last King of Scotland in which he can emulate a person, he often times is dull; and while Harrleson is the supposed villain of the film, after seeing so many films just this year alone, I feel having a 2D villain whose claim to fame is a short-temper just feels lazy. Also, Harlan's face off with Russell is the least inspired finale I have seen, and wastes the smidgen of build the film has.Overall: TV ViewingOut of the Furnace isn't a bad film, it just feels lazy, and because of that I understand why the movie's name was a whisper in the wind. When you compare it to every other movie that came out this year, be it theatrical, DVD, online, or a TV movie, it just doesn't compete well. It uses the old revenge plot and does nothing new of it, while having a decent story it could have used with Rodney which gets wasted. Hence why this is just for TV Viewing. Out of the Furnace may have had decent marketing, but overall it ended up being another film which seemed better when advertised than when experienced.",Out of the Furnace
57,AudioFileZ,Ultra Dark Story With Two Academy Award Level Performances,8,2 January 2014,"I usually come late to the reviewing party and as such I have the luxury of reading a panoply of opinions. Sticking with my beliefs that this is excellent movie making I still like to read other ""armchair"" critics dissect that which I've already formed my own thoughts. So, is there such a thing as a ""perfect story"" and if so has it ever been perfectly brought to the confines of a two-dimensional art form? Of course not, but if the viewer feels something akin to pain during the course of a story it's success far out weighs any shortcomings.Out of the Furnace is such a success. Decay of a town and the downward pull it exerts on those around is bleakly brought to the screen from the first frames of this movie. It doesn't let up as a family deals with death on several levels. It tears an already beaten down cast of characters pushing them into an even darker collision of events. Certainly not a new story, but one that reveals a cesspool of depravity not in a war torn third world country, but right here. So, if not original it opens the scabs of a psychopathic side of our so-called civilized country with quite enough realism for those unfortunate, in both lot and choices, enough to be surviving close to the bone. As such this story while not brilliant serves it's purpose with aplomb.So, what really raises Out of the Furnace is the brilliant performances of three actors: Christian Bale, Woody Harrelson, and Casey Affleck. Especially Bale as the leading role of Russell Baze. Baze is a man who is quietly attempting to keep going while things around him constantly threaten to destroy him. Bale brings so much to this quite intensity it's hard to explain except for just watching his portrayal slowly reveal his sense of right within his own personal hell. As his ""cocked and loaded"" damaged brother Rodney, Casey Affleck brings an out of control hopelessness right into the the viewer's psyche. You desperately want him to turn around full well knowing he's already too far gone. Finally, there's the most harrowing evil so blackly portrayed in the backwoods killer Harlan DeGroat that Woody Harrelson makes one believe if he hadn't landed in Hollywood this is who he'd actually be. These three performances trump whatever the story lacks so brilliantly. The cinematography suits the film perfectly. It's gray and gritty, it has shots as metaphors, and it shows very small glimmers of hope and it goes deeper and darker.Out of the Furnace does what it sets out to do without bowing the least bit to any type of entertainment quotient. It is a harrowing abyss of a cesspool of decay and what evil circles around such. It is almost too dark yet never bowing to graphic violence for the sake of such. When it is over the viewer is both rung out and relieved. This is excellent movie making in most every sense of the art form.",Out of the Furnace

59,bob-rutzel-1,A Thriller in Name Only,5,12 April 2014,"Russell Baze (Christian Bale) is released from Prison, and finds out his brother, Rodney (Casey Affleck), is mixed up with Harlan DeGroat's (Woody Harrelson) fight-game mob and owes a lot of money. When Rodney doesn't come home one night Police Chief Barnes (Forest Whitaker) tells Russell to let him handle it. Russell knows the police are afraid of DeGroat and his gang and decides to take matters into his own hands even though he knows this may send him back to prison. This film went by so fast I couldn't believe it was over. My popcorn was hardly touched. It's not that the characters weren't developed, the story wasn't either. The only time the camera lingered was when we see Russell thinking aboutwell, who knows? That became annoying because it gave us an opportunity to make mistakes about what he was thinking. Okay,we believed we did know what he was thinking: should he let the police handle things or do something himself and chance going back to jail and also how to get Lena (Zoe Saldana) his old girlfriend back. She is now with Chief Barnes. The Lena thing was a wasted storyline. What was annoying was the length of time the camera spent on Russell's face. To sum up: there must have been a time limit for all other shots.But, what I really couldn't understand was why were all the stars (Woody Harrelson, Forest Whitaker, Sam Shepard, Willem Dafoe and okay..Casey Affleck) in this? Their on screen time was very, very short and no one stood out. Didn't make sense to me. All were essentially cameos. All we really needed was Casey Affleck whose Rodney was the catalyst for all that Russell does. We didn't need those other stars. Okay, only one star stood out and that was Woody Harrelson as DeGroat even though his on-screen time was also pretty short. The story made it clear that everyone was afraid of him. Hell, even I was hunkering down on the couch. There is no thrill in here. Yes, we did expect Russell to become a Liam Neeson character when a family member is in trouble. When we see how Russell is going to handle things, we kind of wished Liam Neeson was actually in here. Would have been more exciting, or more ""thrilling."" Didn't happen. The ending was a real piece of work. Here we had to use our judgment to decide what happened and we really didn't have much to go on. We were left clueless. Bummer.The title should have been: OUT of the OVEN, because the story was not done yet and needed more time and should have been shoved back in. Very disappointing. (5/10)Violence: Yes.

60,Sergeant_Tibbs,Bale and Affleck elevate a decent film in competent hands.,7,27 December 2013,"Scott Cooper's debut Crazy Heart felt like it came from an experienced and mature director, but it was too bland and predictable to be anything truly compelling or moving. The premise of his followup Out Of The Furnace is nothing new, it has the potential to add an essential grit to Cooper's style. But it seemed to overcompensate for Crazy Heart. It makes you feel, but its dreary melancholy just makes you feel sad and that can only be satisfying in certain doses. Fortunately, it has plenty of energy to back it up. Bale and Affleck are a great pair and while their characters may not be the most interesting, they're a delight to watch when they're on screen together with that brotherhood bond feeling real. Unfortunately some of the cast are dialed to a different frequency with Harrelson and Whitaker misfiring. Its first half is entertaining, taking many turns per minute, even if they can be melodramatic at times it's the sincerity of the actors that makes it work. Unfortunately the momentum slows down in the second half when it finally reaches the plot promised in the trailer and it appears to deflate to its inevitable end. It's a good film in competent hands, but nothing special. 7/10",Out of the Furnace

I heard one reviewer say that it was just despair and ugliness - welcome to the real world buddy. It is that sense of despair and revenge that makes it good. I can only imagine that there is a part of society that lives in that world all the time. It's dark, depressing, and in your face.

Rodney hasn't even seen Harlan's home. Every part of the interior is broken and warping away, but it still has solid doors and windows. This proves Harlan is AT LEAST a Hundred-Naire, and in THIS West Virginia county, that makes him king. If only Rodney had paid attention in high school history class, he would know that Gen. Robert E. Lee kicked this part of Virginia OUT of the Confederacy, because its men were too ill-bred to follow the rules of war and military discipline. Rodney also should have known from his current events course that these Appalachian hills are alive with the sound of Meth labs exploding.

Cooper has really genuine talent and gets to create atmospheres somehow reminding ""The Deer Hunter"". Casey Affleck is perfect as well and his character is probably even more powerful than the one of his brother. This movie is always deep, everything in it is strong and thought provoking, like the sibling relationship, Woody Harrelson's sinister presence and Sam Shepard's humble restraint.

64,brchthethird,"Well-performed, but underwhelming drama that doesn't live up to its existential themes",7,14 November 2014,"OUT OF THE FURNACE is well-acted and has a high-caliber cast, but it never really lives up to the compelling themes set forth in the beginning of the movie. Deep down, it's really a character study and examines the lives of people in a Pennsylvanian steel town. The two principal characters are Russell and Rodney Baze (Bale & Affleck, respectively). One is a down-to-earth, unassuming guy just trying to make an honest living, while the other is a former soldier who feels that his country has let him down. One thing the movie does really well is establish the relationships between the characters, and the one between Russell and Rodney rings especially true. However, the choices of one leads the other one down a path that he might have preferred to stay off of. There's also a rather impressive supporting casts, with turns by Willem Dafoe, Forrest Whitaker and Zoe Saldana. However, these supporting characters are never really given their due. But the best performance, aside from Bale and Affleck, is given by Woody Harrelson as a drug-addled, boozing, backwoods and generally malcontent criminal who runs an illegal fight operation (and a crackhouse). Despite his limited screen time, he manages to give a full-bodied performance of someone who just doesn't care about anyone but himself. Very nihilistic, selfish, grimy, dirty, unlikeable, etc. Of all the supporting cast who don't really show up a lot, him not showing up as much makes some sense. It doesn't really take much time to get a sense of who he is as a character. Other positives include some gorgeous cinematography and the direction by Scott Cooper is competent, if unremarkable. Even though the story is a bit predictable, and the ending is somewhat underwhelming, he does manage to get excellent performances from his actors, which is fine for what this movie was trying to be.",Out of the Furnace

Good acting, actors, directing and potential and then...and then...It goes no where literally. It had what it took to hook you in the beginning thanks to the stars in their roles. At some point, you notice everyone involved is in peak condition and knows how to fight too. You make a mental note and wait. Then, you have a prison episode which is untapped. I mean people love prison scenes and we get a taste but not a satisfying one. Then, who doesn't like bare knuckle brawling? High stakes betting? It starts out promising and then...then...? Its got a really good bad guy in it and you cant wait to see him get his comeuppance too. He earns the death sentence from the audience, flaunts getting away with murders and you want his ending to just connect all up nice and pretty like and it is so anti-climatic as is the revenge angle as well. You get fear, tension and you commit to this movie wanting it to be satisfying for the time spent and then you wonder how you got done in and you realize it was the starring power allure. If someone would have looked this over, made the necessary changes mentioned above, you would have a great B movie success on your hands with lasting power. In other words, people would see it again. I just don't get it sometimes. The movie ducks line up but no quacking? In this day and age how can that exist? Watch it so you can see Bale, Affleck and Harrelson but don't get your hopes up.

Sam Shepard, Willem Defoe, Zoe Saldana, Forest Whitaker, et al are all wasted. Woody Harrelson and Christian Bale, as the two protagonists, have all done much better work elsewhere.

Christian Bale (Russell Baze) doesn't have a problem working in the local steel mill, just like his father before him, but Casey Affleck (Russell's younger brother, Rodney) is an Iraq War Veteran who wants more out of life. Rodney wants to stay ""out of the furnace"". This movie's title also reminded me of the old phrase ""out of the frying pan and into the fire"". If the fire is worse than the frying pan, how much worse can things get when you start IN the furnace, then find yourself OUT of the furnace? The answer is much worse... much, MUCH worse.Most of ""Out of the Furnace"" takes place in a small town southeast of Pittsburgh – an area in which poverty and despair seem to be an accepted way of life and the survival of the local residents depends on jobs that are few, and less than stable. Rodney's unresolved issues from his four deployments to Iraq seem to manifest themselves in the many backroom brawls in which he takes part – for money. He gets the local loan shark (Willem Dafoe) to set him up with a fight in which he'll take a dive. The fight is deep in the mountains of northeastern New Jersey and the area is basically ruled by the amoral Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson). When Rodney goes missing and the hometown police chief (Forest Whitaker) seems unable to find out what happened, Russell and his uncle (Sam Shephard) risk everything to find Rodney and dispense justice to those responsible for his disappearance.""Out of the Furnace"" is dark, intense and a bit depressing – in good ways, cinematically speaking. The movie draws you in from the first scene and never lets you go. The smart script, taut directing and skillful editing all contribute to that effect, but the biggest reason that this film works is the extremely powerful acting. As the kids say, O-M-G!

As simple as that. What a movie! It has two hours, one wasted on boring and mundane events, half of the other brings some drama, but not too much because it might hurt somebody, while the last part tries to make up for the lack of interest and excitement the movie inspired until that point by providing the much lusted revenge.To say this movie was a waste of time would simply be a compliment for it. Besides the fact that is as boring as it can be, it also features two big stupid and disappointing sequences, on which the movie bases, which make you scratch your head, to say the least.

73,bryank-04844,"Again, the pacing of this revenge flick is completely off and might have worked better as a short film, rather than a feature length.",3,22 August 2015,"Scott Cooper's second film 'Out of The Furnace' has a lot going for it. The script and especially its amazing A-List cast might draw out a decent crowd, but a sour taste might be left in your mouth after the end credits start to roll. Cooper's first film was 'Crazy Heart' and had some similar somber tones to it as this film does, but it's nowhere near how brutal 'Out of the Furnace' truly is. But what makes this blue- collar flick ultimately suffer is the amount of filler that has nothing to do with actual premise of the movie and keep the film from moving forward at a steady pace.The opening scene will literally knock you out of you seat and wants to set the tone for what brutality is to come as we meet a psychopathic hillbilly named Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson amped up to 10), as he forces a giant hot dog down his date's throat at a drive-in theater. And when a guy comes over to stop the abuse, DeGroat viciously attacks the man and doesn't stop, then throws his date out of the car and leaves. It's as almost as this movie is preparing us for some high end ultra violence later on.Then we finally meet the Baze brothers, Russell (Christian Bale) and Rodney (Casey Affleck) who are watching their father spend his last few days on his deathbed. As Russell works a the local mill and tends to his girlfriend Lena (Zoe Saldana), Rodney tends to be running up big debts with a local bookie named Petty ( Willem Dafoe), while he's on military leave from overseas. Russell does the best he can to keep his kid brother from being harmed and even tries to pay off some of his debt, but Rodney doesn't learn.And soon, in order to pay back his debt, he is fighting in illegal bare knuckle boxing matches in various mud pits and abandoned warehouses. In what seems like an homage to 'Snatch', Rodney is told time and time again to take a fall during a fight, but he simply can't force himself to take fall as the fight begins. Now to pay a large sum of money owed and against warnings everyone gives Rodney, a fight is set up with DeGroat's people, who are known as backwoods inbred hillbillies, who thrive on drug trafficking and violence. Basically they are such pure evil, that the local authorities won't touch them.Well as you can imagine and as DeGroat says in the first scene of the movie, ""I've got a problem with everyone"", and things don't go so smoothly. Thus our tale is set in motion and the title of the film comes into play where like the 'Dark Knight Rises', someone comes 'Out of the Furnace' to defeat evil. It's a great set-up, and Cooper gives us some good time to develop these characters and their struggles. However, there is about 30-40 minutes in the film that could have been completely left out, as they didn't advance this story in the least bit. Particularly, where Russell is sent to prison for a number of years due to a drunk driving accident, which led his girlfriend Lena to start dating the local community sheriff (Forest Whitaker), who might only have less than three minutes of screen time.We clearly see that Russell is a good guy who is always wanting to the right thing by his family and even his dead end job. But he's proud of what he has and Bale shows his pride well here. Dafoe and Affleck are near perfect here with Affleck pulling of a range of emotions as he tries to just escape the dreary town he is in. Zoe wears every emotion on her sleeve and we want to cry every time with her, whereas Harrelson is always perfect as the crazy psychopath.Again, the pacing of this revenge flick is completely off and might have worked better as a short film, rather than a feature length. There is just too much here that doesn't keep our main plot going forward with nothing being used as a resolve.",Out of the Furnace

Harrelson is an awesome redneck villain and Bower, Dafoe, Shepard, Whitaker and Wolfe stand out even in their minor roles. Affleck's character's conflict is overwhelmingly realistic and the actor flawlessly executes a soldier's postwar troubles; but the potentially wonderful character-development reveals itself to be a secondary interest to writer/director Cooper when we arrive at the popcorn finale. No doubt it ends as great as it began, but the climatic sequence before the last few moments is plagued with a lack of substance that is contrary to the rest of the film.

But it's one of the best character presentations I've seen in a long time. In a few seconds, accurate, fast, accurate. All presented of this character. Casey is well presented but not so much and the worst is Bale. He needs a lot of time to introduce him. Too many sequences and too many planes.One of the things I do not like about this movie is that it has about thirty minutes of film left over. Why do I say it? From the presentation of Woody until it comes back out, if I remember correctly, spend almost fifty minutes. He is telling us other things that I think we are not interested in, or half repeating. It is not necessary to see so much of Casey that it is repeated, it is not necessary to see so much of Bale that we are not interested. Or he decides to tell the story of the brothers and Woody or decides to tell the stories of the brothers, but the two can not be told. You do not really know which one is telling you. Once Harrelson comes out again, that's all, this story, then he really was interested in this story and not the other.The actors are all splendid, everyone has their brilliant moments. They are all consecrated actors making a film without a budget and leaving their skin behind.Apart there are faults that I see that I do not believe, I explain them in the spoiler zone.Photography, I understand that in America, fortunately, independent film works and that there are such films, never have a photograph, then when they have shown they are good, they have a budget and they have photography, but of course for the film, photography, He supports with nothing. Does not exist.The direction, the problem for my taste, is that it pretends to explain too much about the characters and it is repeated and lost and the story is gone. He does not know how to make beautiful shots or to have the camera. In fact, there are times when the camera passes without a foreground to general and foreground, with what I get out of the narrative.No instant movie is a movie that is worth watching. Just to see the three of them and see a movie with a background, not just shots and revenge.Spoiler:
I can not imagine an American policeman at the end of the movie acting like that, and least of all that character. And the truth is that I was watching the movie and I do not believe that as we know the characters of Bale and Woody, that the story continues as follows. I was watching the movie and I thought how was going to lose Woody used to that life he leads.",Out of the Furnace

Aside from his freedom, he has to come to term with the loss of the woman he loved and as if this is not bad enough he soon must decide whether to jeopardise his freedom to protect his brother who has become involved with organised crime.Although it did not get much acclaim, this is an unusually engaging movie. It has a central character but this character does not carry the film solo as other personalities are required in order to bring the story forward.Early on we expect something to go bad and tension rises progressively. The usual sensationalism is absent and we observe the Russell facing an increasingly difficult dilemma which could end up cost him more than he has already lost.",Out of the Furnace
81,christophe92300,Powerful but lacks depth,6,26 January 2014,"Scott Cooper perfectly shaped his scenario thanks to a captivating cinematography and mise-en-scène that brilliantly underline and emphasize the cold and intriguing atmosphere of the story and this industrial suburb on the decline. The actors are also very good, even though you have to admit Christian Bale is the one who stands out in a very nuanced and introverted role.Despite everything, the banality of the story is a little disappointing, granted the dynamic is ultra fluid, but the plot is very simplistic, the characters aren't exploited enough nor is the social and economic context which clearly was the purpose. In the end, you're under the impression that not much happened, feeling emphasized by a relatively long movie.Out of the Furnace is therefore rather ambiguous, on one hand it is undeniably very powerful with a top-notch cinematography, but on the other its banality and lack of depth are prejudicial.",Out of the Furnace
82,TheSquiss,The cinematic equivalent of a slowly simmering pan of acid.,8,21 January 2014,"Out of the Furnace is the cinematic equivalent of a slowly simmering pan of acid. It's not explosive, but the fumes are noxious and doing you no good at all. You know that what's going on in the pan is lethal, but you just can't help watching, waiting, hoping you'll witness something unpleasant. You'd rather not see it but you still can't resist watching.Russell Baze (Christian Bale) and his younger brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) live in the Rust Belt, another of those depressed areas of America where what little money there is is largely earned at the mill and spent at the bar. Folk are hardworking and decent, for the most part, but an underbelly of violence and crime is inescapable. Rodney returns from a tour of duty in Iraq and, when Russell winds up in jail through a stupid mistake, Rodney aims to ease his financial situation through bare knuckle fighting and becomes involved in a particularly vicious local crime ring headed by Harian DeGroat (Woody Harrelson).NB: at this point, the trailer and production blurb give more away, but the events they describe don't actually occur until over halfway though Out of the Furnace, so I'll stop there and suggest you avoid the trailer.With a fine trio of principals rounded out with Zoe Saldana, Sam Shepard, Willem Dafoe and Forest Whitaker, Out of the Furnace is a raw film of revenge and dark justice with cloudy morals guiding the protagonists. There are certain areas where right and wrong are firmly established (DeGroat is the kind of evil wrong you'd wet yourself if you crossed) while justice and the 'right thing' are sometimes less easy to be certain of.But even that does Out of the Furnace a disservice. It is so much more than a revenge flick. Scott Cooper's (Crazy Heart) is a film about families, about struggling within the rotten system and trying your damnedest to make something of the mess life has served up for you. Revenge is a comparatively small aspect of Russell's life and the act of seeking it belies the strength and determination that he displays to maintain his integrity and the relationships with those around him for whom he cares, but appears to lose through little fault of his own.Some have labeled this a 'career best' performance from Bale. It isn't. Watch The Machinist, The Fighter and All the Little Animals again for some context. However, it is a near flawless performance that has far more depth to it than the shouting man of Terminator Salvation (both on and off camera). From the thoughtfulness of the son caring for his dying father to the resignation of the ex-boyfriend who has lost, Bale is true to Russell. Russell may not be our friend, but we'd want him on our side in a tight spot and Bale plays him so that even in his darkest actions we still care about him.Harrelson is at his cruelest since Rampart, but whereas he was a solitary high point in that turgid mess, in Out of the Furnace his is a compelling performance among many in a film that won't leak out of your mind in a hurry. It is a loud, brash, showy performance that captures the essence of a deeply unpleasant man (monster?) but it is never without consideration for the doubts and inadequacies of DeGroat.Out of the Furnace has hints of Eden Lake. The situation is entirely different but the sense of helplessness and the possibility that one could find oneself stumbling into such a situation are the ingredients of true, genuine horror. Like the scrotes of Eden Lake, DeGroat and his disciples they live by their own laws, without the hindrance of morality or conscience and most of us wouldn't last an hour in their company.In Out of the Furnace it takes two men, one desperate, the other determined, to confront them by choice.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",Out of the Furnace
83,RevRonster,It has its issues but it's still a decent film...,6,23 April 2014,"Despite some issues with the story, I can honestly say that I enjoyed ""Out of the Furnace""and for more reasons than the fact that the cast is filled with talented actors.While, yes, the actors they have in this film is almost enough to make the film watchable and half-way decent, the story pushes it over the edge. I love revenge stories and this film definitely had some interesting characters involved in a dramatic tale. The only problem I had with the film was the story had a habit of feeling like it was wandering in-between what Christian Bale's character was going through with his new life outside of prison and all he lost while in the clink and what he's going through with his brother and his issues and resulting disappearance. While all this creates for some rich characters and conflict, the film felt like it was just bouncing back and forth between the two and not blending them together into a cohesive film. Overall, though, this dynamic wasn't a deal breaker.""Out of the Furnace"" isn't a terrible film and the story did have some issues that were distracting for me but, overall, I really enjoyed the film. The story is gritty and intense and the acting is fan-flippin'-tastic.Greetings, traveler!

84,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Much Too Slow Burn To Spark Complete Interest,4,6 December 2013,"Woody Harrelson's Harlan DeGroat is a bad ass, but more of a bad date At the drive-in theater with his girl, he forces a hotdog into her mouth and abuses her physically. After which, he beats up a man who felt his chivalric duty to step in Harlan won't have none of that.Meanwhile, in a town close by yet worlds apart, Christian Bale is Russell Baze, a factory worker with a sick dad; a mellow uncle; and a little brother about to go to Iraq: A lean, wound-up Casey Affleck is Rodney Baze, and like cinematic icons Charles Bronson and Clint Eastwood, he takes part in illegal warehouse fights.These quick brawls are as good as things get, for a while. The film skips around as Bale's Russell goes in and out of jail, loses his girlfriend, and argues with his determined (war vet) brother in choppy montage sequences not only seen in the prolonged theatrical trailer, but still resembling one. The blue collar siblings do seem real, extremely real, but they aren't that interesting. The best scenes in OUT OF THE FURNACE actually brings us closer to the fire – this involves the return of Harrelson's sinister Harlan, who, it turns out, is a redneck meth dealing/dope shooting psychopath and, oddly enough, the most ""fleshed-out"" character on board He does very bad things, one in particular, and this morphs our tough but tender anti-hero into the kind of guy to finally root forWhen Russell decides to do something, he got his whole heart in the matter.

87,ClaytonDavis,Scott Cooper's 'Out of the Furnace' Loses Steam but Affleck shines...,6,1 December 2013,"There are great things to admire about filmmaker Scott Cooper, who made an admirable breakthrough in 2009 when directed Jeff Bridges to an Oscar win for Crazy Heart. Adapting the film from the novel by Thomas Cobb, Cooper had a foundation to follow in bringing his story of Bad Blake to the screen. In his long-awaited follow-up Out of the Furnace, where he gathers an impressive cast that includes Christian Bale, Casey Affleck, and Woody Harrelson, the co-writer and director lays it on thick and slow, ultimately failing to sustain emotion to be carried throughout his picture.Cooper's latest tells the story of Russell Baze (played by Bale), a hard-working man who cares for his ailing father and lives with his beautiful girlfriend Lena (played by Zoe Saldana). When his war-veteran brother Rodney (played by Affleck) gets involved with illegal street- fighting and ultimately disappears, with no strong searching from authorities, Russell takes matters into his own hands.Out of the Furnace begins with such strong promise. Building a solid foundation in character development, Cooper and co-writer Brad Inglesby give Russell and Rodney authentic behaviors and a relationship that feels believable. When dealing with the film's villain Harlan DeGroat, played by the talented Woody Harrelson, the two scribes don't explore enough avenues to have him become a three-dimensional character, and not a blanket of evil caricatures that we've seen in movies before. The film opens with Harlan watching a drive-in movie and unleashing his fury on his date, and a bystander that tries to intervene. I tend to appreciate some motivation for a character's actions. You can't just make someone horrible just for the sake of your movie. Why is Harlan so evil, and most of all, why is everyone so scared of this guy, even when he's by himself?Christian Bale internalizes most of his emotions, bringing them to the brim of explosion. His Russell is damaged, losing so much of himself throughout the narrative, from family members to his own dignity. It's another great performance from the Oscar-winning Bale. Casey Affleck proves to be one of the most talented actors working today, bringing such raw rage to his broken soldier. He's the film's true highlight and most deserving of any accolades the film may receive. Regulated to one very intense and brilliantly constructed scene with Bale, Zoe Saldana proves to have the goods to go beyond any of her genre roles in ""Avatar"" and ""Star Trek"" if given the opportunity. Woody Harrelson does his best with the information he's given. He strikes fear into the viewer with just a look or a sneer, but with such little understanding about what Harlan is about, it doesn't succeed in the way it should have. Sam Shepard and Forest Whitaker are blips on the radar but have no real sense of purpose to the narrative, though they are serviceable.Cooper also does a great job capturing this rural culture of a small Pennsylvania town. Locals that work at the mill and later gather at the bar to drink their night away feels authentic. Utilizing Cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi certainly helps as the talented DP keeps our story close and intimate. Takayanagi captures the entire rooms for the audience to gaze at. Intimate bedroom behavior is placed into perspective when aligned with a shot of the room where a closet is in sight with no doors and damp, dingy walls. The score by Dickon Hinchliffe is the film's strongest technical aspect. The composer, who's worked on Rampart and Winter's Bone, has a knack for these type of films and elevating them to their true potential.As the film continues to build, to what we believe will be an epic finale of revenge, just becomes the most anti-climactic ending of the year. While Cooper formulates a well-constructed set piece, and composer Hinchliffe and DP Takayanagi are well-equipped for the challenge, the script offers no interesting or payoff to the two-hour investment the audience makes into the story. We are left just mildly and unenthusiastically satisfied.Overall, the film is simply atmospheric; showing the promise of Cooper has a filmmaker if given stronger material to direct. Out of the Furnace is a mildly impressive work but worth it's time at the movie theater.Read more reviews and awards coverage @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",Out of the Furnace

89,Just-A-Girl-14,Ending explained,8,27 August 2020,"I read mixed reviews about this movie. Some liked it, other said it was dark and boring.
I think it depends on what you might expect. If you want a typical revenge movie with lots of action, this isn't it. The movie is dark, heavy and quite frankly depressing, but it's not boring. The acting is really good and the storyline is decent. It's basically the story of two brothers who are struggling, each in his own way. It's a hard watch. There's a lot of pain and violence.I was a little confused about the meaning of the final shot but then I read an interview with Scott Cooper (the director) and here is his explanation:
""This is a man who is battling his soul and living with the consequences of violence. When he went to kill Harlan DeGroat, he thought he could have gone to prison or be killed by the police. He never thought he would get off and that the sheriff would ultimately say, 'Let me make this right'. This is a man who, whether he is prison or not, he's in prison for the rest of his life. Hopefully he will find peace and contentment at some point. I'm a very optimistic person, I hope that, ultimately, Russell Baze does find that.""From that we understand that even though the sheriff saw Russell kill DeGroat, he decided to let him go. We don't know if he did it because he felt guilty for stealing the love of his life, or because he understood the pain Russell was in or maybe just because DeGroat was a scumbag who got what he deserved. Either way, Russell is now left to live with the consequences.
Cooper also said that it's an homage to The Godfather Part II (referring to the final shot of Francis Ford Coppola's 1974 Best Picture winner). It's a moment of reflection. Something Russell will have to live with for the rest of his life.",Out of the Furnace
90,pfgpowell-1,Falls far short of the meaningful film I suspect it thinks it is. Thriller? Not in a million years,5,16 February 2014,"Can you imagine Christian Bale playing comedy? No, me neither. The thought occurred to me at some point when I was watching this rather interminable film and when it occurred to me that Bale seems to take himself and his Art just a tad too seriously. There's no doubt that Bale is a Fine Actor (the capital letters are necessary to make the point), but quite often Fine Acting is so prominent in a film that it does that film no favours at all.A roll call of Bales' fellow thespians in this monstrously worthy and ultimately rather dull film will make you wonder, as I did, where it all went wrong: Sam Shephard, Willem Dafoe, Casey Afleck, Zoe Saldana, Forest Whitaker and, not least, Woody Harrelson are all fine actors (though not, in my view, Fine Actors - do you get my distinction? In that field Christian Bale is in a league all of his own), so why is this 'thriller' about as thrilling as a Wednesday afternoon traffic bulletin. It isn't even a character study (and being one might have gone some way to justifying its length, which at four minutes short of two hours, needs at least a little justification. Lord, even the credits roll for a full eight minutes! Worthy or not?) On paper this should have, and could have, worked but it demanded a completely different treatment to what it gets from director Scott Cooper. I can't suggest exactly what that treatment might have been, but it certainly isn't this.For one thing there are far too many redundant, faux significant shots and scenes for me to be able to take it even a little bit seriously. The final shot of Christian Bale (who incidentally looks a little like a Wasp version of Christ throughout, which should tell you something) more or less sums it up: vacuous is about the only word I can think of without being gratuitously nasty.Out Of The Furnace - the title is as portentous and as pretty meaningless as the film itself - set in a dying town in the Rust Belt, inhabited by, on the one hand, honest working class men and, on the other, drug-addled working class men, will no doubt be revered by some who believe they worship Art (yes, a capital letter is yet again needed), and who might even feel there's some significance in its bleak, post-capitalistic setting. But don't believe a word of it.If after reading this review (and concluding that I am some kind of philistine) and other reviews you still feel you would like to see it for yourself, all I can say is You Have Been Warned.",Out of the Furnace
91,rooee,Out of the frying pan and into the fire,6,2 February 2014,"Cracking cast. Evocative setting. Brooding atmosphere. Archetypal themes. So why isn't Scott Cooper's film an American classic? The clue is in last year's Prisoners. That was another blue-collar drama filmed in drained autumnal tones. It was also genuinely thought-provoking, casting the viewer adrift in an enormous moral grey area. Out of the Furnace, meanwhile, goes out of its way to portray the good (Christian Bale's Russell Baze) and the evil (Woody Harrelson's Harlan DeGroat) in run-down Braddock, Pennsylvania.Russell's brother, Rodney (Casey Affleck), is flitting between the US and Iraq, becoming more and more unstable with each transition. He's in debt, fighting for cash, but he's dangerously proud, so reluctant to take a fall. His gruff mentor and debtor, John (Willem Dafoe, sporting an astonishing trouser-line), puts Rodney in touch with Harlan DeGroat, a mountain mobster who we've already seen choke a woman and beat a guy half to death. All the while, Russell is trying to persuade Rodney to live straight and work at the mill. But Rodney wants ""one last fight"". And in film language, we all know what that means.Out of the Furnace is a recap of a lot of ideas we've seen before, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it excels at none of them. It's a stone-cold average thriller elevated by A-list performances, particularly those playing the Baze brothers. Bale still has that reckless energy that made his performances in Rescue Dawn and Harsh Times so compelling, while Affleck's murmuring rage is used to excellent effect.Harrelson is properly threatening in the bad guy role – the film's best scene is when Russell and his uncle (Sam Shepherd) visit Harlan's home: a caricatured den of iniquity reminiscent of Se7en and Harry Brown. There are nods to The Deer Hunter also, in an extended hunting scene, and in the smoke-plumed townscape of the degraded industrial East. And let's not forget Winter's Bone, which depicted a similar descent into the moral mush of mountain folk, except with greater originality and less eye-rolling machismo.Overall, there are individual elements to admire in this film, but they don't add up to a satisfying whole. It feels more like a Greatest Hits of 1970s American Cinema than its own thing. Which is a pity, because it is undeniably well made on a technical level, and driven by excellent performances across the board.",Out of the Furnace
92,dansview,Grittiness was Only Purpose,6,8 November 2015,"If you like gratuitous violence and a simple revenge plot, then you probably will like this one. I felt like they were heaping on the grittiness for its' own sake, as if that was the sole purpose of the film.Let's get something straight. Even in the most depressed towns, people are raising nice families, taking piano lessons, doing volunteer work, and coaching Little League. Not everyone is some depressing burnout getting into trouble. This film like many that take place in depressed towns, stacked the deck.It's actually bordering on anti-American. We are supposed to believe that a good-looking, healthy kid who did four tours in Iraq cannot find a regular job? OK, it's true that he admitted that he didn't really want one. But then why did he give that speech about serving his country and getting nothing out of it? You don't pay rent during service. He should have plenty of money saved, and he probably has skills. I didn't see any scenes of him going to a VA transitional meeting.Like others have said, there is no development of the female character. Who the heck is she and why is she with some tattooed loser? How long had they been together? Did either of these guys go to college? Were they brought up in the church? Let's see some of their childhood friends.Tell us more about this mountain community in Jersey. Was that made up, or is there such a place there with hillbillies? The violence in this one is way too much for me, and should be too much for any normal person. You'd have to be a sadist to want to watch bare knuckles fighting and guys getting shot in the head, etc.OK, there was a simplicity to the revenge plot that could be satisfying to those who don't crave more. Nice use of cinematography to capture the atmosphere of a nowhere town.Stay away from this one unless you love violence in movies and identify with the down-and-out propaganda.",Out of the Furnace
93,in1984,"Impressive, disturbing, yet incomplete",8,25 December 2013,"7.5 of 10. Impressively disturbing, but the story has gaps and seems like the story framework of someone who was involved in the fighting or excessive drug use, which doesn't fit with the rest of the story.I'm sure this film will get lots of recommendations as to how it could have been better. Part of the reason for that is that it's intriguing and has a solid plot and setting with exceptional actors, so we want it to be perfect instead of the sometimes disconnected mess it is.As a whole, we get an unusual, mysterious half-tragedy of the already melted pot of America outside the normal large city/small town construct. I'm guessing from the very limited soundtrack (playing Bruce Springsteen's Born in the USA at some point would help tie the story together for many people) and some sharp shifts in the story, it ran into budget issues that leaves it from feeling complete.",Out of the Furnace
94,shawneofthedead,"A slow burn that never really catches fire, but it's compelling viewing nonetheless.",6,19 February 2014,"It's hard to decide just what to make of Out Of The Furnace, a potboiler of a drama that grapples with the complexities of family, war, violence, rage and vengeance - stewed together in an uneasy blend that works, more or less, but never really takes off. That the cast is so unreservedly excellent makes it even tougher to dismiss Out Of The Furnace as an awkwardly-scripted curio. They're so good - even with shakily-developed characters and dialogue - that the film often comes off as better than it is.Russell Baze (Christian Bale) is a loving brother and filial son who works hard at the local steel mill to bring home the bacon for his girlfriend Lena (Zoe Saldana). He just wants his war-shattered brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) to get his act together instead of pissing away money he doesn't have on gambling and drinking. When tragedy strikes, Russell must pick up the pieces of his life again - only to discover that his brother has had an unfortunate run-in with ultra-creepy thug Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson), and the authorities are unlikely to be much help in finding out what really happened.The story is interesting, but the script somewhat less so - apart from Rodney, the characters are sketched in broad strokes and archetypes, and points are driven home with little care for subtlety. We're treated to numerous instances of Russell's innate goodness: he spruces up the house while Rodney is getting roughed up in yet another illegal brawl, and studiously avoids shooting a deer when he goes hunting with his uncle Gerald (Sam Shepard). There aren't a whole lot of grey areas, either, when it comes to Harlan: he's mean and vicious without the hint of even a lost or broken soul to add some complexity to his character.And yet, Out Of The Furnace remains fascinating because director Scott Cooper has assembled a truly astounding cast. Bale sinks completely into his role, somehow making it believable that Russell's final-act resolve is not wildly out of character. Meanwhile, Affleck has some riveting moments as the boy broken by the demons living within him. Harrelson, for all that his character is ridiculously overblown, snarls his way through the film - menacing and cowing even the likes of Willem Dafoe, who plays a small-time crook trying his best (and failing) to protect Rodney. Saldana's reaction to Russell when he returns to her, after time spent far away, is heartbreaking, and Forest Whitaker has a small role as a cop trying to keep Russell from going off the rails in search of Rodney. Collectively, the ensemble make the clunky dialogue and odd genre changes work.This makes for a strange but compelling drama - a film that limps and shuffles along as it shifts from brotherly conflict to a brutal game of cat-and-mouse, all of it underscored by a soundtrack of extreme despair. There are good ideas and performances on display, but these often get snowed under by a script that doesn't give its characters room to grow and live. As a result, Out Of The Furnace frequently feels under-cooked, although its cast does a pretty good job of turning up the heat just enough to keep viewers hooked.",Out of the Furnace
95,TheMarwood,Drama: The Movie,5,15 May 2014,"Out of the Furnace really wants those Oscar nominations. It's self important, gritty (with extra layers of grit too) and fills its slate with hard working A listers. Casey Affleck comes out the best here, and Bale and a throughly unpleasant Harrelson are in good form too. But the film is bereft of ideas and piles the drama on a few uninteresting characters, until it's telegraphed miles away what will happen to certain characters and the obvious bad choices the others will make. The whole film is pretty sour and director Scott Cooper tries to make a throwback to gritty smaller scaled character pieces of the 70s, but never makes this a story that needed to be told in the first place. These are unsubtle characters that are written to make make overly dramatic life choices that usually end in prolonged agony and death and heavy servings of drama do not make a great film if the foundation it's built on feel phony.

If the scene were done properly it would be a decent hook and set up for what some people are like. Real (figurative) werewolves operate on cliches, stress reactions, and adrenaline...

The mentality that their poop don't stink.Apparently everyone in the very good case thought the director could give 'em an Oscar, like he did with Jeff Bridges.This thing was a book, not a movie. About 25 minutes of movie here. Started after the the brother Affleck is killed, a process that you could do in ten minutes vs. the 75 minutes they actually took. Very little in this was relevant to the story, which was revenge.Maybe I'm not a legal scholar, but I thought it odd that Bale's character hit a car that was backing out into the road. Why did Bale go to jail? It was clear it was the fault of the other car.Also, after several years of carrying Dafoe's debt, why did Harrelson decide to kill him? I know he was bats't crazy but I don't accept that in a movie.And why did Dafoe carry that debt for so long? You'd think he'd want to divest himself of such a nutcase in Harrelson.And Bale's silly-little plan that got the bartender killed. That kind of takes the air out of any credibility of the ""hero.""Don't go. Don't rent. Not worth the wait. Probably a good director if he isn't also writing.",Out of the Furnace
98,trublu215,"In the vein of The Deer Hunter, Out of the Furnace captures the hopelessness of a nation",9,21 November 2013,"Scott Cooper wowed us with Crazy Heart, his directorial debut that nabbed Jeff Bridges his long awaited Best Actor Oscar in 2009. Cooper has waited 4 years to bring us something that is very much so in the vein of his last film. Out of the Furnace tells the bleak story of Russell Baze and his determination to discover the truth about his little brother, Rodney, after he goes missing without a trace. The strength of this film relies on the performances, hands down. There is no real plot twist, there is no memorable camera work, this is a film that is built upon the strengths of its lead actors, especially Christian Bale and Woody Harrelson. This is a throwback to 1970 style cinema where story and acting trump anything technically. The story is generic but it never feels quite as stale when you're watching it because no matter how many times we've seen this story, we get lost in Christian Bale's performance. He is a man of many facial expressions and very few words and that really plays to his benefit in this film. It shows that, while Bale can be as goofy as Dickie Ecklund in The Fighter, he can also be as dark and ominous as Russell Baze. We really see that Christian Bale is becoming one of the best actors of this generation and with Out of the Furnace, he solidifies that. While Bale delivers a dark and gritty portrayal of a man with nothing to lose, it is Woody Harrelson that plays Curtis DeGroat, a sick, backwoods, meth- dealing, brute and Harrelson plays him perfectly. Without giving any spoilers away, there are a couple scenes (one of which involves a prostitute) that are so unflinchingly brutal that features DeGroat at his most nefarious. These are the roles that Harrelson relishes in, and this film goes to show that nobody can play a villain quite like Harrelson. He's the guy you love to hate and in Out of the Furnace, I have to say he plays DeGroat with a pitch-perfect tone that it makes you wonder where the line is drawn in his mind. You lose yourself in the scenes with Harrelson because he is just that good at playing a sadistic psychopath with murderous tendencies. The rest of the cast, including Casey Affleck, are outstanding. However, this film showcases Bale and Harrelson as definite Oscar hopefuls and it uses that to its advantage. While we see enough of Affleck, Saldana and Whitaker, the film belongs to Bale and Harrelson. This is a bleak and brutal film with fantastic performances across the board. It is far from the feel good movie of the year, quite the opposite, it is probably the most depressing next to Prisoners, but just because you won't leave the theater with a grin doesn't mean you should skip this.",Out of the Furnace

100,ghost_dog86,How are you going to pick Forest Whitaker over Christian Bale?!,5,12 December 2013,"Shockingly, ""Out of the Furnace"" is from the mind of very competent (but maybe one hit wonder) writer/director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart). I mean, the story was flawed, the script was highly flawed and the direction waswell, the direction was alright. BUT, the acting from this award worthy ensemble (Christian Bale, Woody Harrelson, Casey Affleck, Zoe Saldana, Sam Shepard, Willem Dafoe and Forest Whitaker) was so on point, it was enough to make me give ""Out of the Furnace"" a slight recommendation.Synopsis: Set in a small, economically depressed town (the type of place Brue Springsteen sings about) ""Out of the Furnace"" tells the story of a troubled Iraq War veteran (Affleck) who mysteriously disappears after getting mixed up with a backwoods, but still very ruthless crime lord (Harrelson). Now, Russell (Bale) the vet's hard working, family oriented, but ""dealt a couple of bad hands in life"" older brother (also, the kind of guy Bruce Springsteen sings about) will stop at nothing to find out what has become of his only sibling.While this sounds like the makings of a pretty compelling heartland story, the script is filled with the most egregious of gaping plot holes, plausible situations that come to illogical conclusions (the scene when Bale's character buys drugs was obviously written by someone who had never purchased drugs before) and many coincidental plot contrivances which had me suspecting that co-writer's Cooper and Brad Ingelsby hadn't fully outlined the script before writing it. Of course the character who is about to die ""accidentally"" pocket dials the police, so that they now have proof of the entire murder. That probably happens all the time.More problems: During the first 45 minutes this film meanders, telling three or four different stories before settling on the revenge story that everyone in the theater came to see. And don't get me started on the ending! An ending which was so overly dramatic (without earning it) and so drawn out, that I almost got up and left the theater.Again, on the other hand, there is the acting, which is all around electric. Even though Whitaker puts on a ridiculous accent, even though this is the worst (the least greatest) white-trash performance Bale has given to date and even though Zoe Saldana is in this movie, the acting (especially the performances from Harrelson and Affleck) absolutely save this film from dying a straight to DVD style death.Final Thought: Aside from a handful of standout sequences (maybe 3) and a slew of ""top of their game"" performances, ""Out of the Furnace"" is strangely disappointing as far as its presentation, focus and overall point. As much as I enjoyed the acting, there is no reason to spend a cold night in line and eleven dollars on ""Out of the Furnace"". What you have here is definitely a ""wait for redbox"" situation.",Out of the Furnace
101,nesfilmreviews,Characters clearly take precedence here with admirable results.,6,6 December 2013,"In director Scott Cooper's ""Out of the Furnace,"" characters clearly take precedence over plot while maintaining a subdued tone that highlights some fantastic performances. However, it's constrained by its meager, inescapable storyline of vengeance that ultimately disappoints. ""Furnace"" is a much darker and less audience- friendly package than Cooper's Oscar-winning 2009 debut ""Crazy Horse."" His second film captures the essence of an America slowly crumbling amid economic decay. Events unfold in ""Out of the Furnace"" with a violent, unpredictable force that life often presents, as opposed to your standard, reassuring screenplay.Filmed in the working-class eastern Pittsburgh neighborhood of Braddock, Pennsylvania, Russell Baze (Christian Bale) has followed in his terminally ill father's footsteps by making a living at the town's steel mill. After serving a four-year sentence for a manslaughter conviction, Russell attempts to put his life back together. He keeps a low profile, but must contend with his old girlfriend Lena (Zoe Saldana), who is now living with police chief Wesley Barnes (Forest Whitaker). His brother, Rodney Jr. (Casey Affleck), is an Iraq War vet with PTSD and gambling issues, who chooses to enter a backwoods fight club as a means of earning money. Rodney and a small-time promoter John Petty (Willem Dafoe) screw things up and are unable to pay a ruthless criminal named Curtis DeGroat (Woody Harrelson). Refusing to acknowledge the dangers that lie ahead, Rodney finds himself in grave danger with unforgiving men. Russell, who is trying to reorganize his life, now sets out to protect his younger sibling.When all is said and done, the movie boils down to a deceptively simple tale of two brothers coupled with a barebones tale of pure, unadulterated vigilantism. Though Cooper consistently uses formal parallelism to link the brothers' dual narratives, the last shot of the film may be its most telling, as it speaks to their constant, all- encompassing sense of imprisonment.Cooper maintains the threat of violence with a guarded presence of despair from the beginning, which can get difficult for some and is often heartbreaking to watch. Cooper isn't exactly breaking new ground here with ""Furnace,"" and he has a tendency to lean on contrivances and misdirection in place of suspense at times. However, his command is admirable, and the performances of Bale, Affleck, and Harrelson unquestionably warrant high praise. For those who like their revenge served cold, ""Out of the Furnace"" is the very essence of performance.",Out of the Furnace

Although its formal aspects (views, acting, photography, editing) are of the highest imaginable levels in 21th century filmmaking (cast and producers are made exclusively by top artists and you can feel how they really put outstanding quality in the movie) is the moral content, nonetheless, that made this production most noteworthy to me. In 1950 Theodor Adorno felt that after the Shoah moral principles had to be re-written. This movie makes you think that Sixth Commandment 'Thou Shalt not Kill' which we all perceived as the most basic of all when we were kids, can be meaningless in the desperate reality of angry men.I usually prefer comedies.

And I can't complain, I got what I wanted, Bale is always believable and strong in it's acting in every movie, Harrelson was my favourite in this one, Affleck and Dafoe excellent, and even Whitaker that I usually find overacted was according the general acting level. The characterizations of the actors and the setting along with the photography and sound/music gave the right atmosphere to the movie. But then, after what you are expecting to happen happens, it leaves you with a taste of nonconformity because of how it's all left and a bit of lack of strength in the end. At least that's what I felt, and why I didn't give it a better score, as until the end I was thinking of rating it a bit higher. The last shot is there not to leave anyone guessing, but I see that for many people wasn't enough... I think it's a strong scene to closes the story and not have to imagine what happens next to the final scene.It could be better, with all that potential on screen, but was a good couple of hours enjoying god actors and wouldn't say it didn't worth the time.Very good acting, good photography and music, fair writing and story.Good movie overall, but leaves you thinking it could be better..",Out of the Furnace
104,tigerfish50,Out of the Corn Factory,2,28 April 2017,"'Out of the Furnace' shows how fine acting can temporarily conceal serious shortcomings in a film. For about twenty minutes, Christian Bale's performance suggests this tale of brotherly love and Rust Belt revenge might have somewhere to go, but the story slides swiftly into cliché and sentimentality. The introduction depicts steelworker Russell slaving at the mill, tending his dying dad and murmuring sweet nothings into his girlfriend's ear. Meanwhile his unstable Iraq-vet sibling Rodney drinks, fights and gambles himself deeper into trouble and debt. The brothers act out their relationship with good-guy Russell constantly bailing out bad-boy Rodney, as a troop of low-life villains and blue collar stalwarts wait in the wings for their cues.By the time Russell's saintly selflessness has cost him his sweetheart and a stretch in the slammer, this formulaic film has lost all credibility. While the long-suffering hero is locked up in the joint, Rodney gets out of his depth with some toothless meth-dealing hillbillies - and after Russell is released, he finds himself obliged to settle scores with the rural racketeers.

106,tequila101,A Powerful flick to finish the Year 2013,10,23 January 2014,"In my honest opinion, many films are released over every year where they all try to achieve many art forms and film techniques which include acting, cinematography, lighting, sound, camera angles, story and meaning. For me, the majority of films I've seen come out throughout the last two or so years have only had minor success in some of these areas, where they don't achieve the full potential they can. However, when I saw the epic trailer for ""Out of the Furnace"", I thought to myself that this film will be potentially good but nothing overall special. Boy was I wrong.""Out of the Furnace"" was not only one of those masterpieces to end the year of 2013 in a successful way, but it was also one of the most well round housed flicks I have seen in a very, very long time. I mean I honestly cannot say that this film was going to be as excellent as it was. It really threw me and blew me away. The elements that I just mentioned in the previous paragraph (film techniques) is what ""Out of the Furnace"" achieves. Within the first five minutes, I knew that I was in for a good ride when the beating had occurred, the symphonic and gentle music started to rise in the opening titles, and then we finally see Christian Bale doing what he obviously does best. The film in my opinion achieved all art forms, and why? I'll tell you why now.The cast is just a powerhouse of knock out performances and overall just a strong binding cast which I believe had worked through and through, and had formed together to try and give the best of their talents to us film viewers. I thoroughly enjoyed Christian Bale's performance the most as he was a life character that I could relate to and love and conform with. Sort of speak to in a way, that is why I liked his performance so much. The cinematography was a nice, powerful contrast between de-saturation and darkness with a whole meal mix of warm, vibrant brightness which I believe has an expression of it's own, where whatever the scene was portraying and presenting, the cinematography would slowly integrate and intertwine with what the film, characters and plot were communicating to us.Even though the story may not be the most original thing in film story-telling, I thoroughly believe that the way the film's scenes and scenarios were paced, and also the direction of where the director wanted to take the film's characters made the plot ever so enjoyable to watch. The situation with the father, Woody Harsen and even Bale's ex-girlfriend were excellent sources of sub-plot points which contrast so well into the story. I believe the plot-line that grabbed me the most was when Bale's character had to look after his brother as he was merrily in a mental state after he had been at war. I think that the story was key success here.Overall, I believe that ""Out of the Furnace"" was a grand way to close the films of 2013, despite two or so films being released out of it, I still think that it was not only one of the best to conclude 2013 but also just one of the most powerful pieces of cinema I have seen in a long time coming. It's expression-ant, it's well acted and overall well told from various perspectives. Not to mention that musical score has a mind of it's own. It is easily now one of my favorite films in my books.10/10",Out of the Furnace

The scenes between Bale and Affleck felt completely natural, as if they were real brothers just hanging and chatting.I felt the pace was too slow, however, which caused my attention to wander away. After reaching the end of the movie I realised they could have made it half an hour and still managed not to miss any element of the story. It really is disappointing that I'd spent so much time observing nothing!What really disappointed me, however, was Hollywood doing it's thing. It felt to me as if Hollywood was sitting in the wings throughout the filming, probably as frustrated as me with the slow pace. Eventually, near the end, someone gave Hollywood the ok and they sprang into action. The hero of the movie who, up until this point had been calm and deliberate in everything he did, reverted to stereotypical Hollywood stupidity...He was a hunter. A man who knows his guns and knows how to use them. He has a scoped rifle in his hands and he is only yards away from the guy who killed his brother. He is also out in the open...

It's got a great cast, including Christian Bale, Casey Affleck, Woody Harrelson and Willem Dafoe, but it just turns into a fairly by the numbers revenge movie. I think Christian Bales performance is one of the biggest strengths this movie has. He really plays the character well and you feel sympathetic towards him. Bale always gives a good performance and this movie is no exception. He really nails the role. Casey Affleck also does a pretty good job in his roll. He has a lot of mental trauma and he shows that pretty well. Willem Dafoe has a smaller role but is pretty interesting to watch on screen. And Woody Harrelson... well... He's good, but he plays the typical bad guy character he's played before, doing that weird thing with his lips that he always does. An issue I did often noticed with a lot of the characters was that they tended to talk quietly making it sometimes hard to understand them. It seemed prevalent throughout the film and was quite annoying. The plot is generally a basic revenge tale with just a few little unique points throughout. It also seems to fit well in the ""Crappy Small American Town"" genre of films that has been popular recently, with films like Joe and Mud being recently released and having that same kind of vibe (That being a lot of hicks in a crappy town). It has elements too it that really could have make for a unique and captivating film, but those elements are few and far between and it ends up being kind of boring. I just kept thinking of all the other great revenge movies out there that I would rather be watching.I was pretty disappointed in this movie. I wanted it to be great but it just let me know. I couldn't really recommend this except if you're interested in seeing Christian Bales performance.",Out of the Furnace

It also has a glacial pace, and seems like a 5 hour experience, a real slog. The only bright spot is Woody Harrelson, playing an uber-hillbilly who is a down and dirty scumbag, he shows his usual great range when compared to his recent work as a very different character in the blockbuster Hunger Games movies.

While the cinematography was great and the acting jobs themselves were good (except CA; who even though he is a poor actor, is still better than his brother by leaps and bounds), you continuously start to ask yourself where the real plot twister is that will elevate this from just another ""old brother takes revenge on his murdered brother"" motif. However, this moment never comes. In fact, by the time you realize it is ""that"" movie, and nothing more, you just want the act itself to happen, since maybe the true life of the movie will exist after said act of revenge takes place.

111,FilmMuscle,A Promising Start That Leads to Run-Of-The-Mill Fare,7,8 December 2013,"An all-star cast, comprising Christian Bale, Casey Affleck, Woody Harrelson, Forest Whitaker, Willem Dafoe, and Zoe Saldana (wow!), is cast into the cavernous of troubles. Two brothers- one a former solider who served in Iraq (Rodney, played by Casey Affleck) and the other an impoverished factory worker (Russell, played by Christian Bale) - embark on vastly disparate paths. Their relationship has lost its bygone flare, considering Rodney's extensively damaged psyche and his desire to stray away from standard work, instead choosing to make money off of brutal street fighting and gambling. When he asininely involves himself with ruthless wagering criminals (led by Woody Harrelson), all circumstances invert and numerous lives are consequently affected. The first half of the film carries an incredibly strong premise and features a truly gripping narrative that focuses on character development/characterization, which compellingly leads to the ultimate predicament. In essence, a major portion of the film's enticement should be accredited to the exceptionally powerful performances, and Casey Affleck remarkably fights for that recognition by showcasing his deteriorating soul. I mention Affleck specifically because he rarely receives ample praise for his impressive renditions. Furthermore, in that first half, the pacing is smooth and adequate as you sympathize with these distressed characters and are stunned by a sudden unfortunate incident after another, personalities still further strengthening. The arresting visual look of the film partially produces that final element of attraction to the end product. As we proceed though and the midpoint sequence comes and goes, the pacing suddenly decelerates and we encounter additional characters and arcs that are frankly unnecessary and don't benefit the picture in any way. Once the credits roll, you don't feel like Forest Whitaker's character deserved the amount of screen time he ended up with, portraying an archetypal police officer and barely anything more. We're met with countless prolonged and dispensable scenes that are more stereotypical than beneficial to the film's substance and overall plot. The excitement of the first half, fueled by unpredictability and conflict, takes a nosedive and the thriller chooses to tediously capture the lengthy search for the villain alternatively. Finally, the audience is presented with an anticlimactic conclusion that again feels far too familiar and unsatisfying despite the enthralling story beforehand. There's essentially nothing unique in its final act to induce the amount of memorability that the first half accomplished since it ends like your typical run-of-the-mill revenge flick. In sum, Scott Cooper effectively conveys the rural and destitute atmosphere, and the film is genuinely gritty and honest in its depiction of labor and the unrewarding lives that are led by courageous soldiers upon returning home. These are the lives of a considerably high percentage of America's population and the movie's thematic material speaks volumes on this controversial and profoundly relevant matter. Out of the Furnace certainly forces its viewers to react in particularly shocking sequences, eliciting a variety of emotions. Even though the film's quality noticeably degrades while it advances, this tale will undoubtedly provoke intrigue and fervor until the screen fades to black.",Out of the Furnace
112,DanLives1980,A modern day Deer Hunter-esque powerhouse,9,2 June 2014,"Having just finished watching the DVD, I wish I'd kept a tally. To mark how many times this movie gave me goosebumps! Out of the Furnace is a movie I've waited a year to see for many reasons. One, Christian Bale is known for applying his powerful performances and acting methods to big budget movies, but it's the likes of The Machinist and The Fighter that really tested his mettle. Settling down after The Dark Knight Rises, I knew he'd want a role that could connect with audiences without going all out and transforming himself into something almost otherworldly.Two, I'm almost dying of thirst for dramatic and well-produced films that stand alone against big budget action movies, without trying to appeal to the same narrow minded audiences. Three, LA and NYC are not the only places that exist in the American Cinematic Universe. There is much adventure to be had in the places you don't want them to see. And four, check out this amazing cast! Bale plays Russell Baze, a man living in a blue collar rust burg with girlfriend Lena. He works at the local steel mill, the same place that is currently killing his terminally ill father and his brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) is an edgy kid who resorts to making problems in the attempt to solve problems.When a cruel twist of fate puts Russell in prison, his brother does two tours with the US Army and comes back psychologically and physically damaged. When Russell gets out of prison, he begins to see just how much damage when he learns that Rodney has taken to the illegal fighting circuits to maintain himself.With one more fight on the cards, he promises Russell that he's going to quit and change for the better, but upon meeting Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson) a psychotic backwoods New Jersey hillbilly, Rodney doesn't come back home, leaving Russell with little hope and even littler choice; risk his freedom and go back to prison in the pursuit of natural justice, or sit back and do nothing! Since I refuse to spoil anything at this point, I could tell you about all of the characters and what they're about, but I'd rather you be pleasantly surprised and blown away just like I was.Zoe Saldana is such a superb actress and proves it ever more as Lena, Casey Affleck blew me away. I did not expect such an intense and brooding performance and there are times all Bale can do is stand back in awe. Sam Sheperd makes a welcome return as the Baze brothers' uncle Red and anybody else you're familiar with here (Willem Dafoe, forest Whitaker) are solid. Harrelson as Harlan would be effortlessly evil if he weren't so intensely despicable at times. He literally screams psycho hillbilly white trash.There are so many moments in this movie that are so conventionally sound in their portrayal, delivering stark moments of drama that really hit home, and that's this movie's biggest strength. It's rooted so deep in reality that it can seem laborious at times but it's all very much worth the sitting. The setting of broke and broken Rust Belt America is perfect not only for its subtext, but also for its sense of adventure.Even though this isn't a clear-cut Deer Hunter type film, it has many of the same elements and its sprawling backdrops are a huge part of that. The only thing that I thought could have been better was its minimalist and often droning soundtrack, as the credited Dickon Hinchliffe seemed to want to go the documentarian route. This movie needed a theme and thankfully Pearl Jam's Release with Eddie Vedder's hauntingly apt vocals provided that theme.That is as much as I can tell you without spoiling Into The Furnace, but I hope it's enough to make you go see this film and realise that it's much much more than even I make it out to be!",Out of the Furnace

So back to this film, been a long time since I did a review, but as I said this movie needs some love. I will make this review simple and to the point. The story was very good, the acting and casting was excellent, including an Oscar worthy moment from Casey Affleck. The direction was well done, it was very dark and gritty and a realistic portrayal of middle class white trash life. There is something major in the beginning which happens to Christian Bale that never seems to figure into the rest of the film, in any major sense. There is a plot development that resulted from that event, that existed but wasn't defining to the film. Although, it did just simply exist, which if you want a story that doesn't have to have everything wrapped up with a bow adds to the realism of the film.

116,The_moan_of_all_moans,Out of the Furnace and onto the ice.,7,30 January 2014,"Christian Bale is easily one of the best actors around today; hands down. His ability to take a role and run with it has been evident for over a decade now. Critics had been stating this particular role as the finest in his career so far. What is it with these critics having to over exaggerate everything? They take a film and set it up for a fall by making statements like that; especially when it doesn't come to fruition. So no, it isn't his finest performance, not by a long shot. ""The Machinist""? ""American Psycho""? ""The Fighter""? Even ""American Hustle""; all better performances and there are more that outdo this one.It is a good film, but take what most of the ""professional"" critics say with a pinch of salt; everything is bigger in their eyes, everything is at its pinnacle. And this is just another notch on their naive nature. Bale and Casey Affleck don't bounce off each other as well as i thought they would. There is one really powerful scene between them, but apart from that there is not a great deal of connection. For me the best part was Woody Harrelson's part as Harlon DeGroat. Woody is one of the most under-rated actors around. I truly feel he has the ability to excel in any role. He is very versatile and he can play a fun loving guy just as well as he can a psychopath. But although he was great they didn't use him as well as they ought to. All the characters where underwhelming and it had an unmovable unimportance clinging onto it throughout. They fly through the story at the start and for me it was completely unnecessary. It would have been logical to start at the 30 minute mark. it would be fair to say the first 30 minutes where somewhat untied to the rest of the film. The events that happened could have been integrated into the film from that point. I did enjoy this film and i think 7/10 is a fair review; some good acting, a good message of brotherhood and family, but it was a tad disappointing.

118,s_campanale,Ever heard this one before? - An utterly fresh and utterly un-cliché revenge drama!,6,6 February 2014,"We've only just got this in the UK, but better late than neverThis is one of those 'blue collar' movies that depict the bleak hopelessness of the working classes and the ceaseless grey misery and despair that is their life. Such films are inevitably always made by directors from nice comfortable upper middle class backgrounds that see the 'inferior' life of the workers this way and go out of their way to squeeze empathy for it. You can always tell the ones made by directors from actual working backgrounds because, although life is tough and hard, they tend to be lively, full of laughter and gaiety and making the best of things, because that is the natural spirit of the working class. This belongs squarely in the 'piss and cardboard' (as one British comic once called the genre) category, though as the film progresses, you realise all this blue collar misery is just an arty backdrop for a very routine, very unoriginal, seen it all before story of 'revenge'. It's set in Braddock, a rapidly diminishing and impoverished steel town, where father follows son into the mills. Our 'hero' is Russell Baze, (Christian Bale) a tough but good hearted working man looking after his sick old pa, loving his hot sweet teacher girlfriend Lena (Zoe Saldana) and keeping his troublesome younger brother Rodney out of trouble, as far away from a cliché as you can get (Ha!) But, utterly unexpectedly, he gets drunk one night and kills a family in a driving accident and does time in jail. Coming out, to everyone's shock, his girl has done him wrong and shacked up with the much older town Sheriff Barnes (Forest Whittaker) while Rodney has fought in Iraq where he comes back 'all messed up' and is working for local (but good hearted) hood John Petty (Willem Defoe) as a bare knuckle boxer taking dives, but the the red mist takes over and he accidentally finishes the guy – The freshness of all this astounds the unprepared viewer, who was expecting only hoary old stock situations, but then enters evil Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson) a bald in bred psycho meth addict mountain man from 'the mountains' who is always looking for a fight and administers violent beatings on a whim, and his gang of evil grizzled unshaven meth dealing mountain men from 'the mountains'. Petty owes him a favour, and Russell wants a shot at the big time, so he takes up there and gives him a tough fight, but DeGroat is not satisfied and Russell ends up caught in the two criminal's crossfire. With no news of his fate, and Sheriff Barnes proving impotent and incapable, Russell and his wise old hunting partner uncle 'Red' (Sam Shepard) decide to take justice in their own hands and go looking for his younger brother, moved by old memories of them playing as children as seen in scratchy 8mm film. This utterly unexpected and original plot concludes with a showdown between noble Russell and evil psycho DeGroat in a disused steel mill!The main problem with this film is that, as the above précis shows, it is a painfully Deja vu scenario that has been around since movies began, and director Cooper adds nothing to it. What's more, it is more suited to the 'revenge in the bayou/mountains' sort of movie that were popular during the 80s and 90s, yet here Cooper tries to make it some sort of achingly prosaic message drama and grand existential odyssey, succeeding in (A) making the film painfully dull and slow for those seeking a revenge thriller and (B) making it look ridiculously pretentious and laughable for those seeking a meaty drama. Hence it falls between two bar stools and breaks its nose, which at least is amusing to watch on one level!The cast though are good, especially young Casey Affleck as Rodney, who has most of the arc and the real drama. Bale tries to be a noble everyman but ends up looking catatonic, and you wonder if he sustained brain damage in the opening accident. Harrelson plays the stock 'evil psycho' well, but he is never menacing nor terrifying enough to justify the fear his character supposedly inspires. Saldana is barely in the movie at all, and is probably just there for the name, but to her credit she 'glams down' and looks credible as a real person. Whittaker plays Whittaker again, but Sam Shepard injects some nobility into his noble uncle role.Sadly none of the characters ring true and it is obvious neither writer nor director really know small town blue collar workers or tough 'mountain men' (from the mountains) who surely are far more complex and human than these stock archetypes. It's died a death in the US and its week long performance in the UK is hardly inspiring thus far, but it is not an unwatchable movie, just a frustrating one.",Out of the Furnace

The movie in my opinion was not that strong but the amazing cast with their potent performances propelled this movie from a potential 6 to a 10. Harrelson's character was just top notch. This man never ceases to amaze me. His talent is boundless. He embodied his character so completely that I forgot I was looking at Woody Harrelson.Christian Bale personified the oxymoron thunderous silence through the entire film. Everything he did, every look he gave, every word he uttered was just so powerful. As a matter of fact he did not have to say anything. He could have gone through the entire movie and not said a word because he did not need a script to convey his message. I would love to see Bale do another Terrance Malick film where he is the lead.Casey Affleck's performance was stellar. Who knew he was so talented.

120,StonedMagician,Below Average: 4.5,4,28 July 2019,"It's always sad to me when a film manages to attract a great cast, and squanders a good amount of its potential. It has happened before, of course, usually with movies like Valentine's Day and Movie 43. And though Out of the Furnace squanders less of that potential than some, it's a shame to see the talents of Christian Bale, Forest Whitaker, and Woody Harrelson applied to such one-note characters. From the writer and director of the Oscar-winning Crazy Heart, I expected better than this leaden, safe revenge thriller. None of the characters spend any time doing anything other than growling and glaring at each other, so that eventually everything starts to blur together into a tedious collection of scenes that fail to congeal into a whole. But it's not all bad news. The film is well directed, and appropriately gritty, and though the actors are hugely overqualified, they do well enough with what they're given. But this isn't enough to make Out of the Furnace anything other than a gratuitously slow and predictable movie that thinks of itself as being more than it is.",Out of the Furnace

When the credits rolled I was left wondering what the point of sitting through these two hours actually was.Casey Affleck is certainly a good actor, but he has yet to star in a great movie.

And there's another type of movie, small stories, small people living work-a-day lives. People we know and can see something of ourselves in. This is a movie like that. Life isn't high-tech most of the time, its more of a grind whether we like to admit it or not. Most people are scrabbling around to make their lives work, to keep their heads above the water, to have some fun once in a while. They get lucky sometimes but most of the time the only luck coming their way is bad luck. Enjoy the good and deal with the bad. This movie tells a good story about small people caught up in some real bad luck. No big flashy CGI here, just good solid acting. It shows a part of the U.S. we might not be so happy to see.

124,pcrprimer,"Weak ending underwhelms, an otherwise really good movie",8,7 March 2014,"We are immediately thrust into the lives of the Baze family as Christian Bale's character is the hardworking older brother, and Casey Affleck is the troubled younger brother. Right from the Eddie Vedder song on the intro credits, and muted colours of blues and greys, it was clear the tone that the movie would take. It really helps capture the bleakness of the environment. Once again, Bale completely loses himself in the character of the blue collar steel mill worker. After reading that he actually learned how to work a blast furnace for the role, I can see why he really seemed like the character. Also his interaction with the drug dealer would convince anyone that his character had had a rough past. Woody Harrelson is truly menacing, right from the introduction in the drive-in theatre, to when he is testing Affleck and intimidating Defoe. The scenes of his town were very tense, and rank up there with the scenes of LA in Training Day. It elicited a similar uncomfortable response from the viewer that anything could happen. There were a lot of famous faces and everyone delivered, however the ending seemed to be too easy and Hollywood. The symbolism of the deer did not go unnoticed.

It reminded me of a really bad Steven Seagal film from the 80's. However, it wasn't that enjoyable. The characters are all cliché stereotypes and in the absence of any real writing talent, the writer uses absurd scenarios to keep the story limping along (i.e. the accidentally dialed phone that recorded the entire crime in perfect clarity). Then, of course, there is the typical love story forced into a story where it didn't belong. I could go on and on but I have to mention the pathetic story flaws. For example, a guy convicted of vehicular manslaughter and felony DUI would not have a valid driver's license upon release from prison several years later.

It's grim stuff. This one kept my interest all the way and the acting and cinematography is good. It's not a bad film at all but it's also not exactly the most exciting film I've ever seen.

129,kevandeb,Like A Meal Without Wine,8,3 January 2014,"Firstly, Christian Bale, like Sean Penn cannot really put a foot wrong in my book, having said that, I was disappointed with his character, far too much focus on mood shots and little on character development. Unlike other reviewers, a slow burn when cast correctly is a joy to watch and for the first hour I thought we had another 'Deerhunters', 'Nil By Mouth', 'Mystic River' & 'North Country' gritty realism of real life, not some $1M bonus farce created by selling hedged funds that 99% of people cannot relate to. However, cracks appeared quickly in how fast Bale was jailed, how quick his woman left him and how little their relationship mattered to the plot. I want to care for the characters and Saldana got zero screen time to care for her, so much so that when she announced her 'big' news, who really cared? Sam Shepherd was woefully underused and in my honest opinion, I felt sorry for the talent not utilized, again showing no respect to the role or character, he may as well have not been there. Whitaker was OK, but again, lack of promotion of the character, why would Saldana choose him over Bale? why would she not visit prison? Prison time was a joke and may as well not have been there. Affleck, whose voice irritates, really stepped up as did Willem Dafoe, who I am really enjoying of late in his roles and finally Woody Harrelson was on fire in this role. What you have here is a film that concentrates its focus in the wrong areas, relying far too much on a good cast list to carry it through and considering it is nearly 2 hours long seems rushed at the end. I still recommend this film simply as watching Bale & Harrelson is like watching Tiger Woods or Ronaldo.....even if they have a bad day, they are worth the entrance fee alone.",Out of the Furnace

Dark, gritty and raw with a moral that sometimes in life the most obvious choice isn't for the sake of ones own well being but for what is right.

The plot revolves around a man who gets involved with some shady people and ends up dead. His brother then looks for revenge. That's it. It's not complicated or confusing, there's only a handful of characters that really even matter.Unfortunately there isn't really much else to say about this movie. The characters, while defined, aren't deep enough to make this a real character study, nor are there aren't any moral dilemmas that are explored.

Christian Bale and Casey Affleck are brothers, Bale has a man's-man job at a miniscule steel works company that seems to be put together with ticky-tacky and functioning at a scale so small one can only believe it turns out the metal fixin's for matchbox cars and toy pianos. Casey is a sometime military dude who re-ups or is re-upped to serve in Iraq or Afghanistan. He tries to make money by doing anything like standing around waiting for the right numbers to drop. Or fist fighting. The story hangs together barely. Casey's character fights in what are for him fixed fights and he usually takes the dive. But although he does this more than once, he really hates to take dives. And yet his handler, a battered looking Willem Dafoe keeps using him, including in a fight co-managed by a convincingly dangerous looking Woody Harrelson. It is hard to believe that real people behave so stupidly that you want to shout at the screen, but in fact people do behave pretty stupid, so it is believable in real life, only this isn't real life this is a movie which has to be believable. I got the impression that this movie was a precursor to Manchester by the Sea which it preceded in release by 3 years, but the Casey Affleck character is the same character, a skinny man's man with major interior issues which cause him to experience major depression yet express himself violently. His movements, and that of older brother Christian Bale are played out in this long, predictable revenge story. Other characters were played by the comely Zoe Saldana and the grim, somewhat blocky appearance of Forest Whittaker. Good to see, but not really pivotal to the plot, such as it was. I don't know if the town of Braddock is real or what State it is in, but I enjoyed the industrial ruin of a small town atmospherics. Reminiscent of places I'm from that haunt me.

And the idea that Woody's character and his mountain gang getting away with everything they do, drug dealing, murder, etc., long term is not so plausible, especially since the local police are on to him but supposedly completely foiled because nobody will talk, and they and Sheriff Forest Whittaker don't have the brains to bring in higher authorities.

136,graupepillard,Great performances by Bale and Harrelson - dark and edgy,7,31 December 2013,"I am drawn to dark, edgy films depicting characters that are nasty, brutish and amoral, doing inexpressible acts to their fellow man; not horror films - they are too over the top - but movies that awaken my dread of what many people gravely experience as reality. The idea of vengeance quenched is quixotic, but in the transported world of the movies retribution is possible and often probable. Director Scott Cooper's OUT OF THE FURNACE falls into the above category, joined by a terrific cast, but disappointedly full of plot inconsistencies which to a person like myself – who tries to figure things out, those incongruities loom large getting stuck in my head becoming a prickly disturbance.This is a film that does not equivocate about the bonds between family; the responsibility of being your ""brother's keeper""; tending to one's ill parent, attempting to sustain an ethical life despite the roadblocks that chance and circumstance put in life's path. The lead actor, Christian Bale, who gets better and better with each movie, stars as Russell Baze – a man who cannot ""catch a break"" - who we first encounter working amidst the hot, blazing steel mill furnaces in a working class, economically scarred town in Pennsylvania. Bleak images of rows of clapboard houses are familiar – we have seen them many times in many movies - photographed in the beclouded grays of hopelessness. Russell is a bright light in this fog of desolation, an inference of religious ""saintliness"" hangs over his persona; penance and redemption follow.Casey Affleck, an actor who physically looks like the classic clean-cut high-school football star, though slighter in build, portrays Russell's younger brother Rodney – wounded, erratic and traumatized from multiple tours of duty in Iraq; the sibling who his Uncle (a reliably comfortable and comforting Sam Shepard) tells us in an aside was ""trouble even as a kid"". Psychologically seared by the war, Rodney cannot adapt to the ordinariness of existence and the economic deprivation he finds at home, propelling him to bizarre solutions, including gambling and bare-knuckle fighting; his Manager, a greedy and rapacious William Dafoe pushing the plot into even darker regions of emptiness and abyss.Woody Harrelson is riveting as the vicious personification of evil ruling over his inbred clan of loathsome reprobates dealing drugs and wagering on mano-a-mano battles - not in the mountains of Appalachia but in the hills of Ramapo, NJ. Soon the ""lost"" brother becomes a master brawler in the arena of predatory slugfests, surrounded by fierce bloodthirsty spectators. Eventually the two worlds –one from the factory and the other from the backwoods - collide in an explosion of violence and reckoning; the interior core values of Christian Bale's character teetering at the tipping point.Despite good supporting performances by Forest Whitaker and Zoe Saldana (though women play a small part in this testosterone suffused film,) OUT OF THE FURNACE has scenes that made me groan with frustration – how can a director get away with interspersing a deer- hunting stalk-and-kill spectacle with images of dripping blood from the movie's climactic combat fisticuffs, without resorting to cheap pretentious obviousness? There were also anomalies concerning time and place that I felt were due to sloppy editing, unsuitable to an otherwise gripping and sensitive cinematic production - a tale of a man, Russell Baze, scorched by the contingencies of fortune, fiercely struggling to maintain his innate compassion and humanity when faced with the depraved ambiance that he is impelled to confront.",Out of the Furnace

They could've really taken advantage of the amazing cast from Bale, Casey Affleck, Harrelson, Dafoe, and Forest Whittaker because the acting is great, as you would expect, but the range that they're given is small.All in all, a solid movie that moves quickly and efficiently but there are zero surprises.

139,andy-933-696608,I just need the money.,9,19 December 2013,"Naturally when the sight of Christian Bale's face on a poster appears, anyone will feel intrigued in the dedication he will deliver in the project, regardless of the film's subject matter. Granted the disappointment from Terminator Salvation was the only exception as it was the first time one witnessed a Bale character with a one dimensional depiction. The characters in Out of the Furnace are very real, and that can be both a positive and negative. The authenticity towards their representations are raw enough to fascinate a viewer into seeing through this two hour drama thriller, while also feeling a sense of disappointment. The poster of the film shows the protagonist Russell Blaze (Bale) aiming a rifle down, and framed in the same fashion as Jeff Bridges's role in Scott Cooper's Oscar winning film Crazy Heart, as it borders on similar territory. Sadly this latest endeavor into the exploration of the human condition falls short of its bond between brothers premise, only to rely solely on the performance of the actors, adding little intricacy to the plot, dragging it further and further, possibly in an attempt to add more depth to the character's inner turmoil, only with no success. Despite this simple plot, extended further from intention, it certainly borders on some philosophical insights, and it manages to use its long storyline to explore the character played by Bale more so through actions, rather than with words, giving the film sense of balance between its raw characters, but derivative story structure.The decisions we make in our lives place a weight on us. They impact us in the manner in which the next choice can either help us move forward, or drag us further down a path that we choose to call hell, be it the torment of the mind, or the fires of a mystical realm of punishment. Scott Cooper's second feature film explores this aspect of the human condition through the rust belt segment of American blue collar towns. Most of the filming took place in the Pittsburg Metropolitan area, and Braddock, giving the film a greater scenic beauty. When discussing the concept of beauty, a lot of this can follow from the themes explored within the film, be it the awareness of the economic depression within the rust belt segment of America, or the political direction pertaining toward the Iraq War, a memory which still burns in our skulls even after withdrawal. Although they are tackled briefly, they do manage to define the conception of the characters, and their own inability to escape the bounds of their roots. The primary subject of course is the protagonist Russell Blaze, who's own quest through the course of the film is defined by his slow descent into action as he contemplates the choices on which he must embark to define himself fully.The plot of Out of the Furnace is made clear through the trailer, a simple revenge thriller based on the concepts of love, family, and difficult choices made by dysfunctional individuals. Strangely enough though, it isn't until near the end of the film that the inciting incident manages to kick the protagonist into a whole new world of changing circumstances. Most of the film narrative plays out by a slow but naturalistic pace as the characters are presented with an authentic depiction in the time spent exploring the world they inhabit. After taking a poor, but agreed on dive in a fight, Russell's Iraq veteran brother Rodney (Affleck) is taken by a savage group of drug peddlers, run by Harlan DeGroat (Harrelson). As Harlan, Harrelson captures a monstrous brutality that makes his character both unpredictable yet hard to comprehend in his breed of justice. It is the shadow to Christian Bale's more tranquil Russell Blaze as Bale portrays his character with a mysterious presence of inner torment, despite his calm demeanor and subtle dialogue.The conclusion of the film is not exactly built up in the standard that gives it a tremendous impact, but the execution of the last scene of the film certainly gives the film a deeper interpretation of Bale's character as he ponders his own existence in a town he feels is slowly degrading more and more. Although the chemistry between Casey Affleck and Christian Bale was a little slow, it was very energetic to the extent that it could give insight to the main subject of the story and that is the conscious human desire to progress. Regardless of whichever choices we make, the initial response to move forward and never turn back knowing the past can be a form of fear keeping us from living life, is the very pinnacle of our growth. Russell works the day shift at a rotting and crippling mill, while Rodney fights his demons in the ring, both refusing to move forward as the inner torment that shapes them forces them into isolated and deteriorating lives of uncertainty and fear.Out of the Furnace, although not a perfect film, is recommendable to the extent that it delivers a great and visually intriguing characters. Enough has been said regarding the plot, and as flawed as it may be in its presentation, it certainly does not make one turn away. What also can be said about Russell Blaze is that he is one of Christian Bale's most complex characters up to date. Aside from Nolan's Batman, or Trevor Rezik, Blaze's complexity comes from the authenticity Bale gives to the character, and although he is not deeply explored, a lot is left open for interpretation as to who he is, or maybe the same can be said for this film overall. Aside story structure, and the lack of chemistry between Bale and Affleck, there are good points within the film as it explores a territory that is prevalent within our own existential capacities to willingly move forward, especially in a world that often beats you down enough times to feel as if moving forward was a pointless endeavor.",Out of the Furnace

If that isn't depressing enough for you, go see Out Of The Furnace. The setting is depressing. The characters are depressing. The ending is not the thing a civil society can tolerate, but by this time Christian Bale has been long established as the hero, so we're supposed to give him a pass.The 1st half of the movie was spend getting to know the characters. Nothing much happens, but besides Bale as the hero, we establish Woody Harrelson as the bad guy, and Casey Affleck as the bungler but with a good heart. I had to laugh how Bale actually goes to prison for a spell. Was the whole purpose to sneak in an anti-gay almost subliminal message? Bale has been peaceful and reasonable so far until another prisoner calls him a Faggot. That caused a fight. I guess that's the worst thing you could call someone. There's some side plots for the Ladies: Forest Whitaker the Cop steals Bale's GF while he's in jail, etc. Mostly though, this movie is about fighting, killing, drugs, and drinking.

Christian Bale, the straight, hard-working brother, isn't hiding behind an absurd comb-over, and that combined with an apparent 33 day shooting schedule brings out a dirty, raw performance that makes his performance in American Hustle seem lackadaisical at best.Willem Dafoe is always good, and did a solid job as the morally on-the-fence crime boss, as Casey's character descends into the world of bare knuckle fighting, with large scale debts that he cannot pay following his every move.Unfortunately though, Woody Harrelson turns in a thoroughly unconvincing performance; I say this because, compared to his 'Mickey' from 'Natural Born Killers', the embodiment of evil and a legitimately scary performance, Woody doesn't seem to be trying very hard for a supposed meth-addicted psychopath. Although, throughout the movie, his character is talked about more often than he is on screen, perhaps suggesting something unspoken about his character. Or perhaps some scenes were left on the editing room floor.The county of Braddock is brilliantly shot, almost giving a feeling of Pripyat and Chernobyl - no colour variation, just a lot of rusty reds instead of seas of grey. A visual metaphor for the sinking US and, in general, Western local industry? I'd say yes, given what the mill signifies, in vastly different ways, to each character in the film.This is one of those movies you want to watch again, at least once, as the characters and their situations stick in your head. Early in the film, there is one particular scene in which Casey's character suddenly erupts into graphic descriptions of the many casualties of war that he has seen with his own eyes. This is just one of several memorable scenes, driven by the strength of the characters.Highly recommended, just don't expect a unique plot. This is a character-driven story.",Out of the Furnace
143,jrwygant,Disappointment,4,28 January 2020,"I wondered why I had never heard of ""Out of the Furnace"", released seven years ago, now carrying a 6.8 rating on IMDb, and featuring a stellar cast. Maybe my expectations were too high. I realized too late that it was a stereotypical story, a cowboy western, good guy versus bad guy. Worse than that -- it never settled on which of the several stories it tossed out to us that it wanted to follow to the finish. It could have been a story about a town suffering under the impending closure of the steel mill, or a family torn apart by one son's personal suffering, or the broken romance of the other son. Instead, it chose the cliché route, a dark, dreary tale with a predictable ending that it approached at the speed of a baby's crawl. I'm a fan of Woody Harrelson, but he was given a cardboard character to portray, and most of the other big names also had abbreviated roles they never got to develop. With all that talent it could have been so much better.",Out of the Furnace

147,JohnnyWeissmuller,Out of the Furnace,7,25 October 2015,"Out of the Furnace is Scott Cooper's second film as director after the praise and success of 2009's Crazy Heart. Like Crazy Heart, this is very much a character study and boasts a fine array of actors on splendid form. The story, of two brothers, played by Christian Bale and Casey Affleck, centres around Affleck's inability to adjust to society after serving in Iraq. He's drawn into the world of bare knuckle fighting, much to the dismay of his elder brother, who wants him to work in the local foundry. Filmed in Pennsylvania, Out of the Furnace both looks and feels quite similar to The Deer Hunter, although we never leave home soil. Cooper, who also wrote the screenplay, uses the characters as emblems of society making their purpose relevant to a bigger picture both within and out with the narrative -- Bale is symbolic of hard work and decency, Affleck, disillusionment and anger, whilst Willem Defoe and Woody Harrelson, who play a small-time money-lender and a backwoods gangster, are representative of Wall Street and Government and how they can dictate the lives of ordinary people. The results are quite compelling during the first two- thirds of the film, with Bale attached to an underused Zoe Saldana and a turn of events fracturing both his love life and family life. Themes of family and brotherhood are also strong here, and whilst the film steps assuredly and moves at a stately pace, the final act veers into more conventional territory and undoes much of the underlying tension by changing gears and becoming a film of a different nature. Which is quite unfortunate, because there's much to admire in Out of the Furnace, not least of all Christian Bale in a performance the equivalent of anything he's done recently. Casey Affleck is very good at brining anger and a boiling pot mentality to his roles, and does so superbly in this film. Forest Whitaker is also among the cast, with one of the smaller roles as a town sheriff; Whitaker is usually reliable and is no less than such here. Woody Harrelson is also very good, although the initial introduction to his character establishes the type of man he is, this first scene is also at odds with the better aspects of the film. Recommended, though; with some reservations of the denouement, but great acting and solid direction throughout.",Out of the Furnace

149,AkelaLoneWolf,Attempt to portray raw humanity at close quarters,6,21 June 2014,"Christian Bale is, of course, a talented actor and with his portrayal brings to life the grit and grind of an honest man making his living at a small mill town where the steel business dwindles due to foreign imports. He is over burdened by many cares - his restless brother full of angst since demobilization, his ailing father, his very strained means - and his only means of finding solace is to turn to his girlfriend. And with yet another blow of drunk driving and incarceration, he loses even that last support. Then as expected, the troubled brother gets into hot water, and the chief protagonist is left with nothing but feeble attempts at retribution. From this point onwards, the plot ceases to be rational and there lacks a formal closure after the final act. It is a pity as the movie seems to take a turn and ends abruptly, leaving all the previously woven parts hanging in the air. It makes us wonder if there has been budget cuts or change in production personnel. One last word, Bale has played and excelled in several roles of troubled brothers (playing either the bad apple or the good son) - perhaps it is time to move on?",Out of the Furnace
150,mwburrows,"Infuriatingly bad, but also infuriatingly good.",5,19 December 2013,"Out of the Furnace violates every rule in the book when it comes to fiction writing. The opening scene tells us very little that we couldn't already guess. The typical wisdom is that you must start with the ""inciting incident"", but that doesn't come until well near the half-way point of the film. There's clearly a lot of passion that went into Out of the Furnace, and at the end I did feel like I had experienced this incredible journey with Russell and his family - almost like I lost a friend. But as far as thrillers go - which this is advertised as - it is not conventional nor effective. If it were marketed as a rural crime drama (Which it is, really), I would have been more welcoming. But because it wants to be part TV soap opera and part white-knuckle thriller, it irked me to sit there waiting for the ball to get rolling for a whole hour before it switched gears to action mode (sprinkled in sparse quantities, no doubt). It has the glacial pace of a classic novel. The characters are there, the direction is competent, the actors are deeply immersed and never wink at the audience. These are all good things. Where it flops is in its desperation to avoid the formula, and in doing so injures itself. Here's an idea: (SPOILERS) Get rid of Russell being sent to jail, forget about the ""wife leaving him"" subplot, don't show us Casey Affleck getting shot on screen (let us sit in suspense, let us experience the mystery alongside Russell), and you would have a much, much better film. Unfortunately what we get in the end is a grandiose melodrama that bites off more than it can chew and tries desperately to distinguish itself, succeeding only in highlighting its flaws.Stick to the formula.

151,johntheholder,A harsh subject in a solid film,8,2 March 2014,"This is one of those films that takes the hard path. The Director gambles his way , takes the risk and embarks on this respectful attempt. It is about fate , and how we people no matter what we do , despite our character's virtues and flaws , there are certain things in store for us by Fate. And this is what the film examines. In these regards , i would say that this film resembles very much "" No country for old men "" much more than "" Deer Hunter "" which is a very obvious comparison because there is some literal deer hunting in both films and there are wars involved in both along with men working hard menial jobs in factories. Other than that they go their own ways since Deer Hunter is much about the handicaps of War on man's psyche , whereas "" Out of furnace "" like i said , is about "" the fate factor and surprises it stores for us , no matter our qualities and flaws. I don't see why so many bad reviews , and i totally disagree that this film has two halves , the first being good , then the second half is weak due to bad script. This isn't the case here. This movie moves along its story in a justified way , each scene that follows is there for good reason. At least in my eyes. The cast did a fine job , Bale as always delivers ... Casey Affleck's best performance in my opinion , whom i don't view a great deal of an actor , but in this movie i have to give him recognition.

Russell Baze is too tragic/heroic. The whole thing drips with so much gritty authenticity that it parodies itself. I don't believe that life is actually like this wherever it is that this movie was filmed. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that working-class life isn't hard, that working folk don't struggle, or that tragedies like this don't happen. I'm saying that they got the tone wrong. I did a Google image search for the director and he looked exactly how I was expecting him to look: a gin-and-tonic sipping LA man right out of SWINGERS...callow and earnest...enthusiastic...ultimately an attractive dupe with no real style and nothing to say...someone who tells himself that he really wants to tell a sincere story about real people...and why shouldn't I get paid handsomely for it? I am an artist!I can imagine Mr. Cooper sipping cocktails in Hollywood with his screenwriter pals, getting excited as they come up with more and more little touches of quiet authenticity to stick in the screenplay. ""I've got an idea! When his dad dies he gets a jailhouse memorial tattoo! Yeah!""My very limited contact with people who have succeeded as screenwriters in LA has led me to a theory. I think there is a perfect intelligence range to write and produce the kind of movies that make money. Maybe intelligence isn't the word. You have to be sharp and observant enough to be able to seize and reproduce the dominant (ideological) discourse in such a way that it is palatable to the movie-going public and emotionally immature enough not to want to step outside of this discourse. The best is when you hit the sweet spot right at the intersection of pure commercial film-making and ""artisty"". Scott Cooper is a perfect example of the kind of ideal, well-paid dupe I am talking about...fake vision, fake gravitas, fake art, but well-packaged and intelligent enough to be a sure investment. In short, this movie feels like someone's voyeuristic fantasy of working-class authenticity and not a real portrait of life in a place like Braddock. It also feels a lot longer than it is.

Christian Bale was meant for this role, easily causing a non remembrance of the Dark Knight series, much to the chagrin of many hard core fans I'm sure. Bale is raw humanity, coiled and ready to strike with purpose as a deep leveled doting older brother to actor Casey Affleck. The story, which simply put, is about people's lives and their choices also gives us a courageous stomach churning performance by Affleck as a rage filled war vet unable to channel his emotions. Woody Harelson is absolutely chilling as a half hillbilly/half street smart racketeer with long reaching power. His uneasy demeanor codifies rural danger. With William Defoe mixed in, holding down a balancing act between corruption and sincerity, the film tests new ground by playing down caricatures as hard boiled heads collide. It would be an injustice for me to spill too much about the film if you haven't seen it, so I have provided some character assimilation to emphasize the grip of the movie.

Christian Bale really gets into his character's stoic resolve to protect his family and unbreaking attitude in the face of adversity. Pitted against him however are those who survive by other means than good hard work, and their greed for money.

160,brickmoviereviews,Out of the Furnace: Bale's Return a Slow Burn,4,9 December 2013,"Beginning in 2008, Out of the Furnace centers on the Baze family, primarily brothers Russell (Christian Bale) and Rodney (Casey Affleck). Living in a small industrial Pennsylvanian town, Russell spends his days laboring at the steel mill (the furnace), while Casey, a soldier, spends his days borrowing money to gamble away while not fighting overseas. Usually Russell is the one taking care of Rodney, however roles change after a drunk-driving incident lands Russell in prison for some time (I assume five years).When released from prison, Russell's brother eagerly awaits to take him home. As Russell does his best to reintegrate himself into society, without the help of his former girlfriend Lena (Zoe Saldana), he learns that things have changed from the time of his incarceration. Along with the passing of his father, Russell realizes that Rodney has gotten himself into a great amount of debt with local crime boss John Petty (Willem Dafoe), and as a result is forced to fight for money, like animals. Things quickly go south when Rodney learns of fights in Jersey, run by major crime lord Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson), that pay a ton of money, but soon after, he goes missing. Back in Pennsylvania, Russell Baze faces the decision to sit back and let the police fail to do their job, or risk his freedom and get justice for his brother.After a long 17-month absence from the theaters, Christian Bale ditches the cape-and-cowl in exchange for a goatee and a shaky film. Out of the Furnace is mediocre. It doesn't have anything to do with the acting, really, but the movie as a package just was not fulfilling. Bale, surprisingly enough, plays his part well, and is actually one of the saving graces of this subpar film. Out of the Furnace was a decent change of pace from what we've seen from Bale lately (The Dark Knight trilogy) but, overall, the movie was slow. It took forever to pick up any steam and get interesting. Quite frankly, the movie wasn't really interesting at all.While Bale may have been fine, the same cannot necessarily be said for the rest of the cast. Casey Affleck's character was strange, and his acting just made Rodney Baze stranger. It was hard for the audience to get behind the character and feel for him the way it was obviously intended to. Zoe Saldana's character serves ZERO purpose, and Willem Dafoe's John Petty wasn't that much better. Woody Harrelson's villain, Harlan DeGroat, is certainly interesting. DeGroat is the first character introduced in the film, when we see him beat the life out of a guy at a drive in, for essentially no reason at all. Given that the point of the scene was to show how violent and unreasonable DeGroat is, the entire scene comes across as awkward, forced, and unnecessary. For a main character, DeGroat is under used, and in general is just strange.While I can't say Out of the Furnace was one of the worst movies of the year, it wasn't great, and Bale will, unfortunately take a hit for it. The movie seemed to be put together haphazardly, and it was awfully slow and frankly boring. Luckily for Bale, his role in American Hustle later this month should make Out of the Furnace ultimately unforgettable, but for now, this one will sting. If the movie is something you really want to see for some reason, by all means, go ahead, but, in my opinion, you should save your money.Rating: 4 of 10BrickMovieReviews.wordpress.com @BrickFilmReview",Out of the Furnace
161,Vinicius8,A tale of hopelessness that disappoints in the end,5,3 December 2017,"""Out of the furnace"" starts off with big potential, exhibiting a cast that promises much more than what it delivers. The problem is not with the actors, nor with the director, per se. The problem is that all these fantastic actors did not get any space to develop in the movie. What we're shown are two broken brothers, forsaken by society, living with the bare minimum (but a pretty good house they have there, don't you agree?). Casey Affleck plays the younger brother that is already beyond repair, and, sadly, doesn't get enough screen time to develop any further. On the other hand, Bale, our protagonist, is the focus of this story. Throughout the movie he is slowing being broken, to a point that leads to the final climax of the movie. Now I should commend the fantastic and tense build up the movie makes, however, I'm on edge here. I really want to rant about the ending. Without spoiling anything, after all the good work done through, ""Out of the furnace"" spirals down to the same old recipe of an ending, being ridiculously stretched out and overly melodramatic. The movie set a tone of realism in the beginning (with a touch of social commentary) but failed to sustain the same style through to the end. All other side characters are left aside, playing small roles that don't allow any development. It's a shame. It's a waste. It could've been a lot more and that's what really kills the movie to me.

Bale is always a top notch actor and Affleck is so underrated (he needs more roles!) and Harrleson surprises me more and more! You can really feel the pain Russell Bane is going through. The accident, losing his girlfriend, the death of his father while he's serving time in prison then the death of his brother; the man goes through a lot. Casey Affleck's role as Rodney Bale is interesting because at first glance you think he's just a lazy punk trying to make a buck the easy way. For a brief moment, he reveals the pain he's been carrying since coming home from the war; which explains why he's such a good fighter with all that pent up anger. Woody makes a great bad guy; he was a good choice to play Degroat. The scene where he's mistreating the girl in the car then beating a man to nearly to death is an immediate eye opener as to what to expect from this character. The story is a little slow, but it's not an action film so don't expect that. At times it drags a bit, but it's meant to; that's how life is for the average person. These guys are just average blue collar guys experiencing one tragedy after another; specifically Bale's character. I enjoyed it and I would recommend this film.

A simple, spare rural crime saga with ambition and commentary; and performances that make it great. At this point, it seems pointless to praise a Christian Bale performance, but he gives one of his best here, as does Casey Affleck and Woody Harrelson as the menacing, hateful ball of psychotic rage DeGroat. Bale is mesmerizing in his restraint... Harrelson; quite the opposite. ""Out of the Furnace"" isn't going to win anyone over with originality. On the surface, we've seen films like this before but Cooper has a unique vision. He skillfully touches upon America's current Socioeconomic climate without drawing attention away from the narrative. In this way it reminded me of Andrew Dominic's underrated ""Killing Them Softly,"" only a lot more subtle and with the stark, backwoods atmosphere of ""Winter's Bone."" It's with it's performances however, it's cinematography, and the unexpected way in which the story unfolds that makes ""Into the Furnace"" standout; even in a particularly strong year at the movies. Director Scott Cooper has proved ""Crazy Heart"" was no fluke.

The melodramatic tale of two brothers caught on the difficult side of life shows eloquently and brutally, shows us how easy it is to lose everything, good, bad, or otherwise intended actions having been made. Christian Bale is a hard working man, who adores his girlfriend, brother and the rest of his downtrodden family. Casey Affleck, with no less amount of love or devotion, returned from the military a little more shattered than expected. While the brothers' patriarch is bed ridden and failing in health, one accident seemingly destroys all of the good in a man. Difficult, under appreciated work; a violent, unpredictable brother; multiple losses one can hardly handle when life is good, Bales story reminds us of how quickly we can lose it all, and the suffering we can be set up for. While most of his life's trials are beyond his control, the action which takes him fully under, is made by choice, to the viewers, but out of necessity to the man. The script is well written, the characters beyond well acted, the subplots epic, and the always accompanied ugly-crying, takes viewers into an abyss we may never know otherwise.

168,virtue_srb,Wasted Bales talent,6,1 January 2014,"-Contains spoilers-First thing that comes into mind while watching this film are these huge skips plot-wise. When Bale goes to prison,I can only guess he was there for a year or more,it only takes for about 3 minutes of film. Bale comes out of prison the same person he went inside,which is highly unlikely and not contributing to the film. Hes overall character is extremely undeveloped,which makes Bale performance very uninteresting,and he is an actor that has so much to give (could easily say my favorite). He portrays this good guy with bad job,problematic brother,who loses father early on in the film. He has no real personal traits other than being vengeful (I don't blame him),he seems completely emotionless during the whole film. There are a few bursts of emotions,but for 90% of the movie he keeps his poker face on,even when hes been told that hes brother is dead,he says ""Ok"" and the conversation simply mutes,telling us how he feels. If you take one of the most talented actors of today for the role,then use him. If they wanted to make Bale tough,uncompromising guy who does what he has to do,first,he had to lose that goatee beard,and get his hair fixed. He should have looked something like in Harsh times. Then,hes character would have been believable,and I would go for the all tough guy thing. Also,when his ex tells him shes pregnant,hes not supposed to cry and tell its all wonderful news,its kind of pathetic and out of sync with his character,he should have took it like a man,because guys who cry like that don't premeditate killing a person tomorrow.On the other hand,DeGroat is played out pretty well by Woody,classical hillbilly lunatic. He and the environment he is operating in seem very realistic and possible. Also Bales brother is troubling but realistic character,he did good on his part.All in all,this isn't a bad movie,but its not worth of praise either. I think the main problem is the poorly developed main character which makes movie all too mellow for the genre. If you wanna pass an evening watching a movie not expecting much,then go watch it,but if you're hoping for Bale to shine in this one,you'll be disappointed,and its not his fault,its just the way script was done.Realistic rating - 6.5/10",Out of the Furnace
169,AlGranthamMusic,Macho Posturing,4,25 July 2020,"Great cast wasted in a film with the intellectual capacity and insight of a Monday Night Raw episode.I imagine Out Of The Furnace will appeal to testosterone-fueled men everywhere. It's violent. It's full of yelling. There's hardly a female character to be found. The film makes a surface level attempt to illuminate the plight of America's working class, but despite the actors trying their best to make something out of these one dimensional characters, it all feels like padding until the next ""badass"" scene.Save your time and just watch The Deer Hunter again, or The Last Picture Show, or A Simple Plan, or Affliction. These are a few of many other films that actually have something interesting to say about the often complicated and fraught relationships of families and males in rural, working class America.",Out of the Furnace
170,bain0038,Hard punching and straight forward film delivers,8,7 December 2013,"Scott Cooper takes a sharp turn from the school book tone of his last film Crazy Heart and brings us to a more dismal world in Out of the Furnace. Our hero, Russel Baze, (played smartly by Christian Bale), is a well intentioned and responsible man who in trying to protect his brother meets cruel and cold irony and is sent wayward in this ruined world. Meanwhile his brother returns from deployment with a terrible case of post traumatic stress disorder and brings his chaos into the ""imbred"" and lawless hills of New Jersey, led by the degenerate Harlan Degroat, (Woody Harrelson).Now, the story in the vein of films like Deer Hunter and Winter's Bone, two films I personally admire for capturing the delicacy of people amid depressed communities. It's hard to say this film doesn't measure up. The lighting, sound, cinematography, editing, story, are all accomplished with the utmost professionalism. However, if the script fell into the wrong hands its flaws would easily be detected because the weakness of its integrity would show. The story takes too many short cuts to get where it needs to go. Some might already find it slow. It is after all a vignette of the decline of our hero. However, what really made this movie work for me was the brilliant performances of the trait. William Dafoe as a local and smart small time boss. Sam Shepard as the uncle, a face of masculinity and integrity, Tom Bower as a complex and familiar bartender and gate man. Casey Affleck as the young and traumatized brother, Forrest Whitaker as the conflicted cop, Zoe Saldana as the girlfriend. Though, it's Harrelson who really steals the show, he's evil, beyond logic and powerful You can't wait to see him again and that antagonistic combination is rare and even more scarcely pulled off.Out of the Furnace won't be nominated for best screenplay. However, in my eyes, it should get a nod for everything else.",Out of the Furnace
171,RockoutGlockout117,Rather An Enigma,7,16 December 2013,"Out of the furnace is a film that is rather odd, its got great acting talent, Christian Bale, Casey Affleck, Willem Dafoe, Woody Harrelson, Zoe Saldana, and Forrest Whittaker even appears, a cast like this is enough to make Cinephiles have a heart attack, but in the same breath you would be hard pressed to find a film that has such an amazing cast and seems so comfortable with just sliding by. The film also suffers from identity problems, if you've seen the trailer you would imagine the film to be a sort of touching tale of a brother trying to save his other brother from the evil Mr. Harrelson, while that is partially true, this plot of the film doesn't really get underway until the film is pretty much halfway over. The entire first hour of the film is pretty much setting up the Hunt, and then the last hour delivers a less than good ""Hunt"" its only in the last ten minutes or so does the film live up to its possibility. Odder still is the short changing of various actors, both Zoe Saldana and Forrest Whittaker appear in this film for 10-15 minutes, in maybe five scenes, its difficult to understand why such actors would be used for such small roles, as they have greatness in them. And then there's the dialogue, that doesn't really manage to say much of anything, it basically consists of characters muttering to each other to move the plot along, only one scene that I can think of right now, really stuck with me, and is quotable. The film also as many have noted, seems comfortable literally lifting a scene directly from the deer hunter(a much better film) and I mean literally, its the same exact scene, if you've seen both you'll recognize it immediately. All these complaints aside ""Out Of The Furnace"" is watchable sheerly because you wish to know how exactly this strange little tale will turn out. And that is most likely what will keep you watching, that and the hope that will be better than it is, better than passable. Also the Large Popcorn and Icy probably helped.",Out of the Furnace

There wasn't much by way of character development at first, other than you're given the challenges they face, but the rest is picked up through their environment. This was probably intentional because the story very much stayed to the theme of what will this person do next or how will this scenario play out.The movie starts off violent, gets really slow for about a half hour and then finally ties a story together. The all-star cast including Forest Whitaker, Willem Dafoe, Woody Harrelson and even Zoe Saldana were all convincing and really identified with the parts they played. Christian Bale above the others has the ability to completely absorb himself into a role, but as authentic as he is, you never really are given a connection to him or any of the other characters in this film although you do understand them.This was a well-produced and believable movie. Other than some of the lulls in story line, it was fairly entertaining but the sheer raw talent that the actors put into this film makes it a very good watch.",Out of the Furnace

The actors were made to look like real people, not Hollywood stars, and the soundtrack was appropriate and low key. The performances were well acted and believable (with the possible exception of Forest Whitaker).But that's where the train of goodness stops, people. The plot line is predictable and cliché at best, and in a way, almost self indulgent. It's as though the directors and producers thought ""oh what an Oscar worthy screenplay. We really MUST have this film dripping with drama!"" and it makes the film gratuitous and slow moving. I've had more suspense waiting for the washing machine to finish a load of laundry. I also found the sets to feel out of place. The movie takes place around 2007ish. While I get that the setting is a small, poor industrial town, the old school telephones, small tube TV's and ancient vehicles seem like a miss. They make you aware that something with the backdrop just doesn't feel realistic. Overall, the movie feels like it is trying too hard, and in doing so, loses the suspense, and takes away from the truly talented actors who try to carry this mess to the finish line. Definitely give it a pass.",Out of the Furnace

179,ttron2000,this is true filmmaking,10,10 December 2013,"behold a film that relies solely on talent and avoids any clichés or Hollywood vices. out of the furnace is a real film with real depth and real impact. relying more on story and well-developed characters, it's a breath of fresh air whenever something like this comes along. in north Braddock, Pennsylvania, Russell (christian bale) is a hard- working steel mill worker who even with a father dying of cancer and his younger brother, Rodney (Casey Affleck), a stop-lossed soldier who's buried himself in debt with the local bookie (Willem Dafoe), has had his life crushed in one random moment, a dreadful accident sentencing him to a stint in jail. while locked up, his father dies and Rodney is sent to Iraq. upon release five years later, his beautiful girlfriend, Lena (Zoe Saldana), has moved on and into a relationship with the local sheriff (forest Whitaker) and Rodney, now home and haunted by his time over there, has only dug himself in deeper. so deep it involves Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson), a volatile maniac of a white trash criminal who is just aching for a reason to hurt someone (anyone). all this leads to bloody results, inevitably leading to a confrontation between Russell and Harlan. i don't wanna say much beyond that. this movie takes its time unfolding and the more involved you are, the better the movie is. for Russell, it's just good to be home and when a world of drugs and underground fights threaten to destroy everything he loves, you feel the same itching he does, needing to see things through, even if it means the law has to be sidetracked. bale, as usual, is remarkable. in what could be one of his most underplayed performances (he only has one scene where he really emotional explodes), we get everything we need to know about him, even in moments of complete silence. Bale's great at spreading his range and adding humanity to every role and this is no exception. whether it's a heartbreaking moment of being reunited with Saldana or a fun brotherly exchange with Affleck, he covers every base with the ease of one breath, making him a master of his craft. Affleck is good as the damaged Rodney, making us feel for him even when he's in the middle of doing something risky or just plain stupid. Rodney's connection with Russell carries a lotta weight and never for a second do you doubt their brotherly bond. the rest of the cast: Dafoe, Whitaker, Saldana, and the excellent Sam Shepard as Russell and Rodney's uncle are up to par and no one is really shortchanged. while some of them are there longer than others, everyone makes a mark and shares relaxed chemistry with their cast mates (Affleck has some really great exchanges with Dafoe). as for Harrelson...well, when he does bad and intense, it never really gets any better. the film's opening scene tells you everything you need to know about DeGroat's violent nature, but Harrelson never lets you turn away. unpredictable, terrifying, and poisonous, i found myself entranced by the man, even if i knew what he was about to do was savagery at its worse. Scott cooper had me with his first film, crazy heart. this is all i need to stay an avid fan of a filmmaker who knows how to make you stay with characters, even if they're vile scum like DeGroat. cooper gives them human feelings and flaws. he envelops you in the setting, whether it's the sleepy streets of a northeastern small town or the thick country woods. he knows how to show you a place that feels like home. sure...there's blood. lot's of blood in certain spots. he knows when something needs to be violent and he knows how to use it without making it feel forced or cheesy. bottom line, out of the furnace is for true blue film buffs who want a real story with human characters. a story that will grab you and keep you hooked from DeGroat's first act of violence to bale's chilling final shot. it's not a CGI loaded dazzler. it's a film that makes you yearn for some old films that had accomplished more with less. see this movie. even if it doesn't completely do it for you, you'll walk away thinking about it later. you'll recall the things you did like. once you're done thinking, you'll know it was worth it. in closing, Bale and Harrelson are both Oscar worthy. there...just making sure i made that clear.",Out of the Furnace

Mills and factories close, leaving behind ugly, depressing towns, the hopeless un- or underemployed, and the rise of black market economies in drugs and bare-knuckle fighting. It is sobering to realize that the crumbling neighborhoods and rusting industrial structures are real and shot on location, rather than created by CGI for some dystopian science fiction film. Woody Harrelson's portrayal is remarkable, creating a sense of menace the first time he's on screen. Christian Bale and Casey Affleck are brothers, and both have a kind of shell-shocked response to all that has happened to them. Sam Shepard also stands out as Uncle Red, who foreshadows the many small defeats the other two will have in the future. Did I like it?

Amazingly, we do. Which makes me wonder if Critics still rate films based upon artistic merit or commercial value. Out Of The Furnace has a remarkable cast with Christian Bale, Woody Harrelson, Casey Affleck, Willem Dafoe, Zoe Saldana and Forest Whitaker who are brilliant in this wonderfully written and directed masterpiece. Other not so well known cast, who were equally remarkable includes veteran actors Tom Bower, Bobby Wolfe, Sam Shepard, Nancy Mosser, and Charles David Richards to list a few. Combined the cast deliver pure acting. Unpolluted by the commercialized process of typical Hollywood films. This film is to me simply art on display. It does not conform to any pre-established Hollywood styles or typicality. Instead it cuts it's own path. No Hollywood beginning, middle or nice and tidy Hollywood ending to appease members of some early screening. I'm sure a film like this will be hard to digest for those who get a steady diet of pap films like; Transformers, Marvel Films, Jack Sparrow, Potter and Twilight. Unfortunately, looking at the sum of critics reviews regarding this film at Rotten Tomatoes, many critics prefer the corporate friendly, CGI heavy, stylized and formulaic typical offering from Hollywood. If you are one who loves real films like the rich dramas of the 70's, then you may very well love this film. To me, this is the best film I've seen in 2013!

Was it a matter of one actor signing on, and others wanting to work with him (I say him because the only female in the film is Zoe Saldana, in a one-dimensional and thankless role). Was it that the director used to be an actor and knows all these people? Was it because he had success with Crazy Heart?Other reviews basically already touch on the problems here: it means nothing. I wanted to like the film, but I walked out of the theater not knowing what I had just seen (the ending is confusing, ridiculous, and poorly done). The film takes itself far too seriously to get away with just being entertaining, and when you don't have a clue what the whole point of the movie was, that's a bad thing. Things happen in the film without really coming together and create a cohesive narrative where you feel that there's any growth or direction. Perhaps that's the intent, but any theme or themes were underdeveloped and not apparent. I find the comparisons to Deerhunter insulting, personally.The actors do a fine job, although I feel there is some miscasting in the movie. Would Forest Whitaker really be able to attract Zoe Saldana? Nothing in the movie gave me any reason to think they had a believable relationship. Frankly, nothing in the film convinced me that Saldana would even stay in a town like Braddock.

When it finally does (his brother's death) it still doesn't hold much of an impact. Important parts of the movie seemed glossed over, and scenes that seemed quite irrelevant were left in. I want to skip to the end because that might be the worst ending possible to a movie that never really hooks you. No big showdown, nothing bad ass happens what so ever. Then Christian Bale sitting in the house by himself, Forrest didn't turn him in, but who really cares? I sure didn't.

Stuff doesn't get any cooler than this. Just saw it - a bit on the long side, but otherwise absolutely fantastic. Great directing, pace, photography, grading, acting, the lot. I understand why some of the reviewers might feel a bit let down - this is most definitely not an action movie for the masses, but a carefully crafted character study that just happens to have some violence thrown in. The deliberate slow pace is perfectly adequate in describing the tedious, depressing life in the small poor town, permeated by hopelessness. The photography is of the understated, unobtrusive-but-perfect kind, functional and in line with the story, which is pretty rare in an era of mass eye-candy without substance, or at best a Malick+Lubezki polished, fancy, pointless ""exercices de style""-type of empty intellectualism. Screenwriter/director Scott Cooper did a solid, well developed and thought-out job, no flaws there, but where this film really, REALLY shines is the acting. And the acting is INCREDIBLY good. I knew I was to expect that from Christian Bale as per usual, but the guy is simply phenomenal. The rest of the cast is bang on, no exception, top shelf stuff. Can't even remember the last time I saw a movie with such a level of uniformly great performances. No glamorous fancy-shmancy and nicely coiffured and manicured, artificial human-like (from afar) creatures. People here are greasy, sweaty and real-life-like, well, ugly.

200,edm-the_red,Very Well Done,9,10 December 2013,"Revenge is hardly a fresh concept in film-making. This basic theme, however, here takes a backseat to the styled execution of ""Out of the Furnace."" Told through an all-star cast, the story unfolds slowly, but powerfully. Set in a rural, present-day America, the cinematography captures a beautiful country and glory that is seemingly fading under the weight of war and the economy. The cast skillfully fleshes out the various characters, establishing believability and giving them a rare level of depth. This makes the atmosphere tangible and arguably makes the element of human drama the actual star of the film. The entire cast is excellent and essential, however Christian Bale and Woody Harrelson absolutely steal the show. As the bad-to-the-bone ""villain"" of the script, Harrelson is awesomely despicable, his mere presence on the screen inciting anxiety. Alternately, Bale plays a good but troubled man, condemned to watch his life disintegrate one piece at a time. I caught the director, Scott Cooper, in an interview segment on Carson Daly. He mentioned a desire to impact and ""immerse"" the audience in his movies. In that regard, I would judge this effort to be an undeniable success. During certain scenes, I found myself echoing the actions and emotions depicted on screen, such as dread, liberation, uneasiness, tension, and particularly, a relieved breath of serenity. More drama than action, the tone for me was reminiscent of ""The Place Beyond the Pines"", another well-executed drama with a definite crime flavoring. Also, I felt that the Pearl Jam number that opens and closes the film was a perfect choice for the intended vibe, and deserves a special mention. Overall, this movie is very well done, despite lacking the glamour and flash of an action flick. As a drama, I highly recommend it to fans of the genre.",Out of the Furnace
201,sw_florida,"Mass shooting, one at a time",8,27 August 2015,"There is a spreading sense of frustration and panic in the US, which comes from the notion of a deteriorating society. Some blame Wall Street, some blame drugs, some blame lost faith in God, and some, like myself, know it is because of big government. Jobs are drying up, the military is fighting confusing wars, drugs flooding the market carried in by illegals make people do stupid things, and the schools are not providing a good education any more. Mass shootings in despair happen more and more often as the collective mind is cornered and out of options, thinking the enemy is among itself. Though this movie is not about a mass shooting, it is set in that atmosphere. The hopelessness of a nation. The question, why. There will be more and more dark movies done like this one, as we as a country, allow big government to grow bigger and bigger and destroy us all. Obama and the Democrat party is the mastermind at pitting Americans against each other and racking up the national debt faster than people can shoot one another in the streets. The feeling of no future is on. Another movie in this genre that comes to mind is No country for old men.Excellent acting and very disturbing.

Secondly, the stardust used in the movie, including the likes of Christian bale, William Defoe and Woody Harrelson, Zoe Saldana, Forest Whitaker, always fell short of screen time.. If only Scott would have decided to stick with a straight up decent storyline, things would have been A lot better.Although the plot of the movie does shun some light on real life grave issues that many young war veterans are enforced to go through. But the plot was always weak and anemic to begin with. To top things off, the story narration is rather more abrupt and snappy at times, with years of time lapses, consequently, it loses its audience for a while till it suddenly decides to catch up..

The acting is superb, especially Casey Affleck, his finest performance. He really is outstanding in this character and fills the film with tension. All the other leads are very good as well. Well done Mr Scott! The story is compelling and could be the true life of some poor unfortunate people. Woody Harrelson rocks the violent psychopath as usual.

206,sgp-12345,"Out of the Furnace a Solid, But Conventional Crime Drama",7,7 December 2013,"Out of the Furnace, directed by Scott Cooper is a story of two brothers, Russell and Rodney Baze, played by Christian Bale and Casey Affleck respectively. Russell is a steel mill worker in a Northeast town, while his brother Rodney is an ex-Iraqi war veteran who has gone into a fighting club type crime ring in order to make money for himself. Russel (Bale) who loves his brother, Rodney (Affleck) wants to know what he does and why he does not work like himself. The story soon becomes a story of family, and what one brother is willing to do for the other.Scott Cooper, who first directed the movie Crazy Heart, which gave Jeff Bridges a Best Actor Award, really does do a good job of showing what the mill life is like, giving great setting shots of the mill and good cinematography of the land as well.What really enhances this movie just past average though is the acting. It was expected that with an all star cast such as Bale, Affleck, Woody Harrelson, Willem Dafoe, and Forest Whitaker that it was going to be well acted. The cast did not all have a huge impact, but there were a few performances noteworthy. For one, Christian Bale is solid here and continues to pad an impressive resume with films such as The Fighter and the Dark Knight trilogy. Casey Affleck, who was good in Ben Affleck's film Gone Baby Gone is also great and you feel for his character throughout the film. But the one who really shines in this is Harrelson, who plays a stone-cold bad guy who is the head of one of the crime rings. Harrelson, coming off the role of Haymitch in the Hunger Games franchise is so different here in this role that it's shocking and proves that he is indeed an incredible actor.Even with its great cast though, the film sometimes seemed a little bit too over dramatic, but most of all felt a little conventional to other movies. One that came to mind for myself was Viggo Mortensen's movie A History of Violence. The ending also felt a bit abrupt, but it was not bad enough to hurt the film too much. It is a grim film, but the mill and its workers set a nice tone for this type of film.Even with that said, Out of the Furnace is still an intense film and at times is a powerful story. The actors performances is what propels this film to commendable instead of what could have been just average.Rating: 7.5/10",Out of the Furnace

The plot is nothing special, nothing to keep you thinking of any aspect of the relationship of the characters. Just some American poor people, troubled as they use to be in the movies, some poor decisions, poor judgment crowned by stupidier problem solving. Somehow someone got money to cast Woody Harrelson but could not direct him to do a less comic book villain, every aspect of the character is overemphasized. They got Christian Bale to perform a comic book chase at the end, with a hunting rifle and a scope that could easily solve the situation without even braking a sweat . Fictional characters in a near documentary storyline besides some anti-climaxes like the final fight before the chase with the ages-old pseudo climax of pretending dead but kicking at the precise moment, ninja style. At the end, there is just the bland and washed out turning point where a mortally wounded villain is put out of his misery just because... neither drama nor action thriller.",Out of the Furnace
208,juhana-mustakallio,Apparently underrated movie.,9,4 April 2014,"This is one of the few movies in IMDb that has a lower rating than it should. I wonder if it's because of the slow tempo in this movie. It is kind of slow yes, but I think it's more realistic that way. And it also fits the main characters personality. I think this is one of the best characters Bale has performed. It really fits him. From a psychological perspective they created a character who stays in his role the whole movie and makes it feel whole and real. Where as in many movies the personality of the main character conveniently changes to fulfill the plot. It's not really a good date-night movie but one that makes you think. I think they made the right solutions in the movie but maybe not all would agree. I think this movie was extremely original, there were many elements that I hadn't seen before and they were carried out beautifully. The denouement wasn't clear and that's why I was kind of nervous about the ending. I think this movie deserves a way higher grade. And that's why I recommend you to watch it.",Out of the Furnace
209,nanvan108,A powerful film with among the best screen performances I've seen,9,2 December 2013,"When I saw the cast list, I knew there would be some wonderful performances, but I was surprised at how they uniformly surpassed my expectations. I believe it's Bale's best work so far, and that's saying something. Likewise with Affleck, Harrelson and Saldana. The rest of the cast was wonderful as well.There is one scene in particular (I won't spoil it here) where an actor lets loose in a way that careful directors and nervous producers would normally edit out. I applaud Scott Cooper for breaking the rule that films are meant to entertain (and earn millions), and raw emotion that feels too close to reality is to be avoided. It's inelegant, and not what we want to see from stars, especially attractive ones. Cooper lets people be people, and I find that incredibly refreshing.I was immediately invested in the characters -- warts and all. As painful as many of their decisions were to watch, I went along for those very bumpy rides, because any other course taken would be untrue for these characters.I recently saw ""12 Years A Slave,"" and feel inclined to mention that I sense a new, somewhat subversive style of filmmaking emerge -- and maybe a wonderful new culture in Hollywood. (At least I hope so.) It's one where films about extraordinary hardship are treated a way that doesn't hold back, glamorize or otherwise mollify them. In my opinion, when Hollywood slicks up violence (as it almost always does), it informs us that we shouldn't really be moved by its tragedy. We aren't shaken to the core and inspired to stop suffering wherever we can. That's shameful. So kudos to Cooper and to Steve McQueen for embracing a reality in their films that reconnects us with humanity instead of suggesting it's okay to blithely mock it.If I have any criticism of this film, it's that two scenes where one plays out as a metaphor for the other may not have been necessary. Otherwise, I feel the writing is disciplined and at the same time very rich and rewarding.The potential horrors of poverty and a lack of opportunity on display in this film are dealt with in a way that exempts political bias, and that in itself is a huge accomplishment.A sense of hope exists amidst the heartache of this film. I will see it again.",Out of the Furnace
210,lc023,"Hard to follow, horrible story-writing, decent acting",1,19 April 2014,"I have nothing against Christian Bale, I think he did a fine job in The Dark Knight. However, it seems that after The Dark Knight, the movies he's been in have just gone downhill. Out of the Furnace was no exception. The story-writing was choppy, very difficult to follow. I also was baffled by the random scenes that had NOTHING to do with what was currently happening, thrown in between of what was currently happening. That made the story extremely confusing. Was the screen writer and director trying to experiment with some new form of cinema? (And if they were, it does NOT work, I hope they don't try to take that concept to the patent office.) Also, the drama was slow and seemed to build up, but slowly decline backwards. It was like a kid pulling a wagon up a steep hill, nearly reaching the top, but letting go of the wagon and letting it roll back downhill, without actually making it to the top. I also was confused as to where the climax was. I don't think this movie really had one. The acting wasn't bad, in fact, it was very good. However, the screen writing SUCKED. I actually was upset when this movie ended, I felt like I was dooped an hour and a half of my time.

211,nevans1984,"Bale shows up, Harrelson and Affleck at their best",8,12 January 2015,"This film starts with the introduction of Russell Baze (Bale) who is shown to be a good guy who is pretty happy with life. He has a pretty girlfriend (Zoe Saldana), he works at the towns metal works, and looks after his brother, Rodney (Affleck), who is a soldier waiting to be posted to Iraq. Behind the scenes, Rodney makes a little extra cash as a back alley fighter. Rodney falls in with the wrong crowd (Harrelson), gets into debt, and leaves it for big brother, Russell, to come save the day. Christian Bale may have the 'Starring' role in this film, but it is really the duo Affleck and Harrelson that make this film electric. AFfleck and Harrelson give some of the most intense and terrifying performances that you will see on film. With Bale, I was left thinking 'I have seen better' from him. Although the character of Russell Baze is the main lead, he is not given much talk time, and I felt that there was more that could be done with the character. Woody Harrelson has recently started to shake off his reputation for being 'Not very good' with TV shows like 'True Detective' and films like this and 'No Country for Old Men' and the Hunger Games films, and again, he really nails his part of a crazed, lawless, drugged out fighter, but it's really Casey Affleck showing that he is a terrific actor. If you haven't seen his turn in 'The Killer Inside Me' then I definitely recommend you watch that. The film itself plods along in the vein of The Deer Hunter, or even a western a la 'Unforgiven'. Being British I was introduced to 'Get Carter', the 1971 Mike Hodges classic, from an early age, I really got a feel of that film whilst watching 'Out of the Furnace'. Casey Affleck is fast becoming the most intense character actor out there and there is no denying the man has some great acting chops. It must run in the family. I was surprised to find that this is only director, Scott Coopers second film, after 'Crazy Heart'. The film direction was handled superbly, and the end result is a film that will leave you satisfied, although maybe the last 5 minutes could have been handled slightly better.All in all, I would definitely recommend this film to anyone that enjoys intense, well acted films will enjoy this film.",Out of the Furnace

The movie aims to fall in the action/drama realm, and it has its moments in both, but it fails hardly in the action part. And the rhythm is too damn slow. Direction and editing did not help...

What we witnessed was a series of clichés, one after the other. The director succeeded in preventing a group of very good actors to work on their standards, because there was nothing to act upon. For these reasons, it's difficult for me to think to something to add here. This movie is void and shallow, characters aren't developed whatsoever and the plot is a summary of itself.

I agree with most here that the acting was top- notch but for what? Crazy Heart was pretty solid, if a bit overrated. I always thought it was a tad..off though and I couldn't put my finger on just why. I get it now. While it had some terrific scenes and Jeff Bridges turned in another powerful performance, it just didn't seem to jive with the salt-of-the-Earth country genre folks depicted. Like, the young woman's obsession with an elderly singer, despite his prior fame. And now, after watching OOTF (quite an appropriate acronym for this piece of crap), it all makes sense. Scott Cooper has no business telling stories about this particular group of Americans. He may have been born in Virginia but so little resembles reality, in my opinion. Forrest Whittaker's character is just weird, with an unsettling voice and cadence. Casey Affleck made decisions that made no sense. After begging low grade fight organizer John Petty for a chance to scrap with his New Jersey connections he goes up there and immediately acts like a complete, rude a-hole. For no reason. But perhaps the stupidest scene is the meth buy. Somebody on these boards already described why it was so bad but no drug transaction in the history of the controlled substance has ever gone down that way. ""yes, Mr. Complete Stranger, I'll sell you a fairly good amount of this very illegal and federally targeted drug and when you are a jerk to me I won't mind and when you refuse, twice, to even sample the product so I can be sure you're legit, I don't mind. Then, when you forget the baggie I'll run it outside to you."" So &%$* stupid it still upsets me as I think about it. There was no mystery, the tension died as soon as Affleck's corpse was found. For some reason the police decided not to pursue a capitol crime they had audio taped evidence of. This is the biggest waste of talent and anger-inducing film I've seen since Prometheus. Who read this script and thought ""hey, good flick!""? It truly had to be a literal moron.",Out of the Furnace
229,roryrozza,Nicely acted below par written story,5,26 April 2014,"I don't agree with a lot of IMDb user reviews, however many have this spot on - it's a very well acted, but ultimately badly written movie.Christian Bale plays Russell who along with his younger brother live in an economically- depressed small town, USA. Struggling to copy with there own inner demons, the movie shows how the brothers lives intertwine and ultimately come apart when they come into contact with local thug Harlon DeGroat - excellently played by Woody Harrelson. There are a subplots involving Russell's girlfriend and the local sheriff, but they aren't ever brought to a satisfactory conclusion. The character arcs just aren't well defined, and it's hard to care one way or another for the final outcome. Many characters seem superficial to the plot, including Forrest Whittaker, a fantastic actor who just seems wasted in his role as the sheriff. It's a shame as technically the movie looks great, the opening soundtrack by Pearl Jam seems perfectly fitting with the movies backdrop of blue collar middle America.It's just a shame that the great cast, visual quality and sound aren't complimented by a great storyline.",Out of the Furnace

But it turned out to be surprisingly good with strong performances from everyone involved. Casey Affleck and Zoe Saldana deliver good work on screen. Woody Harelson is also very convincing as the Red neck villain. The director has managed to paint a pretty vivid picture of the environment that he wanted to portray. The storytelling is very engaging. Thumbs up to the director and his team for this effort. In the end, no review can be complete without praising the man who continues to amaze with each performance, Christian Bale. Believable and heart warming in this one. He manages to accomplish the one thing which was most needed from anyone who played this character and that is being able to get the audience to empathize with it. Bale succeeds and then some.

I don't know but the writer shouldn't have done that end. The guy portrayed by Forrest wasn't necessary, he appears from nowhere in a story that was going good, and that end, I don't know. It was a top movie till the final minutes, and Bale had to do that. All right, is just a simple movie with a common end.By the way, I liked Woody role, to me one of the greatest of him.

233,mattralston1990,Very underrated and great film!!,10,9 February 2015,"Out of the Furnace has an outstanding cast of Christian Bale, Casey Affleck, Forrest Whitaker, Woody Harrelson, Willem Dafoe, Sam Shepard and Zoe Saldana. The film makes a statement with its chilling opening sequence where it sets the tone and establishes the character of Harlan Degroat (Woody Harrelson). The town that Out of the Furnace plays a big role in the film. It was mainly filmed in was the town of Braddock Pennsylvania, which is a depressed blue collar steel town. It mirrors the town of clarion Pennsylvania that The Deer Hunter was filmed in.Christian bale plays Russell Baze, who works at the local steel mill. Russell is a man who works hard and always trys to do the right thing, but is plagued by his economic circumstances as well as the circumstances of his brother Rodney Baze (Casey Affleck), his girlfriend Zoe Saldana, his dying father and getting in a car accident that sends him to prison . Rodney plays a marine who has gone through four tours in iraq and is dealing with post traumatic stresses from Iraq. instead of working with his brother he turns to bare knuckle fighting to pay off a debt that he owes John Petti (Willam Dafoe) who is a loan shark. When Rodney goes missing russell is torn between seeking revenge for his brother or keeping his freedom. Stellar performances and powerful themes. This should be a lot higher than 6.8 at least 7.3",Out of the Furnace
234,mrjrkelly,The potential was there - just a bit of a let-down in the end.,7,24 December 2013,"I was so excited for this movie, so anything less than the best movie I'd ever seen was going to be an anti-climax. From the trailer, you see Russell and Rodney hugging at the end: ""we're brothers, and that's all we have"" - so I assumed it was going to end by them being reunited. As for the plot, I really wasn't expecting Rodney to be killed off half way through the movie, although the dramatic irony in Bale's character then added a bit to the story. I think there was a lot of potential for Rodney to be assumed to dead by the police force, and Russell to be shaken by this, then carry on searching and find him at the end of the story; I guess that would be too optimistic for this film - maybe the fact that this didn't happen made this film hit harder than usual. Also I found it hard to believe that DeGroat would just try to run away when Russell's shot him a few times - maybe there would be some dialogue? Also, I wanted to find out if Russell gets arrested at the end - or maybe the police Chief lets him off, or maybe he joins in and shoots DeGroat? There were a few aspects of the film which could have been further developed: the relationship between Bale's and Saldanha's characters, Russell's time in prison and Rodney's tour in Iraq, and definitely the relationship between Russell and his uncle. In terms of acting, I think this is some of the best I've seen. Woody Harrelson is 100% believable as a drug-addicted crook; I hated him on a personal level after the first scene. Christian Bale is amazing in this film: especially when he's talking to Rodney in the prison (when he's trying to smile but ends up crying). Also, this is the first movie I've seen Casey Affleck in (I'm more familiar with his brother's work) - he was so moving when he's describing his tour in Iraq to Russell - part of this features in the trailer and was one of the reasons the trailer had me so hyped.The other reason, was the excellent choice of song in the trailer (I believe it's a cover of 'Heart Of Gold' originally by Neil Young) . . . . and it's not even in the movie?!?! That disappointed me big time. All in all this is somewhere between a 6 and a 7/10 - superb acting but the plot needed some work, and just feels a little rushed; it could have easily been a 2hr 30min movie.",Out of the Furnace

However , more than a technical perfection , is a work of political character , with a high content of philosophical reflections .The screenplay by Scott Cooper and Brad Ingelsby dating saga of Albert Camus' Stranger. And as the book of Camus , life drags Russell Baze ( Christian Bale ) by currents flowing in accordance with criteria that ignores , for which there is no power . It is always like that , actually.

Both represented what feels like a near futile struggle for survival as the odds just keep getting worse. Luxuries like love and dignity slip away and all that is left is to wonder if life itself is worth it.The performances, as mentioned in previous interviews, are powerful. Far from finding this film slow, I was compelled by the characters and wanted to know what was coming.

238,Mecces17,good actors don't make a good movie,6,13 November 2021,I'm kind of disappointed because i really would've liked to find a little gem here. Sadly the film doesn't live up to some of the top rated reviews here - probably because the script is a mess. Cooper never really knows which story to tell. Is this meant to be about revenge ? Brotherhood ? Depression ? A forgotten city somewhere in the US ? Bad Police work ? A romantic drama ? All these themes are just touched on the surface and never really in their core. Some huge editing mistakes (u can find these easily if you look closely) ruined it completely for me.This couldve been a much better movie.

Even the stellar cast doesn't save this one and how on earth the synopsis writer gives 9/10 is beyond me.Bale is pretty good, Harrelson menacing as always in these types of roles but Defoe is wasted here and should be holding down his own movies and Whitaker is completely miscast in my view ( what happened after The Last King of Scotland??). Saldana is very good as Bale's ex and usually is I might add.As a silly small point, at just after 1hr 38 of the movie whilst Bale is moving through the office, a man in a suit with grey hair can be clearly seen right behind Bale on the right hand side trying to move out of the way.

241,garretthunter,Some mesmerising performances in this story about Americans on the ropes.,8,17 January 2014,"In this, only his 2nd feature film, writer/director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart) continues to apply his Midas touch on his actors. 'Out Of The Furnace' produces some mesmerising performances.Set and shot in the grainy steel-town atmosphere of Braddock, Pennsylvania, the film conveys the austere beauty of industrial decay. Here is a portrait of Americans on the ropes; forgive the boxing parlance but this is a film about fighters, the working man fighting daily against his inevitable slide onto the scrap heap, the returning soldier fighting as hard to survive in America as he did on the battlefield in Iraq.It is the story of two brothers, Russell and Rodney Baze (respectively Christian Bale and Casey Affleck). Russell is the type of son Springsteen sang about in The River; from a town where ""..they bring you up to do just like your daddy done"". After working at the steel mill each day he calls in to care for his father, a father who is dying, we suspect, from the effects of a lifetime spent working at the self-same mill. Younger brother Rodney, a soldier, home from fighting in Iraq, sees what the mill has done to his father and has no intention of following that route. Seeking quicker money he first tries gambling and then, to pay his gambling debts, bare-knuckle fighting.Russell is almost too good to be true, a nurse to his father, an angelic older brother – he pays off much of Rodney's gambling debts – and a caring and sensitive partner to his live-in girlfriend, Lena (Zoe Saldana). Yet just when you think he has enough to deal with, fate lands him a cruel blow and he finds himself in prison. By the time he is released his father is dead, Lena has left him for local cop, Wesley Barnes (Forest Whittaker), the steel mill is about to close, and his brother is so deep in debt he must associate with some decidedly unsavoury characters in order to find ever more dangerous and higher paying fights.The man to whom he both owes money and fights for is John Petty (William Defoe). What for Petty is a cosy business arrangement - he bets on the pre-arranged outcome of Rodney's fights - is for Rodney an unhealthy downward spiral, and he knows it. Keen to clear all his debts in one go, he persuades a reluctant Petty to arrange a big money fight against the 'inbred' community ruled by sociopath Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson). DeGroat has the opening scene in this film and it is a scene of such brutality that his every subsequent appearance on screen creates tension. We know, as we see Petty and Rodney drive into DeGroat's world, disaster waits.Rodney fails to return to Braddock and Russell does what any hard working honest man would, he goes to the police for help. With the police chief, Wesley, sleeping with his ex, and yet impotent when it comes to finding (or even looking for) Rodney, Russell –finally– begins to awaken to the truth; America and its justice system was not built for the likes of him. After a futile foray into 'inbred territory' he must devise a plan to bring DeGroat to him.Harrelson's DeGroat has the power to become one of our favourite on screen baddies. He exudes such menace that when the climactic scenes arrive we expect a momentous battle between good and evil, and we know, win or lose, he will find a way to express the ruthless evil we know him to possess. The entire final encounter however falls short of our expectations. It seems cropped and almost hurried, and although it satisfies and rounds the story it doesn't deliver on the promise the opening scene sets up, which was to shock us out of our skins. Instead perhaps a more cerebral conclusion is offered, one which questions which way discarded Americans will turn, towards or away from the rule of law. For this is the choice Russell must make, and DeGroat, in the final scene seems to know the answer, we can see it in his eyes.The film as a whole is a success; a great cast working from a good script; with sparse and well defined dialogue. Cooper's honest directorial approach focuses on the performances; and what performances he draws. Defoe can express more in a body movement than many actors can in a monologue, and he uses his talents exquisitely here. The surprise package is Affleck, in his heaviest role to date, as a returning war veteran with hellish memories burning behind his eyes; he can light up the screen. It is Harrelson however who steals this show. He is majestic as the king of the under-classes. Here is an actor at the peak of his energies, and just as Affleck can add light, Harrelson can draw the light in and darken it - too early to talk of an Oscar?Bale can play exceptional and the extraordinary characters with aplomb, but this portrayal of an ordinary man isn't entirely satisfying. Perhaps this is due to his humility and generosity in playing Russell as rather flat-line. He does not pander to our desire for him to explode from his inertness. It is left to Affleck to provide the luminance, and Harrelson to steal it away.From 'Out Of The Furnace' comes a family, an industry, and an entire class of society in meltdown. It is a film which portrays a bleak and somewhat hopeless landscape of modern America, but how enjoyable the artistry.Garrett Hunter - Britflicks",Out of the Furnace

So i went to watch that movie. But it all went different: At the beginning you get a look at the main characters and their ""universe"". Alright, the mainframe gets set up. BUT: A half-clever person can imagine already after 20 minutes what the story will be going to. One hour went by (The film goes almost 2) but nothing really had happened. The two brothers only have a lot of problems. Another half hour passes by and everything is still so boring. SPOILER: Only at the last 20 minutes happens some kind of revenge-action. This is so lame, Even the ending is lame. Another thing: The main character is an asshole. He sets a up a trap for the redneck-guy in which the innocent brother of the bar-owner gets killed.

The movie itself isn't original. At its heart, it's a story about two lower class American brothers who are making their way through life trying to make a living, even if the two of them have different ideas of how to go about making a living. The acting is decent. Christian Bale and Woody Harrelson both excel in their respective parts and the rest of the cast aren't so bad either. Be forewarned though that despite Zoe Saldana's and Forest Whittaker's high billing, they don't appear in this movie too much. This movie is about Christian Bale so be prepared for that. Like I said earlier, the concept isn't original and at nearly 2 hours in length, the viewer must be patient. But if your idea of a good movie is one that revolves around revenge and the brutal reality of life for some of the people, then this film may be for you.

The setting could be any small town in the US where people face hardships everyday and as a non-American, I find it fascinating to witness this face of America. Mainstream TV leads one to believe that America is only how it's shown in Friends, Boston Legal, HIMYM etc and it's refreshing to watch a different America, a more real America maybe.The actors have done a great job.

The movie will insult your intelligence. We see right away, there's only one way an encounter between Bale and Harrelson will play out. (Harrelson is the villain here, surprise surprise) Bale plays the role of a older brother who serves as a guardian to his little brother (Affleck) who arrives back from Iraq. Affleck is quite the rebellious type and considering this is a small town in which the movie partakes in, heads will be bumped. And yours will be cocked to the left, embraced in unconsciousness and drooling the minutes away. Christian Bale's performance was stellar and convincing. It's safe to say the man did his job here. Harrelson and Affleck also had great moments in the film, moments may be a stretch - sparks are more appropriate.

When it finally ""get's Down to business"" you have been bored almost 1½ hour and you just want to get it done and get out of the theatre.

262,nhietter,I really really wanted to like it.,5,1 January 2014,"I'll be completely honest, I went in thinking that I was going to love this movie. I had no reason to believe otherwise. Absolutely stellar cast, The directors last movie, Crazy Heart, was great. And it has a solid 7 rating. I wanted to like this movie, hell I wanted to love it! But somehow, along the way something went dreadfully wrong.The acting was as good as it could be and there were a few scenes where Casey Affleck and Christian Bale actually had a moving performance but that was not enough to save this movie from a dreadful screenplay and direction. The movie kept presenting itself as deep, emotional and powerful revenge story but we are given no reason to connect to any of it. We are shown a violent scene in the beginning that sets Woody Harrelson as an evil bad guy and thats as deep as it goes. Christian clearly loves his family. Casey has been disturbed by the war and now wants to die. Forrest is a cop who wants ""justice"" and stole Christian's girlfriend. We spend a majority of the movie setting up these characters but we never get any deeper than that. They are entirely one dimensional for duration of the film. The tone is bland throughout and the director fails to generate any sort of tension or excitement and the result is very boring. The scenes feel greatly disconnected and many of them unimportant as they fail to progress the stories or the characters development. The soundtrack was nice at first but as the movie went on the music was less and less fitting and it got to be that at times I wondered if a deaf person chose the score. Acting:1.5/2 Directing:.5/2 Screenplay:.5/2 Cinematography:1/2 Soundtrack:1/2 Whole Movie: 4.5/10 In my opinion the director should go back to making deep character study movies where someone else writes the script. He was onto something with crazy heart but he should definitely stay away from action because this movie was baaaad.",Out of the Furnace

The movie is worth watching for that scene alone.The cinema-photography draws you in, the plot is compelling, the dialogue is subtle, and the performances by the incredibly talented caste was impressive/inspiring.I am hard to please when it comes to movie. I'll sit through anything entertaining, but rarely do I find myself compelled to write a review. This film is a ""Must-see"" in my books.Bale, Saldana, Dafoe, Whitaker, Affleck, and Harrelson all showcase their full potential in this movie. It is worth it for the acting alone.

Unfortunately, when times get tough, good people are forced to do questionable things in order to survive. And this film does an incredible job of portraying that.

Woody Harrelson and Casey Affleck also did incredible jobs with their characters.",Out of the Furnace
269,twcrossman,Still an accurate portrait of many towns in America today,10,6 December 2013,"Weeks before I took the time to see Out of the Furnace on its opening day today, I saw an interview with the cast where star Christian Bale made a comment about how the script and the character really stuck with him before he'd ever agreed to take the role. While I normally hate to see a film based on something ANY of the actors involved have said (because really, who WOULDN'T give their film a nice push to the press?), I had a gut feeling I'd want to see this one. It's a good thing I tend to go with my gut, because if you watch for two hours with an open mind, Out of the Furnace is certainly filled with dilemmas people across America STILL face on a daily basis -- and that alone is why it will hit too close to home. It is why some people will say it is ""too"" gritty, ""too"" depressing, ""too"" much of something. I'm a New Jersey native, and my state is filled with many towns that are run down and haven't seen anything positive happen in them in decades. A town not far from me lost its heart when a tea factory was forced out and jobs outsourced to China in the 90s. Just across the border, 20 minutes into Pennsylvania, is an old steel town (not the one in the film) that drove workers out of their mills in the 80s, the old blast furnaces still towering over the ""south side"" of town that is dotted with row homes. If you've ever driven through Michigan, at least a handful of cities there would paint the same picture as anything you'll see in Out of the Furnace. In Indiana, the same. I point this out because several moviegoers in the theater where I saw the film were saying that Out of the Furnace paints an unrealistic portrait of the ""worst"" parts of America, making them seem worse than they are. But until people have lived that lifestyle, it's easy to say that it doesn't still exist. What I appreciated about Furnace is that Cooper had the guts to make a gritty film that points out that there are towns filled with good people who can never get beyond their ""hard times"". Is it unrealistic, perhaps, to assume that bare-knuckle fighting rings are organized nationwide? Perhaps. It doesn't mean, however, that there aren't plenty of illegal activities happening at the hands of ""desperate"" men (many of our nation's veterans are homeless, don't forget). Cooper chose Braddock as a great setting for this film, and he chose great actors to portray ""everyman"". And honestly, I see why he waited for Christian Bale to come around to making this film; nobody could have pulled off Russell Baze the way that Bale does -- with his quiet desperation, his eyes telling you everything that is churning in his gut, the weariness settled into his body making him sometimes appear aged beyond his years. Where Bale brings a quietness to Russell, Casey Affleck brings the loud emotive bursts and the scrappiness of his youth to Rodney Baze, and the two work wonderfully in balancing the ""brotherhood"" aspect of the film. While I fault Cooper for failing to tell us more of the relationship between the two, I feel that both actors worked hard to bring the familial bond to the forefront of the story. There are several aspects to the storytelling that are to be admired. For one, the juxtaposition between Russell out hunting while his brother is being driven to what could potentially be his death match -- a ""hunt"" of his own -- was brilliant in its pacing. The same can be said for the scene where we assume the ""bad"" guy (Woody Harrelson taking a terrifying turn as the film's antagonist) is going to finally be caught by the law enforcement swarming his home. And finally, the bridge scene between Russell and Lena (Baze's girlfriend played admiringly well by Zoe Saldana) is one that gives a heart to a film that is otherwise dark and depressing. It's because of moments like these that I was able to overlook the film's obvious flaws. There is patchy storytelling (blame the script writers), but the actors all grab hold of the material they've been given and work well with it despite its shortcomings. What I ultimately applaud Out of the Furnace for is the fact that these characters could still represent many people in this country and throughout the world. How far would we ALL go, trying so hard to be ""good"" day in and day out, waiting for a break, trying to earn the extra dollar...before we got tired of the rest of the world getting ahead without us, and we take matters into our own hands?Out of the Furnace poses this thought-provoking question and lets the viewer see how you can go down either path. Everyone wants to say that they'd still stay on the straight and narrow, but until you can put yourselves into the shows of these characters, you just truly never know. Ask yourself what you would do if Rodney Baze was YOUR brother? How far would you go for family -- for a family member who had put his own life on the line for this country? How far would you go in a town where everything else had shut down around you? Cooper doesn't give us the best film of the year with Out of the Furnace, but he and this cast give you plenty to think about long after the credits roll.",Out of the Furnace

Halfway through it seems as if the movie could earn the 11$ I paid for it. Sadly I was mistaken as the halfway marked reach the only good 10 minutes of the movie (which was ONLY showed in the trailer) which was extremely misleading. On either side of the entertaining 10 minutes you will get 1.) A beginning that will near put you asleep, 2.)

I have close friends who i would advise not to watch the film at all as it would more than likely send them into a fit of anger. Not at the film, but for whats happening in it.

272,mweisba4,"A realistic, gritty and brutal character study",9,10 December 2013,"I saw the trailer a few months back and was immediately intrigued. Even in the couple minutes of footage I knew there was going to be strong acting.This movie is not perfect by any means, but in all honesty I do not think there is a real thing as a ""perfect movie"". This is not a movie for the average film-goer. ""Out of the Furnace"" falls into the same category as films such as ""In Bruges"" and ""Killing them Softly"". What all of these films have in common is that they all are slow, somewhat tedious character studies, which is not going to be appreciated by the masses. All of these films are brutal in their own way and we get attached to characters that are somewhat repulsive in nature, but yet we feel and connect with their emotions.""Out of the Furnace"" burns with emotion. I believe a film is great when the narrative keeps you engaged and on your toes. You really don't know where the story is going to take you. The story is not the most important element of this film. The substance and beautifully acted characters are what keep you drawn in.Casey Affleck's raw emotion when breaking down to Bale's character shook me to my core. That scene left me trying to understand my own life and what purpose that I serve. It was heartbreaking to watch because I have friends and family that have experienced the atrocities of war and Affleck's brutally honest emotions created an unforgettable scene.There is so much heartbreak in this movie that it is difficult to watch. Christian Bales eyes convey all of the heartbreak and disappointment in Russell Baze's life. Woody Harrelson's, Harlan Degroat is acted with supreme repulsiveness. I don't think any other actor could have pulled off that type of wretchedness, but yet you still feel a connection to that character.The surroundings are hauntingly realistic. Being from Cleveland and in the steel industry, the portraits of small steel town Pennsylvania are all too real in all of its non glorified grittiness. For those who have no experience in that type of environment, I hope you can try to appreciate the filmmakers vision of bringing the harsh reality of the decaying American dream front and center in the most uncomfortable way.""Out of the Furnace"" creates a visually haunting and stunning experience with legendary acting that will most certainly stick with you long after you have completed the film, For your entertainment only, need not apply.

273,ehmalheur,Poor People Wash,3,12 December 2013,"Several things bothered me when watching this movie.Working class and poor people wash their hair. Almost everyone in this movie has greasy hair as a working class signifier. It really made me mad.People living in a town ten miles outside of Pittsburgh don't have Southern accents. People from NJ also don't have Southern accents, even if they live in the mountains. I assume the Southern accents were used to let the audience know that these were uneducated people.People don't drink out of mason jars unless they happen to have them lying around. They probably aren't going to be found in a drug house. Moonshine is sold in plastic bottles nowadays, I hear.Other than that, this is a dark, violent, and depressing movie set in a poor, small town. Most of the cast was great, but overall the movie didn't work for me.

The ending was also anticlimactic. While I (think) I get the point they were trying to make, it fell short.It made me think of Gone in 60 Seconds in the beginning, but just a little, having to do with similar plot devices.It's worth seeing for the acting, but it won't be one I'd see again.

A very moving performance by Christian Bale. And Woody Harrilson continues to reinvent himself with every role I see him in. The plot was moving, engaging, and believable. The earlier blogger who stated that this was an accurate depiction of blue-collar life was right. I see Christian Bale as the Tommy Lee Jones of our generation as opposed to the Robert Deniro of our generation (as one previous blogger compared him to).

The problem that really takes this film down and certainly contributed to it's poorly written story was the lack of realism.Those people that praise this movie for it's ""Gritty"" depth and other words that try to make it sound good are either fooling themselves because they are big fans of one of the actors or what is more likely,just dumb as a sack of hammers.How is that for down home gritty realism?There are many scenes in this movie that are embarrassing and should insult most people's intelligence,but if you gotta look then check out what could be the most idiotic and ridiculously stupid drug deals in the history of cinema that actually takes itself seriously or check out how the sheriff and law enforcement deal with a felon carrying and shooting a rifle,who just so happens is involved with the sheriffs girlfriend.There is even an interracial theme thrown in the story for good measure,which just seems forced into a part of the movie that is not very believable in any case or race.",Out of the Furnace

283,greg-52-418654,Miscast and Misguided,3,12 July 2014,"First of all, this plot steels so much from Deerhunter, from the location to the soldier brother with a death wish pressing for underground fighting/Russian roulette to the main characters inability to shoot a deer. But what made this movie truly disappointing was while it has good actors in it, they are largely miscast and the plot becomes more and more unbelievable as plot goes forward (after the first strong scene with Woody Harrelson). I realize that we have seen tour de force acting from Christian Bale (The Machinist) and Forrest Whitiker/Woody Harrelson (multiple films) but regardless of his acting skills Woody Harrelson at 175 pounds doesn't fit the physical stature of an intimidating hillbilly and Casey Affleck at 155 is difficult to imagine as a fighting machine. Even without makeup Zoe Saldana looks more like a ballerina than a poor school teacher dating a 50 year old overweight cop chosen over Christian Bale (who works in a steel mill) in 2014. Put on top of that the concept that Christian Bale can walk into a hillbilly crack house in Western Penn and not stand out very obviously that he is not a junkie? Then after they ask him if he is a cop and then working his way up to the top floor (why they would let him that far) he asks if anyone knows Harlan DeGroat (The Harrelson Character) who coincidentally owns the house and happens to be downstairs at the time, yet despite this chance of luck, Bale vengeful of his brother and out for blood at any cost chooses to simply walk out without any confrontation at all, and the suspicious hillbillies just let him leave. Lastly the final scene, when Bale is chasing Harrelson with a Shotgun, he could fire about 5 times, but rather than shoot decides to let him run into an area with lots of hiding spaces before finally opening fire. I realize that we are often asked to suspend disbelief in the movies, but I have an easier time doing that in a fantasy than a ""gritty thriller"" the way this is billed. Let's start putting unknown actor into these offbeat parts and add to the gritty realism rather than Hollywood Stars and Hollywood situations.

A lot of guys came back from Iraq and Afghanistan with memories that will never leave them, and a much greater percentage of us came back with absolutely no combat experience whatsoever. But you'd never guess that based on the portrayal of the military in the media.Aside from that, the way the plot is thrown together, with very little information regarding a timeline, does little to help the way the film plays. It basically brushes aside the fact that a man kills one, if not two, people in a car accident. It spends more time showing him in prison than it does dealing with the accident. That makes sense.

Why is Affleck's character so different than Bale's? Why is the antagonist (Harrelson) so tortured? Affleck's love interest (Saldana) is nothing more than a footnote with very little time on screen.

I grew up in a metropolis and have no idea the struggles caused by a dying industry in towns across America losing their manufacturing plants, steel mills, the rust belt but wow this movie rips you out of your cozy living room and puts you straight into the gray deserted towns, and desperation that remains after jobs and manufacturing plants close down. What's more Christian Bale's portrayal of a silent solemn and hopeless life doesn't need words, You feel it in his expressions, mannerisms, interaction, daily tasks. Bale nonverbally communicates exactly how it must be to live in such a sad state every day especially after his brother goes missing. Then add in, Casey Afleck, amazing gritty performance, as Bale's lost younger brother confused after returning from Iraq and trying to find a place in a country that has abandoned him or maybe he's trying to forget the war and heal his mind & soul or maybe he is trying to finish himself off ~ quickest exit he knows that still allows him to hold his head high. The real villain in the story, has taken being evil to a new level, Woody Harrelson's performance guarantees you will hate and loath his character for his decrepitness and loss of humanity, a reflection of someone who takes advantage of people at their lowest point and manipulates them at their most vulnerable state. He is amazing and masterful so believable as the worst, most evil of those who prey on what's left of society's remains and forgotten people. Great performances by all the minor characters, Forest Whitaker, Willem Dafoe, Sam Shepherd and Zoe Saldana who portrays another lost soul, who keeps you wondering how she got there and why doesn't she leave...run away from all the sadness and inescapable desolation of a crumbling dying town. The script is everything, the writing is so real, I kept grabbing my couch to make sure I was still at home & not in their town. See it",Out of the Furnace
