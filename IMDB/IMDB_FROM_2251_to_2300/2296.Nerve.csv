0,Leofwine_draca,Nothing more than a rip-off,4,23 October 2018,"I did get a chuckle when I saw another reviewer calling this a film with ""some originality"". It's nothing more than a straight-up rip-off of the interesting Thai flick 13: GAME OF DEATH, albeit with a teen-friendly rating and a young adult feel so that you know things are never going to get too explicit or disturbing. The most interesting thing about this one is the commentary on the Internet age, which comes as little surprise given the directors are the guys behind CATFISH. Sadly, the plot itself is meandering and overlong, interesting during the set-piece challenges but entirely routine otherwise. The film loses points for starring the vapid Emma Roberts as the lead, a totally unlikeable and insubstantial figure, and Dave Franco isn't much better either. Sadly it takes more than decent direction to make a good film, and NERVE falls at the first hurdle.",Nerve
1,SnoopyStyle,fun until ending,6,30 March 2018,"Vee Delmonico (Emma Roberts) is excited to be accepted to a college in California. She is concerned about leaving her mother (Juliette Lewis) behind in Staten Island after a family tragedy. Her best friend Sydney (Emily Meade) shows her an underground internet game called Nerve. Participants are divided between players and watchers. Players do dares for money and watchers pay to watch the players on their 24 hour adventures. After being embarrassed by Sydney, Vee decides to play. Her first dare is to kiss a stranger and she picks Ian (Dave Franco). They are then dared to partner up on an exciting journey into the city.The premise, the style, and the actors make a fun, thrilling action adventure in the city. There are little problems that can be overlooked for the most part. The conclusion is key and it does certain things to wrap it all up too neatly. It takes the fun dark web idea and slaps on a Hollywood ending. Overall, it was fun while it lasted.",Nerve
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Starts off okay, but quickly turns into a huge mess",4,22 September 2016,"""Nerve"" is a 95-minute thriller from this year that is based on a novel by Jeanne Ryan. Jessica Sharzer (""Speak"", ""American Horror Story"") adapted the work for the screen and the directors are Henry Joost and Ariel Schuman, both known mostly for ""Catfish"" so far. The lead actress is Emma Roberts and the only other cast members I knew in here were her co-lead Dave Franco, brother of James, and Juliette Lewis playing the main character's mother. Most of the cast, also because of the subject, are pretty young aspiring actors that do not (yet?) have a big name. I kinda liked Emily Meade (even if the friendship story between her and the main character was one of the weakest parts of the film) and I can see her having a good future in film. But let's look a bit at the now and this movie. It is a take on Big Brother with a mix of ""Hunger Games"" and an ounce of David Fincher's ""The Game"", so if you hear all this you already know it is a mostly dark take on the age of surveillance. Here we have a young woman who gets told by her best friend that she just isn't taking enough risks to lead a fulfilling life. So she agrees to join in a virtual reality game called ""Nerve"", in which she gets watched constantly by thousands of people while she has to fulfill quests. These quests quickly get her to join forces with Franco's character.And from that moment on, the two are out there together and the Watchers see them and hope for them to start a relationship. There is some situational comedy in this film and this was mostly working well. But sadly, in stark contrast to that, the real core of the film was not working for the most part. I am referring to the dramatic thriller sequences. They start off okay, but the script is quickly lost in a whirlwind of desperate attempts to become more controversial, more shocking and more relevant. The social commentary/criticism, which is what the film really is all about, also with a reference to our world, becomes complete garbage at some point and lacks realism entirely. One major problem is Roberts' main character. In one scene, she is scared to step on the motorcycle, in the next she accelerated the bike with her driver blindfolded. A rush of adrenaline cannot explain that. Same can be said about the ladder climbing scene. Let's not forget: This film takes place over the course of one evening/night and I just refuse to believe a character would change like that from one second to the next on all these contradictory occasions.At some point, I felt the film really went for nothing than shock value and it was very empty and irrelevant as a consequence. Police won't do anything to stop the hosts of the game, even after a kid died earlier and probably more did if we are taking into account all the risky action. But a teenage boy and his pals can hack into the system and send messages that call everybody an ""accessory to murder"". This was maybe the most embarrassing moment, even if the idea about ending it at the very end felt very false as a whole. And why would everybody, even the ""bad"" guy, know about her plan, but Franco's character, the one closest to her, would not know? There were just so many scenes that did not make any sense at all in the second half of the film. Emma Roberts did not impress me at all. Sure this is a film that is much more about the story and plot than about individual performances, but I was shocked how irrelevant her character and performance felt throughout the entire film. A more gifted actress certainly could have elevated the material and her speech in front of the crowd at the very end was nothing special either, more on the cringeworthy side. Franco, a fairly mediocre actor himself, looked really strong next too her. And Juliette Lewis? Oh well. I felt almost sorry for her about what they gave her in terms of the script. The character added absolutely nothing at all, but that's not Lewis' fault, just because of the way she was written. Apart from that, I refuse to believe that the crowd would really want a certain character here to die. First of all, humans aren't that cruel. Second of all, we were led to believe they loved her immediately the moment she entered the game. Make up your mind filmmakers and please don't give me the argument of people's opinions changing fast.Okay, enough said. I am fairly disappointed here. This was definitely a missed opportunity. The film showed some solid premise early, but it quickly turned into a huge mess. I am actually glad it was relatively short and did not get any closer to the two-hour mark. I have not read the book this is based on, so no idea who is to blame and if the base material is also really weak, but if not, then I cannot image Ryan being too happy with the way this turned out overall. I just hope they don't get the idea at some point to make a sequel here. This original was already underwhelming enough. I certainly do not recommend the watch. The longer it went, the worse it became, also with the ridiculously bad rushed-in happy ending for everybody. Stay away from this film.",Nerve
3,nogodnomasters,Are you ready for your first dare?,8,16 October 2017,"Vee (Emma Roberts) and Sydney (Emily Meade) are besties. Sydney plays an on-line game called ""Nerve."" It is like truth or dare except there is no truth. You pay to watch and you get payed to play, taking the dares of the watchers. Sydney coaxes Vee into playing and Vee quickly becomes more popular than Sydney as competition across NYC escalates to the point of being criminal.The characters were very good and the film has a message about the responsibility that the viewer has, although that didn't play into the film until the very end. The production is aimed at people half my age. It is much better than a bunch of the cyber BS that is out there. So if you have grown weary of watching big foot found footage films and the cinnamon challenge on U-Tube, try this out.Guide: No F-words that I recall. No sex. Emily Meade shows her butt on a dare.",Nerve
4,kosmasp,Nerve-wrecking,7,22 January 2017,"Or something along those lines. For some this may feel very boring, but others may actually enjoy this. It depends if you buy into the ""high concept"" of the movie. The one shot idea if you want to call it that. The actors are doing a really good job conveying their feelings and the dread they are experiencing.This is not the first movie to use an idea like this. But it's the most tech savvy (up until the end that is, which is at the very least questionable) one up to date. If you are into this kind of thing you will be entertained enough. The question you have to ask yourself is, if you are just watching ... Well the disc and it's extras do ask you that. The Behind the scenes stuff is on the Watcher tab, the Dare tasks are on the Player tab. So there is more to the movie experience than just watching it",Nerve
5,lee_eisenberg,play if you dare,5,30 December 2016,"I was surprised to learn that ""Nerve"" is based on a book. This story of an online game that forces the players to engage in dares is something that's hard to picture as a book. As a movie, it's OK not great. Mark my words, the scenes where people perform the dares are some intense scenes, but the ending was a little flat. If there's anything that we should take away from the movie, it's that spending all one's time on an online game can be dangerous (never mind the fact that people can use those games to collect your personal information).So, it's not my first recommendation if you're looking for something to watch.",Nerve
6,studioAT,Learning to hold your nerve,5,3 January 2017,"'Nerve' is one of those films that quietly went under the radar at the cinema, but seem to catch on via word of mouth.Truth is it's a decent film, inspired by a YA book. It also acts as a vehicle for up and coming talents such as Emma Roberts and Dave Franco, who both give good performances.Roberts in particular shines in every scene, and it is her character of Vee who goes through the biggest journey throughout.The plot doesn't hold up to much scrutiny, but it is an action packed film, that proves entertaining.If you can stomach the fact that it's really just people doing lots of irresponsible things then you'll enjoy the film. Parents thinking of letting their teens watch it should be wary though.",Nerve
7,neil-476,Moderately original,7,23 May 2018,"Responding to provocation from her more adventurous best friend, Vee becomes a player in online game Nerve, in which Players undertake challenges set by subscribing Viewers, performing via live phonecam videofeeds, for cash rewards. But it doesn't take long for the challenges (starting at the relatively innocuous ""Kiss a stranger for 5 seconds for $100"") to become downright hazardous.Despite a superficial resemblance to the 1997 Michael Douglas thriller The Game, this film is very much its own thing. Built on the internet tendency towards selfies and online gaming and disclosure of massive amounts of personal information, plus a leaning towards thrillseeking - we've all seen the sort of youtube videos embodying risk-taking - this film has a plausible set up and a believable escalation in the risks offered.It does, however, leave you wondering a bit about some of the later developments - how is Nerve run, why can't you get out of it, how are they able to apply certain sanctions? - which needed a tighter hand on the scriptwriting. These shouldn't have been questions that arose, let alone remained unanswered.Emma Roberts, credibly playing a character 10 years younger, does well and looks good in lingerie, and Dave Franco as her partner in crime is also fine.This is essentially an adventure thriller with mild suspense and little substance, yet it held my interest and entertained me throughout: there were some nice graphic flourishes which helped you understand how the game was progressing. Especially recommended if you are fond of taking selfies!",Nerve
8,anaconda-40658,Nerves a Plenty.,8,4 August 2016,"Nerve (2016): Dir: Henry Joost, Ariel Schulman / Cast: Emma Roberts, Dave Franco, Miles Heizer, Emily Meade, Juliette Lewis: The title not just references one's emotional heights, but it is the name of a sickening online game where people can either watch or participate in dares for which cash is deposited into their bank accounts if they succeed. This becomes dangerous as dares aim to riskier heights. Emma Roberts plays Venus, or Vee as her nickname says. She accepts based on the taunting of one of her friends who is popular as a result. Based on a kissing a stranger dare she ends up hooking up with Dave Franco. Together they end up running near nude through a department store. Franco drives blindfolded on a motorcycle while Vee plays his eyes and directions. They are appealing leads but much of their antics boarder on being corny and extreme. In supporting roles are Miles Heizer as Vee's male friend who is not impressed with her new daring relationship. He is a computer nerd concerned for the safety of his friend. Emily Meade plays her popular friend who feels her popularity fading when Vee's dare takes attention. This forces her into an extreme situation. Juliette Lewis is unfortunately underused as Vee's mother who works at the hospital. We learn that her brother died two years prior and that Lewis wants her to accepts a college near by. Two directors manage to sift through the lame stunts by presenting style and location work that carries a personality of its own. It takes aim at social media and everyone's obsession with everything wrong with society. Score: 8 ½ / 10",Nerve
9,FlashCallahan,Holds its Nerve........,8,28 October 2016,"For anyone who has seen the film 'Cheap Thrills' you will instantly recognise the story and the narrative, because Nerve is basically a big budget-ish remake of that film. Just with better looking people and lots is stunning visuals.What a Nerve.....High school senior Vee is tired of living life on the sidelines. Pressured by her friends, Vee decides to join Nerve, a popular online game that challenges players to accept a series of dares. It's not long before the competition requires her to perform increasingly dangerous stunts. When when the game takes a sinister turn, Vee finds herself in a finale that will ultimately determine her entire future.......The first thing that stands out about the film is just how stylish it is. Even though it's set in the present, you can almost sense an air of TRON in the films breath, and it's a credit to the film makers for doing this, because it enhances the narrative and makes the film just that little more exciting.The film does contain the tropes that most films aimed at teens have, like best friends falling out, people losing their status, and the will they won't they aspect of the film, but because the editing is done so well, you hardly recognise the predictable elements to the film.Roberts and Franco have wonderful chemistry, and they make the film just that little more urgent because of their quest.It's Saw for the little ones if you would, nothing spectacular, but well worth your time.Just don't be surprised if their are a slew of direct to Blu Ray sequels soon.",Nerve
10,trashgang,"flashy editing, great score but weak story but it does work out fine",7,13 November 2016,"Teenagers around me told me that I needed to see this flick about an online game going wrong. Knowing that it wasn't a horror but was in the style of Unfriended (2014). Were the latter did had it's creepy moments this is just an action flick but action for the teens having FOMO and walking this earth, let's say all teens (LOL)Was it bad, no it wasn't, even as the story was rather weak and the ending was a bit laughable (and was open also ready to make part 2) I was attracted due the way it was edited and shot. Made in saturated colors and flashy editing I kept watching until the end and the ending was quicker then I thought it would be.It all starts rather with a simple 'dare' game like showing your naked butt and things teens do for fun but quickly the game becomes dangerous and jealousy ( with a lesson) and love enters into the story. Luckily the love theme didn't became the major asset.The score did remind me a bit of the Cliff Martinez soundtracks (remember Drive (2011) for example). Acting is okay for such kind of flicks. It didn't get on my nerve so that doesn't say a thing about Nerve.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5",Nerve
11,KineticSeoul,"Watered down version of ""13 Sins""",4,3 November 2016,"What this movie is, is a watered down version of ""13 Sins"" that try to be edgy and focuses in on the teens as target audiences. I still recommend ""13 Sins"" over this flick. But I do give this movie some credit despite the cheesiness. Is how it depicts people and technology and networks that goes viral. Humanities longing for attention and the distance they will go to get attention and be noticed. Even if it can harm themselves and others in the process. Besides that, this was a dull movie to sit through with a really dumb plot. Some parts just seemed like a insult to the audiences intellect, by it trying to appear edgy, hip and witty but just comes off pretty lame, flat and boring. If you are an audience member that can handle the violence I recommend ""13 Sins"" over this.4.5/10",Nerve
12,Hellmant,A lot better than I was expecting it to be!,7,7 November 2016,"'NERVE': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new teen cyber-thriller, from directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman; the duo also helmed the social media documentary 'CATFISH', the thriller 'VIRAL' and the found footage horror flicks 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 2' and '3'. The film tells the story of a high school senior that enters an online reality game; in which players except challenges from people watching them, and are rewarded with money prizes. The longer she stays in the game, the more dangerous the challenges become though. The film was written by Jessica Sharzer, and it's based on the 2012 novel (of the same name) by Jeanne Ryan. It stars Emma Roberts and Dave Franco. The movie received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it was a hit at the Box Office. I enjoyed it.Vee (Roberts) is about to graduate from high school, while still grieving over the recent death of her brother. Her friend Sydney (Emily Meade) is becoming really popular playing the online reality game 'Nerve'. In 'Nerve' people accept challenges from 'watchers', people that pay to watch them, and if they complete the challenges they're rewarded with money. After being bullied by Sydney, for never taking risks, Vee enters the game and starts accepting challenges. The challenges become more and more dangerous as she goes on though, and the watchers soon control her every move. She finds help, and possible romance, from another game player named Ian (Franco). The movie was a lot better than I was expecting it to be, I didn't realize who directed it when I started watching it though. I did enjoy 'CATFISH'; I'm not a huge fan of the 'PARANORMAL ACTIVITY' films though, but they're not bad. Knowing who was behind the film does explain to me (now) why it had a certain feel to it that I wasn't expecting. It's pretty intense, in certain moments, and surprisingly creepy. I'm not a big fan of the two lead actors though, and the film is a little too geared towards teens sometimes.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/hx1_SKfiNWs",Nerve
13,FeastMode,my notes,4,30 June 2019,"I was very entertained for most of this movie. i enjoyed the weird premise. i like that it was very music based with lots of cool-looking scenes. this could've easily been a 3.5. but a few dumb things started creeping in here and there. and then it just became laughable. literally. also, i like dave franco, but i'm not so sure he's a good actor.

when she finds out that dave franco's character got another dare to bring her to the party, she got so mad, and just because of that she decided that the game was bad and she needed to stop it. even tho five seconds before she was still playing it like it as awesome. and franco getting a dare to bring her to the party isn't even that bad or like a big betrayal. ""ppl could die."" but she was the one walking on the ladder five seconds earlier. it made no sense what changed from her being all into the game to her needing to stop the game. also, the whole plan at the end and the speech she gave was so horrible and just killed the movie for me",Nerve
14,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"'Nerve' is an entertaining thriller with an interesting premise that is marred only by several plot-holes, some larger plot issues and the fact that it is pretty generic.",6,16 August 2016,"'Nerve (2016)' is a thriller directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, one which focuses upon a fictional yet plausible social media 'game' that involves an audience providing people with escalating dares in exchange for cash prizes. It is an interesting premise that feels suitably modern, as well as being incredibly timely as internet 'challenges' and games such as 'Pokémon GO' have increased in popularity - bringing many tales of injury, criminality and other misfortunes with them. The conceivable premise is easy to get invested in, as the film often evokes contemplation about ourselves and our society in general; it isn't all that deep, though, as the greater ideas are never fully explored. On top of that, the narrative itself is actually paper thin with a number of prevalent plot holes. The significance of some elements is never explained or fully examined, leading to a series of plot points that actually seem rather inconsequential.The movie starts off on a weak note, coming across as generic and generally false. The opening uses a number of gimmicks that feel invasive and unnecessary, which end up seeming stylised simply for the sake of creating the pretense of individuality. However, these aspects are eventually reeled back to the point where they actually help to tell the story as opposed to being obtrusive. Once it settles into its second act, the flick really comes into its own. This act features a sense of adventure, as well as a few moments of genuine tension. These moments are when the film is at its best, examining the dangerous and ill-advised nature of the dares themselves, but unfortunately they don't come often enough. For the most part, the 'Nerve' game is somewhat glamourised and a lot of the risk is glossed over. An extended sequence featuring a motorcycle isn't as tense as it should be, partly due to the lack of tangible danger or consequences and partly due to the sense of invigoration - rather than fear - felt by the main characters. There are a few moments towards the end of the picture that actually chastise the anonymous nature of the internet, particularly when it is used to bully or harm, which don't come across as too overbearing and, by that point in the narrative, feel earned. The final act is pretty fragile in comparison the the one before it, easily breaking under scrutiny and coming across as quite contrived. The movie as a whole is devoid of surprises, meanders a little in places and has several fundamental issues which damage its credibility. The central mystery is set up as if it is going to have a big pay-off, but it actually falls rather flat and doesn't warrant the suspense given to it. It could've been dropped entirely, along with some other subplots that don't really add anything. The plot holes and missteps, as well as the failures of the base premise itself, aren't all that noticeable in the moment, though. It's only upon reflection that they become obvious. Despite all of its problems, I do enjoy the picture and find honest entertainment in some of its set-pieces.The characters themselves are decently realised, coming across as somewhat rounded and given just the right amount of characterisation. There is little development but all of it enhances the connection between the audience and the on-screen actors. The two leads are given the most time and are therefore the most complex and relatable; Emma Roberts and Dave Franco do a great job leading the picture. They have good chemistry, even though Franco is in his thirties and Roberts is supposedly in high school. Their interactions feel genuine at times, and they don't simply slot into a preset archetype - at least not always. There is some artifice used to make the characters seem real, though, as well as some revelations that don't come across as well as they should. The other roles are all fairly minor, though the protagonist's best friend is more complex than she is initially presented as being. The cast do a good job of making each on-screen presence feel relevant and honest; they easily demonstrate the qualities of an admittedly stereotyped demographic. The writing is good here, with a screenplay by Jessica Sharzer - based on the novel by Jeanne Ryan - that manages to capture a modern premise and plot elements whilst still retaining a focus on character. There are no overtly cheesy lines and no obvious oddities or clearly 'written' snippets of dialogue, though initially there is a lot of exposition and most of what's said isn't particularly new. It's a script in which nothing really stands out, for better or worse.In terms of the technical stuff, the majority of it is to a high standard. The cinematography is clean, if a little bland, and the editing is satisfyingly unnoticeable - as it should be. The direction itself is evidently favourable, with little 'shaky-cam' and clean framing. Nothing is especially different or quirky, but the shots are easy to read and the flick as a whole does a good job of bringing you into its story. The set-pieces are well filmed and tightly edited, making use of practical stunt-work and wide angles to make them believable. The film, in general, has a tight pace, meaning that there is no time for boredom and no fat that could be trimmed. It tells its story in as little time as it needs, but this does mean that its ending is quite abrupt.Overall, 'Nerve (2016)' is a tightly paced thriller that's competently made and well acted. It's enjoyable to watch and has a few moments of genuine tension, even if it has several plot holes and nonsensical aspects. It's disposable fun despite its issues, even though it is ultimately a little unmemorable and generic: 6/10.",Nerve
15,dromasca,deadly games,5,9 April 2021,"In 2016, when they made 'Nerve', Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman already had in their joint filmography the series 3 and 4 of the horror cycle 'Paranormal Activity' as well as 'Catfish', a successful documentary that deals with romantic relationships online and their dangers. 'Nerve' is a combination of these two genres and more, adding elements of teenage romance and cruel 'truth or dare' reality games like. It is the style of movies that can be watched simply for relaxation, especially by fans of one of these genres, or that can also be viewed as a warning about the capture of public and private space by social networks that turn the Internet from a medium of communication in an alternative space that monopolizes and controls the whole life. This hybrid combination works at times unexpectedly well in 'Nerve'.The film begins as a story about college students searching for a path in life and especially for themselves. They are all connected to the magical space of the Internet, both for entertainment and because a large part of their social life takes place there. The main heroine - a girl named Vee - connects - in response to a friend's challenge - to a network game called Nerve which divides the world into 'players' and 'watchers'. 'Players' accept challenges, 'Watchers' follow them everywhere, bet on them and reward those who fulfill their missions, which become more and more dangerous. Within hours, the game absorbs Vee, who not only crosses the virtual border between 'watchers' and 'players' but also the physical boundary - whose crossing is forbidden by her mother's family discipline - between the suburbs of Staten Island and Manhattan, being absorbed by the game and by the great metropolis that become areas of danger as stakes and rewards in the game increase.Like many other genre films, 'Nerve' skillfully uses visual elements borrowed from digital game graphics, giving viewers the immersive feeling that they are watching such a game. Emma Roberts who plays the role of Vee and Dave Franco, in the role of partner, adversary, and inevitably, of her romantic interest, are both well cast and play their roles with charm and personality. The story is quite interesting for a good part of the film, except maybe for the final part which surprises precisely by the lack of the inventiveness that characterised the rest of the film. How should we relate to movies like 'Nerve'? Should we take them seriously or treat them as pure entertainment movies that only use the format? It ultimately depends on each of the spectators. 12 years after 'Catfish' and 5 years after 'Nerve' were made it can be said that the presence of social networks in our lives has only increased, the use and benefits they bring have become more visible, but the dangers also have become more obvious. After all, on the Internet and social media, as well as in the conventions of this kind of movies, the answers depend on us. 'Watchers' or 'Players'?",Nerve

This film does a good job of making you care about the characters, even if the rules of the game are muddled and the ending feels a bit forced.

What starts out as a way to come out of her shell for an hour or two soon begins to spiral out of control when the law, friendships and lives are all put to the test in a game where there is only one way out. First thing I need to say is that this is defiantly a movie made for teenagers. That being said I actually liked this a lot more than I expected to, and not for the reason the teenagers will. As hard as it is to believe this movie has one of the best messages for teenagers I have ever seen. In a world of anonymous commenting where there are ""no consequences"" this movie really puts that in the forefront and shows that everything you do and say has an effect on someone else. If nothing else, this movie should be watched for that reason. I wouldn't say that this is a family movie at all but this is one your teenager should watch, and hopefully understand the meaning of it, and not just watch it as a fun do this and get money movie.

19,Reno-Rangan,Are you a player or a watcher?,7,24 October 2016,"I watched this film for Emma Roberts. She's in her mid 20s, but played a teen girl, because she looks like one. The trailer roughly tells everything about it, so watching the film is like for the details of what you already know. And this is not the first film to use the game/challenge concept, I have seen many, but this one was updated to the current trend like internet and social media. So you can compare it to 'Eagle Eye', 'See You in YouTube' or even 'The Game', but 'Nerve' is a very entertaining film, especially if you are a young person or an internet addict. Because, you know, the people can do anything to get the online attention, more views and likes for their pictures and videos. That's how the todays generation is made up of.This is a story that takes place in just one day, but most of it is in the night time. Focused on a geek girl whose best friend is the opposite of her. And one day after the humiliation in front of a schoolmate who she adores more, decides to sign up an online forum that gives the daring tasks to complete within a time limit to earn dollars. But all the tasks have to be done in the real world. Then begins the best and worst night of her life where she meets a stranger and attempts to accomplish her given mission. How she manages them and other struggles were revealed till the finale where a small twist comes into play.There's no drugs or intense violence, but the theme was very strong like against the morality of society. There's a butt-flash too, but nothing too much harmful. Overall, this film suits better for the youngsters, but except young kids, it is okay for everyone. It's a crazy pace, the 90 minutes goes like a jet. I don't know how to describe the performance in here, though everybody was great, particularly Emma Roberts and the new look Dave Franco. What's the most shocking is this was based on a novel of the same name. I never read any novel in my life, but the question is does a book like this exist? Anyway, one time watch film, particularly for the time pass.6.5/10",Nerve
20,eddie_baggins,Good dumb fun and a potential franchise starter,6,28 March 2017,"Returning to the technology based groundwork that served them so well with the 2010 documentary (or is it?) Catfish, filmmakers Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman this time turn their focus onto the world of online voyeurism and communities with the way better than it should be Nerve, a fun, fast and colourful experience that loses its way in the home stretch but offers a great time leading up to it.Conjuring up an online game that feels like it could quite possibly exist in today's modern climate of online trends, social media and wannabe superstars, Joost and Schulman imbed Nerve with a strange form of reality that both says something about the climate of our tech savvy and obsessed life, whilst offering up a fun form of adventure to the dark side of the world wide web as Emma Robert's Venus and Dave ""charisma free"" Franco's Ian team up to compete in an online version of truth or dare (without the truth), fuelled by watchers and donators that lead the duo on an increasingly dangerous journey.The set-up of this idea as Vee and Ian meet and take off on a night of dares is far-fetched in many regards but undoubtedly fun and Roberts and Franco make for a good double team as Joost and Schulman instil Nerve with an eye-catching colour palette, while the hip soundtrack fits the style of the film perfectly making the production a polished and inviting one that for a large portion of the films brief runtime offers up great entertainment, until the film losses its nerve on the back of increasingly outlandish and over the top scenarios.From blindfolded bikes rides, questionable character decisions, right through to a thoroughly misjudged finale that feels like it belongs to another film altogether, Nerve sadly can't maintain its initial drawing power which is a shame as the whole universe here feels well built up but unsure of its end game, even if this premise feels as though it could quite easily become some form of Saw like franchise for tech driven thrills and spills.A pleasant and frenetic cinematic diversion, Nerve may not reach the heights it sometimes threatens to get to but this unique and often thrilling premise makes for one of last year's best teen targeted pieces of eye-candy and a potentially franchise starting event that could well be one of the better new properties to emerge in recent years.3 mooning's out of 5",Nerve
21,damianphelps,This Challenges the Ethics of Us the Audience,7,30 January 2021,"My memory of it is vague and I feel it was around 2000. A film was made that included a scene where 3 college kids (I think) did a dare to lie down along the white line of a road as traffic went past. This scene was replicated in real life and some kids died. Again my memory is hazy but I seem to recall the movie makers removed the scene after this event (it may have been put back in later).So...should a movie like Nerve exist???I honestly don't know. I am no longer a stupid teen lol so its harder for me to judge its impact on that age group but when you look at the dumb things people do for a selfie???The movie itself, I actually really enjoyed it. The cast were great and although it did/does have its level of predictability, the story was interesting and fun to watch.My general view (for anyone who cares lol) is that movies are movies first and foremost and the audience has to take responsibility. However its an interesting thing to consider :)",Nerve

It actually does a good job in displaying the kids of this generation, and it reflects what this generation likes and what its about.Nerve is a game played on the internet. The people who play are dared to do all sorts of crazy things for cash, and there is no limit to the craziness. Vee, played by Emma Roberts, is a kid who needs to come out of her shell, plays the game and becomes way too engulf in it.Dave Franco is in the game too as Ian. First thing you noticed is that he's trying to be as hot as his older brother, James. thought he gives us a lot of sex appeal, big bro still has more personality.The game starts out really talking to the young crowd about what they are into. Just playing the game over social media and how everyone participates, with no one controlling the game and everyone able to put in their two cents towards the game.Although, it does get to the place were it goes to big and gets less and less real to me, and overall, it's about sending a metaphoric message to the kids about living your life on the web, and how it can desensitize you.The vibe and the tone of the movie is great. love the electric music score and the art direction. The movie really does feel cool without going too overboard with it, very subtle.I got a feeling that the movie is going to have a cult classic vibe, like Fight Club or something.Check it out.http://cinemagardens.com/?p=83",Nerve
23,jtindahouse,"Could've been worse, should've been better",6,7 November 2016,"'Nerve' reminded me a lot of the book 'In the Dark' by Richard Laymon. I remember reading that and thinking that with a few tweaks this could make for an excellent film. 'Nerve' has some noticeable differences, but at the crux of it it's the same. Doing increasingly daring things for the motivation of cash. I think a problem I had with it was that they weren't creative enough with a lot of the dares. Hanging from a high structure and walking across a ladder - how lazy were these screenwriters? Then, I think the fact that it was rated PG-13 held it back a lot. This film could've done a lot with an R rating. Even as it stands it's a pretty dark film. Take it up a notch with some of the dares and you could have had something very special.Dave Franco is a very hit and miss actor for me. Some roles he absolutely nails (often in comedies like '21 Jump Street' and 'Bad Neighbors') and others, like this, he just doesn't seem comfortable in. He's not so bad that it distracts, but he lacked the charisma that I know he is capable of achieving, and thus I found I never really cared for his character. Emma Roberts is not a natural actress. She's from a family of actors, and I suspect that's the reason she gets a lot of roles, because she is bad enough to distract at times in films. This was no exception. Again, I never cared for her character, partly because of the writing (she makes one of the quickest 180 degree turns in personality you will ever see), but also because Roberts was just not able to sell it for me.So far this feels like a very negative review, but the truth is I didn't actually mind the film too much. The premise was very entertaining (putting aside plot holes, which I try as hard as I can to do) and the overall product is an aesthetically pleasing one. Shot on location in the beautiful city of New York is always going to help with that. With a few tweaks in casting and writing this could have been one of the best films of the year. Sadly, it will remain in the middle of the pack.",Nerve
24,stevendbeard,Aimed At Teens,7,31 July 2016,"I saw ""Nerve"", starring Emma Roberts-Scream Queens_tv, Hotel For Dogs; Dave Franco-The Now You See Me movies, Milk; Emily Meade-Money Monster, That Awkward Moment; Richard Colson Baker-Aka Machine Gun Kelly, a YouTube rapper, Roadies_tv, Beyond the Lights and Juliette Lewis- August:Osage County, Natural Born Killers.This is a movie that hits theaters just as the Pokeman/Go craze is big. I'm sure it is just a coincidence. The movie is about an internet game that is played by teenagers using their cell phones. The game is called Nerve, meaning, do you have the nerve to play it? It's like truth or dare, without the truth part. You can either play or watch, and you have to pay to watch but you get paid, if you play and succeed, within a certain length of time. They even use drones on occasion to keep track of a player. Emma and Emily are high school friends, with Emily a regular player of Nerve. Emma is more shy and is eventually goaded into playing by Emily. Dave is another player that teams up with Emma after Emma really gets into playing the game-I'm sure the money helps her motivation. They will start a dare at $100 and later, get up into the 10's of thousands of dollars so it can be very tempting. Richard plays a competitive player that has won in earlier games and wants to continue winning-I'm sure it's the fame part that motivates him. They keep track of how many viewers a player has, too. Juliette plays Emma's mother. The movie appears to be aimed at teenagers; always short on cash & common sense and would love nothing better than to get fast cash for doing reckless stunts. Now, a player can quit a dare-if they think it is to risky-but if they do, they lose all earned money they have accumulated. They would also lose their money if they squealed to anyone, such as a cop. It's rated ""PG-13"" for dangerous & risky behavior, language, drug & alcohol content and sexual content-including partial nudity-all of which involves teens and has a running time of 1 hour & 36 minutes. It was enjoyable enough that I would probably buy it on DVD.",Nerve

26,alindsay-al,A below average great idea that ultimately fails,4,11 April 2017,"I had heard lots of buzz about this film and I have now see it and I feel like on paper this would be a great idea but the film ends up being a big disappointment. The premise of the film sees a high school student come across an online game of truth or dare, without the truth. Emma Roberts plays V and she does an alright job in this film, she gives her best to the role it is just her character isn't that interesting. I found myself not really caring about her character that much which is disappointing. Dave Franco plays another player of this game and he does a good job in the role, he isn't as funny in this role as much as he has in other roles. He sold his daredevil persona well and I bought his character for this film. Unfortunately, all the other characters in this film are bland and just very cliché that you just won't care about them or the situations they are put in. The story of the film has some interesting dares in it as you see these two people work there way through the challenges, I can't deny that it is fast paced and interesting to watch. However, I didn't buy the relationship between Roberts and Franco and I felt like it was pretty forced and unconvincing. Also the third act takes a big change from the rest of the film and it is just not interesting really at all which really hurts the film. The script doesn't have any really cheesy or bad dialogue it is just so forgettable that I don't really remember one bit from the film's script. The style of the film has some too stunts and dares, buy I don't feel like it goes extreme enough for it to be realistic which is a shame for this film, maybe it could have done with a higher age rating. Overall I didn't care for nerve and I don't really think it is worth seeing at all.",Nerve

It features Emma Roberts as Vee, a high school girl applying to college who signs up for an online reality game called Nerve-""truth or dare without the truth."" Things start off with simple dares, but of course spiral out of control and she winds up WAY over her head. The action gradually picks up steam and you will soon find yourself on the edge off your seat towards the end. I loved the scenes in the department store and on the motorcycle.

As a result much of the characters' motivation or evolution remains obscure. The movie isn't performing miracles in the originality department, either.""Nerve"" is also riddled with plot holes and loose ends. An exemple : the movie is about a young girl who gets sucked into an ever more dangerous game. At one point, a number of computer nerds (you know they're computer nerds because) promise her to find out who's behind the game. And indeed, they succeed in finding out the real-life identity of many of the spectators. A total success ! A resounding victory ! Sadly, the computer nerds have failed to identify the persons who provide the locations, the logistics, the technical know-how and the general framework, but : a total success.Still, the movie deserves credit for the pertinence of its warnings about peer pressure, mob mentality and fashionable follies. If it can keep even a single enterprising idiot (young or old) from jumping off a windmill while playing the bagpipes, it will have justified its existence a hundred times over.",Nerve
30,TdSmth5,Dull,3,16 January 2017,"A nice girl, Vee, succumbs to peer pressure and starts playing an online/social media game of dare called ""Nerve."" The game swallows up all the person's social media info. A person can lose by bailing or failing. And ""snitches get stitches."" A player who succeeds in a dare gets money deposited in a bank. The dare has to be filmed with the person's cellphone and is thus put live in the net for viewers to see. The player goes up in rank depending on how many viewers he has. At the end of the day two players face each other and the winner takes all.Vee's first dare is to kiss a stranger in a diner. Then the stranger starts dancing and singing to Vee. That was his dare. Then the game teams them up for dares, separates them, teams them back up. They have to go to a fancy department store, put on fancy clothes, speed on the motorcycle, get tattoos.Vee's best guy friend doesn't like all this especially because Vee and the other guy are getting closer now. So he does some research and finds out stuff about the guy. Meanwhile, Vee's success puts a strain on her friendships.About an hour into the movie finally the stakes are raised. Another contender for #1 is a pretty wild guy willing to do anything. And when things become life-endangering, Vee's friends, who conveniently happen to be hackers, and her mom intervene.Granted that I'm not the intended audience for this movie, I found it to be pretty dull, even for young adults. There's not much at stake for most of the movie. It just uses occasional POV camera-work to attempt to inject thrills, but it doesn't succeed. The cast mainly stands out for its big teeth but not much else. Not even relationship are made meaningful enough. Like back in the 90s, this movie seems more interested in trying to sell kids some music. I'll give it some points for being fairly good-natured and not too perverse and also for it's main point which I take it to be a warning about the dangers of peer pressure combined with social media.",Nerve

Before I start to criticise this film too much it's true to say that I'm not the kind of person this is aimed at. What I mean is i'm probably 25 years too old to really enjoy something like this. It's incredibly dumb. The story is so far fetched and unrealistic that you just don't buy into what you are watching. It seams to be set in a neon lit world where everyone is 20 years old and where no internet connection is lost , nothing buffers and camera phones are conveniently aimed on every scene but the biggest problem with this is that it's not gritty enough. I wanted see a game like Jigsaw would play in the Saw film but instead we see a tepid watered down version and that just bored me. Unless you 18 years old give this a miss.

33,rgkarim,Do You Have The Nerve?,8,27 July 2016,"The Internet, it was a revolutionary idea that was designed to connect people and share information to expand our knowledge. And then comes the modern era, where information is second nature in response to entertainment, trolling, and occasionally a uniting purpose. In fact, most of us know how the most popular thing on the internet (past pornography) are vines, memes, and other ranting media. Tonight's film decides to highlight current Internet trends and makes a story that looks dangerous, thrilling, and fun at the same time. My review is on Nerve starring Emma Roberts and Dave Franco. Let's get startedThe GOOD  Fun Adventure  Great Acting  Decent Story When I saw the trailer, I though the movie was going to be more of a serious thriller. Thankfully, I'm very pleased to report Nerve is a very fun movie filled with excitement, energy, and adventure. Our two heroes start their night out performing tasks and stunts that we only dream of performing (for the most part). The dares from the anonymous Watchers are diverse, but mostly remain grounded in the realistic zone. While certainly stupid, and often quite dangerous, our actors looked liked they were enjoying themselves as they became lost in the moment. As a result, I couldn't help but get reeled into the moments with them and enjoyed the fun atmosphere it painted. But then like any good movie, the tone switches and soon the fun evening out develops into something much tenser. Multiple tiers begin to form as the mystery unfolds as to what our couple has fallen into. The story takes multiple turns that leads to some decent character development that fits in well with the overall plot. As more secrets are uncovered, the intensity only builds up until it hits a cheesy, overdramatic fight that is both eye rolling and well done at the same time. Nevertheless, the tale takes a few good twists and plays out in a very morale heavy ending. Pay attention and you can see most of the twists coming. Pay really good attention and the audience may learn something that might save the Internet. Again the story is fun, but the twists help save it from becoming another teenage dramedy filled with thrills, chills, and laughs on the way. And to play out this story is none other than two talented actors who truly brought what looked to be simple characters to life. Emma Roberts portrayal of Venus (yeah interesting name) was fantastic, developing over the course of the film alongside her character. She brought both beauty and emotion to the role and was certainly a fantastic protagonist to follow on this ninety minute journey. Dave Franco as ""Ian"" was a wonderful counter character who had poise, pizazz, and a sense of suave that was very welcoming. It's amazing what you can see actors do when they don't act like idiots (aka Neighbors). Franco's dynamic acting helped keep his character fun, but also stays in the dark, brooding side that reels you in. The supporting cast was wonderful too, but we need to move onto the limiting factors of this movie. The BAD  Not as suspenseful/thrilling as portrayed  A few character building moments are rushed  A plot point that was kind of worthlessYes I had fun, and the plot did grow darker, but the suspense was much more dilute than the trailers promised. The Watchers certainly were powerful (we are talking well versed in the art of hacking), but their power wasn't used to its full potential. This mass media entertainment was a bit underwhelming though, whose bark was worse than their bite. I was expecting such expert computer users to lob more threats at the duo, or perhaps pursue them in some Purge like manner. Instead, they chose to use phones as their weapons and film everything that was happening. Sure the phone angle provided some interesting shots and allowed for integration of famous accidents. In addition, there were some character development moments that also were a bit underdone. Ian himself has a traumatic past, and you would think facing his fears would have a bit more I don't know struggle to it. Instead, his challenges were a bit blown over, washed away in a fast pace that could have been more. Fortunately Venus's drama has more gusto behind it and her obstacles require more bravado to overcome. Unfortunately, she has some plot points that were practically worthless despite the setup at the beginning of the movie. There were few explanations to some of the family dynamics, the struggle for choosing a school wasn't as big an issue, and her introverted nature disappeared rather quickly. Oh well, at least we got plenty of fun thrills and a good morale lesson right?The VERDICTDespite the shortcoming, Nerve is definitely one of the more fun and thrilling adventures I have seen in a long time. The dynamic duo of Roberts and Franco are the shining factor for this reviewer, who really brought the energetic fun vibe to the screen. In addition the multiple levels of the plot also made for some engaging moments, and some rather suspenseful moments. Sure there are some missing/blown over moments, but for the most part this adventure gets a seal of approval for unique fun. Worth a trip to theater? I'm going to have to say yes it is. My scores: Adventure/Crime/Mystery: 8.5 Movie Overall: 8.0",Nerve
34,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Nerve,7,3 November 2016,"The brother of famed actor James Franco. The niece of Oscar winner Julia Roberts. Together they make an adorable screen duo in 2016's Nerve (my latest review).Nerve has cinematography in the form of bright colors. It has extras in it with helmets and bandanas to hide their faces. It has a catchy techno soundtrack, and finally, it has a high-flown concept of social media. Truthfully, this movie feels like it's ahead of its time. And based on its lukewarm box office reception, it also feels like a movie that we as an audience, aren't ready for yet. At just over an hour and a half, Nerve is feverishly directed by two people (Henry Joost, Ariel Schulman). Watching it, I would've thought it was made to order by members of electric mongered, Daft Punk.Now for reasons unknown, Nerve is dystopian without being set in the near future. Fast-paced, entertaining, and full of life, it still leaves you a bit frustrated. As I viewed it, I wanted to call for an all-out banning of smartphone, Skype, and Facebook applications. Yeah this film may be bona fide and happily neon. However, it gives off the whiff of America being in a sad state of affairs (primarily with twentysomethings). Young people these days have some sort of technological device with them at all times. Lets hope it's never used in the way it's remorselessly portrayed here.Anyway, Nerve's opening scene projects itself like the beginning of 2014's Unfriended. Not that Unfriended is a bad movie but you feel relieved when Nerve veers away from just being a mouse clicking, email- minded endeavor.The story is as follows: High school senior Venus ""Vee"" Delmonico (played Emma Roberts), leads a ho-hum life with her protective mother in Staten Island, NY. She's reluctant to attend college in California in fear that she'll be away from said mom and some close friends. Not much of a risk taker and on a whim, ""Vee"" decides to partake in a truth or dare video game called Nerve. She can participate either as a ""watcher"" or a ""player"". She chooses ""player"" and gets thrown into a world where other ""watchers"" give her challenges to accept for feasible amounts of money. Everything has to be captured on video for her to receive anonymous payments to her bank account. Examples would be trying on a $3500 dress, kissing a stranger for five seconds, hanging from a skyscraper scaffold with one arm, and walking across two high-rise buildings by way of a ladder. Venus eventually teams up with another ""player"" in Ian (played by Dave Franco). The two of them form a whimsical bond. I won't give anything away only to let you know that Nerve the game, sooner or later gets out of hand. Look out for a mild twist that occurs in Nerve's ending (ha-ha). Also, look for a pivotal motorcycle riding sequence (with a blindfolded protagonist at the wheel) and a quasi-romantic subplot courtesy of Roberts and Franco. In jest, out of the fifty or so movies I've seen this year, I would definitely rank Nerve in the top fifteen.All in all, Nerve nearly has that trait of being a new classic. As its running time flies by, you almost sense that it lives in a sort of fantasy world as opposed to being rooted in forgone reality. Nerve's only hiccups for me, are its sometimes choppy editing, its tendency to portray its characters as annoying tech-heads, and its thankless use of Juliette Lewis as the dorky mother to Emma's ""Vee"". Bottom line: I liked Nerve to the point where I'm gonna have to recommend it. It's unlike anything I've ever seen movie-wise and that gets points from me. With its look similar to 1995's Strange Days and its representation of New York City as an icy, unsupervised underworld, Nerve does have verve. Rating: 3 stars.",Nerve
35,Kingslaay,A novel film about the digital age we live in,8,30 May 2017,"I was pleasantly surprised by Nerve as I was not expecting much. This film definitely exceeded expectations. It introduced a novel concept of a digital game that while fun at first becomes seriously dangerous. What is interesting about this film is it is somewhat plausible this kind of thing could exist. Technology is advancing at a great rate and we are increasingly becoming obsessed with electronic devices. People spend a great deal of time online and devote a lot of it creating profiles. Nerve certainly should strike a nerve or chord with younger generations to show the importance of humanity and people as it was humanity that prevailed in this film and shut the system down. It was interesting and managed to deliver a message. Good performances from James Franco and Emma Roberts who helped carry this film. Surprised with the rating, I was expecting a higher one.",Nerve
36,bkrauser-81-311064,I Saw the End,1,27 July 2016,"When I saw the climax of Nerve; a masked mass of sycophants dimly lit by the light of their phones, I saw what Siegfried Kracauer might have seen in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920); a denial of tradition mixed with ""...faith in man's power to shape society and nature."" I saw the prurient fecklessness of reality TV being weaponized, the desensitized and fragmented youth culture being co- opted and the fears of technology being fiendishly well justified. In other words, I saw the end.The film has a deceptively clever little setup; Vee (Roberts) a goody-goody living on Staten Island is coaxed into an online truth or dare game, only without the truth. Those involved are either Watchers or Players. The much larger Watcher community decides which dare/stunt the Player group is to accomplish and each accomplished dare wins you money. Those who ""bail"" or ""fail"" lose all their winnings and lose a chance at the finals. There's a third group which is strongly implied in the trailer but I won't spoil for the sake of those who actually want to watch this harbinger of the end of the republic. After all, snitches apparently get stitches.Objectively speaking this film is okay. The story from a structural point of view is serviceable and the characterizations are bullet- pointed but never fully fleshed out. There are some neat visuals made real by luscious primary colors then sabotaged by ugly staging and distracting ADHD inspired graphics. Directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman may have been channeling Nicolas Winding Refn or Rick Famuyiwa's work in Dope (2015) but they really only succeed in reaching the sophistication of Untraceable (2008) drenched in warm neon.Our leads Vee and kinda-sorta Nerve teammate Ian (Franco) don't really feel believable within the context of the film not to mention believable as teenagers. Vee especially takes far too long to suspect something is amiss. If she were truly as brainy as her friends Sydney (Meade) and Tommy (Heizer) thinks she is, she would have bailed right after Ian explains someone just showed up and handed him her favorite book guaranteeing she would meet him. Ian's backstory remains murky until near the end but upon closer scrutiny post-credits his ""too-cool-for-school"" act feels more like a story contrivance than honest characterization.What separates Nerve from other YA screen adaptations, and truly makes this film beyond loathsome is its rather cavalier and quite frankly disgusting attitude towards privacy, technology, social media, democratization and human nature. Nerve has an unabashedly negative view of humanity, taking great relish in exposing the dark side of living in an open forum world with open forum expression and open forum consumption. And yes there is something to be said about advancements like the internet, meant to share knowledge and culture, being used as a means to indulge our baser impulses. Yet by being both broad and ordinary, Nerve spits on the nobility of democracy while simultaneously dooming even the smartest among us to a future of celebrity chasing, easy money and permanent distraction. A future entirely based on up or down votes and culpability is but a word that grownups use.Not since Dirty Harry (1971) have I seen a film so morally backwards and utterly contemptible. While gushing at the excess of it's own high-concept, Nerve burrows into the viewers skull, smuggling in unscrupulous ideas made effective by the film's ordinariness. While watching Nerve I was reminded of Plato's ""The Republic""; specifically his passages on late-stage democracy. In it, Plato discusses the risks of a fractured polity, a society where ""too much freedom seems to change into nothing but too much slavery"" and thus becomes ripe for tyranny. I much rather believe as Thomas Jefferson once did that ""An educated citizenry is a vital requisite for our survival as a free people."" Nerve puts that idea into doubt forcing me to fall back on the tired refrain of it's just a movie.And it is just a movie; the walls of Jericho are not going to be tumbling down just because Emma Roberts made out with Dave Franco at a diner. Yet as a harbinger of what's to come let's hope this film is an out-layer and not the eventual rule.",Nerve

39,Screen_Blitz,"This techno thriller is nothing intelligent, but for what it's worth it is at least fun",7,12 February 2017,"This techno-based thriller directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman of the 2010 documentary 'Catfish' is not your average suspense vehicle with white-knuckle thrills and startling imagery. It introduces an original concept soaking with intriguing social commentary about digital technology and its effects on our society. And the central figure of this film's plot involves a smartphone app version of ""Truth-or-dare"". Taking elements from the popular app 'Pokemon Go', this app plays a vital role in a plot that the directors not only successfully provide with both suspense and witty humor, but also serves as an allusion of teenagers' ignorance with technology and social media in today's society. While Joost and Schulman's execution of this concept isn't exactly illogical nor do they show interest in character development and plot, the final result is a fun ride for teenagers and adults to snack on. So this film stars Emma Roberts as Vee, a high school senior who introduces to this phone app called 'Nerve', an location-based augmented reality game where users are given to choices to either enter as a ""watcher"" or a ""player"". A player is tasked a complete a dare on live broadcast such as ""kiss a random stranger"" or ""try on a dress at a store"", and the player must complete the dare in order to move on to the next round (and earn money). A watch is a user who suggests the dares online while spectating the players live. Under the pressure of her friend Sydney (played by Emily Meade), Vee partners with a cute guy name Ian (played by Dave Franco) in a series of increasingly dangerous dares. But the game soon places their lives in danger when the dares begin to border on the line of breaking the law.The concept alone is enough to grab the attention of high school-aged kids, or anyone engrossed the familiarity of the 'Pokemon Go' app. By some means, Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman manage to provide some good surprises here and there with a solid plethora of suspenseful thrills, clever humor, and a sweet dose of social commentary that feels brutally relevant today; that is if you can buy into the overwhelming absurdity of the plot. In an age when social media such as Youtube has become a major part of teenagers' lives, it is not uncommon for teenagers falling cyber pressure to take risks and engaging into dangerous activities that become vital trends on the internet (i.e Cinnamon Challenge). Under Joost's and Schulman's execution, the plot serves almost as an allegory to the influence of social media and the deadly consequences that ensue. And it is safe to this film does an okay job with this, though it could have been accomplished better. As the story goes on, our two lead characters (who are both energized likable performances by Emma Roberts and Dave Franco) engage in a series of foolish shenanigans that start off somewhat innocent, but the real suspense kicks in when they evaluate in more precarious stunts such as scaling tall structures or walking across ladder placed several stories above an alleyway. These scenes are heart-clenching enough and are fueled with sheer suspense and sweet cinematography to capture the neon-drenched environment of downtown New York. The final act however, is when the film makes a rather overblown turn and immediately throws logic out the window, although it is not like the film's concept packed much logic to begin with. In the end, the key to finding enjoyment in the story requires just a little more than not asking ""Why don't they just shut the app down?"" or ""Why would anyone make an app like this?"".Nerve is a suspenseful techno-based thriller that may not fuel your engage your brain but nonetheless generates a fair amount of fun and thrills for anyone filling to buy into the absurd premise. It is a fun treat for both teenagers and adults, but only the ones not seeking for a smart script with character development and intelligence. Otherwise, this one may be disappointing.",Nerve
40,blumdeluxe,Unfortunately not far from reality,7,14 August 2017,"""Nerve"" tells the story of an online game gone too far when a shy New York teenager engages in challenges that ultimately could lead to her murder. It reflects on the brutal acts that get committed in modern internet under the guarding of anonymity and for the sake of likes and viewers.I like the general plot of the movie and unfortunately I think that many aspects of the Internet, including the sadism many users show, are not too far from reality. I am not so keen on the love story because it is truly cheesy and I think it's only included to make the film more suitable for larger audiences. I can understand that some reviewers felt like they were dealing with a teen movie but I do think that there are very serious topics building the background for this rather implausible story.All in all this film has its good moments and raises some questions that are worth thinking about. In the attempt to make it a financial success though, a rather stupid love story and some very implausible challenges were included.",Nerve

42,saptesh786,Good movie on game!,7,19 April 2019,"This is a game based movie. Game is the name 'NERVE' in 2016. Well attempt by filmmaker to show us effects of the dare games on our life. Recent days we are playing PUBG following Blue Whale, Pokeman etc. Those all are from Nerve family. In real life we need hacker guys like Wes (Mark John) and Tommy ( Miles Heizer ) who can download such dangerous games and rewrite the code to modify them into good either or make them off. But real world is only commercial and there is no value of human life before commercial profit. Movie is inspired by Maze and Escape room.
Story is good and well developed. Started in a light mood and then goes into dangerous zone gradually. The climax is watchable and having some twits too. Acting done by Vee ( Emma Roberts) is fine. Others are just okay. As me there are good things in this movie that,
1. Good story
2. Interesting climax
3. Good message to youth and especially for online dare game players.
4. Good acting by leading Emma Roberts
5. Finally very enjoyable crazy credits at the end of movie.
You can watch this movie for entertainment and for a warning message.",Nerve
43,thekarmicnomad,A nice format change - loses it at the end,7,26 May 2020,"The lead character gets sucked into an on-line game of Truth or Dare but with huge cash rewards and no option of truth.This has been done before in several horror movies and rarely works that well.The main issue with this format is the escalation of the dares to create sufficiently horrific scenes.
So the dares go from
1 -kiss your class mate
2- flash you knickers on the bus
3 -murder your neighbours with an axe.As this film is more of a thriller than a horror it doesn't have to go all out on the dares and it makes a big difference in a positive way.
Instead time is well spent building the characters.
This means when someone is going to be expelled or arrested you actually care, because you understand what this means to the character.The acting and production is all good (considering the budget) and there are moments of genuine tensions.I really enjoyed this for a Netflix movie.For the most the film is kind of realistic until the end.
Then things get a bit fluffy.
It feels like the writers set out to make a good honest thriller but felt pressured to tack on some commentary about social media.
The story does this all on its own quite adequately so when the cringey speech about cyber-bullying comes along it feels far too on-the-nose.
The technology element gets a bit out of hand too.",Nerve

45,RforFilm,"Though the game and idea doesn't progress far, Nerve is still a fun teen cyber thriller",7,1 August 2016,"Did you know that were only using ten percent of what's on the World Wide Web? You may think that sites like YouTube, Wikipedia, and even most of the social media platforms have already made the internet huge, but it turns out that we know next to nothing. There is a section of the web called the dark web that is home to the other ninety percent. This area supposedly contains illegal pornography, weapon shops, salve shops, and pretty much everything that were not allowed to see in real life. It's said that the only ones that see this are highly experience hackers, top tier government officials, or radical groups that can crack those complicated firewalls.There have been some instances where the dark web has crept over to the side of humanity, but given how well guarded the regular pages already are, it's incredibly rare and they never last long. What makes it hard to go over anything on the dark web is that the people who created these things have covered their tracks so well, that the FBI and homeland security can barley locate their perpetrator let alone who they are. The game in Nerve comes from a dark source, but has been making it's way around teenagers.Around the Statin Island area of New York, high school yearbook photographer Venus Delmonico (played by Emma Roberts) is in the mist of finishing her last few months and is ready to accept an admission to Cal Arts, but is afraid to tell her mother (played by Juliette Lewis) who is still grieving over the death of her son. Her friend Sydney (played by Emily Meade) is a big player of the online game Nerve, which is a dangerous ""Truth or Dare"" challenge where watchers pay to watch and players play to earn money.After a humiliating rejection from a guy she likes, Venus signs into Nerve as a player, where it collects everything about her (bank statements, I.D., social media pages, etc.). After her first challenge to kiss a stranger for five seconds, she starts to team up with that kisser Ian (played by Dave Franco) for bigger money. As the cash becomes bigger and her following grows, the game starts to tread into illegal territory, causing Venus to want out. When she tries to alert the authorities (which was one rule not to do), she finds that the game has more control over her life then she realized. Now she has to continue playing while her friends try to get the game shut down.I've made complaints before that movies set now rarely know how to use modern technology in a way that will hold up later. Nerve understands that teens are obsessed with the web and often get lost in they're own pleasure against the common moral of right and wrong. Nerve manages to carry an interesting premise, even if it's afraid to go further with what could have made it more psychological. It at least makes a lot of the dares interesting.Both Emma Roberts and Dave Franco have good chemistry and are fun to watch. The writing for them seems to work with the personalities of the actors rather then their characters. That kind of screen writing is old fashioned, ironically in a movie that's supposed to be ""hip"" and ""with it"". I'm okay with it here as they are still interesting to follow as the game gets more dangerous. One major issue I had involves the ending which I wont spoil, but it will make you feel unfulfilled. A lot of that comes from that we don't get much behind the game and who made it. Perhaps a television spin off would explain everything.I'll give this seven game over screens out of five. Though you know this movie could have done a lot more with it's idea, it still manages to entertain and even have some smart ideas. Nerve probably won't gain any major players, but should have no problem finding watchers. So are you a player or a watcher?",Nerve
46,cultfilmfan,Nerve,8,6 August 2016,"The new film, Nerve could not have come out at a better time in my opinion. The film overall is a social and cautionary tale about the dangers and risks that we take everyday using technology and social media. Take the new Pokemon Go game as a perfect example. I remember when the original Pokemon games came out back in the mid to late 90's and I remember playing them on my Nintendo Gameboy, which like many other technical products from back in the day as since been discontinued. The game was enjoyable back then and all the other kids at school were playing it, but it was nothing like what is currently going on with the hand-held devices people are playing Pokemon Go on and also the game itself. I have heard of professional people who have quit their jobs and given up their careers just so they can play this game. One person was so immersed in the game on their mobile tablet that they did not bother to watch where they were going and ended up walking off of a cliff. Also people around the world are showing up at stranger's houses just so they can catch the much desired Pokemon characters and be the winner of this game that will bring you no real fame, or fortune, but instead just bragging rights that will soon fade away as soon as the next technological craze, or game comes along. Also look at how voyeuristic our culture and society has become. I hear of people going to websites to watch real acts of violence, torture, terrorism and other hideous things for the simple reason that they were curious and these horrific videos and images have not been taken off of the web because of so called ""free speech"" and ""freedom of expression"". There is certainly a limit to everything and our current culture has certainly exceeded it. Now when I write these things, I am not against people themselves enjoying a video game here, or there (although I think there are a lot better things you could be doing with your time), or saying that I am against all technology and social media at all (even though I choose not to really use any of it myself). I think that people should just be aware of what they are doing and know the dangers of it. Even the other night it was broadcast on the news that people who post pictures of themselves on social media are actually creating more danger for themselves than they think because cyber and other criminals can and are using other software and websites that can now track where your photos were taken and trace you to where you live, work and otherwise which is now a cause of crimes including breaking and entering and robbery. Again this is not to say that people can not communicate with their friends online, but people should just be very careful with what they are doing. The new film, Nerve shows us these cautions as the characters in the movie are engrossed in a mobile device game of more, or less Truth or Dare. Characters are dared to do embarrassing, risky and sometimes death defying things, all watched by people from around the world in order to make a name for themselves and make some extra cash. Everything seems to be fine at first and to many of the characters it seems like an adrenaline rush that they constantly want more of, but as the film goes on, they soon start to see the dangers in this and how it could consume them, or possibly threaten to end their lives. Nerve was a film that was a lot better than it had any right to be and I mean that completely sincerely. The film will win no awards come Oscar season, but in it's own way it has a lot of merit for it's unique visual style of a very neon lit downtown New York and some of this cinematography and visuals was certainly pleasing to the eye and looked incredible at times. The film's story itself was captivating enough and had plenty to keep me both thrilled and on the edge of my seat at times. The character development was thin and the acting was average, but a film of this kind doesn't need any more than that and it was fine just the way it was. Also it delivers home a thought provoking message and one that our generation is badly in need of discovering and that is also one of the film's strongest points and I thank the filmmakers for pointing it out and also entertaining me while doing so. A better than average film of it's kind that is certainly food for thought and an entertaining watch all the same.",Nerve

48,jrarichards,"Slick and clever, but with a ""your 90 minutes are up"" ending",7,24 November 2017,"A Jeanne Ryan novel is made into a film here by Directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman. All is oriented towards the young, whose actual or potential world the piece invokes, but - first dilemma - also in some way encourages.However, dare games have been played - with all the attendant possible consequences - forever, so what is new about their being brought online is the facelessness, the attendant removal of face-to-face accountability, the possibility of transfers of real money from a huge range of sources becoming involved, and of course the very large numbers of potential participants.However, an element of self-regulation exists here, given that most watchers can only stump up 100 dollars or so, ensuring that the level of seriousness of the dares they propose remains lowish and hence fun-ish (obviously few if any would take a serious risk for such a sum, choosing instead to back out).Furthermore, in the concrete example portrayed here, the dares at the first level bring a cute-if/because-shy Vee (for Venus!) played by Emma Roberts into contact with Ian (Dave Franco), and there's a chemistry there that the darers may egg on, but certainly do not create or fully rule.Hence, at this level, though certainly worthy of the odd ""tut, tut"" (especially from older viewers), the game has its more-endearing side, and is presented in a slick, lightish, fun and at times funny way. All is of course fast-paced, has a hint of darkness, and enjoys somewhat-edgy though often also spectacular New York settings. However, we are left in no doubt that even co-participants in the realisation of dares (such as tattoo artists) are basically decent folk who keep the whole enterprise within some limits, even if parents of the kids are very effectively excluded almost from the outset.A peak of achievement is perhaps reached as the ongoing dares begin to wreck friendships, and also start to pose genuine risks to life and limb; but the much-anticipated escalation beyond even that falls flat - presumably because the makers recognise that they might be leading a fashion as well as reflecting one, and so hold back. The very ending looks distinctly tame and anti-climactic for that reason, even though it hints at the possibility of whooped-up addicts of such a game being prepared to lose the plot entirely. Of course, were they to do so, they would scarcely be worse than those flocking to Roman arenas several thousand years ago (in the times of Emperor Titus, 8000 animals were killed for public ""entertainment"" in just two days of Coliseum ""Games"" - though it is true that Emperors were occasionally disparaged by audiences if cruelty went beyond certain limits).Anyway. a sicker imagination than is on show in ""Nerve"" would see psychopaths from more-adult circles of weirdos hijack the game, offering really large payments for more-humiliating or sicker dares, but we never get to see this. Ironically also, given the precedent set in ""Indecent Proposal"" back in 1993 (!), all of those thousands of watchers are too clean-minded to suggest that Vee and Ian engage in a bit of ... you know what ... online for a larger sum of money. Given that this is not an especially risky dare, but an extremely obvious one that would indicate a desire to assume greater levels of control from ""the dark side"" among watchers, it is clear that this film ultimately lacks the courage of its convictions.This also means a inevitable blunting of the message also worked on in films like ""The Circle"" - that we are creating a kind of new species called Homo smartphonus (a term that has already been coined online, BTW) whose interconnected society and civilisation has all kinds of potential dangers and weirdnesses that are unpredicted as yet, least of all by its primary participants. Ironically, it is those on the sidelines of it, we dinosaurs, who can see the big picture better - and the film we would make would be stronger and darker than ""Nerve"".Still the film has its charms, though most of these are on display best in its first half.",Nerve

50,bob-the-movie-man,"At last, a summer film with some originality",8,10 August 2016,"With great internet power comes great irresponsibility. This is the premise behind ""Nerve"", a film whose producers must have wet themselves with excitement that the Pokemon Go craze aligned so nicely with the release of their film. I was delighted that at last this summer there is a film with a modicum of originality I can enthuse about. 'Vee', short for Venus (Emma Roberts, niece of Julia Roberts) is an NYC teen living in the shadow of a family tragedy and the claustrophobic presence of her over-protective mother (Juliette Lewis, ""Cape Fear""). Always timidly in the shadow of her best friend – the extrovert Sydney (Emily Meade) – Vee pooh-poohs Sydney's compulsion with the new viral internet game 'Nerve': a social media 'Truth or Dare' (""but without the truth"") challenge game where you can either be a ""Player"" or a ""Watcher"". In real time, Watchers set Players with challenges they have to complete for ever-escalating financial rewards but ""Bail"" or ""Fail"" and you lose all. And ""snitches get stitches"".With their friendship at breaking point, Vee is provoked into playing the game by Sydney and teams with fellow gamer Ian (Dave Franco, younger brother of James Franco) – someone with a history that could bring Vee into great danger. However, Vee's geeky wannabe boyfriend Tommy (Miles Heizer) is on the case.What is so impressive about this film is that the screenplay by Jessica Sharzer (based on a novel by Jeanne Ryan) is genuinely original and is delivered with style and good humor. Sure, you can draw parallels for any film with many other sources: in here there are traces of Hunger Games/Allegiance; the ""Simon Says"" portion of Die Hard 3; perhaps a soupçon of ""Gladiator"" and Schwartznegger's ""Running Man"" in the mix. But this is a novel approach to a teen flick, bang on the topical money in bringing in the frenetically viral nature of social media and aspects of the 'dark web', cyber security and open source programming.The film manages to generate significant credibility about the impact that a game like this would have among a teen audience. And there is a telling message in the finale: that it is easy to be a troll without responsibility hiding behind an internet ident, but when the masks come off and the message back becomes personal then your responsibilities as an individual human can come home to roost. The film is delivered with style and verve as well, with innovative graphics (a great title and end title design) and an 'augmented reality' overlay of the action showing Players and Watchers across the city. Many of the challenges are executed really well, with a few seat-clenchingly tense moments, particularly if you have a poor head for heights.But with all this potential it unfortunately fails to be a 10* classic, smelling at times of 'B' movie. Which is a great shame. Emma Roberts is fine at what she does, but at times I longed for the dramatic depth of a Shailene Woodley or Chloe Grace Moretz, with the scenes with the under-used but excellent Juliette Lewis rather highlighting this differential.The otherwise excellent script is – for me – let down by a scene of male-on-female violence which I found both distasteful and unnecessary. And a coding 'geeks shall inherit the earth' moment towards the end is a little too glib for my liking. But overall the directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman (""Paranormal Activity 3"" and ""4"") have done a fine job with a $20M budget. Regular readers of my blog (bob-the-movie-man.com) may recall my use of the ""BvS quotient"" – the number of films that could be made from the budget of ""Batman vs Superman"": this one has a BvS quotient of 8% meaning you could make over 12 of these instead of the superhero dud. Yes please! Although if they had doubled the budget and rounded off some of the sharp corners, this could have been a true classic. It's still recommended for a memorable movie experience though, and probably makes it into my draft movies of the year list so far.(For the graphical version of this review and to comment, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com.

51,Seth_Rogue_One,Mostly for the teenage crowd,5,23 January 2017,"Didn't really dig this too much, started out watchable but got below mediocre as it went along.The movie feels like it was aimed primarily for teenagers in mind so I am probably not the target audience, even though I can enjoy movies like that usually anyways as long as they are well-made enough. But didn't think this one was.The plot is the biggest issue, the whole set up of how the watchers and players scheme works just doesn't make a whole lot of sense and the plot holes just piles on top of each other after a while.And the acting is not the best, Emma Roberts and Dave Franco are usually pretty solid but they couldn't make this movie any better, rapper Machine Gun Kelly might want to take a couple acting classes or something... Could be the director's fault though I guess.Also the music was very intrusive, really loud electronic, club pop music being played almost non-stop... I don't mind some of the songs on the soundtrack (even though some I definitely did) but even the okay ones got distracting.So yeah not too impressed even though it had a cute moral tale message in the end for the audience it's aimed towards.If you are an adult I recommend '13 Sins (2014)' with Mark Webber instead, far superior movie with a similar plot in terms of the game side of things at least.",Nerve

53,CANpatbuck3664,Nerve is a Solid Effort That Can't Quite Capitalize on its Cool Premise,7,8 November 2016,"We don't get original ideas anymore when it comes to blockbuster season. You'll hear that a lot from a certain segment of the movie going population. These complaints aren't without merit. We get sequels, prequels and reboots galore. Some great original movies don't get the attention that they deserve, everyone has their particular favourite (for me it was The Nice Guys this year). So if you're paying attention, a premise like the one Nerve introduces will catch your eye. To me it was reminiscent of The Purge (although not quite as inventive). For that reason I decided to check out Nerve and although I wasn't blown away, I was pleasantly surprised despite the fact that the movie has some flaws.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Vee (Emma Roberts) is a quiet and shy high school girl. She's deciding where to go to college, she can't decide if she can leave the state which would break her mom's heart. She's a yearbook photographer and hangs with her friends Tommy (Miles Heizer) and Sydney (Emily Meade). She operates almost as Sydney's sidekick, Sydney is the popular cheerleader and Vee is her quiet follower. Tommy clearly is infatuated with Vee and she's completely oblivious to it. Sydney gets suspended that day for accepting a dare playing the game Nerve. In this game, you can either be a watcher or a player. Watchers determine the dares that players must complete and if players complete those dares, they earn money. The more followers they accumulate, the riskier challenges and the more money they earn. The top 2 players per region enter a challenge at the end of the night.Being suspended doesn't seem to bother Sydney and when they meet up later she scolds Sydney for not taking more chances. Taking it upon herself, she asks out the football player that Vee likes for her and he turns her down. Vee leaves, absolutely mortified by what happened. When she gets home, in a fit of anger she logs onto Nerve and decides to become a player. She meets back up with Tommy and they go to a diner, waiting for her first dare.I feel bad going straight to the visuals when talking about the movie Nerve. But what surprised me about Nerve was that there seemed to be a fair amount of effort put into making this a good looking movie. Sure, you have a fair amount of looking at characters tweeting and texting but the movie glows in bright neon colours and keeps it moving through lots of quick cuts (that's not normally a good thing but Nerve does it pretty well). It's not an amazing action movie or a visual feast but instead of just hiring anyone to make this movie and doing it on a shoe-string budget, the work was put into Nerve to make it standout against some similar titles.There are a few smaller roles in the movie but so much of it is left on the shoulders of Emma Roberts and Dave Franco. Luckily, they're largely up to the task. There aren't much to their characters and their development isn't plentiful. It's up to them to sell the relationship between their characters and they work well together. I liked the supporting work from Emily Meade, her arc isn't new either but through her performance, it becomes one of the more interesting parts of the movie.I've criticized the character development in the movie but what this movie hinges on is how they choose to use their concept. They could have taken this movie in several different directions, they could have set it up as a romantic comedy or as a horror movie even. I didn't mind this movie being a thriller but the direction the ending takes is just disappointing. The message to be wary of the internet and that we're all sick and just hiding behind anonymity has been done so many times before. This movie does it without any subtlety to make things worse, it's downright preachy and it reminded me of Untraceable with Diane Lane. That's not a movie that you want to be reminded of. I could have even have gotten on board if they had done it well but to go along with this movie, it requires certain logical leaps. I never needed this movie to be completely plausible but the closer you get to the end, the more and more you have to overlook and the less and less believable Nerve becomes.I had low expectations going into Nerve and I thought it was decent in the end. The movie had it's own style and Emma Roberts and Dave Franco are fun to watch together. The dares aren't shocking but they're risky enough to make you squeamish. The movie loses steam when it enters the 3rd act and I could have done without the preachy ending. That type of ending has been done so many times and other movies have done it better. I would recommend checking out Nerve on Netflix or a streaming service. It does have decent idea behind it and I think it would play best for teenagers since most of the characters are supposed to be around that age anyway.",Nerve

The stunts become increasingly more dangerous until it becomes obvious that the viewers are insatiable for sensation, and the whole thing is out of control.This is a fast-paced, engaging movie that I found to be thoroughly enjoyable to watch. The visuals and music are appealing. Emma Roberts and Dave Franco were competent and worked well together.It was one of the first movies I've seen to actively explore where our new online culture is taking us. In that sense, it's not that different than a ""Black Mirror"" episode. Is there any role in our brave new world for trust, privacy, decency, altruism, etc.?

57,PyroSikTh,Are you a Watcher or a Player?,7,17 August 2016,"Nerve follows Vee, a shy and timid high school photographer who holds a crush on the jock football captain (yeah, sounds pretty cliché at this point). Her best friend is an extrovert who makes it her life goal to have the most fun possible at all opportunities, and has signed up for a city-wide internet dare game called Nerve. In Nerve, you are either a Watcher or a Player. Players go around the city doing the dares the Watchers dare them to do and film it live on their phone. Watchers follow them around videoing everything. The dares start out innocent enough, like kissing a stranger, but they then evolve into more dangerous and illegal activities, like hanging from a crane atop a skyscraper. Vee eventually signs up for the game as a Player, bumps into a fellow charming Player, and follows the game through to it's potentially tragic end.The plot holds a few surprises every now and then, for example Ian's true motivations for playing the game are slowly revealed and quite surprising, and some of the dares become super risky later on and you're left not sure of the outcome. In all though, Nerve definitely comes off as a teen movie, with most of it's cast elder teens, and littered with the High School dramas that angle inherently comes with. All the typical archetypes are there as well; the shy main character who proves she's not all she's cracked up to be, the handsome but slightly jerky jock, the computer nerd who has an unrealistic knowledge of hacking, the slutty best friend with underlying personal issues, the mystery charmer who sweeps the main character off her feet, the punky antagonist etc. etc. Take away the Nerve concept, and it's just another teen high school movie like any other, hitting all the same beats.But this is 2016, and a hip teen movie wouldn't be hip without opening itself up to massive dating in the coming years. The movie opens with Vee browsing the internet, but from her point of view looking at the computer screen. While it's a pretty accurate representation of online life today, it will absolutely act as a time capsule in a decade or so when technology has advanced. There's everything in this one scene, from tagging and liking on Facebook, to Skype calls and even the Huffpost. Not to mention, but Nerve has a real hard-on for Apple. Every computer is a Mac and every phone an iPhone, but I don't think there's any technology developer who advances quite as fast and as drastically as Apple. These products won't exist in a few years.With this massive online angle, it takes the usual approach to subtext that all these kinds of movies approach; the pitfalls of social media and the internet, a lack of privacy, and the irresponsibility of anonymous trolls. The first thing Nerve does when you sign up as a Player is it strips every detail it can from your Facebook profile, from your favourite books to your friends, from your photos to (somehow) your bank details. The game controls every facet of your life thanks to privacy T&Cs in place on social media sites.Visually the movie definitely holds it's mark. There's a lot of neon hues mirroring the Nerve interface throughout, from Ian's neon-lit motorbike, to natural city lights and the constant mirror images from phone and computer screens looking up at character's faces. The introductory Nerve montage also deserves mentioning for incorporating a vast number of clips from TV shows and movies, from modern to classic, giving it that Anonymous-type feel to the whole extravaganza.Then there's the soundtrack which is comprised of an eclectic mix of slightly obscure pop acts, be they dance pop, indie pop, or straight-up hip hop, from the likes of Basenji, Melanie Martinez, and even Wu-Tang Clan. I can't really say it's my kind of music, even remotely, but it all served the movie quite well, obviously appealing to it's target demographic. Unfortunately the selection, as 'hip' and modern as it sounds will also go a long way to dating the movie. Pop music unfortunately changes just as much Apple, and I haven't heard of most these acts so I'm not entirely convinced it'll stick in people memories for very long (although I might be a little biased; most pop music sounds exactly the same to me).I enjoyed Nerve, I'll admit. Despite it's thinly-veiled teen movie foundations, the Nerve concept goes a long way to help you forget it all. The criticisms it holds for the troll-breeding of social media is legit, and the concept of Nerve itself is frighteningly possible in today's current climate; preying on people's need for fame, but ultimately showing the depravity of mob mentality. It's not exactly subtle with it's messages, but they serve well. It'll start showing it's age in no time at all, which is unfortunate, but also an unavoidable symptom of it's concept. I give Nerve an enjoyable if not slightly cliché 7/10",Nerve
58,CineMuseFilms,a satire thriller about the herd mentality upon which social media thrives,6,22 September 2016,"There have been several recent films that warn or excite us about the dark side of the web. Finding the right genre label for some is a challenge. For example, Nerve (2016) includes standard rom- com themes like girlfriend rivalry, coming of age bravado, truth or dare gaming, plus sci-fi themes about the dominance of techno-wizardry and the virtual realities of the digital age. It also has strands of deadly thriller, but the label that fits best is satire drama about the herd mentality upon which social media thrives.Tensions erupt between high school senior Vee (Emma Roberts) and her best friend Syd (Emily Meade) because of boyfriend rivalry. Syd's popularity is rising with her success in an online reality game called Nerve. It has a closed membership of players and watchers in a game of dares with increasing cash rewards as the game becomes more dangerous. Vee signs up to obey the three cardinal rules: dares must be filmed on a player's phone so it can be watched live; money earned is forfeited if a player bails or fails; and the existence of the game must not be reported to anyone outside the game community. It turns out the Vee is good at the game and the money keeps rolling in but it gets seriously risky. She partners another nerve member and in one implausible but exciting scene a blindfolded rider takes a motorbike up to 60 miles per hour through traffic guided by Vee's voice on the back. The game continues until the top two players are, like gladiators of old, pitted against each other in a deadly playoff for the approval of the masked watchers and a big cash prize.As a satire about youth dependency on cyber-communities of anonymous likers, this film is far from subtle, nor is the portrayal of blood-thirsty trolls looking for human prey particularly original. Roberts and Meade are engaging as combatants but shallow in characterisation, something you would expect in a rom-com sci-fi anyway. The pace is lively and audiences will be kept alert just to see how life-threatening the game can be before some semblance of adult responsibility kicks in. But the prospects of moral reasoning are not bright. What the film does do well is in maintain a thin and fragile boundary between the actual world where real humans live and the strange world of digital consciousness that is shaping the cyber-morality of the future. At this level, it is a thought provoking film.",Nerve
59,EthanBJones_03,Solid movie; Would recommend,7,27 October 2016,"Overall: It is a very solid movie and I can definitely recommend it.Good: Great concept with cool and interesting characters portrayed by cool and interesting people. The acting was top notch and the cinematography was pretty good, especially when you are looking at them via their phones. Okay music and a pretty decent story. The actual dares themselves are awesome though I doubt they are plausible. It grips you from about 1/3 of the way in on-wards.Bad: The ending is horrific and is just a cop out. It is rated 15(UK) so there is room for shock. That was what I was expecting so I was annoyed when they just canceled it out. In my opinion, Vee should have stayed dead and make it end on a more sour note. The underlying theme is to not get obsessed with stupid games and your actions have serious consequences. Therefore, her death would satisfy both of these ideas and make the viewer question themselves because we've all done bad things. The ending also leaves so many unanswered questions but not the great kind such as 'Inception'. The first act drags and it is quite boring until the 1/3 mark which is when my interest peaked. I understand some setup is required but I want to see people do stupid things for 2 hours. That is why I watched the movie! Best Part: The motorbike sequence MVP: Emma Roberts as Vee 7/10",Nerve
60,Mike_Devine,Talk about a movie that gets on your nerves,4,13 May 2018,"Are you a watcher, or a player? That's the question at the center of the NYC-set millennial thriller 'Nerve.' The Emma Roberts-/Dave Franco-starrer is a commentary on the perils and pitfalls of our budding voyeuristic society as our lives continue to shift from the real to the virtual world.When an underground online game sprouts up among high school-aged kids that rewards those who dare to accept dares, all kinds of havoc is unleashed on the boroughs of New York. Roberts plays Vee - a graduating high school senior who is caught between a rock and a hard place, as she is looking to escape her simple Staten Island life in hopes of going to school on the west coast. The quiet, shy Vee decides to take a chance on coming out of the shadows, and after crossing paths with the mysterious Franco (Ian), her life is never the same.Sure, 'Nerve' is creative, but it tries really hard to be edgy. And maybe it is seen to be edgy to its core demographic, but it otherwise comes off as feeling ""fake"" and ""pretentious."" There are lots of scenes that feel like they were thought up on the spot, and they look like they were filmed on a smartphone. This effect is intentional, of course, but that doesn't signal that it's good. Yes, there are some daredevil-ish tasks that are attempted here, but they all feel muted. On the positive side, there are some great shots of the city scattered throughout.'Nerve' attempts to generate awareness of the growing issue of cyberbullying, but it does so in a way that feels cheap and hokey.",Nerve
61,eberkerbatur,Good screenplay great cinematography and Nerve game like the Blue Whale,7,18 February 2019,"Nerve: first of all, has a wonderful scenario.like the blue whale game was formerly populer game on earth.If we go to the movie,I've sensed disconnections in some scenes,especially in transitions.I can say that there were irregularities in some scenes at camera angles.Because the whole image is either attracted by viewers or broadcast owners, and We can watch the film through their images,I may not have fully understood the balance.
The sound of the film is one of my favorite events in the movie,is incredibly adaptable at movie.
a good love story that we cannot fully understand from the action of the game is not overlooked.a good film that gave the viewer 1-2 beautiful messages until the last moment.I think the film could be a bit more actionable or a little bit more rushed, maybe a little bit more stressed at the end.But overall it was a nice movie not perfect but nice and I think teenage viewers it likes movie more than other viewers",Nerve
62,deepfrieddodo,Millennial Running Man,6,23 April 2021,"A novel concept (or as novel as a modernisation of The Running Man can be), Nerve has all the components that a film needs, but with glaring holes throughout it. Characters are developed and a backstory is created, it's not too predictable either. But it is pretty stupid, riddled with stereotypes and clichés.There is quite a lot that could be picked apart; first and foremost that the watchers in this game must either be in their millions or investing thousands of dollars in each, considering the ridiculous amounts offered. Some of the scenes are plain daft (taking 2 minutes to get to 60mph instead of doing it in the space of seconds) and many others seem to just be a vehicle to get partial nudity of high school students, sex sells but it's just a bit creepy. Acting is okay, but as a millennial dystopia, it's not too unbelievable (until the end - ridiculous) but still quite lame.",Nerve
63,nicolechan916,"Great editing, soundtrack and acting.",7,27 August 2016,"A very terrifying idea that isn't so far from reality. Nerve hits home to how people like to hide behind their anonymity online while, for example, giving hateful comments. While this concept seemed pretty dark in the trailer, it really is a young adult/teen film. The acting cast did well with their characters, and their emotions were clearly expressed. As the protagonist, Roberts did well in displaying her character's conflicting and transitioning state of mind as the story progressed. Franco does well as the male lead, but I felt that his character was a little more superficial than Roberts'. While background information on his character is provided, it feels like something is lacking. As well, I was pleasantly surprised to see both Kimiko Glenn, and Samira Wiley in the film. Both of them are more popularly known for their characters in Orange is the New Black, and it was nice to see them in roles outside of that. While I feel that Wiley wasn't in a completely different persona, Glenn certainly was. They both did great nonetheless. In terms of the soundtrack, I was very into the music played. I feel like most of them belong to the Indie genre, and I have, for the past half year or so, gotten into Indie music. I especially liked it when 'Electric Love' by Børns came on. I'm hooked on that song. Furthermore, the crew did well in the visual effects and editing of the movie. Although I did not care for the fast cuts whenever the game, 'Nerve' is introduced, the rest of the film is edited well. Also, there are quite a few montages, and they give the audience a sense danger as the dares get more and more ridiculous. The montages, along with the dark color palette, added to and helped maintain, the thrilling tone of the movie. Overall, a pretty thrilling young adult movie, with great acting, editing, and an appreciative soundtrack.",Nerve

65,darkreignn,Completely blew me away - the most fun I've had at the theatre so far this year,10,26 July 2016,"Starring the amazing and very pretty Emma Roberts, and the always charismatic Dave Franco, ""Nerve"" is a new thriller about a high school senior named Venus (Emma) who joins an online community, called Nerve, of adrenaline-junkies where anonymous watchers can dare players to do, well, whatever they want to see someone do. From start to finish, this film is a non-stop white-knuckle thrill ride that is exciting, intense, romantic, and most importantly, a lot of fun. Trust me, you will have a smile on your face the entire runtime of this movie, and you'll also be on the edge of your seat. Now, I'm going to be honest, maybe my low expectations made this movie better to me than it really is, but I can't help that I had an absolute blast watching this film.One thing that was great about this movie was that the dares were realistic, and didn't feel ridiculous. All of the things that Venus is dared to do are things that you know actually could happen in real life. The dares range from her getting a tattoo, to her having to go 60 miles per hour on a motorcycle while the driver, Ian (Dave Franco), is blindfolded, and while the dares get more and more intense as the film goes on, nothing felt overly unbelievable or too exaggerated just for the sake of putting it in the film.And watching Venus and Ian complete their dares and gain money was so much fun to watch. Their chemistry was fantastic, and I bought their friendship throughout the film. What can I say? They made a cute on-screen couple. It was also satisfying to see Venus go from a shy and timid girl to an adrenaline junky, but hey, I'd do the same thing if someone was offering me thousands of dollars. The world building in this film was very believable as well. The game of Nerve felt like a phenomenon, and it actually felt like something that could happen in real life. There were shots of the city that showed the different usernames of all of the different people who were logged into the game, and this was an effective way of conveying just how popular Nerve was in the films universe.The color palette was also hypnotizing. Bright, vibrant, neon reds, blues, and purples are a feast for the eyes, and the soundtrack, which is comprised of light techno music, accompanies and mixes with the colors very well and fits the overall tone of the film.""Nerve"" is a fantastically fun and incredibly intense movie that has great chemistry between Emma Roberts and Dave Franco, great visuals to go with an awesome soundtrack, and cool action sequences in the form of the dares that the characters have to complete. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who just wants to spend an hour and a half gripping their seat with a smile on their face.",Nerve
66,austin0731,intense action to cautionary tale,7,27 January 2017,"Nerve came as quite a surprise for me, it was a very intriguing thriller that delivers on multiple fronts. FIrst of all the premise and narrative of the film were really great, it was fun, intriguing and also shows a darker side of modern day society. The whole watcher and player dilemma and the idea of risk taking was also an idea interestingly discussed in this film.Both leads Dave Franco and Emma Roberts gave probably their best performances outside of their comedic roles. The way the film meticulously brings us into this game which starts of very innocent but takes a turn for the worst halfway through was really great. Perhaps reflecting the dangers of games and gaming now a days, how gaming starts off fun can really takeover people's lives and eat away at people. In an age where there are constantly news of people dying at internet cafes the absurdity that the film possess may not be such an absurdity but rather the reality. This film was not only well filmed and intriguing but at the same time serves as a cautionary tale to modern day society.",Nerve
67,FelipeCarrillo,The Stunning Surprise Of The Summer,7,12 September 2016,"""Nerve"" is the homonymous film adaptation of the novel written by Jeanne Ryan, in the same way as the movie, it externalizes a rooted orientation to the young audience. The dynamic is simple: Watcher or Player? ""Nerve"" is an addictive virtual game, within which, you should choose be observer or player. If you decide to be observer will have to subscribe and challenge to the players, something not so novel, perhaps, because it is in what we are immersed day-to-day. If you put yourself in risk to be a player, prepare to meet each challenge proposed by the ""anonymous users"" and to earn money, gradually, Is it suggestive? To some extent, what young people do not know is: Who does the game restrict? considering that, despite there are not rules, certainly, there is one fundamental: If you denounce them, you die, What are they hiding?. The simplicity of its premise goes together almost immediately with the audience due to the parallelism of that apparent utopian world with ours. Aspiring to be more than an entertainment product, the film of Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman succumb in the dangers of Internet and the own morbid fascination that entail to the collective madness, satisfactory at least in the most of its duration by neon lights, fast pace and charming leads.The film transfers the monotonous characters of high school and their teen conflicts of youth films to an illusory and accelerated atmosphere, in where they interpret their characters in an attractive way. Nonetheless, the exquisite casting decision transforms and materialize their roles in an imaginative and even realistic journey into submission. After Vee (Emma Roberts) is lost in the paradise of popularity, money and love, it will be only a matter of time to challenge her maturity and wisdom when she feels cornered against a wall of threats and betrayals. It is here, where the stable pace of the plot falls down abysmally, giving short but necessary minutes of relaxation, minutes remunerate with an ending non-apt for people with heart problems. Nevertheless, the background of ""Nerve"" goes beyond the Internet and its insecurities - theme addressed by several summer films, are they warning us about something bad? -, the mechanism is (invisible) Internet privacy to create the unstable world full of vices, obscenities and addictions. The morbid curiosity of people, potential misuse of social networking sites, lack of maturity and autonomy, avarice, betrayal, materialism and thousands of ethical values more that the film tries to mention of a way so relaxed as lucid. You will be surprised with the amount of social problems hidden in the movie and it sadly solves them of unrealistically.As well as ""Nerve"" gets an absorbent atmosphere and a frenetic pace, it boasts of fundamental cinematographic flaws. At first instance, the proposal of the first scene reminds us the great-looking recording style employed in ""Unfriended"" or ""Open Windows"", where the operating system of a laptop or whichever media is reflected on the screen so that spectator takes a relative perspective. With running of the run-time, digital interfaces, constant neon lights camouflaged in the black night, (visibly) youthful soundtrack and the aggressive progress of the plot they lose the value that it deserved, limiting themselves to the thought of artificiality and lack of self-control of a couple of young people. By this, I do not mean that the result was embarrassing, to the contrary, it fascinated but wears down potential, which had helped it to transform in an outstanding thriller. It must be highlighted that, if it hadn't been for the basic and predictable treatment in terms of its visuals and the nuanced plot that they impregnated to its powerful and influential premises, and surely, it would get the name of 'cult film'.Apparently, the latest releases will improve the disappointing streak of summer films, which is coming to an end. ""Nerve"" is the best teen film with suspense and action that I've seen, and certainly, it is the surprise of the summer - surprise very similar to ""Unfriended"" in April of the last year - because of it entertains, startle and make us reflect about our participation in that vertiginous virtual world. Nerve knows we're already playing the game.",Nerve

Movie had a new idea that was well wrapped and kept it to the end and at the same time it was entertaining, wild and sometimes even tense. Dare that will change your life or not, no it's not it will try to kill you eventually because people are stupid and want to see other people doing stupid things and even pay for it. Movie wants to live up to it's originality but it fails in projecting ideas of people and how they behave in different environments and under other people influences, but at the same time providing you with money. Emma and Dave were entertaining, enjoyable to watch and did not disappoint. On the other hand there were characters that weren't so much inside the game but they could have contributed.

A high school senior named Vee i finds herself immersed in an online game of truth or dare, where her every move starts to be manipulated by an anonymous community of ""watchers."" If there was any other thing that made me want to watch this film aside from Emma Robert's(who I personally think is a fine actress) and ave Franco(who is an actor who I wasn't too familiar about but I theorized he had a relation to James Franco) was just the idea of an online game where you almost threaten your life for money and with everyone watching. I think it's a pretty new way to talk about where online social media and even online gaming could go. It's like how people could say The Purge could be real as well as this game. Now I don't know exactly what the goal of this film is because it's trying to be a message on online social media society, no it failed. But if it's just trying to be a fun film with an interesting idea then yeah it totally won me over and if that's what your looking for I think you would like it as much as I did. The performances from our two main leads is pretty great acting and they do share chemistry. But I wasn't too hot for everyone else they either came off as bland or just not noteworthy.

It's a radical idea but not so unbelievable like a purge. Emma Roberts plays Vee, short for Venus who's having typical teenage parental issues and having a high-school crush on the popular boy. She's surprisingly introverted who falls out of her shell when peer pressure from all angles gets to breaking point which leads her on a daring and dangerous path of discovery and Ian... It's the third time this year we see the charming, charismatic Dave Franco after Now You See Me and Bad Neighbours sequels, but can we trust his daring nature and out-going personality. Romance blossoms in the most unlikely places and expensive branded changing rooms is one of them. The two team up and share the night of dicey dares, but there's a limit and they certainly reach it, and are dared if not forced to cross it. Can't really hear Rob Simonson's score who did amazing work for Age of Adeline and 500 Days of Summer, as it's pushed to one side by an encompassing soundtrack with songs from Holy Ghost!, Mø, Melaine Martinez, BØRNS and Halsey whilst introducing other tracks from up and coming artists like Sweetmates, Jess Kent, Hal Williams and Crystal Stilts. It's a mega soundtrack boasting nearly thirty tracks which certainly helps complete the film, however there's surprisingly nothing from Colson Baker (better known as Machine Gun Kelly) on the track-list who plays the punk-darer and main contender/competitor to the game. The film makes the city look ultra cool and stylish with plenty of clever camera work which almost gives it an anime gloss with plenty of fruity product placement. It's very slick and neon- coated as the poster suggests, very well paced for 96mins but I don't think it could go any longer. It's didn't feel like a movie and I'm unsure why, if it was the way it was shot or edited but it felt more like one of these viral TV series pilots which isn't meant disrespectful to either mediums. It does get nerve-wrecking at points but falls a little flat towards the end, becoming anticlimactic and me thinking this should end here, not being so keen on a sequel or worse still another Final Destination franchise.

She wants to escape her goody-two-shoes reputation and get out from under the shadow of her friend Sydney (Emily Meade). Players are told what to do, where to go to perform a DARE and if successful, they get the money offered. WATCHERS pay to watch and record the events. In a diner, she meets Ian (Dave Franco) and is told to kiss him for 5-seconds and she does. She doesn't know - until much later - that Dave is already in on everything Vee is to do. In time the DARES get more involved and dangerous. For example Vee and Dave must attain 60-mph on a motorcycle in city traffic while Dave is blindfolded with Emma being his eyes. See?The acting and pacing are all good, but we can only hope this game doesn't catch on in real life as we know there are copycats out there. The DARES are ones that can be accomplished, but must be recorded and done within a time limit. The music is toe-tapping good all the way through and it pumps us up but we are cringing at many of the DARES and we hope no one gets hurt even though we know this is movie magic. In time, Vee sees that the game is getting out of hand and wants to find a way to shut the game down. The ending scenes are quite shocking if you make it that far.

Our main character is not very interesting or fun but it is good to see her be turned into more of a rebel by our other main protagonist who is a really interesting and fun character.

77,danielharden,The NERVE of some people,7,12 August 2016,"The internet, where would we be without it? The internet has become an ever expanding necessity in our lives, but it has also proved itself many times to be a dangerous and seriously f*cked up place. Nerve is an example of some of the many dangers that come with the social networks and internet fame, as well as the incredibly idiotic and life threatening things teenagers can be peer pressured into doing.What makes Nerve so fascinating to me is that it could actually happen someday. This film has come out at a time where apps like Pokemon Go has been the cause of many road accidents and other such crimes making the films release perfect. This idiotically-scary-in-a-real-way film has some rather tense moments whose impact is further amplified by the films scary realism. The films theme and timing couldn't have been any better and the film itself really brings the tension when it comes to what some teenagers would do for fame and money.Another great moment of this film was its build up to the ending. The film does a good job of highlighting when people using the world wide web go too far and delivering a rather powerful message on human beings desensitisation to matters such as violence. I especially liked the message sent to every Nerve users phone by the hackers. But... The film chickens out. Spoiler Alert everything goes happily ever after. The end. This annoyed me a lot as it took away a lot of the power they had if they had ended with an actual death. It felt to me that the filmmakers lost confidence in their own ending and so conformed to and everything-works-out-in-the-end ending. This was really disappointing to witness and I can't help but feel like the film copped out last minute.One thing I didn't really understand was the relevance of the backstory about Venus' brother. It comes up on occasion but overall I'm not too sure why, like maybe he was Vee's role model and so she plays Nerve to be like him... But no she plays Nerve because her friend was a b*tch to her. I guess it brings some more depth to Vee but still I'm unsure of its inclusion and impact on the film overall.Overall Nerve is a tense thrill ride that is scary in a realistic way.

Profuse with promising visuals and inspired sounds, both also screaming for a more serious, adult and deep approach, Nerve directors Schulman and Joost go through a hole aplenty plot with such vibrancy and enthusiasm fast pace assertiveness, worthy of a CW TV show, that the final result is somehow not detrimental despite a convenient and frankly eye-rolling conclusion.",Nerve
80,fillerruth,Your nerve will taste the acting.....not the suspense...,2,27 July 2016,"When I saw the name of this movie I had some interest and thought this will be a good movie. I saw the casting and read the synopsis. But that is not the feature of the movie. The plot is ""A high school senior finds herself immersed in an online game of truth or dare, where her every move starts to become manipulated by an anonymous community of watchers."" The sad thing is, this is not the story and when you will watch the movie you will get confused that, what is the synopsis and what is the actual story. Maybe the director (or director duo) also confused about the plot and the story line. If you want to make a thriller movie you have to maintain the suspense and have to create the thrill but in this movie the director used a very common formula and monotonous plot. Here I want to say, the acting and some humor are good in this movie but these are not enough to save the movie. Plot wise the movie could have been better a lot. But the director missed the opportunity to execute the thrilling content and failed to maintain the pace of this movie. Unnecessary subplot and some enigmatic incidents surely make you confuse. I like the theme and young people's story like high school story is always enjoyable for me but there is no execution of the teenager's emotion and sometimes the director put some exaggerated emotion on that. When you deal with a story that has a virtual game and social networking concept you have to put proper suspense and thrill among the characters because the game is not usual and that is the main character of this movie. There are a lot of cliché points in this thriller movie and I am sure you already have been seen this story 50 times before watching this movie. Save your money and if you want to watch, go with your own risk.",Nerve

The connection between events and persons from dare to dare is really commendable because that makes you feel as a viewer that anything can happen here, anything and anyone can come out of nowhere.The climax though turned out to be pretty lame, and that whole thing firstly with police not taking it seriously, and then the imprisonment thing looked a bit too much and overboard; and hence the ending from thereon was never going to go anywhere, sadly.Overall, I'd still give it seven out of 10 for the entertainment that it brought and how it was fully able to engage me into it - till the climax at least!As a side-note though, the film delivers a good message for the teenagers and the youth of our age (who spend all their day on their computers and smart-phones).",Nerve

84,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 91,9,18 August 2016,"Since the dawn of the internet and smart phones, films have tried to relate to the generation that's so engulfed in the technology. From the guy in his 30s trading on Wall Street to the teenage girl who can't seem to separate herself from Snapchat or Instagram. Many have tried, and few have succeeded. Most are done in a way that comes off as a little too pushy or polemic. Others use it as a devise to make the film look more attractive to a younger demographic. Either way, it's always seemed as though it was the technology that was propelling the stories--almost forcing them upon us.Right off the bat, the concept of Nerve may have you thinking the same thing, but its premise is much more relaxed. And where it isn't, it's more subtle than its contemporaries. Nerve is, all around, more mature with its subject matter.It stars Emma Roberts as Vee, an artistic high school senior who's best friend, Sydney (Emily Meade), thinks she doesn't live uninhibitedly enough. Then there's this secret game/app which the user can choose to be either a watcher or a player. As a player, you have to complete tasks, or ""dares"", for money. The two who last the longest without giving up go to the finals.The rules of the game take much of the film to get a grasp on, but it makes sense when it needs to.Along the way, Vee meets Ian (Dave Franco)--another player. The watchers like the two of them together and keep giving them tasks to complete with each other.The audience should also like them together, since they have a natural chemistry, which helps us see past some of the streaky performances.The film bounces around between different characters in the story seamlessly without losing us, or its energy, in the process.At no point do you look down at your watch wondering when the film will be over. It keeps you in its grasp the whole time. And afterward, you'll be talking with others about hypotheticals if the app actually existed in real life.You will definitely be surprised by this film, despite any preconceived notions. It's one of the best we've seen in this ""techno"" subgenre. Maybe by now we've gotten over the newness of our devices and can finally get a real film that actually takes control of the technology within it, rather than the other way around.Twizard Rating: 91",Nerve

If money is the thing that everyone likes, get ready for some good stunts, so good to see (Dave Franco) in it he is one of the growing characters out there i would like to see him more for upcoming movies, grossed well too and a work of success out there, highly recommended if you are the one who likes to see game shows, 6.5/10⭐",Nerve

The beginning was good and I was waiting fot things to get more interesting from the usual unpopular girl vs popular girl trope, but Nerve became a mess real quick. And by the end, it felt like just watching arial shots of bridges over a city with soundtrack playing in the background.The message the movie sent is good, don't get me wrong.

87,shimenpf,"Good plot, great tension",7,7 March 2020,"First of all, the idea of Nerve is quite original and engaging. It is fitting to our reality, and seems similar to those kind of dark urban games teenagers play nowadays (I'm not an old bitter 40-year-old, I swear!).
The 'dares' the characters go through are great for the plot, filled with suspense and written/filmed in a way that really had me on the edge of my seat. The dares escalate, starting off soft but going up like a movie should, which is also nice.The character could be a little more solid, with clearer motivations, but this doesn't affect too much because of the kind of movie this is. The film takes a little turn towards the third act, changing from an urban game to something much bigger. I'm not sure if I liked this or not, but it was mostly well-written either way. I did not like the revelation that Ty turns out to be good. The reason is, I feel more foreshadowing was needed. There was never any clue about him even considering turning good. It could not have been predicted, therefore it is improvable. Yes, Emma Robert's character's friend did call him and that made sense, but I feel even more clues were needed for it to work.Either way, the movie is very good, I'd say about the average. I definitely recommend it.",Nerve
88,trevor-82944,So Daringly Relevant It Scares You Pantless!,7,1 August 2016,"It's a game of truth or dare, minus the truth. You have a choice to be either a watcher or a player. Over the brief period of twenty- four hours, a phone app puts teens everywhere in danger through dares that are played for cash payments. In the meantime, a fan base sends in that money to watch certain players take on requested dares, specific to information picked up from their social media profiles. It is a nationwide phenomenon that is the subject of Nerve, based on the Jeanne Ryan novel, a timely piece of summer entertainment that gives teenagers what they want simultaneously with what they need.Thank goodness this type of mobile game doesn't exist, but thank even greater goodness that directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman (Catfish, Paranormal Activity 3 and 4) made it feel as close to real as we could probably grasp it. The camera takes on a DSLR feel with its Steadicam effects and shifting in and out of focus, all made the more heart-pounding to watch with the intense, stylistic colors that make every image pop. The Rob Simonsen score compels with a pulsing synthesizer, adding to the imprisoning effect of the city skyline illuminated at night by the usernames of the game players. But the directing team's most creative narrative technique is the unsettling effect of putting us behind the point of view of the phone screens, as if we're the watchers communicating with the players.Joost and Schulman similarly draw us in at the start of the movie with a wonderfully stylistic opening hook, where a teenage girl's PC fills up the entire screen as if we were the ones running the show. The teenage girl of this story is Venus Delmonico (or Vee for short), played by Emma Roberts. She always has more social media tabs open than she can keep track of, which matches her cluttered mind that is set on leaving her mother's home for college. The problem? She doesn't have money to afford the dorms.But Vee does not consider herself a risk taker—she can't even ask a boy out on a date without her best friend volunteering to do it for her. Here is where the game ""Nerve"" steps into her life, offering a possibility to win hundreds upon thousands of dollars for each dare she achieves.Her first dare: kiss a stranger. Her second dare: take him into the city. Her third dare: try on a sparkly jade dress that costs four- grand. You can figure out the pattern from here.As the night goes on, the money is deposited into her unsuspecting mother's checking account, a romance sparks between her and the stranger she meets from the dare, and she becomes one of the top 10 worldwide players, helping her to at last feel free and respected through her rebellion. It's worth respecting the challenge Emma Roberts and her male co-lead, Dave Franco, went through to complete these dares. They work rather well together, better than most teen couples on screen, although I have to wonder, was adding a predictable love story necessary?I would not say that the screenplay turned out one-hundred-percent bullet-proof. With a story as big as this one, half of the unnecessary subplots had either little resolution or none at all. When Vee gets a tattoo for one of her dares, she tells her newly found boyfriend about the time her brother died. It could have been a meaningful moment, except it's never mentioned again, nor did it add anything to the story. Along with all the loose-ends and time- wasters, I also have one blaring question to ask: how did the police not know that any of this was going on? With a phenomenon as big as Nerve ruling teen culture, I feel like the police would have some involvement, but they didn't. I don't know how you just miss something like that.Nonetheless, I'd be lying if I said I did not enjoy Nerve, because it delivered exactly what it promised: on-edge terror that never stops and splendidly pays off in the end. I am sure that if you are a boy or girl also obsessed with the juvenile culture of mobile gaming, then this should just as well please you.",Nerve

She then meets a boy that pushes her to continue playing.There are quite a few adrenaline fueled moments during the film and little drop off from the action. Obviously this is a movie marketed to younger audiences as it is centered on social media and the ever increasing use of text bubbles on screen...but I managed to look past it (I personally stay away from all that). So if you hate that and the found footage kind of shots be warned as that will be heavily featured.The plot is pretty thin, but this is a movie that is not worried about that. Instead this is just a fun movie that leaves the viewer as a watcher of the two popular contestants played by Dave Franco and Emma Roberts. The two had very good chemistry with one another and kept me wanting more of their shenanigans.This movie is by no means bad and anyone that is looking for a fun intense movie, look no further.

How could this game owned by nobody? and no server? what did they shut down at the end? If so, who benefits. It is not realistic that watchers play to watch and yet there is no middle man to control or benefit. Someone had to create the game to benefit.2.

But after moral (not ethics) catches them up they fall back in place and will live ordinary boring lives. What remains after leaving the cinema, is the depressing fact that our digital world can only be thought as going mad, that internet brings out mostly the bad side of people, but very seldom the good.

I was sitting in football pub and checked it out on IMDb first to see if it had made some high marks, and I don't regret. Pulled up the average too. All though I thought I'd made a mistake after watching the first five to ten minutes, I after that got sucked into an original and intriguing story. The actors are young, as are the directors and writers, but they've all done a good job on this one. The composition and the editing is also very well balanced.I am tempted to write a spoiler or two, but am simply going to recommend it to everyone.

93,sildarmillion,Probably a Hit or Miss,7,18 September 2017,"Given the low ratings, I had expected this movie to be a lot worse than it turned out to be. That's why I think maybe it's a hit or miss? The things is does right - some people will relate to and some people couldn't care less about?In the list of what it did right, I would say: the portrayal of the relationship between kids and their technology. Their lives revolve around technology. You even see the characters doing their things from the perspective of their screens (laptop screens or tablet screens or phone screens).The next would be the audience mentality. You have a bunch of ""watchers"" who send dares to the ""players"" and send them money when they complete the dares. The dares get more and more ruthless as the movie progresses. (Not unlike the Hunger Games audience, eh?) At points I did question whether people can really be that ruthless, but the movie implies that this audience has lost touch between the line between reality and entertainment. (Again, not unlike the Hunger Games audience.)Finally there are the characters. Yes, you have a bunch of stereotypical tropey high school characters. But there is a decent amount of effort to subvert some of those tropes.Ultimately, this is a mindless thriller. (If it tried to do any commentary on audience mentality, it didn't do a good job of it. Any commentary that I gleaned from it was by drawing comparisons to the Hunger Games.) But it's a pretty solid thriller, but probably only if the whole relationship-with-technology aspect connects with you (or if the stereotypical high school setting doesn't take you out of it).",Nerve

Where Nerve differs is that, eventually, it becomes darker and much more interesting. The world of teens is hard for adults to understand as so much of their lives are spent on mobile phones. While adults use the Internet, teens rule the mobile world. And for this reason Nerve is quite believable. As an adult I am blasé and disinterested in many things, but for teens Nerve sets up a world of unpredictable excitement. It's just that the film took a long time to get there. The acting between the two main protagonists is well done, with Franco giving a far more nuanced and in-depth performance than in the Now-You-See-Me's, and Roberts moves well from ingenue to smart survivor. Naturally, the film is rapidly cut, with hardly a shot longer than three seconds, and especially at the beginning, this pace jars.

98,Stewball,Should teens see this?,9,28 July 2016,"So, should you let your twixt-ten-and-twenty kids see this? Superb story line and execution with little to no use of formulaic plot devices or simplistic teen music--which makes it easier for adults to watch. It's basically a Pokeyman Go game with money and FAME as the rewards, only with increasingly dangerous dares. It's right into the wheelhouse of its ""I'm bulletproof"" target teen audience. It shows exactly how addicting something like this would most likely be, as well where this out of control path to daredevil thrill/fame seeking so often takes us.I see plenty of movies for younger kids since they usually have material adults can appreciate mixed in. But as a rule, I avoid movies directed straight at teens, especially horror. This, however, is about as good as I can remember a movie for this particularly audience being. In fact, when I saw all the teens, mostly girls, coming into the theater, for a 1 PM showing, and then several teen slasher previews, I almost walked out. But the premise made me stick it out, and I'm glad I did.As for the opening question, I recommend a very hearty but advised, yes. Adulation derived adrenaline could well be the new drug of the future, and it's always better to face something head on than to ignore it. With caring parents and relatives, this can actually be a good source for a life lesson discussion--and to its credit, the movie is on your side. But you really need to see it too (separately?) so you can help them think through what really happens, so they don't just conclude, ""well I would do it better"".

That being said, the plot - as it developed - felt ""obvious"", I wasn't surprised by anything and I wasn't ever emotionally ""moved."" The movie knows what it is, and it does it pretty well - it's a teen thriller. What the movie explores is far more important: the way people interact with each other when they are hidden behind a wall of anonymity. The movie has a good message.

106,organicsocial,Mismanages the thrills and ends up being a mushy teen love story,5,17 October 2016,"This movie is definitely an example of missed opportunities. In the post #Snowdengate world, we are more aware of the dangers of internet than ever. Nerve could have been an awesome dystopian sci- fi story about identity thefts, dangerous cyber-criminal underworld or just generally subversive technology dependent society. There are many great movies like Minority Report and Enemy of the State that take on the idea of surveillance. TV shows like Mr. Robot have already broadened our outlook on social networking and hacking. In this environment, a superficial outtake on this subject is more nerve-wrecking than the ill-informed 1995 thriller The Net. Nerve is not without its redeeming virtues though. It opens up today's generation to a debate of what is sensible and what is not. There is even some ethical pondering towards the end of the movie but its too little too late. By that time we are already fixated on the beautiful couple of Dave Franco and Emma Roberts. Whatever message the movie could have mustered against peer pressure and bullying got flushed down the toilet as soon as you realize that without giving in to the demands of their peers our on- screen lovers wouldn't have even met. Nobody dies and the audience gets to go home without any emotional baggage. Its like a beautiful yet terrible person who you sorta date for a while because the sex is good and nothing else.The idea of taking dares too far is not new. Yes, there are some scenes in it that remind you of the nauseating videos some Adrenalin junkies post on YouTube jumping on building roof tops without any kind of safety. The most thrilling parts were already covered in the trailer itself. I hoped for the characters to resolve the mess more intelligently but nothing came quite close to convincing. We see more believable techno babble in a single episode of Mr. Robot.

With the first act, it seemed to be okay, if you ignore the poor aspects the overall set up is good, when the moral matters are brought up the message is overly played, really pushing a message, whereas if you took the concept to Dead Tube, you could have a successful message if not so on the nose, a message played through the events and what is seen rather than the ending that is given. Much of the overall film feels as though something exciting is about to happen but is unfortunately lost to draw in viewers to the the message the film and studio try to push. It is unfortunate this is a missed opportunity, the cast were also an issue in that they were selected for attracting a younger audience. If we had unknown actors, with a darker plot we could be left with something that makes the viewer consider what they have witnessed compared to the message that is painfully spelled out.",Nerve

I hope to god this doesn't spawn several Internet themed movies, in the same way 'found movies' did. Haven't we got enough social media in the world, without making movies about it? I suspect this will appeal to the younger person, but it just didn't do it for me. I feel this movie has missed the boat somewhat.....we've already had the ice-bucket challenge, cinnamon challenge, drinking challenges etc etc etc... I agree totally that some clown will try to invent something like this and there will always be bigger clowns who will try to compensate for their lack of a brain by morphing into a sheep and BAAAA copying it. I dare folks to live without their phones for a day - now wouldn't that be something? Okay for a watch, but absolutely no classic!",Nerve

110,ChrisInMiami,7.5 Stars. Not a perfect movie but a fun ride in the theater with an audience,7,28 July 2016,"Vee is a young woman who has taken all the right steps to advance into adulthood but is too stuck in her comfort zone to make the necessary leap. Her friend Sydney is exactly the opposite; her devil may care attitude may take her far in life or may send her into a life of mediocrity. A new mobile game, NERVE, puts both their philosophies to the test. People who log into NERVE are either Watchers or Players. It pits the Players against each other as they compete to finish ever more challenging dares, which they must stream live on their smartphone to the Watchers. Players win increasing prize money for each dare they finish. Sydney plays NERVE because she craves the attention it brings and she eventually bullies Vee into becoming a Player in an attempt to crack her out of her shy shell. The audience become the Watchers as Vee is thrown face first, literally, out of her comfort zone. The challenges begin harmless enough but spiral inevitably to complete chaos as Vee does things she never have thought of on her own. Along the way we meet a few of the other Players, who are struggling with their own reasons for playing the game and one in particular who may know more than he is telling.The movie, based on a novel by Jeanne Ryan and directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman who brought us the last few Paranormal Activity films, is very entertaining. I saw it with a half filled theater on opening night and they were truly invested in the story as they cheered, clapped and gasped throughout the progressing challenges. I definitely recommend you see it in the theater with some crowd participation and I expect the good word of mouth will bring in a bigger audience through the next few weeks. As fun as the movie was though, I couldn't help but feel that, in the hands of more visionary film-makers, it could have been a cult classic. It may in fact actually reach that status based on the concept alone, and a deep theme of who is more corrupt... a person that does wrong or a person that encourages it. But Stanley Kubrick could have slayed this script with his atmospheric tension. David Cronenberg might have been more effective if he had given some of the players his patented creepy characterization. David Fincher already knocked it out of the park with 'The Game', which this movie shares some similarity with. Wishful thinking of course, but I have a tendency to nitpick in that manner as I watch 'high concept' stories like this.As fun as it is, it is not a perfect movie, its biggest flaw being the rushed third act. The rules and atmosphere created so well in the first act and mined so well throughout the challenges in the second act just don't seem to matter in the third.7.5 stars. Not a perfect movie, but a fun ride nonetheless.***POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW*** There is a subplot that hints at the necessity of finding out who created the game, but that is never answered. The story instead chooses to blame the watchers, and although they are certainly part of the problem and a worthwhile substitute, imagine if a Bond movie ended after he killed the henchman and the mastermind walked free. I also felt there was slight overuse of special effects, having the mobile phone buttons and text superimposed over the camera lens and having the story told through the phone, a la found footage. Those devices were used very well in the first act and it wasn't necessary to continue their use throughout the entire story to tell the story.",Nerve
111,nathannicolarobertscouk,"Nerve is a tense, well-performed and directed original and interesting film",9,12 August 2016,"With social media at the very heart of the world we live in, the film takes these elements to demonstrate the wide-spreading nature of this technology, as well as the hidden danger through its incredibly intriguing premise. Captivating and brilliantly performed by Roberts and Franco, Nerve exceeded my expectations to become one of the most tense, adrenaline-packed films of the summer. In a blockbuster season that lacked originality, Nerve brought it in abundance, dressing it up in a visually-spectacular package that is well acted, well directed, well edited, thought-provoking and intriguing. With Lionsgate wrapping up their insanely successful Hunger Games franchise with Mockingjay (Part Two) last year and stepping on egg shells with the Divergent series, this is exactly the sort of film that they should pursue as they attempt to craft their new wave of cinema.Summary: Nerve takes an intriguing premise and selection of themes, two charming leads, solid direction and beautiful visuals to deliver an adrenaline-packed, original film, that may just be one of the strongest of the summer.

112,miinty,"I was entertained, but....",6,28 December 2019,"20 mins into this, I loved it - I was all in for the ride, then, you know, that la dee da, bulls*** ending happened. I really wish they'd gone dark with that ending.
Actually, every moment after Vee snitches to that cop should be changed, I feel like up until that point it was so good.
I was still entertained, but the magical hacker network taking down everything... in record time, uuugh, it was so, typical.
Also, Vee's brother, he played Nerve, right? That's how he died?? lol, I can't've been the only one that thought that - why mention him at all, why even have a brother, if he's not central to the story or some breakthrough??
Him being ""the fun was"" can't've been it, can it?This movie was good, almost great. Strong 6/10.",Nerve
113,Anaslair,Almost feel something like this could happen nowadays,7,26 February 2017,"Nerve was an entertaining movie but it asked for a lot of suspension of disbelief.The strength of the film is the possibility that all of this could happen, born out of the feeling of anonymity that virtual lives allow. It explores that power to the limit.In this game called Nerve, there are players and there are watchers. Players have to accept challenges, or dares, which get progressively more difficult to fulfil, even life-threatening, but the reward is exponentially higher as well. Winning the challenge is part of the game, the other is getting more followers. So all these people gather around following their favourite players both online and in real life, rooting for them.There was so much I didn't get about this game and how the movie progressed.How are the dares chosen? Only towards the end do we get an inkling of an explanation – that they are voted by the majority. OK but who creates them in the first place and out of so many thousands of people how many are necessary to get a dare through? Do they all vote? It seems like a somewhat long process given the speed at which they came up.Who created the game? Who wires the money and how? Who decides if the challenge is passed or failed, since it is not always that obvious?One of the challenges was for Ian to take Vee to the city. What if she had said no? Would he have lost? Was he supposed to take her by force?Also one of the rules is that for the dare to count it must be filmed by the player's phone. I got so confused because the scenes would be filmed as if the player was holding the camera when they were obviously not The motorcycle challenge was the one where this showed most blatantly. There is no way either of them could have filmed that, or even a watcher, not from that angle.The movie is so fast paced that probably folks won't be thinking about most of these things but I couldn't get them off my mind. It just did not seem plausible for such a concept to exist in this fashion. It needed to be much more polished.Also, the ending was totally anti-climatic since those issues were never explained, particularly about who created the game and how it worked. And having kid hackers admonish the watchers and that's it, game over, slap on the wrist and people simultaneously gain a conscience and the game is destroyed was beyond ridiculous for a resolution of such a story.The main character's evolution was a bit too dramatic. She is portrayed as a bookworm with little to no self-esteem, cannot even speak to a guy she likes, and we are presented with a knockout of an actress who I can never believe is any of those things. She shines so much more than her so called star friend. Anyway, assuming she was all that, I get that Vee gets carried away by the entire thing and it is a journey of discovering herself but some things were really extreme and it just struck me as not believable. Then there were all the clichés about the friend who obviously likes her more than she does, the jealous friend, and so on.With all these things that ticked me off, Nerve is still a fast- paced movie which makes you wonder about possibilities in today's world and how things can so easily change in the blink of an eye and how everything we take for granted may vanish and especially that just because we are anonymous online it does not mean our words and actions do not count or have no power.I had fun. I wish the concept had been developed better but I had fun.",Nerve
114,agentk-77301,"In the end, I wasn't satisfied",5,26 May 2017,"When I initially saw the trailers and plot description, it sounded a LOT like the manga ""Dead-Tube"" which explores similar themes. (Only with a LOT more gore)- But the manga takes its time exploring the ideas and thoughts about the theme, something the movie half-assed about, which was one of the main reasons that by the end of the movie, I didn't feel satisfied. They had a GREAT concept. The actors weren't bad at all. But the lack of exploring and eventually making the main character say one of the main messages directly really ruined it. She literally screamed at the audience (Us and in the movie) the moral of the story. ""Show, don't tell"" is an important rule- Both in writing and in film making. Beyond the lack of deep exploration, I felt the music didn't fit. It was too... ""Pop"" for me. I expected slow songs or scary songs at the appropriate time, but it was all pop pop pop. The lack of diversity bothered me in that aspect. Probably because it felt contradictory - mindless pop vs (a supposedly) deep movie. Or was it mindless? idk, I guess I just dislike pop. But my point on lack of diversity still stands. Moving on! The characters. Two problems. Ian/Sam. How the hell a guy who fights for his FAMILY and his own sake, falls in love in the middle of his own manipulations? It felt forced and not genuine. If he had betrayed her in ""the moment of truth"" it would feel much more genuine and honest than ""well... he just falls for her mindlessly lole"". And the fact that the other male character what's his name... The hacker guy. I just felt SAD for him. Even by the end. He didn't even develop a personality beyond the ""stereotypical hacker-beta male who's in love but can't express it or something"". Now, a plot-problem - Wouldn't anyone see via their phones the other major player switching to fake bullets? Aren't they under constant surveillance? If you or the movie have an answer for this - I'll up my rating to 6.I think the movie should have ended like this:Ian betrays Vee near the end (probably around the snitching part), Vee who is heartbroken yet determined to get her life back and even some revenge contacts her friends to make the plan to crash Nerve. In the big finals SHE AND HER FRIENDS switch all the bullets to fakes (And Vee would've been in charge to do the same to her own gun, yet she doesn't switch bullets in order to get revenge on Ian). She fakes her own death (Since no one knows the bullets aren't real), and then shocks the audience by rising up from the ground and you can imagine the rest. This could have given out the same results in terms of theme and the final message to the viewers (of the movie) with bigger and more fun twists and turns. ""The mask of anonymity won't protect you forever, and what you do online can come back like a boomerang"".At least it's my opinion about it.",Nerve
115,portraitofaladyonfire,Cinematography is strong on this one,7,17 March 2021,"Unfortunately the last third of the movie lacks of logic and the characters start to become incomprehensible.

Like this it was still better than I expected.",Nerve
116,twanster-1,Teen flick,2,27 February 2020,"If you've watched the trailer, your probably curious. Let me save you the time. This is a teen movie. PG13 so there is no real thrills. The scenes that make it PG13 have no impact on the movie. The cast are boring, the plot holds promise but it's poorly delivered and because of the low age rating the film goes nowhere. The trailer shows the only action within the film. It has nothing that a fan of action, thriller, horror or slasher would be interested in. Its about teens saying ""omg"" alot with corny pop music played over it.",Nerve
117,klheintz,Solid film but very predictable,6,6 November 2016,"Nerve is a movie about how people interact while under the anonymity that some apps can allow you to be. It's graver than anything out there obviously but it gets the message across. It's got wonderful editing, acting, and the colors are really great. I like those parts of the film the best.I just wish there were more twists in the film. In a movie about dares, there could have been literally anything available to make the plot a little more twisty. I think the main focus was on how apps and more so group mentalities can make people act in certain situations. Roberts and Franco do a great job but these high school-ers all look way older than they should. I mean that's an issue in a lot of movies but it's still something that bothers me. Regardless, they do a good job and they have some chemistry so it helps the flow of the film... Especially when it keeps a pretty fast pace the whole time.Overall it's a good little movie that is fun to watch and doesn't get too dumb towards the wrap-up. It does get a little dumb but it's not a terrible ending.",Nerve
118,dareent-amethyst,Nerve was soooooo good,10,4 September 2016,"I came inside the theater with somewhat a high and low expectation for Nerve after seeing its trailer. The trailer started off great but it seemed like too much was revealed and that the movie might turn out boring. However, the movie turned out so great i immediately told everyone 'Nerve was so good' right after the movie. The plot is creative and fun and original, well kinda. Emma was surprisingly a convincing 'good girl'. What i loved about the movie is that although I knew the game was going to turn ugly and the main characters would have to make impossible choices, Nerve still managed to kept me on the edge of my seat begging the game to stop but also begging for the movie not to end at the same time. And the soundtracks are perfect. I loved how the movie went for Indie Pop instead of go down the mainstream road. Go see this movie! I guess its more for teenagers, but its so good i think everyone should go see it. There haven't been a lot of great movies lately but this one is an exception. 10/10",Nerve
119,drawnsupreme,Nerve captures today's social media mindset perfectly.,7,5 January 2019,"This generation is easily entertained by social media, and many of the people who use these platforms happen to care about the amount of likes, followers, or views that they receive. If you happen to go viral, you can expect to make a decent amount of money regardless of whether you use YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, and/or many of today's most popular social media platforms.Nerve is a movie that portrays the mindset of today's social media users (which, of course, are mostly young adults) and the effects of the contributions that we make by repeatedly liking, viewing, and sometimes further encouraging insane behavior - which circulates these social platforms every single day... all for our own amusement.This is a movie with a message, and is not far off from today's reality. It touches on small things such as insecurity, social media addiction, and even provides some insight to the dark web, which I didn't expect.My only gripe? The story could have been fleshed out more. Emma Roberts her part perfectly but I feel that this movie should have had some more character development in regards to Dave Franco and Machine Gun Kelly's characters but over all, I enjoyed the film.",Nerve
120,AustinOswald,"Great Concept, Inadequate Execution",6,31 July 2016,"While the movie was moderately entertaining, most of the film was highly unfeasible and not likely to happen. From a technological standpoint, there were many inaccuracies and blemishes. The film's story had very little character development, which, in turn, made the story hard to follow. Story aside, thrilling and suspenseful scenes kept the crowd engaged and entertained throughout the film's entirety. This however, brings a false sense of realism to the movie. If audiences fear for the character, audiences feel as if they must fear for themselves. The film connects to the audience's biggest fears including heights, public embarrassment, and lack of control. The greatest parts of this movie were, by far, the concept and the overall anxious mood throughout.",Nerve

Well, if you were someone like 17-18 year old Vee Delmonico (EMMA ROBERTS), you'd play ""Nerve"", the game where ""watchers"" watch you ""play""...if you know what I mean. Emma's fellow players are best pals Sydney (EMILY MEADE) & Ian (DAVE FRANCO, brother of JAMES) who get caught up as other friends, most notably Asian Liv (KIMIKO GLENN most known for ""Orange is the New Black"") are watchers.

122,hartj-75983,Vee 99!,8,29 May 2021,I liked this movie a lot though a lot of suspension of disbelief is required to enjoy it.In some ways it is a lot like other dystopian stories such as 'Fight Club' and 'The Purge' in the way there is a hyperreal society where powerless and desperate people are manipulated into dangerous activities for the amusement of controllers or 'watchers' as they are described in this tale.So sit back and pretend that the story is set in a very different America because on that basis it is very entertaining.,Nerve

126,crybaby-30283,This is one of my favorite movies,10,9 September 2020,"I love how they go to the dark web with nerve and no one can even get out unless you bail or fail. The concept is awesome. I can't stand Emma Roberts but she did good playing the awkward teenager who can't get a bf but is smart. James Franco character was great and he's of course gorgeous and I love Sydney a lot also. I felt her character made the movie interesting. I never got bored once and I love watching all the dares! I felt this was a really good movie that was underrated! I like how this game is on the dark web and not controlled by one crazy villain, but just kids who want to be entertained. I love the crazy hackers that shut down the game in the end. I just got confused how Sydney was able to call Machine Gun Kelly, when I phone dropped and was smashed. I don't know anyone's number without my phone, especially a person I just met. Other than that, I felt this movie was great and interesting and no too full of technology. But based on a girl who was turned down by a guy she loves and then snaps and wants a change! The fact the game can take over your whole life and bank account if you snitch. Is crazy but if you actually watch the movie it make senses and explains it all. I like Sydney and Vee as best friends because that is all girls in high school. You compete with each other but love each other at the same time. I like machine gun Kelly in this a lot too. His character makes you scared of him at first and then like him later on. He's not bad actor. None of these actors were bad at all. Just couldn't stand looking at Emma Roberts extensions. They could have gave her better extensions in the movie. I could tell right away it was fake. But that doesn't make a movie! I even like the soundtrack in this movie. The mother annoyed me alittle, I didn't think she needed to be so much into this because I just wanted to watch the younger actors. But I guess you have to have a mother that worries in a high school movie. I just loved the premises of this movie, the actors, the whole plot and even the ending didn't piss me off. It's a good movie. People who give it bad reviews either don't understand the dark web or didn't actually watch the movie and listen to what people said. Like I said I watched this a million times so I understand it a lot. I'll keep on watching it.",Nerve
127,picassomanhdan,an averagely good idea doused with redundant compliments,6,8 September 2016,"My decision to see this film largely stems from the high recommendations by my friend. Of course, their taste in film is rather questionable, thus I entered the theatre without excessive expectations. Unsurprisingly, it responds to my humble expectation just nicely.The intrinsic idea of Nerve is intriguing, as compared with other commercial films: a dare game that blurs any credulous limits to the extent of danger. My attention was totally on the film for the first half, but sadly the second half failed to sustain my interest.A major theme that runs across this film is the romanticisation of thrill-seeking activities by American adolescents. Despite some modest amount of novelty, this couldn't bring the movie to a high standing of ideas due to the use of clichéd motifs. These include a girl absorbed by a bad boy, character transformation due to peer pressure, estranged relationships with old friends due to newly cultivated ones, plot twist of bad boy turning out to be good- natured despite his wrong-doings. Sadly, some of the details appear quite contrived: the drastic alteration of Vee from a shy and introverted girl to a bold and reckless one is a bit implausible, a friendship between Vee and Sydney, an extroverted and outgoing teenager, appears incompatible.The resolution of the climax is quite powerful. The most effective way to put and end to the existence of something is by totally forgetting its being. Watchers are compelled to sign out as their identities are tracked. However, the flaws are apparent: once the watchers figure out Vee is not killed, they would return to the game. Or maybe the realisation isn't necessary; humans tend to forget very quickly, and get back to the old track easily.",Nerve
128,Fiurilli,Fun along the way,6,13 September 2016,"The movie 'Nerve' is set in a world much like our own. Teenagers are all following the newest craze, a mobile application also called 'Nerve' This application takes the dare aspect of a game like truth- or-dare to a new extreme. People playing the app can earn money by executing dares send by those who are watching, however if they ever fail a dare they'll lose everything. 'Nerve' has us follow a teenage girl called Vee (Emma Roberts) who decides to became a player. She quickly teams up with another player called Ian (Dave Franco) and together they discover the hidden truth about 'Nerve'.The whole idea of a mobile application like Nerve is not the most believable one. Supposedly someone somewhere created the very basics after which it evolved on its own by allowing users to update it by adding in their own code. The movie also has us believe that every little thing Nerve does is completely automated, except for the dares sent by the watchers. While this does seem plausible at first it quickly becomes apparent that in a real world scenario this simply cannot be the case. Often times dares sent by watchers are far too complex and without some micro-managing it is quite frankly impossible that the players were able to interact with one another the way they did. It is also very clear that little to no thought has gone into certain technical details. The hacking scenes are downright laughable especially for people who have a technical background. For these reasons it is extremely important that one completely suspends their disbelief. Despite its ridiculousness at times this actually wasn't that hard since this movie was surprisingly well made.The two directors Henry Roost and Ariel Schulman have done a great job. There is never really a dull moment even at times when in retrospect nothing seemed to have happened. The pacing is almost always on point and pretty much every scene was interesting to watch. Often times this was because of the great chemistry between Emma Roberts and Dave Franco. The way these actors and subsequently their characters interacted was a lot of fun to see and both acting performances were very decent. Not all characters were all that great though and some of them should not have been in the movie as they are of no importance to the overarching story. Most characters were given some form of backstory, but this was mostly presented by means of some very exposition heavy conversations.One of the best parts of this movie though is its great use of lighting. The neon style the directors were aiming for is very well executed and it was even used in a functional manner. Characters that seemed to be enjoying Nerve as a whole were mostly lit by using blue lighting, while on the other hand red lighting was used for characters who were more rebellious towards Nerve. This use of colour was not restricted to just the lighting however. 'Nerve' is filled with visual clues ranging from a mere red exit sign to the colour of a character's hair. Exploring these hints was a lot of fun especially since almost every scene contained quite a few of them.Despite its ridiculous premise 'Nerve' achieves what it sets out to do and is a pretty well-made action movie that's fun along the way.My rating: 6/10",Nerve
129,thesmythley,A parody of reality TV.,4,18 October 2018,"The film is full of social media tropes, complete with a nearly constant club soundtrack to constantly remind the audience how modern, hip and funky the film and it's characters are, presumably in an attempt to conceal the overall blandness of the film.The plot of the film gradually, or perhaps quickly becomes ludicrous to the point where the scenes that are meant to be serious and gripping are actually quite funny. For example, you have the people who are competing in the dark web dares video recording themselves while they are petrified. ""Hey look at me I'm scared and I'm doing a dare that will endanger my life. Still, I should make time for a selfie. *SNAP**SNAP*""There's not really much that the film offers, other than a load of deathly dares and mediocre, stilted drama between uninteresting and generic characters. However, the film picks up very very slightly when all the uninteresting characters finally get around to performing in the thriller portion of the film. Still, there are lots of tedious jump cutting scenes interspersed with the same old funky, hip club music which I think fails to establish any kind of effective pacing and instead makes these scenes more like a music video.",Nerve
130,imrigu,Brilliant concept but no backbone,6,6 July 2020,"The backbone of a film is always the characters, in this film, apart from the two or three lead protagonist, no others were introduced on the scale to connect with. Plot is good, social media attention, showing insecurities between friends, twist at the end is huge. I just kinda fed up of watching good guys hacking into bad guys at the end moment and won boom! What I'm trying to express is that the concept had the potential of taking this movie to the ultimate peak but it's ended too quickly and simply.(plot discussions) If the creators of the game were capable of hacking into everyone's server and mess up with everything, if they were able to have command in such high authority, how can they be dumb at the final moment of the movie?

Harmless and fun at first, but as the game progresses one player might dare you to do the unthinkable and of course the choice would be up to you to accept or decline it. Life was simple then when we had games like this or board games children enjoyed wanting to play. Now in this day and age technology is our newest friend. This and much more are the overall themes behind ""Nerve."" High school senior Venus Delmonico ""Vee"" feels withdrawn and cautious about her choices in life. It doesn't help that she got accepted to go to CalArts but after the unexpected death of her older brother she has become her mother's (Juliette Lewis, offering little to the story) top priority, afraid of her venturing out. Once dared by her best friend Sydney (Emily Meade of ""Money Monster"") to try Nerve: an online reality video game of objective-focused ""truth or dare"" where people either enlist online as ""players"" or pay to watch as ""watchers"". Vee along with fellow player Ian (Dave Franco of ""Now You See Me 2""), are caught into deadly objectives, with their identity taken and victory being the escape. Directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman (""Catfish"") ""Nerve"" paints a picture of the world we live in now, from the film's opening montage showing Vee's daily schedule from ""Spotify to Facebook"", Joost and Schulman raise questions on Privacy concerns, Illegal downloading, Unnecessary apps and more. But sadly that's all it manages to achieve; questions we are ourselves already have answers to or want answers to. Especially during the third act where the hidden agenda is revealed. Screenwriter Jessica Sharzer (""American Horror Story"", adapting from a novel written by Jeanne Ryan) weaves together an interesting story with two likable leads. The chemistry between Roberts and Franco really carry the movie for its runtime, as Roberts fragile and cautious nature sub comes to Franco's alluring and charismatic appeal. Cinematographer Michael Simmonds illuminates the city with vibrant and lush neon lights taking a chapter from ""The Neon Demon"". A scene in particular in which Vee has to help be Ian's eyes as he drives at 60 Mbps blindfolded is frightening and yet beautiful thanks in addition to music by Rob Simonsen. ""Nerve"" might not be the best example of how the technology we use influences our daily lives, but it certainly will entertain with each dare.",Nerve
135,jd-creativeguy,Oscar-winning: No. Highly entertaining: Absolutely!,8,31 December 2016,"I don't understand the negative reviews that comment about the validity of the technology behind the app/game in this movie. IT'S A MOVIE. GET IT?The plot is nothing new. I've seen two movies in the past year alone that had the same exact plot, with basically the same exact outcomes. That being said, the cinematography in this flick is pretty good, the acting is more than decent, the music is good. Pretty much everything about this movie will make you feel like your time investment was worth it.. unless you were hoping to be surprised.

136,kendallschristopher,Thinly veiled social commentary on smartphone addiction,10,21 December 2018,It's all about being bored with reality with this one. A dystopian Y/A just under a different premise. Cinematography and everything was solid but the movie feels like it is as empty and vain as the characters in the film.

138,edgeoflight,All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.,8,11 June 2017,"The plot of the film is arguably simple: A ""truth or dare"" app spreads across a city and mesmerizes its audience--which grows by the day--to finally become a dystopian source of abuses which jeopardizes the lives of the ones who ""dare"".More than a movie it's a social and modern criticism of the behavior that can be induced by social networking challenges but also by the addiction we have to stories that turn sour. This movie sheds light on our own vice as viewers who always want to see more no matter what happens to the ones who make up the stories we watch. Who never found themselves scrolling down the news to skip the ones about happiness and love to go to thrilling stories about murders, accidents or worse? This movie is exactly about that. The more dangerous the challenge, the more view it has. Besides, it's typically the modern media ethos which makes the most of violence to entertain a massive audience that is described in this movie. The violence in this movie is actually overwhelming since at the end we get to see how many people participated in this madness which leads to the shooting challenge. By watching you are an accomplice and this issue often eludes us. It reminds me of a novel in which an old lady gets harassed on the NYC metro but the narrator just sits there and waits for someone else to react. (Bright Light, Big city by McInerney). We are in this society in which we find entertainment spying on one another under the cover of anonymity, and it can hurt.Other than that the photography is quite top notch as the top review argued. the colors, the design, the filming, the lighting. Everything is so city-like and modern, with an engrossing soundtrack to improve the atmosphere. The acting is very good too. The story was pretty believable if you suspend your disbelief for a while because, indeed, many questions will arise. The police does nothing but a kid can hack the system and save everyone... Quite far-fetched. The final challenge was well thought-out. Quite a plot-twist there although the fact that the schoolmates actually voted to kill the girl quite shocked me. That was pretty messed up. But yeah you never know what your neighbor's really like.In the end the movie has a solid plot, a great moral, and gripping cinematography. The rate is too low for me who was pleasantly surprised by this movie which at first just looks like a teen movie, but which is actually a consistent criticism of modern society.",Nerve
139,JustALittleBitRandom,"Tense, Action Packed Thrill Ride",7,18 August 2016,"A teenage girl begins playing a game called Nerve where players are payed to complete life risking dares and are watched by anonymous people known as Watchers.Once again another film this summer that seemed to be mis-sold. The trailers that were released for Nerve made it look like a film that would be hanging on the very edge of lukewarm only by its weak hand. But it actually turned out to be a very tense and entertaining film. As the dares get more life risking for the characters the intensity goes up but so does the entertainment factor. Emma Roberts ,in the lead role of Venus, gives a very good performance and Dave Franco ,who let us not forget gave one of the worst actual attempts at acting ever seen in last years Unfinished Business and wasn't the best in Bad Neighbours 2 but was alright in the chronic disaster that was Now You See Me 2, actually delivers what is a surprisingly decent performance and his character is one that adds to the films twists and turns and intensity. There are many different themes in this film and lots going on but instead of creating one great big, confusing mess it all goes towards making one of those rare film that target a teenage audience but also succeed in entertaining adults just as well. Summer 2016 has once again delivered another surprise. Nerve is a fast paced, entertaining, action packed thrill ride. **** <-- Four Stars (Out Of Five)",Nerve

The idea is great, with the fast camera action, sudden change of scenes that help to keep the rhythm of the narration high and gripping (i was never bored one second).
But mainly what is great in this movie is the message itself that brings in: who really give powers to the social networks? And to the most creepy ones part of the deep web which can endanger our lives? Who is the main responsible, in the end? But of course. Oursevelves as users and us public.
The end of the movie gives a good message: we can still act on time if we are able to understand the subtle line that distinguish ""fun"" with ""fall into a unhealthy trap"" that those online social games put: maybe the key is to be able to act on time. We simply have to learn how to ""handle with care"" social network and online interactive games.

147,rosaliesummers,Apparently teens will risk anything to get famous,6,20 May 2017,"So the concept is this: a new website/app arrives, called Nerve. There are two options, to be a player or a watcher. Players get given dates by the watches and receive money for completing dates. The watchers have to pay to watch and are basically all crazy cult like about this game. People either 'fail or bail' and eventually the game will go down to two people.I actually thought this was quite a good idea. Is it really so unbelievable that a website like this wouldn't pop up, knowing the risks people will take for money and fame? The first hour of the film was good, but then you find out about the secret third mode 'prisoner' and it all becomes ridiculous after that. It is absolutely unbelievable that the police would not find out about the game or just simply not care about it. The cult following of Nerve is also dumb af, who would want someone to die over a game? It doesn't even look majorly exciting to watch to be honest, not exciting enough to have such a weird obsessed fandom anyway. We never find out anything about the people who create Nerve either. I get that our cute little team of hackers took down all the servers at the end, but I don't see why the creators couldn't just simply start it again. Also where did the big stadium come from in the showdown? Like I said, it is impossible that no authorities know about this! It's also crazy that after their big fight, Sydney forgives Viv in a heartbeat, when she seemed like such a cow earlier, but hey.The cast was pretty good, Dave Franco and Miles Heizer are great as usual. The soundtrack was obviously aimed at 'edgy teens', what with the likes of Halsey and Melanie Martinez. Overall I like the techie vibe to it.In conclusion, after the first hour all the plot holes become glaringly obvious and it gets stupid, but up until that point it's enjoyable. Aside from that there's nothing really that lets it down, so a decent film for us crazy millennials I guess.",Nerve
148,woodcoinmagazine,Teen flick with scruples,6,31 July 2017,"Female-driven film about high-schoolers taking dares for money via the darkweb. The soundtrack is sickeningly girlie, yet the beats are there along with the colors. Beautifully shot and capably acted adolescent film about selling out and getting in too deep irrespective of morals and self- worth. How much money would you accept to deny your own tenet? Angst incoporated. At times, the script feels like a prognostication of the future. Yet an emphasis on young women finding a man sends the plot into bubble-gum territory. The novel adaptation by Jessica Sharzer is stellar, and the result on screen resembles an artform. Yet it remains a child's story, albeit heartwrenching and slick, embracing Gothic principles to the point of distrust in society. The cornball finale is nonetheless on-point.

151,sfgebel315,"""Nerve""-Where Phone Batteries Never Die",7,6 October 2016,"""Nerve"" is where a high school senior who never crosses the line, Vee (Emma Roberts), succumbs to peer pressure–instigated by her best friend, Sydney (Emily Meade) and chooses to be a ""player"" rather than a ""watcher"" in this online interactive game, Nerve. In the game players are dared for cash, and the last two players standing battle it out for the jackpot. The watchers decide the dares, and a player either accepts or fails the game and loses all the money they've made.I'm not saying this is an earth-shattering film, but I did find it entertaining and host to a very important message–no matter how obvious it is. Be careful what you post on social media, be careful what you do on the internet, and remember to look up from your screens and actually live life.Though most of the dares are unrealistic and downright insane, it was action-packed and thrilling to watch. I'd give it a solid score since it didn't knock my socks off, but it didn't disappoint either.Sadly, my biggest issue is that I could not understand how no one's phone battery died. You have to keep the game open and are contiguously videotaping/taking pictures to prove the dare is met; therefore, how does Vee or Ian's (Dave Franco) phone never die?I know, I have a strange thought-process. Being as I have an Instagram (though I've never used it), Twitter, Facebook, a blog, and a smartphone by which I access all of theseand yet, I feel we overindulge in social media–go ahead, call me a hypocrite.I applaud the movie for being an entertaining criticism. Sadly, I worry too many people got caught up in the actors or the interactive online dare game to really pay attention, even if the ending attempts to spell it out.",Nerve

The game that gives the movie its title is insane, and the most shocking thing about it all is that it's fiction. The movie is very exciting, fast-paced, and even cute and romantic at times. Emma Roberts and Dave Franco are charming and do a nice job as the protagonists. The art direction is pretty fabulous, making it all just slightly futuristic (you can trade numbers on each others' phones by making the devices touch!) and colourful in ways that reminded me of another exaggerated-reality franchise, ""The Purge"". I also very much enjoyed the ideas of class struggle, where some pay to watch and others are paid to risk their lives - again, very close to reality, but a little exaggerated. Overall, I had a great time watching ""Nerve"", and I admit I consciously avoided overthinking some plot points because sometimes you are on the roller-coaster for the thrill of it and not for some deeper purpose.",Nerve
153,gaxiola_fk,Nerve - Review,7,20 September 2016,"Nerve - Review Year: 2016 Directors: Henry Joost and Ariel SchulmanNerve is a movie I expected pure entertainment and was exactly what I found. We have the actuation of Emma Roberts and Dave Franco as main characters, we see the development of a piece of youth limitless and access to a game, technically an app, that make you earn money if you overcome the stepped dares. Our main character, Vee, is a little shy person that under her friend's pressure and a heartbreak decides to start overcoming the watcher's dares, however, she meets Ian in her first dare, the watchers like the couple, both start to make dares together and that's where the plot starts. The dares increase the risk so high that now are out of control and Vee's friend that suggested her the game, Sydney, is in a bad mood by the fact that her retracted friend has gained more visits than her. The development is quite good and entertaining, the movie quickly introduces you to the plot without much explanation. Generally is a movie oriented to the youth however the environment in which it develops could be considered illogical. To begin, the police, where the hell is the police?, all the players go around doing illegal and stupid dares and the officers are a kind of accomplice. Knowing the speed at which the authorities move nowadays, is not possible that they are not aware of the existence of a game that's causing deaths or dangers, there are videos and a precedent in Seattle of this event, they should be investigating and being they who stop the system and not a group of street hackers. I didn't expect that they alone got rid of the entire game with a half-formulated plan. And finally couples get together, Vee with Ian, of course, and good Tommy, comforts himself with the semi prostitute dressed friend, Sydney.A film with good actions and development, real persons that in some way take the risks of their lives for money and a world of anonymous people that only want to see blood and keep their hands clean.",Nerve
154,tempestnyx,Worth the Watch | Review of 'Nerve',7,23 September 2016,"Are you a player or a watcher? Nerve, based on the novel of the same name, is based heavily on the extreme's some people take to be YouTube famous. But the film takes it to another level taking the control out of the daredevil and putting it in the hands of watchers, people who control the player and the game, giving them reckless dares that could cost them their lives. For Vee (played by Emma Roberts), becoming a player on Nerve is all about trying to prove herself, that she isn't just the meek shy girl everyone thinks she is. Thrust into this game of do or die, she meets the handsome Ian (played by Dave Franco), another player in the Game who knows more than he is telling her.In a high stakes game, the film brings it to life with a high-tension film that really draws the audience into the film. The dares start out small, but then as they begin to escalate, the audience is pushed to the edge of their seats. A riveting film doesn't stray too far from reality leading to some more outside tension adding to the movie, elevating it from any other typical movie about teenagers. There is a danger in the film that feels very real and that's because it is. With social media on the rise, this sort of control over people can easily happen if people aren't careful.Of course the film takes things to an extreme, as most films with due to add more drama and tension to the film, but there is nothing wrong with that because it still adds to the air of believability. Not to mention that the actors really got to understand their characters and the story well enough to keep the believability within the film. It's not outlandish, and the acting holds together throughout the entire film which is good. There are some parts that are extreme and outlandish but it doesn't detract from the overall aesthetic of the film.Moreover, the style of the film was creative and brought out the internet into the film without taking the viewer out of the film. It moved with the film and allowed for the freedom of camera movement without hindering it. The audience was able to see more of what was going on through the stylistic direction of the film.Over all it was a decent film, very well made, the only flaw lies with the overly dramatic scenes involving the hackers which would only offend those who know how to actually hack. But again, that was done to keep up the ever increasing pace of the film. At the end of the day, it was full of tension, character development, and decent drama making it worth the watch.",Nerve
155,dan-willi84,A Crazy and Dangerous 92 minute crime thriller.,10,1 January 2017,"Nerve is a real classic. A really good film with a good premise. In Nerve, Emma Roberts stars as a young woman whom is in talked by her snobbish best friend (Emily Meade) into playing an online truth and dare game, which players are dared into pulling crazy and dangerous stunts, which they win prize money. But, she soon finds her life in danger when she crosses paths with a another player (Dave Franco) and soon learns the terrible truth behind the game and she becomes manipulated by the people behind it and the challenges and the stunts become more and more dangerous. The film reminded me of Crank starring Jason Statham and it reminded me of the Stephen King novel The Running Man. Some of the stuff the main characters do in the film were downright Ludicrous and dangerous. It was one of those films which keeps you guessing about what is going happen next. Emma Roberts gives an outstanding performance and Emma Roberts and Dave Franco have good on-screen chemistry. The editing and the pacing is sensational. The film had good visual effects and the soundtrack is superb. The film has a good message and it teaches us about the dangers of online gaming and social media. All in all, Nerve is a really good film, if you enjoyed films such as Crank, Saw, Run Lola Run, Gamer, The Game and Turkey Shoot, than I highly recommend Nerve.",Nerve
156,Alex-Siddhi,'Are You a Watcher or a Player?',8,8 October 2016,"A Neo thriller with whiplash pacing and whiplash genre decorated in pretty lights, this film is colourful, gripping and unpredictable. It shines light on the true nature of social media and the power of it also.From the start we are introduced to Vee (Emma Roberts) who appears to be an introverted shy character who doesn't 'take risks'. She is peer-pressured by the circle of her college 'friends' who are of a more wild nature which eventually leads to her dipping into the viral online game 'Nerve'. An online system that is built on watcher paying to watch players who are playing to win. From being led to believe she isn't a risk taker she decides to play after given the choice to play or watch. She finds herself being sucked into this game which starts of fun and exciting with adrenaline filled dares, meeting fellow daring people and ultimately fans of her work. After we have felt the excitement of this hypothesis, the movie takes a whiplash turn and we dip into the true uncovered reality of this game which is more sadistic and cruel. We see what it is capable of making young people do and what people are capable of making other people do. We no longer feel any safety and fear for the lives of the people in the game. This is the irony of peer pressure and networking because the games and jokes that are taken too far always started out as a bit of fun.What I truly like about this concept is that is shows us that a large group of an underground movement or any movement for that matter is capable of perishing our moral code, able to change us, make us competitive and humiliate. But the watchers are safe, on the other side wearing anonymity like sheep wool.The effects of this movie are great, it is very vibrantly colourful, which makes the majority of the movie pretty to look at, which goes well with the film's theme because it looks quite superficial in its colour grading, and the effects are quite subtle with the texting and the bright buttons appearing on the screen to symbolise what we can see, which is what others are experiencing.With twists, turns, mysteries throughout and a heart racingly blind- folded pace and plot I really enjoyed this experimental unique modern thriller, and I give it a 8 out of 10.",Nerve

Every single cast member delivers a solid performance in this film and does justice to their characters - which were consistent and believable.Though his role is more of a side character than leading character, Miles Heizer does an outstanding job with his performance. Talented actors will shine whether they are in the spotlight or not and Heizer definitely shines in this film. He really gives himself over to the character and captures a lot of nuance for an unknown actor.This film delivers an excellent social commentary about social media and the youth today. Not only does this show in the overall plot, but the film is also rich with symbolism and subtle references.*Review: Spoiler Alert!*The symbolism and negative foreshadowing in regards to the Nerve game was executed brilliantly!There were a lot of allusions to other great films, such as Snowden, The Game, Network and Lord of the Flies.The symbolism wasn't reserved to the game though. Sydney, the adrenaline-junkie and first Nerve ""player"" we see in the film, had the words ""Teenage Dirtbag"" on her phone. Just like the game, Sydney had no boundaries and cared more about what she wanted than her friends (or in terms of the game, the players). She never once took responsibility for her own actions - even by the end. She embodied the worst of the modern, social media-obsessed teenagers.The ""cat fight"" scene between Venus and Sydney being purely verbal and not physical was very sensational and compelling. It really showed how much power words of truth can have over violence, especially between females. This was a fantastic modernized version of the cliché cat fight - especially with the line, ""You're one of those girls that peaks in high school""! (In my opinion, this was far more entertaining than the cliché physical cat fight.)The film also does a good job setting up Venus' situation in the beginning and how easily children can become victims of single mothers. While her mother has no malicious intent, Venus still has the burden that most children of single mothers have when they reach adulthood: when the single mom wants the child-now-adult to make sacrifices for the ""family"", rather than the other way around. As expected, Juliette Lewis does her usually excellent job at playing the bad mom - trying to force her fantasy about the situation on her daughter, by saying she'll be her ""college roommate"". (Yikes!)When Venus meets ""Ian"" and he is holding her favorite book, it was brilliant the way she immediately apologized after offering such an intellectual discussion about it. This was very symbolic of how many in the social media generation prefer superficiality to substance and how she felt the need to apologize for saying something smart and stimulating - something previous generations didn't experience as they weren't so anti-intellectual.There was also some allusions to the ""power of anonymity"", which were also executed brilliantly: *Since Venus and Ian didn't know their phones were recording their conversation, it allowed the unfiltered truth to come out (about Sydney having a ""revolving door of guys"" and how Venus thought ""it's sad, really"" because she's the one who's really ""insecure"". *By the finals round, the ""Watchers"" were wearing masks and bandanas to cover their identity - very similar to the modern emotional fascists aka ANTIFA. *Venus' speech exposed the ""watchers"" as being responsible in their own ways for participating, despite the fact that they wore these masks to make them brave and feel like they weren't responsible.This movie did indulge in some classic Hollywood liberties (though it did provide some balance when showing all of the ""fails"" which outnumbered the successes shown).Juliette Lewis' quote near the end, ""you guys are the dumbest, smartest kids I ever met"" was a great statement about the youth today. In some ways, they are very smart and have a ton of knowledge and education at the tip of their fingertips, which gives them a lot of potential; On the other hand, they make a lot of bad decisions and too often act impulsively, self-centeredly and carelessly (not thinking of potential long-term outcomes).*End of Spoiler Alert!*This film had a surprising amount of witty quips that were very funny and always delivered perfectly.The movie's lowest point is honestly it's soundtrack. Yikes! Most of the music was pretty awful and corny in the worst way. That being said, I do think there was a point to it, as the music was obviously lacking in artistic feel and talent; just like Millennials and younger so far have been lacking in artistic feel and talent (as a Generation compared to previous ones). With all of the other symbolism and allusions going on in this film, I don't think it's far-fetched to think the music was decided on, along the same lines.Overall this film was a phenomenal social commentary on the social media generation. A surprisingly thought-provoking teen film with compelling performances.",Nerve

I can't imagine anyone over 12 years old even relating to a half-baked story like this. And when will the youngest generation rebel at being portrayed as self-centered, arrogant ignoramuses in movies? Unless it really is true that every teen wants to become famous by doing incredibly stupid things and then broadcasting it to the rest of the world. Wall-E was far more prophetic (and vastly more enjoyable). And does anyone else find Emma Roberts' constant whining in everything she is in annoying? Watch The Net for a much more relatable cautionary tale.

I liked this movie's concept...it's fun and engaging. The actors did a good job with it for what it was. It's not an Oscar worthy movie by any means, but if you're bored and you're looking for something to mindlessly entertain you for a few hours this will do the trick. A little far fetched at times with regards to the antagonist(s)...but it's a good source of mindless entertainment. I've read people say it tries to actually get into serious themes...if that's the case I missed the memo cause I didn't really see any serious themes other than the availability of information over the internet... I'd sort of go the other way with this and say it doesn't really take itself too seriously...which I think is a good thing. I do feel like the ending was a little meh and a little bit of a letdown...but I can't think of a better way to end it off the top of my head so I really shouldn't complain. This was an OK movie with a really good premise for nerds like me.",Nerve
162,seanevanmackey,unique-ish film,7,31 December 2016,"Nerve is a unique-ish film and sets a kind of futuristic tone for the viewers by creating a world in which the world is crazy for a game every teen is playing,this game is called nerve and the premise behind the game is that you can be one of two categories, a player or a watcher,this game creates a world in which people(the watcher)have to dare the players to do certain things for their entertainment,personally i found this premise interesting and quite intrigued to find out what they would do with the idea.Plot This aspect of the movie is abit hit or miss for my type of watching experience and overall analyze of the movie itself,the positives of the plot in my personal opinion is that the concept and idea of this game is quite unique and shows how the popularity of this game can cause people(the players)to do things that can ruin their life or even kill them,this idea i really wanted the film to explore and it ultimately does explore some aspects of the game but explains the more damaging side to the game and not the extent that this game can reach in terms of why everyone loves and is obsessed with this game,saying that the overall concept and what they did with the idea of this game existing gave me an idea of how this world works and found that the film gave enough substance to show that this game is massive in this world.The negatives i have with the plot is that it feels abit bland and uninspired in terms of the rules of this game as a whole,the film explains itself in a way that raises more questions then answers,throughout the movie i kept thinking of the likes of hunger games and the maze runner because of its lack of uniqueness and ultimately distracted me from the movie making me think of other movies.Characters the characters are somewhat complex and react to the events happening to them throughout the film,the main character venus(known as vee to other characters)played by Emma Roberts is the most complex character in this movie and shows the effects firsthand that the game has on people that are players,this gives the story a unique-ish feel and expresses the effects that this game has on peoples lives(this aspect is shown through the character of Ian),vee is shown to be a character with very little confidence and hangs around with people who play nerve and are more confident then she is,the character of vee is very relatable and sympathetic.The character of Ian(a more experienced player and partner of vee)is a character that the viewers are introduced to that expresses the experience he has in this game and also shows the effects of this game and the damage that's caused,personally i did not find Ian an interesting character and overall did not effect the experience for me,saying that the relationship between vee and Ian was a very interesting part of the movie and expands and develops the relationship and makes it more organic.Overall the movie was a very unique-ish experience for me and offered a very unique and expansive lore to the world and very interesting concept of this game. 7 out of 10",Nerve

(Would'nt be a player either for that case.) It reminded me of the series Black Mirror, which shows the dark side of life and technology... how technology can dehumanize humans.

164,maurovicmarin,Better ending next time please!,8,8 October 2016,"I have to say Nerve is one of the best adrenaline movies I've watched the last couple of years. It has a fast pace but still gives us enough time to enjoy the characters. The actor choice was great,bot Emma and Dave gave us that realistic feeling of the movie and a perfect fit for the main role characters.The side ones were not that great but it didn't affect me that much. The dares are all really exciting and unpredictable, I loved that they combined professional filming with the amateur and realistic one (for the dares). The plot is so amazing that when I was re-telling the story to my friends it took them some time to realize i was talking about a movie and not real life situations.The idea is somewhat innovative and well-timed (since today's world is focused on the internet). It has a moral, but that last part was a bit sloppy which made me give a worse rating than it could have been, it was at parts pretty unrealistic and pathetic. It bothers me that some things in the movie are not explained at all and makes it a bit senseless, but it still reached my expectations and made it really enjoyable to watch.To sum it up: big plus to the main actors and the plot itself, but the big downside is they way the movie ends, could have been much better. I would recommend it to anyone who love adrenaline-action movies that reflects on real life situation too ( even if it is not based on a true event ).Solid feedback overall.",Nerve
165,kevinlemenager,Are You a Watcher or a Player?,7,17 January 2017,"Nerve is the kind of movie that hooked me from the start. I was curious when I first saw the trailer on You Tube. Even though the trailer sort of give away a lot. I was intrigued by the premise of an online truth or dare style game (minus the truth). It was one of those rare times where I went to see a movie by myself. Normally I see movies with my brother or entire family. This was an exception because I was the only one who had any interest. One of my secret obsessions is prank videos, so this was the movie for me. Is it a good movie, it depends on your point of view. I loved the concept for the movie. One of the best things about the movie is its color palette. The movie is filled with stellar neon pinks, greens, and blues. Another positive is the chemistry between Emma Roberts and Dave Franco. As well as the teen humor and building tension near the end. So I loved the movie. Watch the movie and judge for yourself. Do you accept the challenge?",Nerve
166,simranaujla,Amazing soundtrack,8,19 January 2018,The best bit of the movie is the middle - the part where they're actually playing the game.

The actors do a good job and the final task was kind of unexpected but at the same time predictable however I think they should have had the nerve to let Vee die after being shot as it would have shown a consequence to the game instead of everyone just kind of forgetting it was a thing.

This is literally the best movie I have seen in a while. It beats anything else out there for sure. Dave Franco and Emma Roberts are amazing. I'm not gonna ruin it for you, but basically they are playing this game and the thing about this game is that it is just really fun. You just got to see it, this movie is soo amazing OMG!! But on the flip side, if you are a grandma or a baby boomer, you are not gonna like this movie, and that is understandable. This movie is much better than the ratings suggest because the baby boomers have rated it down. But don't be tricked, this really is a great movie",Nerve
171,PopSpective_net,Nerve is an intense thrill,9,19 August 2016,"Are you a Watcher or a Player? My wife and I had a chance to see a pre-release screening of Nerve at the Alamo Drafthouse, followed by a live-streamed Q&A with Dave Franco.The premise of the movie revolves around an online game called Nerve. The game website describes it like Truth or Darewithout the truth. I would say it's more like Fear Factor and Amazing Race, combined with Periscope live streaming and a splash of 4Chan. Basically, you can join the game as either a ""Watcher"" or a ""Player"". The Watchers pay money and propose dares for the Players. The Players have to complete the assigned dares in order to win the money. Simple enough.As we have witnessed with things like Taylor Hicks winning American Idol, or ""Boaty McBoatface"" winning an online contest to name a polar research ship—the anonymous masses on the Internet have a sadistic sense of humor when given enough latitude. You can just imagine what sorts of dares you might be challenged with if you opened it up for the whole Internet to crowdsource a dare for you.Nerve was pretty awesome. I don't get off in the weeds much about cinematography, lighting, or other things like that. I base my reviews and recommendations on one thing and one thing only—""Was I entertained, and do I feel like the movie was a worth my time and money."" With Nerve, the answer is an emphatic ""Yes"".Granted, the movie isn't without its plot holes, and events that defy belief. Suffice it to say that I don't feel like those things take away from the experience of the movie. I mean—it's fiction. The story and events are almost supposed to defy belief by definition. I still highly recommend that you go see Nerve. If you want to talk about issues with the plot after you've seen it, drop me an email and we can have that conversation.The live-streamed Q&A after the movie was pretty cool, too. Dave Franco seems to be very likable and funny, but also a bit quiet—possibly even shy. He definitely portrayed his personal life as something that is both a tad boring and mundane compared to what you might imagine for a Hollywood star, as well as private. Ironically, given the premise of the movie, Franco says he essentially does not engage online or in social networks.It was interesting to listen to Franco talk about making the movie and some of the things that challenged him. I don't want to give anything away, but you can see in the trailer that Franco's character rides a motorcycle. Franco said he did not previously know how to ride one, so the directors gave him a motorcycle and a couple weeks to learn before letting him loose on the streets of New York and trusting him to drive co-star Emma Roberts around.Someone also asked whether or not there is any concern that someone will now try to create a similar game in real life. Franco described the movie as being ""five minutes into the future""—meaning that it's feasible something like Nerve could exist. Again—we already have shows like Big Brother and Fear Factor, and people live streaming their own exploits and adventures on Periscope, Facebook, YouTube and more. It's not a huge stretch to imagine tying all of those things together into some sort of crowdsourced daredevil online game.Franco replied, ""I hope that more good comes from this than bad—like I really hope a game like this never exists,"" adding, ""But, if it does—don't blame us."" I like to think I'd be a Player. After watching the movie, though, I may think twice about that and just kick back and watch some more crazy YouTube videos.",Nerve
172,jayfemsantana,Nerve,10,29 July 2016,"I loved this movie, I thought it was one of those bad ass romantic films ( not to say that I am a hopeless romantic myself ) It was a fast pace film that kept my adrenaline moving. The more I understood the plot story the more excitement would travel through my throughts. Like when Dory foundher parents, it gave me that excitement of thrill. Its an obsessive technology teen movie with a hint of a novel. One of the main reasons I also watched it was because Dave Franco was the main character. I feel like they could have not chosen a better actor then himself to play this role, he fits in the perfect category of that ""Bad boy"" who risk everything in life.",Nerve
173,ken-35957,"Singing another's song can be fun, but the fame it brings is temporary",9,4 September 2016,"Like old-time story tellers, Nerve film makers want to share messages (morals) with movie goers. They spent $20,000,000 to do it. What were those messages?Message #1: Be real or live a compromised life Venus > ""Vee"" Delmonico (Emma Roberts) mother Nancy (Juliette Lewis) desperately wants Vee to stay with her which means Vee cannot attend Arts School, but Vee doesn't make this truth known in an effort to please her mother. The Moral: If you are not willing to let your truth be known, you will lead a compromised life.Message #2: Find out if they like you too > Vee is secretly in love with J.P. (Brian Marc). Later in the film, J.P. reveals that Vee is ""not his type"". Morale: If you are in love, find out if it is mutual or not. If not, move on. If it is, develop.Message #3: When someone dies, love them by living > Vee's brother tragically died a few years earlier. Vee's mother has left his room as a shrine. Grief is a crippling emotion and holding onto the pain is a way many people honor those who have passed. Moral: People who love us would not want to see us pain and they would want us to progress with our lives (when the time is right).Message #4: Fame is temporary > Sydney (Emily Meade) completes a dare at school and gains temporary fame. Moral: Action for external reward (fame) brings temporary feelings. Doing what you love just to be you brings lasting satisfactionMessage #5: What we know attracts us > Ian (Dave Franco) is a diner reading Vee's favorite book, Virginia Woolf's ""To The Lighthouse"". Vee has to pick someone to kiss for 5 seconds, and she is drawn to Ian because of the book. Moral: The familiar is safe and a powerful magnet for our attention. Message #6: No benefit without a cost > Vee kisses Ian (a stranger) for 5 seconds and gets the biggest rush of her life in the process, as well as $100. Moral: The benefit of excitement often comes at an unknown cost. There is always balance in life.Message #7: Don't overpower or dis-empower others > Tommy (Miles Heizer) who drove Vee to the diner where she kissed Ian is secretly in love with Vee. Tommy gets jealous when Ian wants Vee to go with him on another dare. Vee initially doesn't want to do it but agrees to go because Tommy took away her choice ""Vee doesn't want to go"". Moral: Telling a person to ""not walk on the grass"" maybe the fastest way to get that grass trampled underfoot.Message #8: Looking good is transformative > Vee has a dare to try on a very expensive couture dress. She does so and she looks amazing. The clothes transform her. Moral: Changing how you dress transforms how others view you.Message #9: Do it for internal not external reasons > Syd is playing Nerve to gain fame and stardom (external reasons). Vee is doing it for internal reasons (she wants to break away from compromised life). Syd sees Vee gaining in popularity and gets concerned then jealous. When Vee exceeds Syd's status, Syd melts down. Moral: Do it for internal reasons and whatever your outcome you keep the rewards.Message #10: From excited volunteer to compliant prisoner > Nerve is a simple game. Do increasingly dangerous things for double the money each time. If you lose, you lose everything. What starts as an exciting dare quickly turns into compliance then imprisonment. In many ways gambling follows the same course - start small, win a little, bet bigger, win bigger, until you lose (your relationship, your home, your job, etc). Drugs follows a similar line. Moral: Things that start small but grow quickly are very hard to control, for anyone. If something feels wrong, it probably is.Message #11: Anonymous crowds want blood. Identified people want out. > A conceptually powerful scene where watchers vote on if Vee should die (be shot) to create a winner. The majority wants Vee to be shot dead by Ty (Machine Gun Kelly). Ty shoots Vee to become the winner of Nerve. Vee's friend Tommy has been busy hacking Nerve's network and turns on the identities of all anonymous users leaving them a message ""You are an accessory to murder. Quit Nerve?"" Now exposed, the now identified watchers turn off Nerve en-mass. Moral: Personally accountable people are mindful of their actions. Anonymous people are happy to see others suffer. Cyber- bullying, flame wars and a large number of online behaviors are explained by this idea. Message #12: Only one life, live it authentically > Vee starts living the life she wants by accepting her study placement. It shows her and her friends happy and progressing with their lives too. Moral: The time we have in this world is short, use it to create the meaning you wish - but do it for you own internal reasons (not fame, etc) if you want to be satisfied/happy with the life you create.There are many more messages in Nerve, I hope you have found these of interest. Take care and I look forward to sharing more in my next review.Ken Standfield is an avid film watcher having watched tens of thousands of films over many decades. He seeks to find meaning and morals in films rather than analyze plot lines.

Instead it portrays to kids on how to be cool and popular these days on and off social platforms and sending a disturbing message with a sinister twist...what a lot of crap.

Thats not so good for a man wanting to become a critic, but for this one its true. I doubt even the writers realize what they actually create!This movie represents every single no- life gamer out there. And i say no- life because that is a real thing. 20+ 30+ even 40+ years old without family, not only husband/wife, but parents too if they live in different city/country in rental homes. No friends, just nothing. No- life means your ""friends"" is the computer and the strangers and i will caps here- STRANGERS that you play with. In the movie Vee had a few friends, but the writers made it as clear as possible that she is a wallflower. No-lifer gamer doesn't have time to eat (and i mean it !!!), sometimes he doesn't have time to sleep even! And the worse thing is that the no- lifer thinks this is actually a good thing- to play for 20 hours and to sleep for 4. And that in most cases is life threatening, exactly like in the movie. Every single no- lifer, that realize what really happened to him will recognize himself in that movie. The sad thing is that in most cases there is no ""happy end"" for them. I know all this because i was/am? a no- lifer and i hate it!Emma Roberts, brilliant! Her act was perfect. The worst act winning prize goes to Machine Gun Kelly.

183,andrewbalboni,Meh,7,31 July 2016,Nerve stars Emma Roberts and Dave Franco as two people who play a game nerve. The game is truth or dare minus the truth. Emma Roberts is some one who doesn't take risks and then she gets pushed into playing the game. She then teams up with Dave Franco. Is it good? It was better than expected. It is full of colors and shot beautifully. The actors are decent and the plot is interesting. The problem I had with the movie was how predictable it was. You see it coming a mile away. I really did not like the soundtrack at all. But this movie is very enjoyable. It seems like the hunger games on the internet.

Emma Roberts was as bad as always (in my opinion) and Dave Franco was fine. The idea they came up with was awesome and it had the potential of going in many directions. They decide it is best to go the route that we as a people are the villains and let social media run us or whatever the hell they were trying to put across. The opening of this film is fast paced and well done. The second act makes sense, the characters are believable and Nerve itself is something that could actually happen. I mean I would play Nerve 100% but for a film I think they were going too relatable and tried for a film to make you think about yourselves and how you are basically this nerve game because it essentially is a metaphor for us and you choose if you are a watcher or a player and then you as ""watchers"" influence or pressure the ""players"" to do things. This could have been one of my favorite thrillers and in my top 3 films of all time but it was so poorly executed and turned out to be a run of the mill unoriginal film in the end.

192,GeneralOfBerlin,"Unexpectedly amazing movie, simply a masterpiece.",10,8 February 2017,"This movie was extremely fun to watch. It may be partly due to the fact I immediately fall in love with everything Emma Roberts stars in, but don't blame me for this. She is an amazing actress after all (and not only because she is unbelievably beautiful), I wish she got more roles like this one. Because of my appreciation towards her, I didn't set too high expectations for the movie itself, I just wanted to see her acting and enjoy it. However, what I got was an unbelievably entertaining movie, which I would have definitely enjoyed even if she wasn't cast for the main role. Great acting, good story, one of the best films in years. It made me think and still kept me entertained.Let's start with the acting. It was perfect all the way. I could start analyzing all the characters one by one, but it is not necessary. Emma Roberts is just brilliant in the role of Vee (an introverted high-school photographer, who joins a dangerous game in hope of some fortunate outcomes), Dave Franco also delivered his role like it had to be delivered, and the supporting cast was also okay. Enough said.The plot actually gives us what it promised (if not more), and it is quite rare these days. We get a coherent story, believable motivations, detailed and developing relationships of characters, interesting background and a maybe expected, but still a bit twisted outcome. When I first read about the plot, I didn't really believe I would actually get what I expected. The various dares were especially interesting, way better than most movies would have done them. Riding a motorbike blindfold? How awesome is that? This film could have gone wrong in so many ways, and yet it was just perfect. The photography also stands out, one of the most beautifully photographed films in ages, the colors, the shades, the places all contribute a lot to the atmosphere. And the music also fits. Well done, good job. Masterpiece. Haven't seen such an outstanding movie in a while, and if all the action, drama, thrill and even some fun in the movie weren't enough, it even has its own moral, which is worth thinking about.This movie again confirmed that Emma Roberts is one of the most talented, brilliant and unfortunately quite underrated actresses out there, and it also gave back my faith, that Hollywood may still be able to produce some entertaining stuff. Wish I could see more like this. Perfect movie, definitely recommended for anyone, 10/10.",Nerve

In my opinion Tommy should have ended up being the creator of the game. And after all this dangerous dares no one turns up dead?!I thought that Sydney is going to join Machine Gun and make a great team against the love birds. It would make this movie a little bit more interesting. And the sad story with her brother did not help it making it more exiting either.However it shows pretty much how internet can affect your life and how sad it is that today's kids would do anything for fame and followers on social media websites.

The only downhill of this film is how the present the ""internet"" in a very edgy way. I totally recommend this film if you're looking for a fun and excited movies.",Nerve
196,j_ring_x,A pleasant suprise,8,20 November 2019,"I quite enjoyed the visuals style and cinematography, it was suspenseful but not to graphic. It's nice to watch a movie sometimes that isnt jam packed with violence

197,josephyeh,May be fun but far from a masterpiece,5,6 August 2016,"Emma Roberts and Dave Franco played two strangers that teamed up to play a game of truth or dare minus the truth by traveling all over the city doing crazy things. It is an original idea set in the 21st century by having the theme as technology.It was a fun ride and there were some parts where I did felt tense or excited. But overall I think that there is a lot of substance missing from what makes this a good movie. They overdid the technology theme by showing way too much scenes being viewed from the phone. I really feel that they can tame it down. The directing is not the strongest either and the dialogue sounded pretty silly. Franco and Roberts was decent in the movie but I really wanted a stronger chemistry between. On top of all that I really wish the ending would be stronger but instead it just fell flat and gave you the exclamation of ""THAT'S IT!"". So in other words its just a fun movie made for teenagers that doesn't have any Oscar materials but may still be worth a watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon with the entire family. Entertaining? HECK YES! Quality movie? No Way!",Nerve
198,menghuikrista,It was okay...,5,10 August 2016,"The characters are walking stereotypes. We have your shy and timid protagonist played by Emma Roberts, the hot guy who Emma Roberts will inevitably fall for,the cool- girl-who-is- actually-insecure and the computer geek. And the characters are really shallow. I found many of the motivations for their actions pretty stupid and shallow.I sometimes wonder why Hollywood cannot think of any other teenage character traits. It ,sure, is getting boring using the same formula over and over again.But, I am not saying that Nerve was entirely bad. The movie is actually much better than what the trailers make it out to be.Despite the fact that the movie has plenty of plot-holes and an over-the-top ending that gets a pretty easy resolution, the movie was fun to watch. It is the kind of movie that you can only enjoy by turning your brain off.The soundtrack is pretty cool at some points. A particular scene involving Emily Meades and a ladder was intense and had me at the edge of my seat. Unfortunately, that was one of the only really intense scenes of the movie. The chemistry between Emma Roberts and Dave Franco is fine.Overall, it was an average teen movie.",Nerve
199,hmuse57,Better Than Expected,7,29 July 2019,"After watching the trailer, I found the premise of the movie to be interesting, but I was afraid that most of the movie had been spoiled by the trailer. I liken this to Black Mirror because it is a story that shows how social media can spiral out of control and create something very dangerous and unsettling. The ending had a nice unexpected twist which I enjoyed. I loved the cinematography of the film with the bright neon colors, because it was a nice juxtaposition to a somewhat thematically dark movie.",Nerve

I was right to assume,there are few bits that are good but most parts are slow and doesn't make sense in a way that it's very uncharacteristic by the protagonist. The trailer of the movie gave it away too. Emma Roberts and Dave Franco don't have any chemistry at all. There are some kissing scenes when you can see that he squirmed or pulled away a bit.",Nerve
202,metodiev-mi,Really good movie,9,20 August 2016,"I really like the fact that the main character evolves over the course of the movie. First, she is shy and not taking any risks. By the end she is addressing big crowds and taking life-changing risks. The movie teaches us that everybody needs a little push to unlock their true self, and although this push shouldn't be as extreme as in ""Nerve"", it is what friends are fore to give us the push to start living our lives!Surely if you've reading this you've also read tons of other posts on the screenplay, so I'll just say that it's fine. The actors play quite well too, but it is the message I outline above that I took from the movie and why I'm giving it such an unusually high rating :)",Nerve
203,davidsalmon,Vine and Pokemon Go had a baby (and the Kardashians are the Godparents,4,26 August 2016,"I struggled staying until the end of that movie, probably because I am not within the right demographic,so I'd say, if you are shaving already, this movie is probably not for you! (But if you are not shaving yet I am not sure I would like you to see that movie) I usually enjoy college silly movies or even some high school centered movies, but this was too much for me. Only good reason to see this movie might be for a drinking game: take a shot every time they say ""OMG!"" This movie is surfing big time the Pokémon Go wave, it is an ode to so many things that as an adult,are bothering me: the social media addiction(Vine,FB, Instagram), it puts ego-centrism, greed, instant gratification, instant fame into the spotlight. It encourages people to break the rules for fame, it makes attention seekers, extreme thrill seekers looks cool. But at the end there is a nice little twist and a lame moralizing lesson, which tells us do not go too far, friendship and life is more important, awwww so true, soooo nice, but...too late, the movie just spent 90 min showing people that all this crap was cool, pretty much being an enabler, validating addictive, dangerous behaviors, in front of a young susceptible audience! (or an older audience wondering why the hell I am here) We all read stories of selfie takers who fell from a crane or roof or cliff because they were trying to score a cool shot for their social media profiles... The movie is rather fast paced, but it is just watching a succession of dares: steal this, be naked, get a tattoo, risk your life...it is actually not funny nor entertaining to watch this. The main actors are likable, but it is was not enough to make me forget how idiotic this movie was. I was fooled by the 7 average, but then I realized 80% of the people watching this movie were below 25, so like I said in my opening statement, this is for a younger audience (who might pause their Pokémon Go hunt or their posting on FB, VIne, Insta... for the duration of this movie, and get their nose back into their phone screen as soon as the movie is over)",Nerve
204,Therru_Babayaga,Pretty uninteresting and uneventful,4,16 October 2016,"This is a hard movie to review because there is really no point to it.It is probably meant as a statement about the danger of the internet, the addiction and the pressure associated with social medias, and how detached we are from all the suffering in the world through our screens and phones. Maybe, but this is not what the movie is actually really about in its development. Basically, we just follow a teenager (Emma Roberts) trying to figure out her future by having a crazy night-out and going out of her shell by using the application ""Nerve"", where ""watchers"" proposes challenges to ""players"" with an increasing difficulty as well as money if they complete each of them, until a final showdown at the end of the night between two players who have the most watchers. She then meet a love interest (Dave Franco) and through her challenges, she revises her relationship with herself, her mother, her friends and her life in general. Classic ""coming of age"" movie stuffs. It's as formulaic as it gets. The movie is called ""Nerve"" but it clearly lacks some. Nothing feel exciting, nothing feel ""dangerous"" or thrilling. Most challenges outside of one are pretty tame and never feel life-threatening or really that rebellious or outraging. Worst, they don't really bring anything to the characters in terms of development except for the adrenaline of completing them. Everything feels rushed and too easily resolved. The last challenge is almost breaking the fourth wall and being addressed to the audience with heavy speeches and bad camera work, way too far from the action. The third act in its entirety is very weak and not credible in the slightest, and the characters reaction make less and less sense with each passing minute until the very end. The worst part is, if we take away the ""Nerve"" game and replace it with Dave Franco being a classic attractive bad-boy with a mysterious past who seduces Emma Roberts, it would have work pretty much exactly the same. In the end, the game is played more like a lazy excuse for a watered-down thriller with a weak romance vibe. There are many things to say about the way we relate to social medias and peer pressure through the internet. This movie is treating it like an after-thought or a pretext for the plot and never challenges the viewer in his/her relationship with those kind of content and way of life. ""Nerve"" is a very disappointing movie which looks good in terms of cinematography and that is easy to watch without being too bored. However, it's also way too bland, unexciting and never at no point take advantage of his subject matter. Catch it on Netflix or such when it's available if you're intrigued, but it's really not worth spending any money on it.",Nerve
205,iciahgem,"Interesting plot, failed to fully deliver",7,17 February 2017,"I'm an anarchist and nope, anarchy doesn't work this way. (At least that's what I've learned from the books I've been reading and not the movies I've watched which are telling me otherwise.)I like the film. It's interesting. It's realistic given that in today's society with the prevalence of social media among people, teens especially, everything, or most things anyway, is done for the sake of views, likes, hearts, shares, re-tweets, or whatnot. People aim to be internet famous not so much as be an actual TV or big screen celebrity.That is our reality now.Not that I'm complaining. I, for one, love the internet and that's not because I also need the constant approval of anonymous individuals (I don't, although getting a nod here and there ain't bad sometimes), but because I get to reach out easily, or at least easier than it would be before the internet was made available to everyone or almost everyone (Jae for example 😜).But it still remains scary how most people find the necessity to receive nods from complete strangers to feel, well, complete. It's scary but every time I open my social media accounts, I see people doing almost everything to become viral and have their 10 minutes of fame. It's crazy. And have I said that it's scary? Because it is.And you know what's scarier? Knowing that Nerve's reality is actually not that far from this world's reality.Given all that I'm still giving the film a 6.5. Why? It could've tried to take itself more seriously but it chickened out and gave us a happy ending wherein good defeats evil (or busybodies who like making other people do dares they won't do themselves even with their lives on the line). Yup, exactly how a teen friendly thriller would run.P.S. I changed my mind and I'm now giving it an 8 because Dave Franco. I watched this for Emma and stayed for Dave. I know a couple of Ians in real life but his Ian sets the bar for how Ians should be IRL.",Nerve
206,augustonardin,Dave Franco got Emma in the game... to then save her?,9,12 October 2016,"Nerve has a frenetic pace It got me calling my friends (that hadn't watched it) late at night to discuss about it.It is commercial and it has a lot of teenager romance cliché (which I find entertaining). It brings up some deep reflections about how being anonymous in the internet changes our behavior - we don't measure our acts and words, we tend to get indifferent.Now, the thing that does not get out of my mind: how come Dave Franco states that all he wanted was to save Emma from being a prisoner of Nerve if HE was the one that got her to be so involved with the game in the first place?? If that makes sense, I might not know who I am. I like to believe this is a conscious flaw in the movie (so that careful watchers can interpret the situation as: Dave Franco is psycho and he manipulated everyone the whole 90 minutes; after the movie ends, he turns to be Emma Roberts new evil boyfriend ready for more wicked games).",Nerve
207,itsbekah,"Predictable like most movies, but it's worth a watch",6,29 July 2016,"I miss movies that have real twists. But this was a great movie nonetheless, it had your average tropes. (Good is Boring, unrequited love, dead family member, hot mystery guy, evil internet, sad rich party girl, blah blah blah). But even so, if you want to watch a new take on something old, go or it! I'm not mad that I watched this movie despite the average acting and predictability. It had great funny moments as well, I liked the part where they had to run through the store. I also enjoyed the fact that it had some truth in it. When people think they are anon, they do things they normally wouldn't do. Do I think crowd mentality would agree to kill someone? Actually, that's not far off either. Honestly, though watch the movie! It's a fun watch.",Nerve
208,sean_footynut,"Nerve shows that the Internet and Smartphones can be a really dark area, in a thrilling and visually stimulating way.",10,6 September 2016,"Nerve reflects the society we live in today, where the internet and smartphones consume our life, like it is an addictive drug. Nerve is very self-aware when it comes to these issues and uses them in an original and interesting way, influencing the film entirely.The plot is well influenced by this self-awareness, as we follow Venus or Vee (Emma Roberts) and Ian (Dave Franco) through an Internet game of truth or dare minus the truth, where you sign up to the game as a watcher or a player. As a player you are dared by watchers to complete a dare to receive a cash incentive, if you fail or don't accept the challenge, its game over. The narrative taps into the peer pressure of teenagers and the influence of the Internet on today's society. As players in Nerve, the aim of the player is to have the most viewers watching you in order to progress through to the finals and win the game. Reflecting the ideas of popularity and being ""internet famous"" that is much apart of the Internet culture that we live in.The way in which Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost have structured and shot the film suits its main themes and influences. This is evident as the film opens in a very topical way, as we enter the film through the entering of a password on Vee's computer. This isn't the only time in the film where the directors directly acknowledge the technology influence/theme of the film, as a majority of the camera shots in the film feel like they are being taken straight from a smartphone camera roll or from a webcam and its visually appealing and suits the film perfectly. These camera shots, complemented by flawless editing add to the action sequences, making fast paced and visually interesting scenes.The graphics also play a part in the aesthetic feel of the film and enhancing the viewing experience. At the beginning of Vee's introduction to being a player in Nerve, her username is displayed over a establishing shot of New York, which shows other players in the game. When she meets Ian and begins doing dares with him their usernames are linked time and time again in shots of the New York skyline. It's this smart use of graphics that really adds to the feeling that we are also watchers in this game without even knowing it.Nerve also has an underlining lesson for us as we watch it and it's a very strong lesson as well. At the beginning of Vee's game and towards the tricky end of the game it shows how accessible we are when we put data on the Internet and that this data can be accessed by anyone on the Internet. Everything we like on Facebook, Google search and buy online is accessible. This provides a grim reality of the world we currently live in and how accessible it is to get information with the click of a button.Nerve is an entertaining, visually appealing and educating film, with a direct reflection of what our everyday lives have become. Through the use of alternative camera work, interesting story line and a little lesson it creates a wonderfully crafted film that offers plenty of reflection upon leaving the cinema. Nerve is a step in a new direction of noir films of today; taking into account the ideas and concerns about technology and uses them to entertain, shock and thrill us from start to finish.",Nerve

Old but gold. the actors did a real great job too. everything was so realistic in a classic motion that makes you a part of the movie. living the story in a factual level. something that was actually forgotten! of course there is a lot of good movies specially in the past two years but i love how classic the movie is and how realistic, factual, true and veritable. i would actually give it 8/10 because its just so amazing ! and do i recommend this movie ? of course i do ! its modern, based on our time! based on something that would actually happen! little bit o drama and so simple, what else do u want ? WATCH IT PEOPLE ! ah and i forgot to mention ! for MGK fans (Machine Gun Kelly) he is in this movie !!!!!! so its just another reason to watch it !!!!!

As soon as people are not anon anymore, they are afraid to speak- why? The game in the movie might be over but it is not in our every day life. We have access to social medias and other online platforms where we can be our true selves that are not even us in our close friends' and family's eyes. That being said, the dilemma is that sometimes we are not ourselves because we care too much about what other people would think (though irrelevant to the message this movie is trying to deliver). In that sense, this movie accurately depicted a small piece of the life we are living in. People may find this movie scary and freaky, but it is our real world we are all living in right now.",Nerve
211,natedeathwing,An interesting and original idea...,7,12 August 2017,"Nerve is a game much like Truth or Dare, but without the truth. The game is structured around 2 types of people, ""watchers"", who help the ""players"" get views and help give Players dares to then complete, while ""players"" have to either complete, fail, or bail on the dare. All in all, a pretty interesting take for a film, but an enjoyable film to watch. Remember ""Snitches get Stitches!""",Nerve

The thing is supposed to be set around 2018/19 I guess but all the tech in it is outdated. This just really confused the hell out of me during the entire movie.It also gives off a certain 90s teenage movie flow.The worst part is the representation of the ""darkweb"" Honestly 3 mins of research on tor would've helped the producers to at least get the addresses right.Wait until you see how they represent hackers too. Also, really you should shut off the movie now if you even have a remote understanding of the term open source.Kind of not worth your time anyways unless your understanding of tech is limited to that of an 80 year old North Korean farmer.However the characters and setting are pretty well done.

The trailer is at least watchable and 30 seconds of this movie is too much for my eyes. It is such lazy writitng with such a great potential to tell us a story and wartn us about the dangers of the internet. Yet it doesnt fail to disappoint in ecvery aspect of cinema. Classic teengae girl, no life, fake friends (except for that one guy who is apparently the greatest hacker in the world and just deletes the game with a little help of his ping pong enthusiasts), unrealistic parent, dead brother( btw he is dead just so we could feel sorry for her and it gets mentioned for like 30 seconds so again lazy character dev.). So she decides to take on an advanture that can literally be stopped at any time in the movie with submitting the photographic evidence to the police and ending the game immediately. And then this little girl who is not 18 yet btw outsmarts the whole hacker team behind the game and orchestrates a fantastic plan in a matter of seconds to stop the game just so we could get a plot twist at the end which is again like the whole movie disappointing

I don't like to see films get released with an exact concept as previous ones but with no mention (looking at you James Cameron, Avatar= Fern Gully).i do , for some reason like Emma Roberts, even if she hasn't been in anything great yet.

You'll see some well known and rising star faces who's acting was on point. The movie tries to win you with likable characters, scenes that show familiar problems to most internet users (e.g.Skype call glitching) and with a cute little morale story at the end but fails as it provides no depth to be discovered. Some scenes are super cringe worthy and left me feeling uncomfortable about my movie picking skills.It's just one of those films you watch and forget about in a day, doesn't leave you questioning some character's decisions or the way it ended which left both me and my girlfriend disappointed.

It's not, however, an Oscar winner as I'm sure no one expects it to be. The graphics are at times exceedingly cool and at other times flare towards the corny. I feel like the underlying message of the whole film, that being that the current state of fame seeking draws people to do irrational things and people, in the safety of a crowd, are a less than compassionate audience, was a little ham handed at times (especially at the end) and all in all, if this movie really wanted to get across its message, could have been executed a little better in terms of the writing and direction.

223,mbelko618-694-275266,Fun Movie,7,20 August 2017,"Nerve is an aesthetically-pleasing, high-speed thrill ride that keeps you entertained every step of the way. The movie is not without its flaws and, let's be honest, some pretty unbelievable scenes, but its relevancy to the internet era, its entertainment factor, and its visual eye-candy (not just the lead actors) does more than enough to make up for it.In the beginning of the movie, we meet Vee (Emma Roberts), which is short for Venus, who's not exactly the thrill-seeker of a lifetime. In fact, she's kind of weenie. Her friend Sydney (Emily Meade) tells her to live her life more so she can enjoy it more (always great advice). After Vee is rejected by her crush JP, she decides to take Sydney's advice and play the game Nerve. This is where the film really takes off. In an age where everyone wants to be internet- or insta-famous, Nerve hits this aspect on the head. Watchers pay money to watch and dare the players to do challenges, which can consist of anything from kissing a stranger to performing dangerous stunts. Players win money when they complete a dare. Beware though, because while you'll make more money the farther you go, the dares will also become more and more dangerous. Not to mention that you'll lose all of your money if you happen to ""bail"" or ""fail"". Vee meets Ian (Dave Franco) during her first dare, which is essentially what makes her press onward.However, although this movie is great fun, it's not without its flaws. There are various plot holes, various ""reallys?!,"" and the ending does wrap up just a little bit too easily.Overall, there's not denying that the cool neon blues, purples, and reds combined with the dark New York City blacks and grays is a feast for the eyes. The acting is well-done for the most part, even by Roberts who can be a hit or miss. If you're looking for a fun, summer movie where you don't want to think too much or too hard, Nerve is the perfect choice.",Nerve

227,micahkonzen,"Not worth theater matinée, but worth the $1 Redbox price",6,28 August 2016,"The age of internet fame and fortune is upon us, and ""Nerve"" gives us the over-dramatized Hollywood version of what some people are willing to do for this type of life. Emma Roberts plays Vee, your typical high school outsider who feels the need to prove herself to her peers and the rest of the world. Her partner in crime, Ian, who is portrayed by Dave Franco is that cool, edgy, and hard counteract to Vee's soft, afraid, and timid character. Together the two have quite good chemistry, but apart neither of their characters thrived.Emma Roberts had some good scenes, some bad scenes, and one absolutely ugly scene. It's almost hard to blame the actress though, because her character's reactions to life's problems were so over-dramatized. It's understandable that in a movie that's appealing to the younger generation, cheesy high school drama between friends or love interests is bound to happen, but this movie exceeded that acceptable level of drama. What started out as a great plot with some legitimately unexpected plot twists eventually came crashing down with an absurd finale riddled with plot holes This movie did however have its strong points. The acting by those with smaller roles, such as Miles Heizer, was great and actually smoothed out some scenes that may have been rough without it. The concept of online gaming mixed with real life consequences was very interesting and could open the door to a major future theme in Hollywood. The fast pace tempo that this concept requires keeps you intrigued and engaged. The moral messages centered around peer pressure and the harsh reality of internet fame and fortune were both very clear. So overall, despite the sub-par acting jobs, plot holes, and weak finale, this movie still accomplished what it set out to do. It puts you on the edge of your seat at times, makes you feel for the characters, and gets its messages across. It may not be a movie you see twice, but it might be on you recommend for a movie night at home with some friends.",Nerve

I'm not gonna give it a higher note simply because I felt that Venus wasn't the ideal main character for this kind of stuff in terms of personality: while it's nice to see her overcome her challenges, it felt to me like she didn't really have a big motivation to do so after a point.",Nerve

An introvert has had enough of her extrovert best friend being the centre of attention as well as calling her out for her personality; decides to prove to her peers that she can be badass. The game Nerve is quite unique and if used correctly, could be a set up to something greater than what the movie perceives. Here comes the spoilers; everything went great until Venus decides to snitch out after learning that Ian was dared to set her to fight with Sydney. In my personal opinion, it's a rather weak reason because she barely knew Ian and after just showing up her BF, Syd, it's hard to believe she'll snitch. I rather the movie takes a darker turn whereas a death or serious injury from Sydney makes Venus snitch therefore it's more possible as well as empathize their friendship. Sydney and Mad Max has a weird connection; do they know each other??? Their interaction was weird in the movie. Venus' mom was poorly used in the movie, she just accepts everything in the end. Here is my main problem with the movie, Nerve, what are the rules!? I know it's all dare but up until two instances (guy trying to grab an officer's gun and final: Venus and Ian stand off) the dare hasn't been any criminal or physical assault acts. Sure, some dares are life threatening as well as boardline illegal but not quite criminal. So what I'm trying to say is that Nerve is inconsistent therefore ruining it's potential for greatness. Lastly is the ending. Yep, just a bunch of hackers able to break down Nerve; simple as that. And we never know who created or controls Nerve. My personal rating is 5.5 to 6.2 out of 10",Nerve
231,reviewswc,"Nerve: Good Concept, Poor Execution",5,29 July 2016,"This was a movie that I thought had a very cool premise, but at the same time, its trailer appeared to leave no surprises to be discovered.The Good This film's premise is definitely a fun one, and at the least, this movie was almost constantly entertaining. The dares that these people are forced to do as well as the reasons for why people are playing this game are things I found very fun and interesting.Emma Roberts and Dave Franco both give solid performances in this film, and they each work well off of each other. Roberts as Vee accurately depicts a high school senior struggling with social problems as well as college, even if Roberts herself looks like she graduated from high school six years ago. Franco's character was also an intriguing one, and he grew on me the more the film progressed.I enjoyed nearly every moment when a legitimate dare was being done, as they were handled very well and created tension excellently. The style of this movie is also a reason as to why this film feels original, as the sleek visuals create some very cool scenes.The Bad Nerve can be very fun when it wants to be, but the problem is that it also takes itself way too seriously in many scenes. This movie tries to get serious towards the end and become dramatic and have important themes, but it all comes across as incredibly dull and tedious.Speaking of the ending, no matter how serious the movie thinks it is, it is absolutely stupid. The whole plan doesn't make much sense at all, and there are way too many unanswerable questions to just let go how convoluted it is.While I did like Roberts and Franco, I had a massive problem with Emily Meade.Whether it is the design of her character or the performance, Meade is completely unlikable and lacks any sense at all, and that would be okay if we are supposed to be against her. Instead, the movie expects us to feel sorry for her, which I found impossible to do.My biggest fear coming in was that the trailer gave away too much of the main plot.I wouldn't say the trailer gave away too much, I would say the trailer gave away everything. Every single scene, besides two, in particular, I saw coming a mile away because of one individual trailer, and I think it completely ruined my film going experience. Nearly every dare, every important conflict, and even the plot twist can be found within this movie's official trailer, and I highly recommend avoiding that trailer like the plague if you have any interest in seeing this movie.Conclusion Nerve has good performances from its two leads and a unique visual style, and it certainly has its fair share of entertainment. However, though it might not be fair, the trailer absolutely ruined my experience by giving away the vast majority of the plot. Even besides that, there are issues in the film's storytelling, and whenever the movie tries to be taken seriously, it falls flat on its face. Nerve has its moments but falls apart towards its conclusion.4.5/10",Nerve

It's maybe a little bit high school, but woman will always love this kind of movies and this one is kind of a thriller but not on a scary way but more excited.. The story is really from this time and that's why you are really in to the movie. Because you ask yourself: ""If this was for real? What will you do? What will happen?"" First I was curious: how this will be thriller? But when I watched the movie, I understood after a while.. This movie is not ""really"" for men, more for young minds/woman I guess.

235,popcornpaul,A cautionary tale with a techno soundtrack,8,2 November 2016,"Social media – Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Instagram and so on – is now all around us. Some of the generations of humanity remember a time when it didn't exist – when people sent letters through the post, got birthday cards and a knocked on someone's door to see them. They didn't post a status, sent a ""selfie"" or followed them. Sometimes, because it's so easily accessible, people think, that by posting something, it's harmless. But you know what? Social media can be dangerous. And, it can make or destroy you depending on what's posted. As a blogger and vlogger, I use social media every day to inform and discuss.But not all of it is great. Sometimes though, something comes out and goes viral. And this could be a meme, a song, a video or a game. Such examples include Candy Crush, Farmville (am I showing my age here?), Clash of Clans or, more recently, Pokémon Go.Nerve is a movie all about the above. Set in the near future, an unknown conglomerate of hidden persons known as the Watchers create a game called Nerve. A cross between Twitter, YouTube and truth or dare, Nerve is a game whereby you can either be a) a watcher or b) a player. If you are a watcher, you pay to watch the constantly streaming show. Apparently it's $19.99 for 24 hours access which is expensive, I reckon. Anyway, as a watcher you can like the people who play, recommend dares for them to do and post comments as they are doing the dares. If you decide to become a player, then you play Nerve – where you are given a dare to do and if you carry it out you get more likes and a financial reward; but the dares get increasingly stupid or dangerous, but the money goes up. The top liked people get to a ""final"" where the winner gets to walk away with loads of money, fame and probably a fan club. The players are always being videoed and stalked by the viewing public, and to complete a dare the player has to record the dare on their individual mobile phone or similar. Also, you get quite famous so I guess you could see the appeal. Now, after explaining all that, young lady Venus (who is known as Vee in the movie cos she's cool and never uses her full name) is a plain, boring, non-stand out, book reading, non-risk taking young lady. Loving her photography hobby (especially of taking photos of the local football team and one guy in particular) and keeping in the background, she is overshadowed by her best frenemy and Nerve player, Sydney (Emily Meade). Sydney is an interesting character but is someone I think the film wants you to feel sorry for but she is written in a way that is hard to like. When the gang get together at a local fast food chain, Sydney states that Vee (Emma Roberts) should be a bit more risk taking as you only live once and what have you. Vee is dared by the group to go over to talk to said football blokey but is too shy to do so, so Sydney goes over instead to ask on her behalf. Football boy replied that she's not his type (he's stupid – she's stunning) and this breaks Vee's heart and she runs for home, both upset at finding his feelings out but also angry at Sydney. In a not quite clear motivation (is it because of her getting back at Sydney or does she want to prove she's brave or both) she signs up for Nerve and becomes a player. What follows is a thrill ride backed by a techno soundtrack (which is actually quite good) and outlined in neon. Playing the game of his own accord but crossing paths with Vee is Ian (played by Dave Franco of Now You See Me fame) and both actors have a great rapport with each other. As Vee's dares start off fairly easy she is knocking them back like no-ones business and is coining it in. But when things start to take a turn for the sinister she breaks the games rules by trying to get the police involved and finds there are not only watchers and players but a third option - prisoners of the game too. How is that for a cautionary tale? Featuring Juliette Lewis as Vee's mum as a nice surprise, Nerve is an original, tense action thriller which could have been rubbish but is actually really, really good. The scariest thing about this movie is that it's so well written that this situation is so close to reality that the scary thing is, this could actually happen.",Nerve
236,erickabantolopez,A postmodern version of the banality of evil,7,1 February 2018,"Nerve is the typical story of one who overcomes his fears by taking unexpected risks, but also the nth cinematographic representation of the Cavafy Ithaka, in which the journey (the situations the protagonist experiences) is more important than obtaining what he initially wanted: Venus, the shy young photographer of this story, begins by entering a virtual game of real challenges in order to overcome her fears and silence her friend, but ends up trapped between her own ambitions and the constant pressure from other players to get to through dangerous challenges, more money, popularity and fun. Almost at the end, a fortuitous revelation and the subsequent violation of a rule of the game will put her life at risk and lead her to design strategies to save herself.In the background, Nerve shows the ability of the Internet to house social structures that, as Hannah Arendt said of Nazism, end up functioning by themselves without control, eroding freedom and trivializing evil. But it also shows, with bluntness, two great certainties of the human condition: that in social life, we all participate by action or omission; and that in the face of the unjustified presence of death, we always seek consolation and security in our moral values.",Nerve

Sound exciting? If you said yes, then you're probably not sober.All snark aside, this isn't actually THAT bad of a movie. The plot itself is okay, the actors did a superbly passable job for being a bunch of teenagers, and the premise, while outrageous, is acceptable by Hollywood standards. But there's not much that goes on for about the first half of the movie, the main characters are pretty much unmemorable, and it's pretty difficult to not see the INCREDIBLE amount of product placement.

240,midori_mkv,Simply lousy,2,24 August 2020,"The main idea was interesting but the way it was implemented was terrible. This movie was simply a neon cyberpunk aesthetic. The characters only fit in very obvious unoriginal archetypes. The naive girl, the popular girl who is gonna lose her popularity, prince charming, bad guys who are secretly good, and the genius hackerman. The only decent thing about it was how how the main character Vee eased into this whole dangerous life. Like she was clearly much more uncomfortable in the beginning.
The plot didn't really go by smoothly. It was shifted from stage to stage very sloppily. Especially in the final plot points.
The cybersecurity/tech side of the movie was also very inaccurate. But then of course, the majority of the audience aren't familiar with cybersecurity on a technical level but the concepts weren't simplified well at all. They were simply wrong and inaccurate. Another example of misusing science in movies. (Just like quantum in other movies.)

244,d-28932,The Dicey Social Media Game of Truth or Dare,7,24 January 2020,"In the exciting thriller Nerve, teens turn New York into a stage for showing off the dares they accept from the newly addicting game called Nerve. In this game, you either pay to be a watcher or get paid to be a player. When shy wallflower Vee (Emma Roberts) decides to be a player in the game, she ends up meeting Ian (Dave Franco) to play the social media-driven truth and dare game without the truth. Nerve was nominated for people's choice awards in 2017 for favorite thriller movies, along with an 85.2 million grossed total. The new game drags Vee and Ian all across the streets of New York at all hours of the day, and sometimes into very risky situations. This movie will keep you on the edge of the seat and the wondrous soundtrack will bring a smile to your face.
Vee is a Statin Island high schooler who recently got accepted into her dream school, but the death of her Wu-Tang Clan-loving brother makes this choice more difficult, as her mom wants her to stay at home. Vee recently got shut down by her crush and is persuaded by her Wild best friend Sydne (Emily Meade) to try this new game that all the craze is about. This high-risk game of truth and dare led to her kissing a stranger in a diner for $100, this stranger happens to be Ian. The rest of the night Vee continues to complete dares for money, but all the viewers want Vee to be with Ian and do dare with him. At first, the dares are just fun challenges but later on, they get more demanding and dangerous. Soon the movie explains the dark side of the game and how it's controlled by people on the dark web and once you start you can never quite unless you win. This is similar to the movie Catfish directed by Schulmanas well, both films hint at the danger one can do when behind a screen.
The intense scene where Vee and Ian accept a dare to go 60 blindfolded on a motorcycle, is a nail-biting situation similar to the James Bond movie Skyfall The fast car and motorcycle chases in James Bond make the audience embark on the same fierce and edgy emotional journey. When Vee (Emma Roberts) is very nervous and shaky at the beginning of the scene, you can see her go through changes and transition into a bold cutthroat stuntman. Ian (Dave Franco) is forced to put all his total trust with Vee, their acting tremendously helped create the right tense atmosphere for this scene. These actors also made the characters connect on an emotional level to the film and Vee and Ian. I won't say any spoilers but at the end of the film, the audience is so invested into the characters your palms will be sweating.
Equally Important, this movie soundtrack that will make you want to get up out of your seat and dance around. The ""electric"" song electric love by Borns, adds to the film an enjoyment factor. This music gets your heart pumping, and adds realism to the movie because during an exciting time in your life energetic music should be playing for the audience to get a deeper connection to the film. The audience for this film is mostly teenagers and the upbeat and popular songs appeal perfectly to that age group. The directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman add an interesting component of Vee's dead brother loving the rap group Wu-Tang Clan, so they add lots of Wu-Tang songs which are popular with teens. One recommendation I would give the directors is to choose a direction they want their movie to go in and stick to it, its part high school cliches, part love story, and part cybersecurity similar to the movie Anon directed by Andrew Niccol.
Despite the one negative aspect, this movie is sure to be very intriguing and scores a perfect score for entertainment value. Nerve will hold your attention for the entire 96 minutes. The cinematography by Michael Simmonds adds bright neon lights, stereotypical New York City lights, and excitement. Although this movie isn't in theaters anymore be sure to pop some popcorn at home catch this film on Amazon Prime, YouTube, or iTunes, because this is one you won't want to miss.",Nerve

249,fabianczilwa,Short enough to not get my nerves,5,22 March 2021,"To make this clear from the start: Nerve is never logical, never close to reality and should not be dissected to the details. But it works as a mindless entertainer for a good one and a half hour.
It all gets started with a view into the life of normal high school girl Vee and her friends. Her best friend encounters the new real-life online game Nerve, where you can choose to become player or watcher. Soon she convinces Vee to register as a player too. What begins as a distraction from her ordinary school life quickly turns into a night full of spectacular action and completely dumb decisions at the point when she meets the mysterious Ian.
From there on her actions, resulting of the dares she receives by the watchers of the game, become more and more perilous as hilarious. Nerve creates an utterly sensation-seeking society to speed the audience through a series of pointless events and forgettable characters. Nonetheless, it knows to entertain when just taken as it is: a bright, fast-paced movie about a game, that could never exist but at the same time feels realistic enough to be believable. At least as long as you don't think about it further.
Do not get me wrong here, it all works as a popcorn and beer entertainment, but never sustain any logical review of the happenings. Consequentially, all upcoming attempts to really criticise society or the internet culture are smothered right away. As there is neither any character built-up nor a real antagonist, the movie left me completely indifferent and incurious.
I would recommend it as a movie with friends and booze, when the dialogues are not properly followed anyway and the fast pace and bright colours do their job.",Nerve
250,thisgirlisfli,Are You a Watcher or a Player?,8,20 April 2021,"""Hello, Welcome to Nerve. Nerve is a direct democracy. Watchers decide your dares. The two players with the most watchers by the end of regulation will advance to the final round where the winner takes all. Watchers can watch from anywhere, but they are encouraged to film live, so don't be alarmed. There are three rules, one all dares must be filmed on the player's phone. Two, there are only two ways to be eliminated, fail or bail. Three snitches get stitches. Thank you for keeping nerve a secret. Good luck player."" (Nerve) If you're someone who enjoys being on the edge of your seat, trying to predict the next plot twists a movie might throw at you, then this is the perfect review for you to read. In this review I'll be arguing that Nerve is a great movie to enjoy if you're looking for something that is thrilling, but at the same time, connects you to the characters as if you were in the movie yourself. Nerve was released on July 27, 2016. Directed by Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost. In the movie, nerve was a highly successful game everyone was playing. Nerve, essentially, is truth or dare, minus the truth. When signing up for nerve, a character can either be a watcher or a player. Watchers decide the player's dares.Nerve is centered around a character named Vee, who is shy and not immensely daring. Vee and her friend Sydney had a altercation prior to Vee signing up to be a player which ended in Vee getting angry, attempting to prove her wrong. This was the game's ultimate demise.I know a great deal of people see the movie as all over the place and confusing, but to me, there was nothing confusing about it. The reason I give this 8/10 only because I enjoyed the movie a lot when I watched it for the first time. The movie wasn't extremely predictable, plus the drama that unfolds in it was the pulling factor in me finishing the movie. The drama in the movie is what really connects you to the characters because you've been experiencing the entire movie with the main characters. You've felt what they had, plus they take you along with them during the dares, making you feel as though you're a watcher too.",Nerve

Interesting premise, but has major plot holes and threads that are unresolved by the end of the movie. The lead girl doesn't have much charisma, and turns into a supporting character to better actors that are supposed to be supports. One problem is that they keep describing a previous ""game"" that took place in Seattle, and it ends up being more interesting than the current story.

253,MrAlxT,Shockingly stupid movie,2,15 March 2017,"Give a 10 year old to write a screenplay for movie and you'll have something similar. If we assume the movie is about kids then it is much more acceptable. I gave the movie rating 2, simply cause there was some good prerequisites for it to has a nice atmosphere. The scene where they're crossing the bridge on the motor, going to the city is the only argument to call this piece of frames actually a ""movie"". Even if we assume this is fun/no brainer flick made for kids, the lack of plot holes and nonsense is simply more for me. Basically I'll put this film into the bottom 20 films I've ever seen. I don't think I somehow appreciate good movies, in a way better than the people who rated it more than 5.It is just very important and determining the factor, where we find ourselves in our ""life movie"", how we judge and rate one. The first 20 minutes are enough to make a judgment whether this one is okay for you or no. The statement and the vibe are pretty clear. It doesn't really get better.",Nerve

I know a lot are saying the same thing oh it's been done before and shows how far people will go for views but I think the beauty of it more so is the flaws it points out in the watchers. Far too many today hide behind their anonymity and think it's OK to do whatever horrible thing as long as they don't get caught. All across the Internet I've seen people telling others to kill themselves, threats of murder, threats of rape, and all sorts of discrimination because people know no one will take action against them as long as they're hiding online. The end of the movie was pretty accurate to me that there are a great many who would want something like watching someone be murdered for their entertainment because they can't get in trouble for it. It's only in the end they bailed once they were afraid they had been caught. It doesn't just show how far an attention seeker will go but how far an entertainment seeker would. Some of it was predictable but I like a movie willing to say yeah humanity is pretty messed up.",Nerve

256,annachenxu,Pleasantly Unexpected Thoughts and Feelings,10,31 July 2016,"Taking viewers for a glamorous ride, Nerve brings a harmonious medley entertainment and thought-provoking contemplation. A multifaceted movie, Nerve doesn't fail to give the comedic, thrilling, edge-of- your seat entertainment that moviegoers crave on a night out. The chemistry between Franco and Roberts, the intense visuals, and memorable soundtrack readily draws watchers (get it?) into the movie. These features complement each other so well that the hearts of viewers still race hours after the end. For those who want a deep, discussion starting movie, the door is there for those who want to open it. There's no overt pressure from the movie to draw a certain conclusion, or for watchers to take a certain stance on social media. Rather, it presents an unbiased entry into the thrilling world of social media with its upsides and downsides. Franco and Roberts display superb acting in the way they manifest of their characters history and unique motives through the course of the adrenaline-filled night. Nerve provides a stunning look at the different personalities and impulses that draw people to social media without explicitly labeling motives as wrong or right. Nerve comes at an especially relevant time with the increasing concern over social media and its consequences, and the directors produced a wonderful spark to incite discussion and awareness on this important topic. However, there's no force on audiences to answer to the social media dilemma. Viewers draw their own conclusions as their personalities and thoughts guide them through the movie. Nerve is quite the package. There's enough nerve-racking displays to keep your hearts thumping throughout the night, but there's also the second layer of radical questioning to plague your minds as the night goes on. All in all, Nerve is a great option for those who want to experience an alluring night filled with fun and great music, and for those who want a movie that draws out that reserved, subtle, philosophical parts in ourselves.",Nerve

It makes you join the actors in their journey to full fill them dares.Good acting, Good FX, Good story, which i wouldn't come up with on the fly.The story itself is good, the writer of this story tries to tell you that you can pretend and follow the crowd behind a mask but if you are known without a mask and confronted in real life you wouldn't be doing such things.The story lets you get introduced to some of the main characters except Ian, you get to know a little bit about him when the story progresses.It's an interesting movie, so check it out!",Nerve

It's about what public figures/streamers/Youtubers would do for the views.BUT...The ending (and actually the whole second half of the movie) is really bad! That honeyed happy ending just destroyed the weight of the message. The characters are okay most of the time, but the dialogues are horrible. It's not that well directed, but the idea behind it what makes it fun to watch!In summary: Not bad, but you should considering watch Black Mirror instead.",Nerve

It invokes feelings in the watchers, and it makes your heart race as if you were actually in the movie. I felt like I was actually able to feel the same feelings as the characters. I was squealing and laughing and -mostly- crying. I absolutely loved this movie and I would totally watch this again, given the chance.

I don't particularly see this film as bad, in fact I believe that it is above average, the only thing is, is that I thought with the material the filmmakers were going for it had the chance to be something really special and entirely unique. However this is no where near being a bad film, in fact I recommend that you go see it because it is good and it does have interesting ideas to offer, even if they are just plainly ideas that are never explored within their fullest capacity. The social commentary about the way we use social media and where we are headed was quite engaging and entertaining. There were just some things that I thought could have helped the film stand out and be GREAT instead of just good.",Nerve
264,peixotes,"A new theme, old cliché",6,25 September 2016,"despite talk about a current topic, the film does not choose the new themes that social networks bring, and ends up bringing the old clichés, replace the game ""nerve"" for reality show ""nerve"" that the story does not change. The characters are totally generic that when passing the film you do not remember a name The performances are OK for what the script gives the actors, could not be much better than it appears on the screen At times, the phone cameras that are used, despite the good intentions, give a bit of a headache, but otherwise the direction is basic and does not hurt. The soundtrack disturbs a little, by excessive pop songs that help that headache I've said above So ""Nerve"" is another 2016 film with good ideas, that the lazy script team, becomes disposable and generic.",Nerve
265,dinkvjr,Compelled to keep watching,10,12 October 2016,"First, I must say that while this movie appeals to a younger generation, once I started the movie, I couldn't stop watching it. The movie kept me interested in what was happening and what was to come. Unlike some critics, I thought Emma Roberts and Dave Franco had great chemistry.It felt very natural, not forced at all. ««Spoiler»» The romantic interactions were in a time frame that could happen instead of the movie magic romance that is meeting and falling in love two minutes later. The action was nicely paced with believable and exciting dares. Nerve is something I can easily see happening since people already do dares and challenges without pay for many social media sites. I love it when a movie has me asking myself a question. What about you? Are you a WATCHER or PLAYER ❓",Nerve
266,connermackenzie,Nerve - 3.5/5,7,4 September 2016,"I went into Nerve hoping to see a pulse pounding thriller, and it did not disappoint. Emma Roberts, who I feel is a highly underrated actress, pulled off her classic character trope of a shy and withdrawn teen named Venus, or V, wishing only to keep herself under the radar. Following her story, I grew to actually care about her as a character, worrying for her more and more as she came across increasingly challenging dares for the game of Nerve. Dave Franco portrayed an excellent polar opposite to Roberts as Ian, an adrenaline junkie with a dark past that isn't revealed until late in the film. The feats that these two accomplish together had me closing my eyes or cringing while on the edge of my seat more than once.V starts off as a quiet and introverted teenage girl, who is thrust into Nerve by the sudden realization that she's not the most exciting person in the world. Her friends describe her as basically a sidekick, and she sets off to prove that she has an edge, even if that edge hasn't exactly manifested itself yet. Against the wishes of her peers, she teams up with Ian and the pair undergo challenges that gradually increase in difficulty, until the drama and pressure placed on her become too much.Ian counters V at every turn in terms of personality traits, and that's what attracts them to each other. The bad boy effect begins to take hold of V, and with Ian's influence, she becomes a true daredevil. The viewer begins to care about the duo, and love them together. The on-screen chemistry between Franco and Roberts wasn't the greatest, but it was definitely enough.As always, I look at a movie and grade it on three things; did it make sense, did it serve its intended purpose, and was it entertaining.As far as plot and character development, I had no problem with this film. The events made sense as they passed and continued on to the next, and the characters gradually were placed in different positions than they were at the beginning of the movie without being rushed.Nerve was intended to be a nail-biting thriller, and it was just that. The excellent direction by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman delivered a heart-pounding experience that truly made me scared for each of the characters.I was utterly shocked at some of the stunts V and Ian had to pull off, each one was a surprise, and some had me wanting to pass out from the sheer anxiety that would come from the stunts they pulled. The movie definitely did entertain me, and kept my attention the entire durationOverall, Nerve is a solid movie for regular viewers and adrenaline junkies alike. It receives a solid 3.5/5 from me.",Nerve
267,jackbroxton,All of the potential without significant elevation,3,13 October 2016,"To start, the soundtrack was effective and enjoyable.The plot itself and lack of development did the cast a disservice.Great cinematography to boot was appreciated, NY is a top city and I have visited many times.The script itself was poorly written, no advanced vocabulary whatsoever.The twist at the climax of the movie was completely underwhelming, the opportunity to create a link with the lead actress dead brother was so obvious but over looked by the writers. Exploiting this angle would have presented a more much satisfying ending, the mind boggles as to how this was not written in.I must add that promoting the dark web is socially irresponsible. The tackiness of the secret handshake with the tech geek with one of two (minimally scripted) token African American actors was ridiculous. The lead actress tech geek friend driving a Subaru was also laughable, being a realist there is no correlation that such a character would be have that kind of car.Upsetting to the extreme was the minimal role given to Juliette Lewis, she has proved herself over many years in many excellent films. What a waste to use an actress of her caliber so sparingly.The narrative for me is social media is getting completely out of control and its better living through reality, doing so is much more likely to bring you love and meaningful connections.I had high hopes for this film after scanning reviews on here, I'm an avid movie fan. This would generally be more enjoyed by the social media generation, not that I can classify that generation as having an age bracket (I'm 34).Anyway, enjoy if you can. It's easy viewing for sure.Good effort anyway.",Nerve

269,donaldsonjean,"OK Film, but wouldn't recommend",4,3 October 2016,"It seemed like the writers tried to come up with an interesting plot line but the execution fell short. The story was too fast paced and seemed a little patchy in places. The film does explore how the internet affects our society to some extent. But instead of being insightful it's just plain and a film to make you hang onto the edge of your seat. It seems to be more for the thrills than the moral story-line. To tell the truth I got a little bored while watching it.Another very big problem with this film is the lack of representation. There were hardly any non-white characters and the few that there were had a combined total screen time of about 12 minutes. There were also no LGBT+ characters or relationships in the film. I found it to be just another fast-paced film about pretty, white teens trying to prove their not boring.

I was really excited when I got to see it and it made me feel like I want to have an adventure. The movie has a great message and the actors were absolutely amazing in showing this. Spoiler alert: But after I saw the movie and I thought a lot about it, I noticed a mistake in the plot. Maybe I am wrong and I didn't understand it right and if I am, please everyone is free to correct me and explain to me what was going on. Near the end of the movie, Vee met her friends in something like a parking, she changed and she told them about her plan. Then she went where the watchers sent her and found a gun and then she went to the arena where she understood that one of them should die. So what I don't understand is: how did she tell them what the plan is even before she knew what the last dare was. If the plan was only to shut the game OK, I would understand. But Sydney called TY and he went to the arena with a gun so they had to know what the last dare was and they couldn't know if Vee didn't tell them, but she told them about the plan even before she saw the gun. This is the only thing that is really bugging me about the movie and I think that it is not something little. However, I really enjoyed the movie and I loved it.",Nerve

274,KainatAShah,"""Nerve"" is what adrenaline junkies, like myself, thrive for.",7,24 August 2016,"Easily one of the rare movies that had me on the edge of my seat at the theater. The incredible mix of teen flick, social media and intense thriller was astonishing.The title was intriguing to me and when I looked up the trailer, I came up with the conclusion that the fictional online game was called ""Nerve"" as to see how much ""nerve"" you got to complete some random challenge given to you by strangers.The story line itself is quite sloppy, but the rush of adrenaline certainly overlooks the negative qualities. The visual effect and the soundtrack help a lot too.Though I have to admit, the scene where Dave Franco is blindfolded and guided by Emma Roberts on the motorcycle, it had me accidentally screeching out of surprise and excitement.I personally think the movie is a combination of ""Vine"" and ""Pokémon Go"".

276,lunyo,Write a good review : $100,7,18 September 2016,"First of all I'd like to say that I'm a 23 year old male. Second, that though I love movies, I always have a secret pleasure watching teen movies, and I have watched so many of them I feel like I'm 17 again (like the movie)When I watched the trailer (that is not a good trailer as it gives away all the story), I thought to myself : Yay, a movie with Emma Roberts (my queen) and Dave Franco, a love story with two strangers playing dare or dare, a Heathers-like movie that starts well and ends off bloody, count me in, please.Okay, so I went to the movies, and sit at the back row and watched Emma Roberts being the opposite of the roles she usually plays. The two things I can say before starting are: - If you like teen movies with romance stories, you will find it. - And if you are looking for some darker, Pretty Little Liars's like story, you'll find it too... But none of these elements are actually perfected, which gives us a movie that is both teen movie-ish and dark-ish, without actually satisfying lovers of both genres.Stating the good points of these movies right away: - The esthetic and the way of filming, mostly at the beginning, is stunning. I won't spoil too much, but turning the movie into some kind of phone screen, and having the camera film from inside the screen, gives an overall very satisfying desert for our eyes. - The music is awesome, I actually went to get it on Spotify, one of the best soundtrack I heard in a teen-movie - Intense scenes are... Intense. The motorcycle dare is one of the most stressful things I have watched this year. - The story is somewhat compelling and interesting. I gives a Mean Girls vibe which is everything I have been dreaming of.There, the screening is enjoyable, but this is when it becomes cringy. The teen genre is a very coded genre, and you somewhat do not find the same appeal to the couple on the screen than you should have. The worst part is that it works, at the beginning, and then, it does not anymore. And this entire movie is like this. The first half is genius, the second half does not work anymore. Basically, I think that the director had an awesome idea for a film, and he made it work... Then he did not know what else to do, or something was blurry in his mind, and he kind of stumbled in the dark of his mind, trying to find a way to make his movie end.So all the bad points would be: - Second half of the movie is kind of hard to swallow. - The idea is good, and it works for the first part of the movie, but then it turns into a complete mess, and even if you understand where the director wants to lead you, you just don't buy it. - The critic of social medias and the need for today's youth to take risks, to live their lives fully because they feel oppressed in a society that tries to protect them too much (the fact that the mother does not want her daughter to leave the house in case something would happen to her is completely relevant to this overprotected, riskless life), kind of loses its flavor because it is not developed enough, it is not deep enough for us to actually feel enlightened.Overall, the last part of the movie feels like something you could watch on Disney Channel. I hated it. It is the kind of movie that you love, while you hate what they did to it because it could have been awesome-r. That movie frustrates you, but it is so worth to watch, one, because the first part of the movie is pretty good and intense, and two, because you will understand what a ""could-have-been-so-much-better- gosh-I-hate-this"" feeling is like.",Nerve

279,tianarhannemann,Not just a typical teenage movie,10,4 October 2016,"Nerve, directed by Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost, is a thriller about an online game luring risk-taking players seeking the excitement and money it brings. Although this movie is advertised to be full of adventure, romance, and comedy, the movie features underlying elements, such as internet safety, cyber bullying, and peer pressure. Thus, in the duration of just one hour and 46 minutes, Nerve is able to demonstrate these three often talked about topics amongst teens most effectively, because the scenarios are relatable and the film itself is very entertaining. The online game, Nerve, not only requires personal user information, but the game also hacks into the players' computers accessing all activity and media. However, these members trust the application, because ""all of the other teens"" are participating, so, therefore, it ""should be safe."" This is a common mindset that teens possess, because, at this age, teenagers tend to follow the crowd. Although internet safety is not the main focus of the movie, the movie exhibits, within the plot, realistic situations that can occur when private information is made public. For example, this connects to a popular application Instagram, because users regularly share the location of their posts. Most of these users do not realize that with these locations, Instagram creates a map with the pinpoints of all your photos. The majority post pictures from their home making it very easy for stalkers and criminals to locate you. Along with any social online program, comes cyber bullying. Players are constantly bullied based on the dares they choose to complete. If they attempt at a life threatening dare, they're a wimp. This is quite comparable to the modern app Vine. It is very trendy to post vines, six- second videos, of users doing risky things because the recorder continuously says, ""Do it for the vine."" Actors love the attention and feedback they receive, which leads into the third major element of the movie, which is peer pressure. In several scenes of the movie, the participants are pressured to hop out of their comfort zone even if it means risking their lives. The participants give into the pressure, which results in a fatal outcome. This could have all been prevented, though. Today, social users risk their lives every day to get the ""perfect selfie,"" especially in Hawai'i. Models enjoy standing on rocks with the waves crashing behind them. Little do they know that these breathtaking waves will literally take your breath away if you're not careful. It is common for oblivious visitors to get swept away by waves. Overall, this movie definitely killed two birds with one stone. Not only did Nerve serve entertainment purposes, but it also serves as a PSA showing users of the internet the dangers and cautions to take.",Nerve
280,ldevens,Daring Lovers Keep The Audience Wanting More,8,11 October 2016,"Venus, a timid high school senior, rashly decides to sign up for an online truth or dare game, minus the truth. The watchers pay to watch and players play to win cash prizes. Although Nerve, starring Emma Roberts and Dave Franco, emphasizes an intriguing truth or dare game, the concept of the app is extremely risky for civilians to engage in and the love of the leads is authentic, yet rushed, it leaves the audience with a curiosity of apps like Nerve and a want to see how their love flourishes.In the movie, players were dared to do things like; kiss a stranger, fart by civilians, flash an audience, sing in a diner, etc.. Later in the film, the dares grew increasingly more dangerous. I was expecting a more intense thriller after watching the trailer. But, the movie showed how teenagers can easily get too consumed into an event and made the audience think, if an app like this were to exist, would people actually behave this way? I caught myself thinking about concepts from this movie. That's when I knew it was a success. While watching this film, I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. I literally had to constrain myself from getting up and using the bathroom because it got so intense. What made the movie even better was the chemistry between the two leads. Their relationship was so real and compelling you want to continue watching their interactions after the movie ends. Although their love seems a bit rushed because the entire movie runs over a course of one night, I liked how everything seemed to be in real time. But, I know that style is not for everyone. Either way, it was exciting to watch the execution of these interesting dares, The concept of Nerve successfully lingered in my brain way after watching the movie.

281,pakvplk,Really Epic Thriller Movie,8,16 October 2016,"A really great thriller and action movie i have seen since a while, I am a huge fan of Emma Roberts as well and Dave Franco as well. What makes this movie more awesome than any other thriller movie i have seen is that it includes a video game that is incorporated with the real life, the game in which you have to choose either to be a player or a watcher, if you are a player then you have to the dares given by other people who are watching it, and the more intense a dare gets the more money you tend to earn from it, Now Emma Roberts who is acting as 'Vee' a girl who is like less socialized than her peers joins this game and meets 'Ian' in a restaurant and then a dare appears for her to kiss him, after this first dare she gets more obsessed into this game with Ian, where it tends to take a twist of story, at one point she had enough of the game she wanted to quit is but she couldn't quit it as she had broken one of the three laws of the game, At this point the game is a death game and she has to find a way to escape it, Im not going to explain this further because as it would be revealing too many spoilers, but i would recommend anyone who is interested in games incorporated with the real world (Like Pokemon Go)",Nerve

On this movie we can see too, the influence on the dynamics of group of social pressure and the conflict of affirmation and identity vs dissemination and integration in the group.

The emotions shown by Emma give a convincing and relate-able character which the audience can understand while Dave is more mysterious and interesting in contrast to Emma. Their plot was thrilling and tense while other sub plots in the film failed to show either traits and sort of let down the film a bit. The soundtrack was intelligently chosen and the casting of Dave and Emma obviously was a good choice. The only good sub plot was Dave's characters past and I liked how it was linked into his slightly broken personality, allowing the ""ah f*ck it"" choices he makes to make sense.

I think it is happening all over in our lifes, for example I think there is no one who doesn't have experince in their puberty as; drinking alcohol and hating it, but still drinking it because it is something you shouldn't as a teenager so you feel rebellious but actually you are doing this just because you want to be accepted by your friends.It was really enjoyable 96 minutes. The film was so exciting and fun while watching. I really like the style of it, there was generally dark scenes with some neon colors, it was pleasant to look at. About sounds; I think the story was getting stronger and much enjoyable with the songs played.The start of the movie was really good, you really get into the film from the start I think, but the ending was ordinary but I still got satisfied, (SPOILER) until I see the hand with the phone, taking video.Bad side of this movie starts when you start to question the story and events.

Overall, it was a great movie and it showed lots of pathos for the audience.",Nerve
293,marturacca,Surprisingly bad movie with no message at all.,1,1 July 2019,"The most prolific review says ""surprisingly sold with a good message"".
Sorry man, not for me.I saw this film recommended in a lot of websites.
Why would you recommend this?
The premise sounds fun. The rest, it doesn't.
Really really bad.Go get an ice-cream and enjoy it for 1hr and 36 min, you'll be much better..",Nerve

295,justinsteven92,I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit :),10,12 November 2016,"WARNING: THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW, MAINLY TO THE BOOK THOUGH, JUST A HEADS UP! I actually really enjoyed this movie! I did read the book beforehand (unfortunately I wasn't able to see it in theaters so I had to wait for the DVD release) but that's OK! Yes, the movie is different from the book in a lot of ways BUT I can understand why they would update it a bit since the book did come out roughly 4yrs ago (sometime in 2012). The main difference between the book & the movie in case you were wondering is the dares & the backstory of Vee. In the book it was assumed she tried to kill herself (Vee fell asleep in her car while it was parked in a closed garage listening to music but she forgot to turn the engine off so the exhaust fumes almost killed her) in the movie her brother died (I forgot how) but I felt like they replaced the original backstory with that one also in the book Vee was in ""lockdown"" from her accident because her parents though she tried to kill herself intentionally & her mom was VERY strict not wanting Vee to go anywhere after school & to come straight home everyday right after. Also in the book Vee was a theater/drama girl as was her best friend Sydney. The prizes were different as well, instead of cash they got actual prizes (things you would have on your Amazon wishlist or a new car for example) & lastly but not least the ending was very different as well but kept a little bit of theme from the book which was the whole gun situation but in the book the finalist were all locked in a room together (about 6 to 8 people I believe?) & they were all handed guns to see who would shoot first but I won't give the whole ending to the book away, lol. I honestly wish they kept the ending to the book in the movie though I think it would have made the movie a lot better! If you have seen the movie & haven't read the book yet I would read it since there are so many differences it doesn't spoil the book watching the movie first like most book to movie adaptions. All in all I think they did a good job on the movie & did good with what they had to work with I just wish they kept some more parts of the books in the movie. I really liked the lighting/coloring they used for the movie (bright neon colors) & the soundtrack to it was amazing as well! Lots of great songs that went perfectly with it :) If you like thrillers & keep an open mind I think you will enjoy this movie as well! It's not a masterpiece but it's definitely not a bad movie either, like I said just keep an open mind while watching it!",Nerve

297,jmichel_audi,No logic. A few questions.,1,17 December 2018,"Who's filming the shots, the people watching the dare? How incompetent is the NYPD? The film didn't establish the rules of the game. So, I'm left with no explanation of what the main characters can and cannot do. It needs to piece together a sense of logic, so we as the viewers can understand the rules and how the film/game works. The color palate was exhausting, it didn't set the tone appropriately.",Nerve
298,dominikadadova,Fight for your life.,10,24 January 2019,"Nerve is a 2016 American thriller adventure film. It was directed by Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman and written by Jessica Sharpez. The film stars are Emma Roberts, Dave Franco and Juliette Lewis.
Nerve is an online reality game where people can play this game as ""players"" or pay to watch as ""watchers"". Players accept dares voted on by watchers, try to become the winner of that day, and receive money. The main character called Vee, who is fearful, careful and boring and she has a friend Sydney who in contrast to her is really popular, adventurous and active. Sydney forced to sign in Vee as a player and here the story just begins. Vee was dared to kiss a stranger, get a tattoo, ride a motorbike. She was really good at this game a sydney started to be jelous, because she was better than her. Vee found out that someone was killed in this game and when they tried to warn police, they took their jobs, bank accounts and stole their indentities. Vee is now in secret third category of the game called ""prisoners"". If you are prisoner you will die or you can win the game and get everthying. I will not tell you how it will end. What i will say is that the movie keeps your interest right to the final minute. I really enjoyed the movie for a number of reasons. I identified with the main character the plot is really interesting, gripping and unusuall. But what I liked most was the idea of this movie and that was how social media influence our lives in negative way and we let them to controll our lives. I would definitly recommend it.",Nerve
