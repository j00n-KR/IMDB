0,MartinHafer,"Two angry, sullen hipsters....who try very hard not to try.",7,9 October 2017,"""Ghost World"" is not a film for everyone. Its characters are certainly unusual but not necessarily crowd-pleasers. It also features a vague ending...something which most film viewers would not appreciate.Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) just graduated from high school. However, they are far from the typical 17-18 year-olds. In many ways, they are like hipster versions of Daria (from the wonderful cartoon series)...but with a darker, nastier edge to them. They don't fit in with those around them and seem to enjoy giggling among themselves about how stupid and ridiculous everyone else is. However, through the course of the film, these two sullen young ladies who try very hard not to care find themselves caring. Rebecca finds a job and Enid invests her energy in a social outcast, Seymour (Steve Buscemi). All the while, their own relationship with each other becomes strained...mostly because their lives now are taking different directions. This film features some truly terrific acting. While Scarlett Johansson went on to great fame, the real stand out in this one is Thora Birch...who since has had a respectable but much more low profile career in pictures. The script also is very nice, with some interesting characters. I particularly thought the art teacher (Illeana Douglass) was fascinating...mostly because she was so very, very monumentally flawed as a human being. But it also suffers a bit because it's so very hard to care about these young ladies...at least until much later in the film. It would be easy to dislike them and just turn off the picture...which would be a mistake. A challenging and odd film...but worth seeing if you are patient and are looking for something different.",Ghost World
1,SnoopyStyle,slacker cool,9,23 September 2013,"Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are outsider recent high school grads best friends. They love Bollywood, have eccentric tastes, and can't relate to regular people. They rather make fun of them. They meet weirdo Seymour (Steve Buscemi) and make fun of him. He's socially awkward who collects old vinyls. Enid develops different opinions as she gets to know him while the best friends drift apart.These are absolutely entrancing characters. Not only are they slacker cool, but they are really deep characters. Their relationships are complex and these are great actors. It makes their final resolution that much more poignant and heart-breaking.",Ghost World
2,Prismark10,Ghost World,6,10 February 2021,"Ghost World is the anti John Hughes teen movies of the 1980s. The type of movies Hughes made such as The Breakfast Club, Some KInd of Wonderful, Pretty in Pink which were not quite as alternative or radical as many initially thought.Ghost World sets out its stall in the opening credits with a groovy dance scene from a 1960s Bollywood film. Enid (Thora Birch) is mimicking those moves.At the graduation ceremony at High School. Enid and best friend Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) make fun of a student who was disabled in a car crash. Enid liked her more when she was an alcoholic and a drug addict. Now she is little Miss Perfect in a wheelchair.Enid and Rebecca think they are too smart and choose to be outsiders with their piercing barbs at everyone they meet. After high school they have no plans for college or a career.It is Enid who really is a misfit. Rebecca isn more conventionally pretty, gets a job in a coffee shop and plans to move into an apartment.Enid does not realise that the best friends are drifting apart. Enid cannot hold down a job in a popcorn stand in a cinema.When Enid and Rebecca decide to play a trick on a dorky loner loser Seymour (Steve Buscemi.) Enid discovers that he really is a kind of kindred spirit.Seymour likes old records, vintage art posters and he works as an executive in some fried chicken outfit. His passion for art gives Enid an idea about her art class that she needs to do at summer school.Enid also tries to hook up Seymour with a girlfriend when she originally set him up with a fake date for a laugh.Directed by documentary maker Terry Zwigoff. Ghost World takes a layered look at the life of teenagers. It has a cult reputation simply because it knows that there are no easy answers to growing up.However I did regard both Enid and Rebecca as self absorbed narcissists. They were too consumed in their own smart ass view of the world. They had no empathy for anyone else. At least Enid shifted a little with Seymour but then became jealous when he did find someone.The best performance was from Buscemi who is the one character who has a heart tom give but no takers.",Ghost World

After graduating in high-school, they decide to get a job and rent a house of their own. However, Enid need to attend the Arts summer school to graduate and the unsociable behavior of Enid makes her lose her job. Meanwhile, they play a prank with Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a middle-age collector of long-plays record that feels also difficulties of relationship, and Seymour and Enid become friends. Along the days, Enid reaches maturity and a different view of life.""Ghost World"" is an excellent low-budget cult-movie nominated for Oscar in the category of Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published and awarded in another twenty-five (25) prizes plus twenty-four (24) nominations in different festivals. The caustic and mature adolescent-coming-to-age story is centered in the weird and rebel Enid facing and overcoming the need to join the real world after the high-school period, and is brilliantly directed by Terry Zwigoff, who also writes the wonderful screenplay with Daniel Clowes. The performance of Thora Birch, probably in her best role, also deserved a nomination to the Oscar. Scarlett Johansson, Steve Buscemi and the supporting cast are also awesome. I really loved ""Ghost World"" a lot, and I would like to thank my great movie-lover friend Ricardo that recommended this gem.

4,classicsoncall,"""I can't relate to ninety nine percent of humanity.""",7,24 April 2018,"Teenage angst gets a workout in this film with the principal characters and best friends Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johannson) going in somewhat separate directions over the course of the story. Even upon high school graduation, their acerbic putdowns of fellow classmates and other unlucky targets position them outside the mainstream, and they revel in the fact. However after agreeing to become roommates upon graduation, it's only Rebecca who seems to buckle down to a level of responsibility by finding a job and getting a bit more 'serious' about impending adulthood. Enid meanwhile stumbles around in an existential haze in an attempt to find that ever elusive 'meaning of life'. As teens and young adults, we might all have been there at one time or another. A cruel prank is at the center of this story as Enid responds to a Personals column by leaving a message for hapless, old-time record collector Seymour (Steve Buscemi). When it backfires, it puts Enid even more at odds with herself for her failure to foresee unintended consequences. I thought it kind of interesting that Seymour eventually entered therapy wearing the green cardigan that he had on when he 'felt a connection' with Dana (Stacey Travis) before ever actually meeting her. That was a telling moment for how productive his sessions might have turned out, as he leaves with his mother and the therapist just rolls her eyes. What I thought the film did successfully was broach a topic in our culture that's become distinctly more partisan since the picture came out, that of attempting to have an honest conversation about racism. It opened a door in the story but didn't take it to any conclusion other than to ostracize Enid even more for trying to make a statement. The ambiguous ending of the movie accentuates Enid's lonesome quest to somehow relate to the world and find some meaning for herself, and leaves little optimism about her finding it any time soon. In a way, she might have been taking the subliminal advice offered on the park bench at the bus stop by temporarily taking herself 'out of service'.",Ghost World
5,gavin6942,Incredibly Depressing Because It Was Just So True,8,20 July 2006,"Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johannsen) are finally ready to graduate high school. But as they find themselves growing up, they may also be growing apart. Enid becomes closer to an older man, Seymour (Steve Buscemi), who collects old records. Rebecca, on the other hand, is turning more ""normal"", getting a job at The Coffee Experience (a clear Starbucks ripoff) and hunting for apartments. Can their friendship survive the rift? Brad Renfro also appears as the girls' friend Josh who drives them around.""Dear Josh, we came by to (sleep with) you, but you were not home. Therefore... you are gay. Signed Tiffany, and Amber."" That note left in the film was so amusing, if nothing else had worked they hooked me with this scene. Of course, as you can guess by the ""8 out of 10"", they sold me in many other ways.And also, even if this film was a pile of dung, the cast alone would have carried it. Steve Buscemi is amazing and needs bigger roles. Thora Birch -- especially at the point -- is the ultimate heroine. And Scarlett Johannsen, before anyone really knew who she was, had appeal to audiences across the board. The way these characters interact could work for hours on end... a television series would have been perfect. And i have to say, there's nothing ""dung"" about this film -- the directing is awesome and the writing is better than most of the independent films out there. ""Ghost World"" continues the greatness that ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" and ""Buffalo 66"" started and seems a good inspiration for ""Juno"".If you were an outcast in high school, you sympathize with Enid and you may even find her unconventionally attractive for her style and interests. (You have to admit the Batgirl mask is hot.) This is the girl you would have loved to be friends with in high school if you knew she existed. And one of the best scenes, Enid working at a movie theater, is something anyone who ever worked fast food can identify with. There are so many great scenes and great lines -- David Cross even makes a good cameo as a hebephilic record collector -- that it's hard to write a review without wanting to quote them. I should say that by far the best role in the film was captured by David Sheridan (""Scary Movie""), as the loiterer Doug, who looks just like Gunther (from Gunther and the Sunshine Girls). His karate fighting and bashing of the Greeks was comic genius (the Greeks gave us two things, can you guess what they are?). And the soundtrack. I may not be into blues... but they made blues cool in this film. I could get into what Seymour was trying to push. If you haven't seen ""Ghost World"", this is a film you have to own. Rarely do I see a film that really hits home and seems so timeless, but this is one. I wish Thora Birch and Scarlett Johannsen were like this today... but they're not (please, Thora, eat a sandwich). And if nothing else, the feminist artist is smoking hot. (I enjoyed this picture while downing large quantities of Scoresby Scotch -- the Scotch of the connoisseur -- but you need not be imbibing to fully appreciate this masterpiece.)",Ghost World
6,lee_eisenberg,Now THIS is a movie!,10,21 October 2005,"""Ghost World"" has high school outcasts Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) finally figuring out how to get back at the world that ignored them, via loner Seymour (Steve Buscemi). Everyone does a great job in their roles, and some of the scenes are hilarious (particularly the ""8 1/2"" scene). The world's outsiders will just love this movie. Even though Enid and Rebecca are outcasts, everyone will be able to relate to them. The Coon Chicken Inn is disturbing, but in the movie for a good reason. ""Ghost World"" is one of the many movies showing why indie flicks are better than Hollywood movies, and you'd better believe that it makes that point. Truly a gem of a movie.",Ghost World
7,Woodyanders,A deliciously wry portrait of teenage alienation,9,9 August 2017,"Disaffected teenage outcast Enid (a spot-on snarky performance by Thora Birch) and her equally sullen best friend Rebecca (a marvelously sour and aloof portrayal by Scarlett Johansson) find themselves at a crossroads in the wake of graduating from high school. Moreover, Enid feels sorry for fellow misfit Seymour (beautifully played with lovely hangdog grace by Steve Buscemi) after playing a cruel prank on him.Director Terry Twigoff, who also co-wrote the witty and perceptive script with Daniel Cloves, savagely skewers the stifling conformity of conventional consumerist small-town America, poignantly addresses the basic human need to fit in and belong even if it's on the fringes of society, maintains a splendidly dry'n'deadpan tone throughout, adroitly captures the awkward transition from adolescence to adulthood (Rebecca wants to grow up and get her own apartment while Enid tries to avoid thinking about what she's going to do with the rest of her life), and concludes things on a haunting ambiguous note. Moreover, it's acted with aplomb by a top-rate cast, with especially praiseworthy contributions from Illeana Douglas as ditsy overzealous art teacher Roberta, Brad Renfro as the easygoing Josh, Bob Balaban as Enid's nerdy ineffectual dad, Stacey Travis as the sweet Dana, Charles C. Stevenson as patient old man Norman, and David Sheridan as antagonistic goofball Doug. Affonso Beato's vibrant color cinematography provides a pleasing bright look. Great soundtrack of vintage blues tunes, too. A real treat.",Ghost World
8,rmax304823,Urban Anomi.,7,4 March 2015,"It's a spiritual quest masquerading as a romantic drama masquerading as a teen comedy about two girl just out of high school.The girls are Scarlett Johansson with stunning features, a voice that occasionally croaks, and a mammoth bosom; and Thora Birch, a pudgy Jewish girl with glasses that define her as a loser. The two friends wander about the boulevards and empty residential areas of Los Angeles, making vulgar wisecracks to the weirdos they run into. There is, for instance, an old man sitting at a bus stop, waiting for a bus whose route was canceled years ago. ""That's what you think,"" he replies.The girls are very close, as only two people who hate everyone around them can be close. But their interests diverge when they run into a weirdo whose weirdness awakes a dormant thirst for something beautiful and entirely different in Birch, but not in Johansson, who prefers disgust.The catalyst is Steve Buscemi. The girls play a rather nasty prank on him. He's a pathetic loner with an eccentric obsession -- traditional jazz records. He sells them on Saturdays in a kid of front-yard souk. The girls twit him, asking if he has any Hindi rock music. Birch prefers heavy metal but she buys an old record from him anyway, out of curiosity, and finds herself moved by an old blues song.We see less of Johansson and her bosom as the movie follows Birch's blossoming attraction to Buscemi, who lives in a room that resembles a museum of hundred-year-old vernacular art. If self esteem could be measured, Buscemi's would register in the negative range. As Birch's home life become less tolerable, she plans to move in with Buscemi but changes her mind. Buscemi, almost against his will, takes up with a woman his own age, Stacy Travis, who is enough to disentangle any man from his affair with a portly teen ager.I don't think I'll describe the ending. Well, maybe I will. That old man sitting at the bus stop, waiting for the bus that will never come? It comes. And he gets on it and goes. Having lost everything, Thora Birch watches another bus come. She gets on it and goes.I'm sure the arrival and departure of the bus was symbolic but I don't know of what. After bouncing like a pinball between life at home, the dissolution of a warm friendship, and her affair with Buscemi, she hasn't really found anything. Rather, she's lost it. She hasn't developed a taste for blues. There really isn't anything left but disappointment and despair.All the performances are fine. No one is better than anyone else, although Bob Balaban, as Birch's indulgent father, has the best comic lines. The story is full of color and repulsion. I wish the writer, Daniel Clowes, had imagined a less allegorical end to it because that final scene just doesn't fit.At any rate, this is several steps above the expected trash about teens, sex, love, ambition, etc. I mean, it isn't, say, ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High.""",Ghost World
9,BA_Harrison,One for us geeks.,7,23 September 2008,"Thora Birch (surely the perfect poster girl for all nerds, male and female) stars as Enid, an intelligent, artistic and sensitive girl who becomes friends with obsessive record collector Seymour (Steve Buscemi) after playing a mean joke on him. As her relationship with Seymour develops, her bond with school-friend Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) begins to crumble.Akin in many ways to introspective indie fare such as Lost in Translation, Napolean Dynamite, American Beauty, Secretary, and Sideways, Ghost World is a quirky, meandering, satirical study of social outcasts in a world that demands conformity, and, as such, isn't going to find much of a following with your average Blockbuster crowd.Those hoping to see a laugh-out-loud comedy should definitely seek entertainment elsewhere: although there are some painfully accurate insights into the lives of its likable losers that will bring a wry smile to the faces of those who don't quite qualify as normal, the droll humour will leave Mr and Mrs. Average Joe straight faced and reaching for the off switch.And anyone looking for a film with a feel-good factor should also hit the stop button: if you're not in the mood for a film that takes a leisurely, measured approach to a tale about doomed relationships and uncertainty about the future, you'll find the film rather annoying.There are those, however, for whom the film will definitely resonate and no doubt become a firm favourite: disaffected youths, geeks, losers, and weirdos who are able to identify with the main characters' lack of direction in life and sense of confusion at the world around them. They (or should that be 'we'?) will be the ones to fully appreciate this subtle and poignant cinematic journey of self-discovery, which delivers excellent performances from its talented cast (Buscemi, in particular, is superb), confident direction from Terry Zwigoff, and a memorably daft character who sports a mean mullet and a pair of nunchuks!",Ghost World
10,moonspinner55,Deadpan comic revulsion,7,30 October 2002,"Two female high school grads plan to get jobs and hang together, but bonds become frayed and paths separate after one of the girls ends up on an unintended journey of self-discovery. From the comic-book which takes a perverse delight in celebrating the geeky side of all of us, ""Ghost World"" is profane and cynical, but also surprisingly blithe and bright. I rather enjoyed it but realize it's not for every taste. Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson are incredibly rich and vivid in their roles (low-keyed, deadpan, but not blanks); their love-hate friendship is convincing and blessedly free of melodramatics--even they seem to cherish the personality conflicts that come up, it may give them more ammunition. As for the ending, I'm not sure whether it is ingenious or a cop-out, but it did leave me touched (in a bemused, nostalgic way). A movie with much to offer. *** from ****",Ghost World
11,Quinoa1984,One of the better films of 2001,10,17 February 2002,"Ghost World is an (somewhat) original, bleak but continuously interesting picture about alienated teenage girls with no where to go after graduation. One of these girls is Endid (Thora Birch in a fine performance that is wide in range), a true cynic and loner who soon finds a weird relationship (not sexual) with a 78 rpm collector (Steve Buscemi in his best performance in a while).  Not much plot, but there's a lot to look at, with an enveloping story and characters that are built out of reality so much you can see why director Zwigoff (made 2 documentaries before) chose to make this.  Not totally easy to take, but it is good film-making nevertheless. A-",Ghost World

It was adapted by director Terry Zwigoff and writer Daniel Clowes from the latter's 1990s non-super-hero comic book...The film's story leaves the ""Enid"" and ""Rebecca"" relationship and focuses, instead, on the one Ms. Birch's ""Enid"" forms with geeky 78-rpm record collector Steve Buscemi (as Seymour). The characterizations are excellent, the angst and alienation themes are telegraphed well, though there isn't anything particularly original here.

Enid is a dark-haired arch cynic who is tired of living at home with her ineffectual dad and his annoyingly perky girlfriend Maxine, while Rebecca is prettier and a bit cheerier, but no more certain about her future. While the two girls have vague plans of getting an apartment together, they seem content to while away their summer hanging out and indulging in their shared infatuation with Josh, a friend from school who works at a convenience store and doesn't seem to be especially attracted to either of them. Enid discovers that in order to get her diploma, she'll have to take an additional class over the summer, where she winds up studying art with Roberta, who is determined to encourage Enid's creative impulses, whether she likes it or not. More significantly, Enid meets Seymour, a geeky record collector more than twice her age, and while they would seem to have little in common, Enid discovers a kindred spirit in fellow misfit Seymour, who shares her disgust with the world around them, and a relationship begins to develop between the two. Although the movie had an interesting premise about a touching study of alienation that comes with no easy answers or excuses for those who cannot seem to connect in life,I found it boring and mundane for most parts.But nevertheless,the theme was completely original and brand new for teen-age movies.The performances of Birch,a young Johansson and Buscemi were commendable.Also,inspite of the brilliant screenplay,the viewer maybe left with an unsatisfying feeling in this dramedy due to its numbing pace and laughs that aren't really funny.",Ghost World
15,jotix100,Comic book relief,8,26 October 2004,"""Ghost World"" is worth watching because of the wonderful aura created by its director, Terry Zwigoff, who has an eye for presenting an unconventional situation with humor and intelligence.The movie enjoys the magnificent presence of its principals, Steve Buscemi, Thora Birch, and Scarlett Johansson. These three actors are wonderful portraying roles that need an unusual understanding because they live at the edge of what society takes for normalcy. Thora Birch, above all, as Enid, does one of the best characterizations of her young career. She is a force to be reckoned with, and who will go to bigger and better things in the movies. Enid is the girl that rebels about her life. The mischievous Enid is instrumental in luring Seymour to show up for a fictitious date with a woman who he has met briefly, only to make fun of him. She ends up being attracted to him because she sees qualities in this lost soul that she doesn't see in her world.Steve Buscemi, as Seymour, has a creepiness that is easily misunderstood for weirdness, but this is a lonesome soul in search of a happiness that has eluded him most of his life. Seymour is in reality an optimist because he wants to get things that are not readily available to him because of the personality he emits to would be friends. It's Mr. Buscemi's achievement to have given life to this simple man with his innate talent.Finally, Scarlett Johansson, is a smashing Rebecca, Enid's best friend.

Actually, Enid (Thora Birch) is forced to take a summer art class so she can graduate because her grades were so poor. These two hang out together like twins and live to aggravate Josh (Brad Renfro) who works as a convenience school clerk. After they tire of making Josh's life miserable, they pick on another man, Seymour (Steve Buscemi of ""Pulp Fiction""), because Enid reads an advertisement in the newspaper about a man who saw a beautiful woman and wants her to contact him. As a prank, Enid phones Seymour and pretends that she is the lady in the ad and sets up a blind date with him at a local diner. Enid and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) think that Seymour is a dork and they bring along Josh to protect them. Nothing happens. They watch Seymour show up, have a milkshake, and leave. Zwigoff and Clowes populate ""Ghost World"" with a variety of characters and Steve Buscemi steals the show as a blues lover. The humor is decidedly deadpan and Zwigoff lets us decide if we love or hate the characters.

But tensions arise when Johannson gets a job, starts thinking about her future and matures generally, while Birch begins to feel more and more stuck, still mad at the world but increasingly bothered by the fact that she doesn't have a place in it. The thing I liked most about the film is that it doesn't pass judgement on either girl. It doesn't try to make us dislike Johannson for ""selling out"" and it doesn't make a hero out of Birch for her alternative chic. Instead, it addresses frankly the tricky job of developing an adult personality whether or not you're ready to do so.Steve Buscemi does nice work as a middle-aged geek whom the girls are a little too quick to label.Grade: A",Ghost World

19,zetes,Bittersweet coming-of-age story,9,4 February 2002,"It's actually a bit difficult for me to pull myself out of this material. Enid's life is a lot like my own experience, or at least my own attitude, when I reached the end of high school. And now, half a decade later, I'm growing into Seymour at a rapid rate (with movies instead of music). I imagine that Seymour is a lot like Zwigoff, and I feel like I must be like him. His misanthropy is very much like my own. You stare at everyone, and they all seem to fit into a specific slot so entirely well. The concept of individuality seems like a joke. How about the guy with the nunchucks? A character who should have seemed like a gross cartoon, hell, can anyone honestly say they haven't seen people just like him? You think you're the only person who differs at all from all the others. Do you hear the kind of crappy music they listen to? The kind of bad films they watch?But then, take a step back. That is what this film does for me. Seymour and Enid think they don't fit into a slot, but, well, unfortunately they do. Which is why I can so easily fit myself into their places at different times in my own life. And make sure to note that Seymour says to Enid several times during the film, ""Yeah, I felt like that when I was your age, too."" Sometimes it's sickening how no one seems to differ.The film is not perfect, however. Enid's schitck does get old after a while. My biggest problem, though, is the ending. SPOILERS. The trip on the mystery bus seems like a poetic ending at first, but, really, to me it seems more like a cop-out. The film isn't exactly going for realism. There is a lot of exaggeration. However, I think that it needed a more down-to-earth ending, one where some sort of decision was made. That would show that Enid has passed a point of no return, that she has grown. That magical bus ride is nothing more than an escape, an easy way out, an evasion.END SPOILERSThis film was directed by Terry Zwigoff, who directed one of my favorite films of all time, Crumb. Crumb, in my not-so-very-humble opinion, is one of the most perfect films ever made, and easily the best documentary I've ever seen. That film was released in 1994. Zwigoff made one documentary before that, I think in the mid-1980s, but I'm not sure. I haven't seen it, but perhaps I should seek it out. Anyhow, please, please, please, Terry, don't let another seven years pass before you direct another film. I'm pretty sure that Ghost World was relatively successful. It has been a critical smash, at any rate (well, that hardly matters). Please, find something or write something that you find worthy and make another film out of it. Trust me, if you send out another one as good as this in a couple of years, you'll be a household name. 9/10.",Ghost World
20,Smells_Like_Cheese,I don't know,6,13 January 2007,"I never heard of Ghost World until my sister lent me this movie telling me how awesome it was and that I would definitely get into it. So I watched it twice yesterday thinking maybe I was just in a certain mood when I saw it, but actually I came up with the same results, I thought it was just an alright movie. My main problem is that Thora Birch normally plays the same character over and over again, the rebellious teen who doesn't know what she wants. My only plus of the film was seeing Steve Buchemi, he just rocks and I felt so bad for him in this film.Well, Ghost World is about these two ""rebelious"" teens who have just graduated high school, but Enid(played by Birch) has to take an art class to earn her diploma, while her and her friend are reading a wanted ad for love, they find one for a guy who met a girl at a library and the guy is looking for that girl since he felt a connection, they prank him into a fake blind date. But Enid gets to know him a little later to find that he's a very ""cool""(by her standards) guy and they end up having an affair.That's the summed up version of this story, it could go on, because this is your typical Maury Show episode of twisted love and well, I just really didn't like Enid. I think that's maybe what killed the movie for me, because she just wasn't at all a likable character that just needed a good swift kick in the butt. Well, I can tell people for some odd reason love this film, so I know I'm going to get my butt kicked for only giving it a 6, but I just thought it was an alright film, you know? 6/10",Ghost World
21,=G=,Disappointing dark open-ended tongue-in-cheek satire,7,5 February 2002,"In ""Ghost World"", Birch is at the center as a disaffected recent high school grad with a bad attitude the source of which is never made clear save the fact that she's surrounded by cliched caricatures and, in fact, is one herself.   At odds with the world, she wanders out of a relationship with her best friend (Johansson, Manny & Lo) and into one with a middle aged man (Buscemi) who becomes her hero as he's the only ""normal"" character in the film's comic book world.""Ghost World"" is a good shoot technically and artistically. However, it -is- pulp fiction on film and appropriately exaggerated making empathy or any emotional buy-in difficult.

22,MovieAddict2016,Good but certainly not without its flaws,6,9 December 2004,"""Ghost World"" is a funny comedy from Terry Zwigoff about two teenaged girls in a small middle-America town and their unique outlook on life. Scarlett Johansson and Thora Birch are the leads, but Birch in particular is a stand-out and co-star Steve Buscemi (""Fargo"") is wonderful as always and a real scene-stealer.Unfortunately the film isn't quite as witty as I had hoped, at least not evenly. In particular it falters in the mid-section and many sequences could have been altogether cut from the finished product without harming its effect Ã¢â¬"" running at about 120 minutes this is certainly a heavy ""comedy""! I remember Danny DeVito once said a comedian has failed if he makes a film longer than 90 minutes (or something to this effect) and I totally understand what he means Ã¢â¬"" many comedies that are two hours long suffer from overlong scenes.""Ghost World"" is a bit of a drama, though, so I guess I can understand it being long Ã¢â¬"" but that doesn't excuse the fact that it doesn't need to be as long as it is! Overall this movie amused me and I enjoyed a number of the sequences but it really doesn't feel like an independent production Ã¢â¬"" more like a mainstream Hollywood movie trying to hide underneath the false image of an indie flick. Buscemi's directorial debut, ""Trees Lounge,"" is a much better exploitation of suburban life and depression and relationships between middle-aged men and teenaged girls Ã¢â¬"" it's cleverer, sharper and more memorable. And if you enjoy ""Ghost World"" I can also heartily recommend some other similar independent films that really _are_ independent.

23,Red-Barracuda,Extremely good coming-of-age tale,9,6 February 2013,"Ghost World is an example of how a teen movie should be made. Unlike most films of that grouping, this one has considerable intelligence. One of the reasons for this is that it's a film that truly understands the adolescent mind-set. The teens in this movie may well be hyper-cynical and too cool for school but they are also portrayed as very vulnerable and somewhat lost. Consequently, they feel quite real and will remind you of how you used to be or of others that you knew.It's a coming-of-age story about two adolescent girls who have just graduated from high school. They are at a crossroads, unsure of where they are going to go with their lives. They pull a cruel prank on a middle aged nerd called Seymour but this unexpectedly results in one of the girls Enid realising that he is something of a kindred spirit of sorts and she forms a close bond with him.Enid is the central character here. She is excellently played by Thora Birch who had a similar outsider role in American Beauty. But here she is much more prominent. She certainly captures the bravado and insecurities of the character well. Steve Buscemi is equally great in the role of Seymour. He is also a character that feels very authentic, another lost soul in the world.I never even knew this was based on a graphic novel when I first saw it. But it is clearly not a typical one, as the events in this story are very mundane. I don't mean this in an insulting way though because it's the way that everyday life is made to be so interesting that is the movie's overall strength. The characters are all very good. The leads are well drawn, while there are some funny peripheral ones, like the mullet man who hangs about the shop. The mix of comedy and drama is very well done. Both compliment each other with genuinely funny moments combined with some heart-felt drama. It's all in all a very satisfying whole; and it will give you more insight into the pains of growing up and most other teen movies ever will and if you have ever felt lost and alone in the world then it will speak to you too.",Ghost World
24,KineticSeoul,Constant mockery and hypocrisy,7,28 July 2016,"When I first saw this movie as a kid I had no idea what this movie was about. Just thought the title ""Ghost World"" made it seem like a fun movie. I thought maybe it would be something similar to movies like ""Pleasantville"". With the two girls dealing with supernatural activities in a very awkward manner. However this movie is about two awkward hipster girls in a strange suburban area. These are the most cynical female duo that see the negative in just about everytthing while constantly judging others. Especially the girl named Enid. They basically go around putting people down that is almost as depressed as they are. While trying to diminish others from having a bit of hope. Because they are sad about their own existence. Kind of like some of the groups out there that puts out some of the most illogical causes. While trying to put others down for trying to achieve just about anything and thus go around acting like they are superior to everyone else. Watching this movie was like watching acts that can make you very hated by others. From the girl duo, I especially disliked the girl Enid. She is even mean to her only hipster friend Rebecca and tries to drag her down as well. You know those people that claim to be your friend but is the biggest anchor on your side. Well that is Enid in this film. Watching this movie was like watching the journey of one of the most annoying female leads ever and yet it's engaging. Mainly because of the bizarre style of it all and it's direction. How it doesn't compliments and endorse the actions of the lead but you kind of feel bad for her in the end to a degree. Although she is a anchor, her only friends are insecure people like herself. She is a character that bashes on things she find childish, but isn't ready for adulthood either and wants to grasp on to her childhood despite it all. It even shows the biased actions of a radical feminist teacher to kind of show the similaries between the two. Although this film does get a bit annoying after-awhile with it's constant showing of mockery and hypocrisy. This is a watchable movie about a girl that is running from herself and wants to be anyone but herself. I did like the subtle messages around the imagery and characters with their motives and why they do the things they do. 7.5/10",Ghost World
25,paul2001sw-1,The Real American Beauty,8,12 December 2004,"Thora Birch starred in 'American Beauty', a funny movie that was sadly over-hyped, pretentious, glossy and an attack on hypocrisy not without a few easy hypocrisies of its own (the take home message seemed to be that to work in a regular job to buy a middle class home is shameful and materialistic, but to sell drugs to buy photographic equipment is cool). She also appears (alongside a very young Scarlett Johanson, and a typecast Steve Buscemi) in the much superior 'Ghost World', a film with a narrower but related focus (the life of teenagers in suburban society), but in character less preachy and much more humane. Director Terry Zwigoff, and Birch herself, combine in an excellent portrayal of the latent power of teenage girls just beginning to play with their own sexuality, a common subject in Hollywood films but usually handled with little subtlety. By contrast, Birch is excellent as the girl who turns from cool to loser almost without knowing how.Another merit of 'Ghost World' is its understated stylisation, reminiscent in mood of the early films of Hal Hartley (which also had a suburban setting), but visually much richer (whereas Hartley depended more on dialogue to create a similar effect). In many ways, it's the film that at least one half of 'American Beauty' was trying to be, but wasn't. And even though there may be hundreds of other superficially similar movies, it stands out through eschewing the excess, sentiment and morality which sadly spoil most of its competitors; and also for its light artistic touch.",Ghost World
26,gbill-74877,Alienation,8,25 August 2019,"Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are a couple of outcasts who graduate high school together and face entering the real world. They're awkward and unsure what their next steps is in life will be, see phoniness all around, and are unable to conjure positive attitudes about much of anything. I would say that in other words they're teenagers, but they take it to an extreme, Enid especially. The movie is populated with lots of pretty simple characters which make easy targets for their cynicism, but one of them, an older guy who collects old blues records (Steve Buscemi), strikes Enid as someone who is genuine. She probably also relates to him as a fellow misfit, and while she still thinks of him as a dork, they form an unlikely friendship.The trouble with Enid is that while she hates how false and judgmental people are in the world around her, she is so negative and judgmental herself that she hasn't yet figured out that she's part of the problem, and she strains the few friendships she has. The film is unapologetic in this character, and we are only given little glimmers of a warmer, positive side to her. That makes her hard to like, but the film has an honesty about it, and many may relate at least a little. It reminded me a little bit of Jack Nicholson in 'Five Easy Pieces' because I had just seen it, and which is about another person trying to find himself. People who are alienated and suffering sometimes do hurtful and stupid things, thus furthering the downward spiral they're on. What ultimately happens to such people in life? The ending allows for different interpretations, and has emotional power.",Ghost World

I felt there was no action or any interesting scenes that were included in the movie. It was bad enough that great actors were involved in this such as Scarlett Johansson. She would ve been better off if she just said no to this, that will make her career fo smoothly rather than this being above her head!This movie sucks, I wish IMDb would give us the chance to rate this 0.

29,kenjha,Wonderful World,8,3 April 2009,"After finishing high school, two angst-ridden girls spend a summer contemplating an uncertain future. There isn't much of a plot; it's an episodic look at bored teens trying to connect with the world around them. Birch is terrific as one of the teens while Johansson shows early flashes of star power. Buscemi excels as a shy, middle-aged collector of 78 rpm records with whom Birch strikes up a relationship. Douglas is amusing as an eccentric art teacher. Zwigoff's direction is assured in his first fictional film after a couple of documentaries. The script by Clowes, who adapted his comic book, is not only laced with humor but also includes keen observations about life and love.",Ghost World
30,The-Sarkologist,Teenage Angst is still Teenage Angst,9,7 October 2021,"This is basically Catcher in the Rye, though there are some differences between the two (ignoring the obvious, namely that one is a book - it has never been turned into a movie - while the other is a comic, and Ghost World focuses on a woman, while Catcher in the Rye focuses on a man). The main difference is that Catcher in the Rye has the protagonist, Holden, flee the familiar surroundings of his school to wander around New York (though it becomes apparent that his family lives in New York, so he is quite familiar with the city), while Enid spends the entirety of the film wandering around her suburb.Yet the similarities are striking, as both deal with teenagers that are on the cusp of adulthood, and find that the world is changing around them significantly. It isn't that the world itself is changing, it is just that their perception of the world is changing, and they are both fighting against the driving nature of society that forces them into the conformity of the adult world. In fact, they are discovering that the rules of being able to participate in the adult world are vastly different from the world in which they existed as children.I would say that Ghost World is The Catcher in the Rye for the 90s, but in reality the experiences that Holden faced, and the experiences that Enid face are no different. Sure, we are talking about stories that are set 40 years apart, but while the concept of teenage agnst is unique to our post industrial democratic society, it is still something that exists, and it is still something that all of us experience as we move from the relative innocence of childhood into the adult world.The unwritten rules are certainly something that is explored, as is the fact that our actions have consequences. In fact, the idea that our actions having consequences is something that stands out a lot in the film. We actually see the reprecusions of the choices that Enid makes as we move through the film. For instance, the work of art that she creates as a means to challenge racism ripples throughout the closed community that is the unnamed suburb in which she lives, though interestingly she doesn't see, or experience, up close the results of this.Actually, Seymour is the prime example of how our actions have consequences, as we see how the relationship that Enid has with him completely destroys his life. The reality is that Enid just doesn't seem to have any concept of a reality beyond her immediate needs, yet we are given a glimpse into Seymour's life as to how his innocence is also destroyed by Enid's actions.The other interesting thing is how Enid begins to grow apart from her friends, or at least the only friend that she has. They begin the film being as thick as thieves, but by the end of the film she is alone. In fact, she spends the second half of the film simply wandering around the streets by herself. It seems as if Rebecca begins to adjust to becoming and adult, and interacting in the adult world, while Enid is resistant to change. Like, they begin their relationship with Seymour simply by playing a prank on him, but as they begin to grow apart, Enid gets closer to Seymour, yet in part she still doesn't really know what she wants.Seymour is quite a tragic character though, and it is certainly different to the roles that Buschemi generally plays, yet he picks up and runs with the role really, really well. In a way it really seems to suit him, the introvert who finds it difficult to simply say no. The thing is that in Seymour Enid discovers a kindred soul, which is why she says what she says to him at the end. In fact, the ending seems to be similar to the ending in Catcher in the Rye, though it does seem that the roles are reversed. What is so tragic about the position Seymour finds himself in at the end is that he basically didn't do anything wrong. It is just the fact that his character is so, well, accepting of people, and he finds it really hard to say no. Personally, I don't think Enid did anything wrong either, namely because it is very clear that she simply doesn't know what she wants - in a way she is lost in a Ghost World, a world where people just drift about aimlessly, yet in part she is aimless as well. The fact that she is going through multiple phases is clear there.It's a rather sad film, yet it does portray quite well the nature of living in a post industrial society, a world where we simply wander around like zombies, with no meaning or understanding of what we want. In fact, it simply seems to be the curse of freedom, but even then, with the freedom that we have, there are still many places where we are in chains. When Enid gets her first job, she suddenly discovers that she simply isn't as free as she thought she was.Yeah, this film is pretty much The Catcher in the Rye - it explores the same themes, and simply shows us that little has changed over the forty years between the two works. In fact, it almost feels as if there is something of a homage, particularly since there are numerous 50s tracks played. It's not well know, but it certainly does have a well deserved cult status.",Ghost World

This man can't seem to relate to women but has a drive to possess one like he does old records; totally unaware that his longing is merely a reflection of his inner emptiness which cannot be filled by a human presence.

How could a movie make people want to have friends like Seymour and Enid? I'm serious. I'd really want to meet people like them! Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi deliver high level, great performances. Their acting skills are just part of the big success of the movie. But the script is what really makes this movie a winner. I was immediately into every situation and every dialog. It's like your own life is displayed in the film... talking about missed opportunities and the problems of personality after high school is over. The settings, score, and cinematography are excellent. This is a perfect representation of the new millennium. This kind of film making (not 100% Hollywood) is quality. The character of Enid is a solid representation of how clueless someone can be just for being on a certain age. And that is just normal. Through Enid's eyes we learn that this life is full of surprises and that no one has a pre determined destiny. Yes she loses important opportunities but she is loyal to her ideas. Her family situation is not the best but that doesn't affects her life that much. She has a best friend that always supports her. She seems to have a perfect life but it's just too difficult when you are in the process of becoming mature. The ending is satisfying because it leaves for your interpretation to wonder what will happen to Enid. Apparently, Rebecca, Seymor, and Enid's dad got what they wanted. Enid is an open interpretation. In my opinion, you can imagine whatever you want towards Enid's future.Recommended for everyone who wants to take a break from Hollywood productions.",Ghost World

36,dfranzen70,Mean Girl saves Super Dork,7,14 August 2008,"In retrospect, seven years after its initial release, Ghost World rings a little hollow, sort of like costar Scarlett Johannson's character later, in Lost in Translation, and Steve Buscemi's character Seymour here. It's not helped by a particularly vicious and selfish lead character, played by Thora Birch, but it IS helped by finding its heart and soul about three-quarters of the way in. How much this movie appeals to you will depend on how well you identify with Birch's Enid, an iconoclast who delights in her displeasure with just about everything and everybody. But it's how her character relates to Buscemi's schlubby Seymour, with a relationship that evolves from cruel to curious to tender, that might well sell you on the entire premise.Enid and Becky (Birch and Johannson) are recent high school grads who don't quite buy in to the optimistic and/or clueless nature of their fellow classmates. They're sort of like Goths without the monochrome wardrobe. The girls are the sort who like to hassle fellow classmates - including their friend Josh (the late Brad Renfro), who works at a local convenience store - just for kicks. They're like the Mean Girls without the awesome hair. At any rate, they're looking for trouble one day when they decide to answer a personals ad just to mess with the sender. They set up a blind date; snickering behind their hands, they watch Seymour get stood up by the date that would never arrive.But that's only the beginning of things, as the trio find themselves drawn together, improbably. Enid, a perpetual loner, is intrigued by the self-described dorky Seymour, who's content with his old-time interests (including a vast 78-rpm record collection) and has basically given up on a life outside of his apartment and job. Becky, on the other hand, is a bit skeptical of the budding relationship between her best friend and Seymour, who's certainly much older than either of them.Although this may seem like a study of what happens to two conniving girls after they pull a prank on someone who's totally not cool, it's really the story of the evolution of Enid's character - in fact, Enid is really the main character here, with Seymour and Becky playing lesser roles (contrary to the movie's poster). The complexities of her relationship to her former mark are explored rather well; there's a physical attraction, perhaps, but more importantly Enid sees in Seymour a way for her to redeem herself. After all, if she can help him improve his life, then the stain of her mean-spirited prank will be steam-cleaned away.The acting is pretty good, but Buscemi, in an understated, nuanced performance, steals the show. Seymour is hopeless but not without hope; he's pathetic, stuck in a world that passed him by thirty years or so ago. His social skills are nearly nonexistent, and he spends his free time interacting with record aficionados, so he and Enid make quite the mismatched pair.Again, though, if you don't buy into the character of Enid from the get-go - if, that is, you don't see anything redeemable in her to begin with - then the movie won't be the cult classic it should be. Juno, which came out seven years later, had a titular character who was just as snarky and all knowing but without the bitter, pathetic, hate-filled edge that Enid has here. Birch does what she can, and she can carry the picture when Buscemi's not on screen, but the mountain's too steep for her to climb.***",Ghost World
37,meeza,Ghost World is hauntingly terrific!,10,12 March 2002,"I do not mean to spook you when I tell you that `Ghost World' is definitely the coolest film of the year. This vastly entertaining film stars Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson as bored  high school grads who try to find adventure in obscure places in a changing city filled with mini-malls & quick-stop food marts. Thora Birch's performance as the seditious smart-talking teen is one of the best acting performances of the year. I have become a big fan of Ms. Birch and hope to attend more `Thora' parties in the future! Thora! Thora! Thora!  Scarlett Johanson's mild-mannered work was also very good, and if you do not think Scarlett was good then ` frankly my dear I don't give a damn.' Independent acting god Steve Buscemi was amazing as the blues loving loner who Birch's character befriends. It is no buschit that Buscemi is probably one of the best five actors working in films today. Illeana Douglas was hilarious as the summer school art teacher who finds pseudo symbolism in her student's artistic paintings.  Bob Balaban's work as the caring father was also very good. What I am really trying to say here is that the ensemble acting of `Ghost World' is the best I have seen in film this year and that is no hallucination. Also, Daniel Clowes and Terry  Zwigoff's classic screenplay is highly deserving of its Best Adapted Screenplay oscar nomination.

39,noralee,Quirky Characters in an Unusual Looking and Sounding Story,10,19 December 2005,"""Ghost World"" is like an indie fun-house mirror image of ""High Fidelity,"" as if we're seeing how those characters were as teen agers and could be as older.Its painful honesty about its confused,isolated characters in all their complexity is what it has in common with Zwigoff's previous feature, the documentary about R. Crumb and his family (which is visually referred to several times).Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi are fascinating to watch in an odd-ball relationship, which the movie intentionally references to ""The World of Henry Orient,"" balanced in between by a more grounded best friend, a terrific Scarlett Johansson. Even the minor characters are almost cruelly on target, such as Ileanna Douglas's political art teacher and Bob Balaban's milquetoast Dad.Music is the communication vehicle of choice for these characters who have difficulty communicating and the music selections are very unusual.My friends and I post-viewing inconclusively disagreed about the meaning of the title and the ending.

Why would anyone want to watch a movie about these stereotypes when there are plenty 'nuff in real life? The movie systematically ridicules everyone by presenting the worst (though funny) caricatures: the goofy corporate young Republican, the flaky touchy-feely art teacher, the loud-mouthed redneck, the xenophobic Greek convenience store owner, the oblivious parent, the evil stepmom, the annoying socialite and the equally annoying misanthropes. And this brings me to our lead character: the I-don't-know-what-to-do-with-my-life-so-everyone-pity-me slacker.So far, so good, right? The director did an excellent job of mocking each demographic... so where's the punchline? There is none. That's all you get. There's no deeper commentary, no hope for redemption and no indication of any philosophy other than ""life is a bunch of losers"".That's not to say that this is a poorly made movie.

They are deciding what to do next, hanging out, and messing with strangers. This movie starts out extremely strong, focusing on the dialog between Thora Birch and Scarlet Johannson, who play it cool and hang strong. About a third of the way in, the movie begins to veer off to focus more on Enid and her interactions with a middle aged loner named Seymour. Whereas the writing felt naturalistic early in the film, it gets pretty hard to buy the relationship between Seymour and Enid, and the story eventually deflates. The ending felt more like the filmmakers ran out of ideas than actual symbolism, and it left me hanging. However, I still watch many scenes of this movie over--the ironic humor hits perfectly more than a couple times. Some viewers have criticized this movie for being depressing, and things do go badly for several of the characters, but for me the only thing that is truly depressing is Enid's relationship with her father. Some of the things the characters go through are lessons they can emerge stronger from, but I don't imagine things improving between her and her dad.

Basically, everyone.As one reviewer mentioned, it is not a formulaic Disney movie, nor is it a Gothic depressive movie, like ""Disturbing Behavior"" or other teen movies. This film actually stands out on its own, and the performances are excellent. Steve Buscemi is believable and sympathetic as the local loser who Enid and her friend decide to stalk. Ileana Douglas portrays Enid's art teacher (classically quirky). Enid is required to take art class for the summer ""for retard losers"" she tells Teri Garr, her father's girlfriend.Enid and her friend find the world out of school has little more to offer- The hypocrisy of graduation; when the class president speaks: ""I liked her so much better when she was a crack head"" Johannson sneers. Classic.Enid also reflects that she will miss the geeky classmate who she will never see again- a familiar sense that ""what is to come"" may also be a disappointment. The underlying theme of Seymour's (Buscemi's) collection of 78's, and a lost world, is touching and effective. He works as a VP at what was formerly known as ""Coon Chicken"". Enid develops an interest in this, and brings the logo to her art class,where Douglas commends her for her awareness of the subject. Yes, there were places like that, Seymour says, now it is less out in the open. The possibility that we all live in a ghost world of our own is not just a remote possibility.This film is excellent for its creative portrayal of disenfranchisement, discontent, and the humor that saves us from despair. Johansson offers comic relief when Enid visits her at the local coffee house where she works: ...""mostly I just want to kill everyone""... The starkness and impersonal environment of the strip malls, the Sidewinder where Brad Renfro makes slushies, the ""fake 50's diner"" where weird Al works- all these places are familiar americana. Hopefully John Malkovich will make a sequel. 10/10",Ghost World
43,Enchorde,You got to think...,6,1 November 2008,"Recap: Enid and Rebecca just finished high-school and is just about to plan their future. Oh... they have plans, but as everyone knows, plans never work out as you want them to. The girls initially have a real anti-attitude towards everything else, but they grow apart. Rebecca slowly adjusts towards ""normal"" life with job and her own apartment. Enid, however, clings hard to her attitude, searching for a path at the periphery of society.Comments: There is a lot of thought put into this movie. How to grow up, how to adapt and how to find your own way. We are provided with lots of examples how to. Of course, we have Enid and Rebecca. But there is also Seymour, and by all means Norman.At the end there is a very symbolic scene with Norman and even if it was very predictable, I couldn't help but smile when I saw it. Very charming. Enid, on the other hand is not that charming. She is against everything and everyone, respects no privacy or boundaries, and sometimes quite mean. And still she can't figure out why so few people seem to like her. Actually I started to dislike her too, and whenever you get that feeling for the main character, the movie is in trouble.As Enid grew disinterested in the world at large, I grew disinterested with this movie in specific. Mostly it was slow and dull (intentionally so?). It had its moments, some funny, some thoughtful, but in all they were too few and too far apart.Good performances all around by the actors. I can see what they aim for and they do it quite well. However, as mentioned, I don't like all the characters that much.6/10",Ghost World
44,Jonny_Numb,faithful adaptation/expansion of the comic,8,10 February 2003,"""Ghost World"" is very much in the ""Breakfast Club""/""SubUrbia""/""Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys""-mold in that it's the coming-of-age story of two girls dealing with the post-high school void of 'real life.'  Based on the irreverent, blackly comic graphic novel by Daniel Clowes (""Like a Velvet Glove Cast in Iron""), we follow Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) through a pastel-colored urban landscape of desperate characters, including lonely record-collector Seymour (Steve Buscemi, who's an obvious stand-in for director Terry Zwigoff), whom Enid becomes particularly fond of.  Overall, I think Zwigoff and Clowes transferred the tone of the comic faithfully to the screen; Birch and Johansson are great, full of self-aware cynicism, but their relationship becomes more fragmentary as the film progresses (whereas the comic focused on them together, the movie focuses more on Enid and Seymour).  The supporting cast is well-chosen and enthusiastic, from Illeana Douglas (as a wigged-out art teacher), Brad Renfro (whose character deserved more screen time), and Buscemi.  Terry Zwigoff employs the same sort of deadpan directing style that made ""Crumb"" such an affecting masterpiece, but if anything, ""Ghost World"" is a much more mainstream, cyncial comedy (that's a compliment).8/10",Ghost World
45,rbverhoef,Very good,8,6 October 2003,"'Ghost World' is one of the best teen movies, if that is what you call it, I have seen. The characters are not there for some stupid romance or some silly jokes, but they feel like real people in a real story. Thora Birch plays Enid, a girl the world does not understand and without any plans for her future. Scarlett Johansson is Rebecca, her best friend who does slowly develops some plans for her own future. Enid meets Seymour (Steve Buscemi). At first she thinks he is not much of a guy, but slowly starts to like him, may be even more.'Ghost World' is intelligent and although it doesn't sound very funny there are a lot of funny moments. We don't find the normal Hollywood -clichés here and like I said we deal with real moments, not movie moments. This is definitely a very good movie.",Ghost World
46,valleyjohn,The bust stop of death?,7,1 March 2021,"Ghost World is another of those films that i wouldn't normally seek out but I found on my watchlist because it was recommended by someone .
I like Steve Buscemi and Scarlett Johansson so why not ?With only the plan of moving in together after high school, two unusually devious friends seek direction in life. As a mere gag, they respond to a man's newspaper ad for a date, only to find it will greatly complicate their lives.I quite enjoyed this film . It's quirky rather than laugh out loud funny and a really enjoyed the performances of Steve Buscemi and Thora Birch but I did feel Scarlett Johansson was a little wooden but she was only 17 so maybe she can be excused for that .There are some really poignant scenes . The one that sticks with me is the man sitting on the bench who is waiting for the bus that never comes .
I wonder if he got on that bus to the place in the sky ?The shop is brilliant. The shop keeper made me laugh out loud along with the nunchuck wielding nut case who hangs around outside.Thinking about it , this film Is not bad at all .",Ghost World
47,vertigo_14,Female Escapism. (spoilers),9,1 August 2004,"You can probably relate to Ghost World probably if you're an American who views nearly everyone around you as completely wrapped up in a self-indulgent, phony, and excessively materialistic little world. Someone once said that movies with these kind of themes (similar to Fight Club and in the 80s, Repo Man and Suburbia) would probably be best understood by Generation Xers, despised by the Baby Boomers, and misunderstood by the Millenias. I think this is true. To some, Enid may appear like an unnecessarily bitter girl. The outsider. But to others, they may share the perception that Enid is on the inside looking out and justifiably ridicules what has become of things. In fact, Enid is your modern Holden Caufield or like the main character, Clay, of Less Than Zero (the book, not the movie). Only, those characters who model Holden, are funny cynics in this movie.
'Ghost World' is more unusual, too, because it is the rare story of female escapism. Most always, novels and films alike, our protagonist is a male (see the examples above), no matter what the situation. The only other I can remember was the main character, Anna, of the 1998 indie 'Whatever.' Although, she was more disillusioned by percieved failures rather than by the false character of society.The story of Ghost World is about two girls who graduate high school. Their plans, ordained long prior to graduation, change afterwards along with everything else. Thora Birch is Enid, the main character of our story, and the one who is most defiant of structure. Because, if you think of structure as what society has created, and she doesn't like what people have become (most people), be they superficial or ignorant--I'm not sure how to describe her father--or whatever, then Enid would rather defy that structure as much as possible. She is so deadset in her defiance, that she has everything and everyone molded into a particular position. And as the things around her change following graduation, so to does the positions of those around her. Familiarity is out and to Enid, those around her are giving in to the structure, to the things she hates.Rebecca (Scarlett Johnson), the monotone best friend of Enid who seems to be cynical (and quite amusingly in expressing it), though not as much as Enid. After graduation, she tries to stick with Enid's plans of finding an apartment together. Only, with Enid's refusal, they tend to drift apart. Rebecca is, in a way, growing up while Enid is trying so desperately to hang on to something so familiar and essentially, trying to defy change. Rebecca, for example, gets a job at a coffeehouse (where all the phonies flock, too). And so forth. She may not be giving in, but to Enid, she is.
In fact, Rebecca and Enid drift further apart with the arrival of a hapless dufus named Seymour (the awesome Steve Buscemi), who first enters the picture when Enid and Rebecca call him pretending to be a long-lost blonde that he was looking for through the personal ads. Seymour eventually becomes good friends with Rebecca, having that main characteristic in common: they're both outsiders to the complacent and mundane mainstream. Seymour is caught up in a time warp sort of. His fascination is the ragtime period of the 20s. He is an avid collector of ragtime record classics. His apartment, his taste in music, everything is similar to Enid in that he completely feels like he, too, is in a Ghost World.But, gradually as the movie goes along, Enid can't defy change and familiarity as much as she'd like to. Rebecca starts showing up less as Enid spends more time with Seymour. Seymour gets himself a girlfriend, who is mainstream, and tries to impress some of that on him. Other things, too, like the man who seems to be waiting for the bus that never comes but one day, it does. Enid's father starts dating an ex-girlfriend that Enid didn't like. Things gradually become more and more out of control for her. And she seeks escapism that really has turned into a Ghost World. Only one for her and no one else.This is a movie that really makes its point well (although that's pretty easy) about how Enid and Rebecca (to some extent) and even Seymour view the world. For example, Illeana Douglas, who plays Enid's art teacher, appears like a pretentious person (and art was a good example to use). Look at her 'Mirror Father Mirror' video. Don't ask if that's art. Ask what's the point? And also, what's the point to most of what Douglass's character has to say to her class. Look at the 50s restaraunt that the friends go to: Wowsville. Where, included in your authentic 50s diner experience is booming rap music and a waiter with a haircut like Wierd Al Yankovic's. At the bar that Enid and Seymour go to, a group of white guys in a band get up on stage and introduce their songs as the real blues experience. Nevermind that they're a bunch of white guys singing about cotton picking. There's the annoying girl from their high school who shows up every once in a while. There's the situation with Enid and the Coons Chicken/Church's Chicken sign where everyone was so politically correct, that they didn't even want to consider what the sign was about and asked to have it removed from the museum. There are so many examples that work well in this story. It is really a terrific movie.Ghostworld is based on the comic book by Daniel Clowes, who also wrote the screenplay. If this is your kind of story, I highly recommend watching it. Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson, and Steve Buscemi were perfect.
But I wonder, what is green symbolic of here? Green is used in nearly every scene?",Ghost World
48,RainDogJr,"Memorable film, my favourite of Terry Zwigoff",10,27 January 2008,"This is the story of Enid (Tora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) after they finish the high school. Both have problems to be related with people and they spend their time hanging around and bothering creeps. When they met Seymour (Steve Buscemi) who is a social outsider who loves to collect old vinyl records, the life of Enid will change forever.The screenplay of this memorable film was based on a comic book with the same name, created by Daniel Clowes. The plot is very simple but excellent and there are a lot of memorable dialogs and two memorable characters that makes this film as one of the most original films ever and that is, without a doubt, Terry Zwigoff's masterpiece. The way that the film start, when we can see how Enid and Rebecca spend their time, is really strange in consequence of the strange attitude of the characters . I mean when they follow the ""satanic"" couple is really bizarre but later they just forget about them in less than a minute and they stop in a restaurant, and it's even more bizarre. And there are lots of this kind of scenes that makes this characters truly memorable and the best thing is that they are believable. And the other main character, Seymour, is also great. The lines of all the characters are really great and the critic to the ignorant society too, specially the scene when a man is looking for the film ""8 1/2"" by Fellini and the video clerk give him the film ""Nine 1/2 Weeks"" with Mickey Rourke.Well, the cast is perfect; Tora Birch is amazing in the best character of the film, Scarlett Johansson is perfect in all the ways and Steve Buscemi is excellent like always in a memorable character. The rest of the cast is excellent too like the rest of the secondary characters like Josh (Brad Renfro) or Roberta Allsworth (Illeana Douglas). And the music is another perfect thing of this film just like in every other masterpiece like this one.Conclusion: i really love this film that is highly re-watchable and for me is one the best films of the 00's and amazingly original. I haven't read the comic book but Daniel Clowes, the creator, write the film too so i think is very similar to the comic book, that i'm going to get soon. So watch this film, is funny thanks to the great satire to the society but also is sad thanks to one character who doesn't know what to do with her life and is quite disappointed with the rest of the world.

49,bandw,Extreme alienation,9,30 April 2010,"Enid, the main character in this movie, is a smart and cynical 18-year-old who is just graduating from a Los Angeles high school. She is the type that adults sometimes refer to as ""Too smart for her own good."" If you have heard of extreme sports, well, Enid is a master of extreme alienation. Just about everything and everybody is a target for her scorn. We get a taste of her acid tongue early on--after her graduation ceremony where a young girl, who has been the victim of a tragic auto accident, has given a banal speech (""High School is like the training wheels for real life"") Enid says to her friend Rebecca, ""I liked her so much better when she was an alcoholic crack addict."" Enid has made it through high school, as many outsiders do, by having a close friend who shares her world view. Neither Enid nor Rebecca plans on going to college and the movie concentrates on what happens when such a pair is thrust into the real world.As Enid, Thora Birch has been well chosen for the part. She has all the facial expressions needed to portray disdain, dismay, confusion, and sadness. In a role that is not as demanding, Scarlett Johansson plays the person of the pair who is headed for a more normal life inside the ropes. Enid gets involved in a relationship with Seymour (Steve Buscemi) who, as is noted, is everything that Enid does not hate. Seymour is a collector of old 78 records and when Enid expresses amazement at the 1500 records in his collection he remarks that he has winnowed it down to the essentials. This exemplifies the droll humor that is evidenced throughout. I can't recall another film that deals with a person like Enid who is being forced to try to come to terms with her nonconformist personality in order to survive. She does mature during the course of the movie as seen by her realizing that a permanent relationship with Seymour will not work. The ending is ambiguous and we are left wondering what is to become of Enid. It would be interesting to drop in on her when she is in her 40s. I like to think that she would be running a small art gallery in Santa Fe, but that is if she has avoided suicide.The opening credits are about the most interesting I have seen. For one thing they illustrate how movies can do some things far more effectively than the written word. As the camera pans along looking through apartment windows (and ultimately landing on Enid's) enough information is provided about the contents of the apartments and the people living in them that would require twenty pages of description. But, the thing that really captured my attention was the inter-cutting of a Bollywood dance clip from the movie ""Gumnaam."" This clip features the song Jaan Pehechaan Ho performed by Mohammed Rafi and it is so unusual that I was left saying to myself, ""Where in the hell did that come from?"" After my initial viewing of ""Ghost World,"" I was so fascinated by the dance number it that I bought ""Gumnaam"" just so I could have the full clip--a clip that is now an extra on the ""Ghost World"" DVD. This clip fits into the opening credits by way of Enid's watching it on TV and dancing to it in her apartment room; it shows an unfettered side of Enid that we don't see much of in the rest of the film.If you are a bit of an outsider, then this movie should be particularly appealing; if you are not, then it should give you an insight into such people.",Ghost World
50,stensson,Incredible Buscemi,7,23 July 2002,"Maybe the best American picture so far this year. Brilliant acting, especially from Steve Buscemi, who comes near the genius standard here. But indeed well managed also by Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson, who are not making just comic magazine figures, but know when to turn into ""real"" human beings. In a small part you also see Bob Balaban making a smashing performance as Birch's father.The girls sarcasms are loveable. The American commercial culture has been murdered before, especially by Americans, but this is a new way of doing it. Even if you're heavy into ""raw capitalism"" you will probably like this.
In the last scenes you get to understand why this film is called ""Ghost World"". It is when the bus appears. It makes the ending very tragic and somewhat funny too.",Ghost World
51,DeeNine-2,"No ghosts, but funny in a sweet and melancholy way",10,10 May 2007,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)The phone rings. Enid says, ""Aren't you going to answer that?"" Seymour says, ""I have no desire to talk to anyone who wants to talk to me."" He picks it up anyway and listens and then says, ""That's my mother."" I just about cracked up.Well, the whole movie cracked me up. It's a work of art from indie auteur Terry Zwigoff whom I recall as the director of the edgy documentary Crumb (1994). For some reason, as I was watching this, I thought it was directed by Todd Solondz who directed the amazingly real and funny Welcome to the Doll House (1995). I imagined this as a kind of high school/out of high school progression from the junior high school of Welcome to the Doll House. It could be, actually, with Thora Birch playing an older Dawn Weiner and having all those bad things happen to her, but still managing to survive it all. Both Enid Coleslaw and Dawn Weiner are amazingly true to life and also amazingly talented and unappreciated outsiders in this arbitrary and capricious world. Birch (whom I remember vividly from American Beauty 1999) in her glasses and all those campish outfits over her rather ample figure was just outstanding.Scarlett Johansson who plays her friend Rebecca was as vivid as my high school date on prom night and actually prettier (I have to admit). She was also outstanding. Both Johansson and Birch are charismatic in a way that will glue your eyes to the screen. They play ultra cynical slackers who love to satirize the world and their fellow creatures as they hide their vulnerability from themselves. They are so cute.Steve Buscemi plays Seymour, a kind of autobiographical alter ego of cartoonist Daniel Clowes (thus Enid's last name, ""Coleslaw"") who wrote the comic from which he and Zwigoff adapted the movie. Buscemi manages a tricky part calling for old school dorkishness, vulnerability and self-consciousness portrayed in an ultimately winning and sympathetic way.There are a lot of amusing insider ""trivia"" comments about this movie at IMDb, including the fact that Sophie Crumb, daughter of Robert Crumb, did the drawings in Enid's notebook. One of the most amusing is this: ""The actor who plays the high school principal in the graduation scene also plays one of the customers in the porno shop. This was not intentional--Terry Zwigoff cast him as a porno shop customer forgetting that he also played the principal."" Right.See this for Zwigoff who has the eye and the ear of a genius, a man who knows the hearts of his characters and the mass culture they live in, and how to satirize them both, but gently with affection.",Ghost World
52,KUAlum26,Not the easiest characters to like but...,7,19 September 2006,"...still quite the curiosity.Director Terry Zwigoff,who'd later strike commercial pay dirt with the equally downbeat but more straight-ahead funny Bad Santa,along with writer Daniel Cloves present this story of two girls(Thora Birch and Scarlett Johnasson),freshly graduated from high school,who simply want to get jobs and move into their own apartment together. While Rebecca(Johansson,pretty and intriguing,if seemingly drowsy)is able to keep herself employed steadily and on the path to achieving her very simple goal,Enid(Birch,kid-like AND sexy,equal parts disturbing and sympathetic)drifts aimlessly,unable to keep a job,barely able to keep her grades up in the remedial Art class she's been sent to to make her diploma official. To make matters worse,she begins a vague,ill-defined relationship with a gentle eccentric(Steve Buscemi,who is IMHO,even better as a good guy than as the stock,dangerous creeps he's usually cast as)on whom she had initially(with the help of her friend Rebecca)played a cruel prank. Added for fleshing out the story are such pros as Brad Renfro(as the boy the two girls both fraternize and playfully torture in equal parts),Illeana Douglas(as the performance-minded Art teacher who is easily cowed),Bob Balaban(as Enid's dad,a milquetoast character who is concerned but ultimately oblivious to his daughter's behavior) and Stacey Travis(as the woman who Buscemi's Seymour is attracted to). As per what I'm sensing is true in Zwigoff films(I've only seen two so far),there are a fair amount of obscure character actors,plenty of un-glamorous,raw scenery and a soundtrack full of edgy,somewhat rare music. Definitely meant for a smaller audience,which might explain why this movie moved quietly through the cinema in 2001.A down-beat,almost nihilistic character study,this film will test the patience of probably more than a few viewers. Those who stay with this film will(probably)find that there is,when you dig through it,actually a positive,hopeful sense to the movie. It challenges you the movie-goer or renter to empathize with the characters,flaws,warts and all,for the whole film,and for the most part it succeeds. I'm not sure I can recommend this film in general(although I'd say that if you are to any degree a loner,then this film should be up your alley!),but I wouldn't DIScourage anyone from checking it out,either.",Ghost World
53,capkronos,"This is a fine, fine film.",9,6 June 2002,"I guess different people can extract different meanings from GHOST WORLD and all nail exactly why it was made. For me, it was the chronicle of that small group of people who don't, and probably never will, quite fit into this world. They're here on the fringes though, just existing in their own parallel universe, or their own ""ghost world."" Though it sounds depressing, this film is hardly a downer, it's full of humor, satire and acute observations on life. The overall production is excellent (the brightness and colors in the photography, costumes and sets is stunning)... plus it pulls off the impossible by successfully steering toward dead-on seriousness near the conclusion to drive it's point across.It begins at graduation with Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson), two very perceptive high school outcasts who see right through the facade of their juvenile peers and want nothing to do with it. For Rebecca this self-ostracizing is just a passing phasing, but for Enid you get the strong impression this is going to always be her way of life. It's not that she doesn't get it, it's that she's doesn't understand IT or people or the games of life. There's a brief emotional turning point for Enid when a cruel practical joke backfires and she becomes involved with the target, the nerdy and very sardonic Seymour (Steve Buscemi), who may just be the kindred spirit Enid was looking for. The shared scenes between Enid and Seymour, though doomed to take a bad turn, are handled with tenderness by the director and actors and are quite memorable and touching.Highlights are an excellent scene in a blues club that just about nails the American outlook on life and our lack of reverence and the ones in Enid's remedial art class, with the most misguided and pretentious teacher (Illeana Douglas) you could imagine. The girls are wonderful, and Steve Buscemi was unfairly overlooked at awards time (big shocker). Anyway, he's never been this good before. The fact this premise, these ideas and these original and interesting characters came from a comic book makes me realize I've completely overlooked the artistic possibilities within that medium.",Ghost World
54,PimpinAinttEasy,A movie where the characters are like my best friends .....,10,30 October 2015,"Dear Terry Zwigoff, We often look towards art for comfort. When you're watching some movies, you feel like the characters are like your best friends and that they are talking directly to you. Almost as if the director and the writer know exactly what you are experiencing in your life.Ghost World is that sort of a movie. When the movie ends, you feel like your best friend just left the bar you were both drinking at and talking in the most honest way possible.I have watched this film many times now. Enid is one of my favorite movie characters of all time. She embodies the anomie and acedia that we all experience as teenagers or even as adults. The same is the case with Seymour. I could completely relate to his sense of despair and isolation in a society which is not artistically inclined and lacks moral values.You extracted a terrific performance out of Thora Birch . What an intensely brilliant actress. I was surprised by her choice of films after Ghost World. In 2001, she was definitely the greatest young American actress. Steve Buscemi - well, is he ever bad? Seymour's feelings of insignificance and frustration are perfectly portrayed by Buscemi. Perfect casting, Terry. Every single actor in this film delivers a pitch perfect performance. There are hardly any mistakes. It is almost as if you could hardly put a foot wrong, Terry. Everything from the choice of songs used in the background score to actors in the smallest of roles are simply perfect. What a great director you are. I wish you would make more movies. Ghost World is definitely one of the most important American films of the last 20 years. And my favorite film of all time. (10/10)Ps: Why aren't you making more movies?",Ghost World
55,Sirus_the_Virus,Great movie.,10,28 November 2009,"Thora Birch and Scarlett Johanson star in Ghost world. A little know film that should be known. I know I am a little late on reviewing this. Probably because I just saw it a few days ago. It's sad I know. But here I am reviewing it. It's a fantastic comedy filled with laughs, and a couple of chills to be perfectly honest. In a good way, but still kind of gives you the chills.Thora Birch stars as Enid, and Scarlett Johanson stars as her friend. When these two friends graduate, their lives change. They decide to torment people. Enid is odd while her friend plans on growing up. That is what really destroys their friendship. Enid soon torments a nerdy man named Seymour(Steve Buscemi). As she finds him a date, she soon realizes that she is in love.This film to me seems a little like Juno. But I actually liked it more than Juno. Personally, I thought both films were great but this is a little better. Thora Birch has never given a better performance in her life. She is so good as the odd one. In a way she is kind of creepy.

56,Vomitron_G,"""Jaan Pehechaan Ho""",9,9 February 2006,"GHOST WORLD is a sharp satire about two girls, Enid and Rebecca, who've just graduated from high-school. They're trying to find out what they're gonna do with their lives. While trying to figure that out they also take their first steps to real adulthood, in search of an own identity.This is the kind of humor I like best: Rather subtle, yet very sharp. This movie really has it all: Sarcasm, cynicism, hilarity and there's even a fart joke and a little drama kicking in at the end. It's amazing to see two young girls act so cynically already. At first GHOST WORLD seems to be humming along just fine, but rather pointless. But very soon you'll discover that every little set-up leads to an appropriate pay-off. There's really no grand conclusion in the end, instead this movie starts on a very high intriguing level and manages to maintain that level throughout the whole movie. It manages to make fun of different types of human beings, but never gets insulting. There's just so many scenes that are bound to leave you with a smile on your face. One of my many personal favorites is were that older guy walks into a videostore and asks the clerk, who clearly knows nothing about movies, about the Fellini-movie ""8 1/2"". The clerk looks it up on the computer and then proudly says something like ""You can find it in the erotic-drama section, yes, ""9 1/2 weeks"" with Mickey Rourke.""The acting ranks from good to excellent. In supporting roles I especially found Illeana Douglas as Roberta extremely funny. She answers to the ultimate cliché of an art-school teacher. Bob Balaban as Enid's overly gentle dad was enjoyable too. He was so out of touch with his teenage daughter. And Dave Sheridan (with a mustache) as Doug cranks me up every time. It's always nice to see Scarlett Johansson in a movie, but actually she hasn't got much to do in GHOST WORLD. The script just demanded her to be a bit more rational than Enid and not enthusiastic about anything. So that's basically what she does. The real show is actually stolen by Thora Birch as Enid and Steve Buscemi as the record-collecting loner Seymour. They have so many little funny moments together. Thora Birch really shines in this picture portraying Enid as a girl that's everything but ordinary. Her different costumes were superb.The camera-work is excellent. Even when there's a lot of talking going on, you can see that every shot is picked carefully. Terry Zwigoff must have had a perfect understanding with the actors, 'cause it shows. And he makes sure he keeps the camera steady and has it make subtle moves when necessary. The traveling-shots alongside the apartments during the opening-scene were perfect.To me, this movie has no flaws. It might seem a bit slow in the plot-department, but the pacing of witty dialogues isn't. And the best thing about GHOST WORLD is: it keeps getting better with every next viewing. It least for me it does. Chances are that next time I see it, I'll be giving it 10 out of 10 stars. So, go watch this movie. It might not be for everybody (in fact, no movie is), but it's a modern-day classic in my opinion. And if you like it, try to get a hold of the DVD 'cause it features the full length video-clip of that Indian song ""Jaan Pehechaan Ho"". Hilarious it is.

As it is film goes 2 minutes too long, but nobody's dead and it's a fairly harmless error.  Birch virtually reprises Beauty role of un-anchored teen who ticks everyone off, then wonders why she's lonely. Buscemi is really good in co-lead role as older guy she thinks she should save; their chemistry together, despite or because of Buscemi's aloofness, is fascinating.  The sort of honest movie rarely attempted and usually botched - and this one hangs in the balance towards the end. Kudos.",Ghost World

59,mattymatt4ever,"Funny, unique and truthful",8,11 March 2002,"I'll start off by giving this tiny disclaimer:  THIS IS NOT A TEEN MOVIE!! The main characters in the story happen to be teenagers, but I'll be damned if ""Ghost World"" were to be put in the same category as ""Drive Me Crazy"" and ""Can't Hardly Wait.""The story focuses on Enid and Rebecca, two outcasts who fancy themselves on criticizing others.  I can relate to these characters.  I was an outcast myself.  I couldn't relate--and still can't--to most of my fellow young people.  If this were the standard teen fluff, the story would focus on ditsy cheerleaders and dumb jocks.  I, personally, can't relate to those types of characters.  So the fact that Terry Zwigoff decided to focus on the outsiders really fascinated me.This movie reminded me of a much lighter Todd Solondz film.  Solondz also focuses on the outsiders, only there's no perverts or child rapists in this film.  No offense to Solondz, his films are great, but this is a much more pleasant film to watch.Thora Birch is adorable in this movie, and very well cast.  I love the way she delivers her dialogue.  In the scene where she's faced with an ecstatic senior who can't believe she just graduated, she responds (paraphrasing) ""We graduated high school.  How shocking.""  I don't think anybody could've given better deadpan delivery than her.  The other actress--her name slips my mind--is also great, as her other half.  Steve Buscemi is great--when is he not?--in a much more unusual role.  He doesn't play the villain or the talkative, obnoxious creep.  He actually plays a decent person.  Even though this is a comedy, this is one of his more dramatic roles.  He has some funny lines (""What are ya, hypnotized???  Have some more kids, why don't you!!""), but basically he plays the straight man.  And I really loved his character, because it's one I can most relate to.  I don't listen to blues or country or collect vintage records, but I tend to be a loner and many people just disgust me.  He says a great line:  ""I can't relate to 99 % of humanity."" That's the way I feel.  Some may consider his character cranky and cynical, but I think he's just a laid-back, peaceful, average Joe who just wants to live his life without the annoyances of everyday people.  Illeana Douglas has some funny moments as the wacky art teacher who makes a short film about parts of a baby doll getting tossed into a toilet and considers that art. I've known some of these arthouse geeks, and they can be just as wacky. Also keep a lookout for Brian George, who played Babu on ""Seinfeld.""  He pretty much plays the same character, only this time he's Greek and owns a convenience store.  David Cross, who some may remember as the wheelchair-bound creep in ""Scary Movie 2,"" also has a cameo.""Ghost World"" is funny, but not in a hysterical fashion.  Because it's not meant to be in the tradition of ""The Naked Gun"" movies.  There are elements of farce here and there, but all in all it's a human comedy.  One that makes you laugh and think at the same time.  Some of the characters are exaggerated, but its morals are honest and truthful.  I can't really say it's a satire--""Heathers"" is more in that territory--and to be honest, this movie can be classified in several genres, because it's a film about life. And as Lasse Halstrom said, ""Life doesn't have any genres.  It can be comical, dramatic, suspenseful...""As a final reminder:  this is not a teen movie!  This is a unique, genuine piece of work worth cherishing for years to come.  I just wish Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi were considered for Oscars.  It's time to give the little people and the little films a chance!My score:  8 (out of 10)",Ghost World
60,sharky_55,(unfolding a built-in ironing board) Isn't it great?,8,4 December 2017,"Is Ghost World a pretentious film, or merely about pretentious people? Watching and studying it again, I think it is a bit of both. Of the notable criticisms, most are aimed at protagonist Enid, highlighting her behaviour as selfish and cruel, and condemning the overall mood of pessimism, disconnectedness and morbidity. But what teenager hasn't gone through that phase? Placed precariously in a zone of uncertainty after graduating high school, her best friend quickly assimilates into the small-town adulthood, donning a chain cafe uniform and hunting for the perfect two bedroom apartment. Enid would rather die an early death than succumb to such plainness. The opening sequence captures the heart of her vitality against the sad, seedy backdrops of American suburbia, cycling through various states of disregard and then back to Enid - her walls decorated with the same feverish red as her costume, her bob cut swishing from side to side in careless abandon to Indian surf rock. Director Terry Zwigoff, working together with Daniel Clowes, makes a distinct departure from the source comic's colour scheme and style from the very beginning, replacing a melancholic swathe of blue with warmer colours that pop out from the backdrops; clothes and props flushed with pink, red, orange, hair dyed bright green and blue, neon signage blaring amongst hellish light. The mise en scène is Enid's style, and Enid's style is a way of life, never boring, never plain, always changing. Thora Birch is even more defiant than she was in American Beauty. Fashioning a distinct rebellion through her makeup and wardrobe, she recreates styles so precise that they are mistaken for wannabe efforts, so obscure that no one could possibly be impressed. But Enid doesn't want to admit that fashion alone can only take you so far; she's equipped with a unrelenting supply of sarcasm and cynical wit, delivered with dry, deadpan amusement, but not much else (her remedial art teacher fills in the gaps of her genius work). She keeps a sketchbook documenting the hallway of freaks and geeks she encounters in her everyday life, both relishing and resenting the fact that she could occupy a double page spread of her own. So when she stumbles upon Seymour (through an act of teenage viciousness), it's a sign, a soulmate sent from heaven. How could she have ever been best friends with Rebecca anyway? They're polar opposites - Becky blond and pretty, always fending off advances from boys, while Enid's aura of superiority and disgust is her potent version of skunk spray: keep away. But she's fascinated by Seymour, firstly as a strange new specimen for her to prod and play with, and then as someone with a fairly satisfying existence in a seemingly dead-end town. He's portrayed by Steve Buscemi, who has the kind of look that screams character actor, but through sheer persistence and talent has forged a remarkable career. In one of his best performances, he never lets the character become a cliché, despite all the signs pointing to that eventuality: middle aged, single, an eccentric collection, a ""funny looking"" face, all of which combine to form a human blob that cannot to relate to 99% of society (see how Buscemi is outright unapologetic about how his party might slide into sleaziness, and notice that it isn't out of malice). He can relate to Enid, though, because she shares the same predicament. Their friendship blossoms into something oddly sweet and endearing, with Enid determined to right her wrongs and find Seymour a date; if he's weird and can't find romance, then she's bananas and doomed forever. But wait, isn't that Enid's way of life? Is it a choice or not? The title refers to the utter banality of the suburban existence, of lonely TV meals, of nuclear families festering in apartment blocks. There was a deliberate effort to minimise the presence of extras, an added element of inertia; no one coming or going, or even living, just a few figures here and there trudging to their next destination. It's all a tad dated, because nearly two decades on that unnamed small suburban town is now bustling and medium sized, and we've all just accepted that corporate logos are going to be involved. We all know a Melora, a bouncing, overly shrill cheerleader that sometimes you just want a break from, but hey, at least she's enthusiastic about the next stage of her life (and summer holidays, and extracurricular, and breakfast, and finding a penny on the ground...). Modern art is weird and meaningful, sometimes both, sometimes neither, but taking aim at it is just low hanging fruit (and the art snobs will turn it against you anyway). The film grips me in a different way now. If I had watched this even a couple of years ago I would have been captivated with Enid's self-stylised rebellion, letting no one and nothing define how she lives her life. It's not about what colour her hair is or what weird mask she wears, but the specific attitude of individualism and personality. Isn't the appeal of that something universal? But now it's almost painful to revisit - I see how clearly she is enamored and disappointed with herself at the same time, and it hurts too much, reminds me of too much. Mostly I just sympathise. Getting on that bus is a brave and revealing move, knowing that she is about to be all alone again - it wasn't the town, it was her all along. And I'm hoping to god that she finds what she is looking for.",Ghost World
61,jhclues,"Great Stroy, Outstanding Performances",10,17 February 2002,"To begin with, let's dispel any misconception that his is just another `teen' film; the main characters are teens, to be sure, but it is decidedly anything but.  Rather, it's an examination of the methods we employ in the attempt to connect with the world in which we live, and how we negotiate our own specific time, place and environment.  A comedy/drama by director Terry Zwigoff, `Ghost World' explores what it means to be on the outside looking in, without necessarily wanting to be on the inside, but unsure of what the next move should be or to whom or what we should reach out and embrace. And, as the story unfolds, we discover that the elusive answers have much to do with our own preferences and perceptions of a world in a constant state of flux that refuses to slow down or wait for us to make our decisions.	Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) have just graduated from high school.  Their plans for the future include sharing an apartment-- and so far, that's it.  Toward that end, Rebecca has secured a job at a local Starbucks, but Enid is stuck in the procrastination phase, job-search wise.  Be advised, however, these two are no `Romy and Michele;' mature beyond their years-- especially Enid-- they have a jaded, cynical view of the world in which they live and those who populate it.  They possess a keen insight into human nature, but regard those around them with a rather cold and detached perspective.  They observe people, Enid sometimes sketching them from a distance, and often they follow their subjects just to see where they go and what they might do.  Life to them is something of an academic character study, with perhaps an underlying sense that by so doing they just may stumble onto their own niche-- though without realizing what they're doing themselves. 	It's all fairly harmless, at any rate, until one day they inadvertently get too close to one of their marks, Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a man they view initially as a pathetic little geek.  They initiate an incident involving him that is cruel in the extreme, and when they follow it up rather than just dropping it and letting it (and Seymour) go, their lives take an unexpected turn, and for the first time they get caught up in their own scheme of deceit.  And it's a step toward the inevitable changes we all face in our lives-- and slowly they begin to understand at least one thing:  That once the die is cast, there is no going back.	From the outset, you realize these characters are not your typical, average cinematic teens, and as the story evolves, Zwigoff does an exemplary job of developing them.  They change, they evolve; and you see it.  And given the fact that this story is adapted from a comic book, there is an unexpected depth to it, along the lines of `American Beauty' or `The Ice Storm.'  It's funny, as well-- hilarious, in fact-- but the humor is never contrived or forced, but flows quite naturally from the characters and their situations, just as in real life where you find that even the most serious situation has a humorous side, though to find it you may have to take a step back and look for it.  Zwigoff allows us to take that step back and see that side, along with the drama; and the result is a film that is funny, incisive, insightful, and at times extremely moving and poignant.  The ending alone is enough to initiate hours of discussion.  Extremely well crafted and delivered, Zwigoff's work here should have earned him an Oscar nomination, as it is clearly superior to some that were rewarded with that honor.	For years now, in numerous films, from `Fargo' to the sleeper `Trees Lounge,' Steve Buscemi has been one of the best character actors in the business, and the role of Seymour is arguably his best work to date.  And inexplicably, like Zwigoff, the Academy overlooked him.  Buscemi's Seymour is the epitome of a regular guy who, if not exactly content with his life, accepts it and has no delusions as to who and what he is; and Buscemi plays him beautifully.  There's a touch of Donnie from `The Big Lebowski' in him, but with much more depth, and an attitude that is decidedly acquiescent. This is a guy who doesn't expect much, because he knows he'll never get it anyway.  It's an engagingly subtle and honest portrayal that also gives definition to the contrast between his stage of life and that of Enid and Rebecca's.  Buscemi was perfectly cast in this part-- absolutely no one could have played Seymour better.	One of the true revelations of this film, however, is in the emergence of Thora Birch, who turns in an absolutely commanding performance.  All that she's done previously has been but a warm-up for her portrayal of Enid, which, without question, will propel her already successful career to an even higher level.  With an understated and oh-so-subtle manner, she manages to convey so much about what is going on behind Enid's eyes; all the emotion, all the confusion that hides behind her mask of external indifference.  Birch knows her character inside and out, and presents Enid accordingly, letting us know unequivocally how she feels about those around her, including Rebecca, her father (Bob Balaban), and especially Seymour-- through her relationship with whom we learn so much about her.  It's terrific work by an extremely gifted young actor.	Johansson gives a striking performance, as well, though her character is ultimately overshadowed by Birch's Enid.  But it's good work, and one of the strengths of the film.	The supporting cast includes Brad Renfro (Josh), Illeana Douglas (Roberta) and Stacy Travis (Dana).  Filled with memorable characters and scenes, `Ghost World' is a thoughtful and highly entertaining film, deservedly recognized with an Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay.  This is the magic of the movies.  10/10.",Ghost World

Everyone character in this film (sans Seymour) are various levels and gradations of vapid, despicable, close-minded, cruel and gross. The main characters, Enid and Rebecca, are committed... anti-socialites, if you will. They hate everyone and everything about their lives except 70's punk rock. When Enid meets Seymour she becomes attracted to how odd and lonely he seems. By getting to know him, she attempts to become a more kind and open person. But in the end, her natural ability at wrong decision making gets between her relationship with Seymour and ultimately, nothing comes of it. What was Terry Zwigoff's message here?

One of the girls, Rebecca, is ready for job, apartment, and the attendant responsibilities of the 'real world'. But the other, Enid, is still contemptuous of the 'real world' into which she is being thrust. Both were outcasts by choice in high school, now one wants to cast off the teenage persona, while the other wants to carry it into adulthood. Of course this places strains on their life-long friendship. Also, Enid, the outcast, is attracted to Seymour, a nerdy middle-aged collector of classic 78s she meets at a yard sale. She pursues him, and they begin a friendship that is poised to bud into romance. A weird romance.Ghost World really doesn't have a linear plot that progresses from point A to B. It's more of an exploration of the odd and strangely familiar people that inhabit this Ghost World. It's a novel take on the ever-so-common coming of age story, and brings to the screen some very interesting characters.

Supposedly a class graphic novel, I've never managed to get round to reading it. This film has piqued my interest.Thora Birch is the real central character of this film as we follow 'Enid' round her hometown as she falls for a far older man (Seymour) who is socially awkward. Enid is partnered by her friend Rebecca, and both have a dark sense of humour and pray cruel pranks to get their kicks. They're outsiders in their world, and seem almost nihilistic. Apathy rules, but Enid's burgeoning friendship with Seymour seems to release pent up emotions in Enid, riding from caring & love to jealously & loss.I'm very surprised by this mostly low budget movie. It's sassy and interesting, and will bring back long past memories. The characters feel too real to us all, and maybe we see some of our past lives in them.There is little to be negative about this movie.

66,itamarscomix,"Beautiful, funny, intelligent",9,24 May 2005,"'Ghost World' is extremely hard to classify. It's certainly not another teen movie; in fact it's the exact opposite of what we learned to expect from that category. Calling it a comics flick would also give a very wrong idea of what it is. It's certainly not a comedy, but it's not really a drama either. If you really must know what kind of film is it, think in the direction of 'Daria' but more intelligent, sensitive and with three-dimensional characters (not only physically). Or, more accurately, three three-dimensional characters making their way in a two-dimensional world of cardboard and plastic.The movie does have some very nice comedic moments, but it's more important traits are its atmosphere and symbolisms. It's beautiful and sensitive and creates a mesmerizing atmosphere, Making for a superb adaptation of Daniel Clowes's original graphic novel (though the story itself has little to do with that of the source). The directing (Terry Zwigoff in his first non-documentary) is masterful and very original and unique, the dialogue is sharp and intelligent (quite a lot of it is taken directly from the novel, but the rest is in very much the same spirit), and the actors are all superb; Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson and Steve Buscemi as the more sophisticated characters make a fantastic job. They are strenghtened by the wonderful, mostly hilarious cartoonish stereotypes that surround them, like Enid's father (Gosford Park's Bob Balaban), the creepy John Ellis (Pat Healy), the pretentious art teacher (Illeana Douglas), and the obnoxious Melorra (Debra Azar). A wonderful movie all around.There is a change, though hardly unnoticed, happening in the cinema world. More than ten years after the artistic revolution in comics, the graphic novel is finally being appreciated as a potential source for films, starting with the Hughes Brothers' excellent adaptation of Alan Moore's and Eddie Campbell's 'From Hell', soon followed by this adaptation of Daniel Clowes's classic. (I'm yet to see 'Sin City', but from all I've heard it may be the best one yet). Having been lucky enough to be in NY at precisely the time these two movies came out, I was thrilled to see the novels on which they were based in book stores...

68,FilmOtaku,Thought-provoking dramedy,8,29 June 2003,"This was the second time I watched this film - the first time I saw Ghost World, about a year ago, I was blown away by its modest profundity.  I expected a quirky coming of age story, but received an experience that was much more rich.  This time when I watched the film, I was able to glean more subtle jokes and I finally was able to create a plausible hypothesis regarding the end.  While Ghost World is not a film for everyone (I know of at least two people who thought it to be completely boring) there are characters in the film that I imagine just about everyone can relate to - if not one specific character per se, then a general familiarity with the cast as a whole. During both viewings of Ghost World, I marveled at how amazing it was to encounter a film that actually made Steve Buscemi attractive.  Sure, he's up there with Walken in the ""cool character actor"" category, but never before have I watched something with Buscemi where I not only identified with his character (being a film/music/literature geek myself), but actually wanted to befriend a character he portrayed. There are a lot of issues covered in Ghost World - what to do with one's life, growing out of a friendship, relationships, struggling with ones own identity - and they are all handled beautifully with humor and poignancy by the director, Terry Zwigoff.  He handled his previous effort, a documentary on the great artist R. Crumb much in the same manner.  With both Crumb and Ghost World, I came with the films with a sense of unexpected sadness, but immense appreciation for the characters involved - the difference between the two films is obviously that Crumb's players are non-fiction, but the biggest similarity is that Zwigoff takes a very unflinching look at his subject matter and lets you come to your own conclusions. 
I recommend this film to anyone who is tired of watching the supposed mainstream ""coming of age"" films that Hollywood has been turning out for decades, which seem to become more inane by the month.  There was a lot of hype surrounding this film in the independent film circles and it is more than justified.  --Shelly",Ghost World

It's a monkey wrench in the cranks of the tedious genre that features actors in their mid-twenties portraying stereotypical high-school characters shamelessly indulging predictable plots of frivolous romance. Where most movies set in high schools find resolve in romantics, ""Ghost World"" dares to be different.Yet it contains all the usual ingredients-aimless main characters, one-dimensional side characters, high school graduation, moronic parents, sexual revelations, a romance-but it tastes different. This movie doesn't believe high school is the root of youth complications; it knows that school isn't where the confusion lies-it's after graduation when the complexities begin.The movie opens as a high school senior dances along with a music video. Sounds like a typical teenager? Well, not really. The music this girl listens to isn't exactly mainstream. Nothing about Enid (Thora Birch from ""American Beauty"") is ordinary.The same goes for her best friend, Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson). She is slightly more focused than the aimless Enid, but, as they graduate from high school in the opening scenes, neither of them know what they want out of life.Rebecca and Enid find interesting people to follow, exploit, and embarrass, just for their own leisure, but even this loses its edge. Making the most (or least) of their situation, the girls stumble upon an outstandingly pathetic personal ad. As a joke, they respond. However, when they meet this man, Enid becomes infatuated with him.In their post high school days, Enid and Rebecca find themselves slowly drifting apart. Rebecca is eager to get an apartment and get on with her life, while Enid lives by the day, following one infatuation after another. As their attitudes gradually change from cynical to sober, Enid and Rebecca's emerging differences become blatantly obvious, but painfully realized.""Ghost World"" refers to the world in which these characters live, a town slowly being overcome by shopping malls and coffee shops; a town that slowly loses its distinctions and becomes a ghost of what it once was.
My small town of Mason, MI speaks for itself. Once a minuscule farming suburb of the state's capital, it's now a breeding ground for new subdivisions, factories, stores, gas stations, trailer parks, and businesses. Before you know it, it will be a densely populated city like the capital itself.""Ghost World"" makes harsh points, but it never loses its sense of humor. Enid is so full of bitter cynicism that we have to laugh. She indulges the dialogue. It's often tactlessly frank, savoring every opportunity to bash, thrash, ridicule, or insult anyone or anything for any reason.
Society tends to repress our caustic desire to insult a fellow man, but ""Ghost World"" doesn't hesitate. It takes a lot of risks, but never steps in the wrong direction. It connects us with these characters. They are so casually antisocial that we can't help but to love them. At times, the movie doesn't require dialogue. It simply examines the character's surroundings. We get to know these people so well, we know exactly what they're thinking before they say it. They are a part of our instincts to react on impulse.But a character is only as good as the actor behind it. ""Ghost World"" features enormously engaging performances. Brad Renfro gives his nobody store clerk a raw blandness. Illeana Douglas injects a kind of controlled eccentricity into her role as an art teacher. Steve Buscemi creates a hopeless record player collector out of repressed emotion, and lack thereof.
Scarlett Johansson gives Rebecca a dry, depressed mood. Thora Birch steals the whole show with a straightforward, fearless performance. Although the movie never defines the relationship between Enid and Rebecca, the actors themselves make it clear. They create an enticing charisma that gradually turns to an awkward tension.""Ghost World"" captures part of our journey from childhood to adulthood with poetic grace and cynical wit. Though it's not really a coming-of-age film, where a young character finally takes a place in the world. Enid never finds her place, decides her future, or chooses a path. By the end of the story, she simply becomes aware of her possible options. This movie is just the beginning of her story.",Ghost World

That constant fight between wanting to stay in your confort zone and wanting to take a bus going anywhere.In the end, you can be like Rebecca and get a job and be a reaponsable adult, or you can be like Enid and explore adulthood however your heart desires.Each of the character's choices feed into their flaws and strengths. Their pretentiousness and creativity, their self-reightousness and maturity. The movie refuses to paint either of them as right or wrong in their life choices. It never judges them, even if we the audience might.It may be pure early 2000's teen angst, but it still feels fresh today.(I didn't even mention Steve Buscemi. This is his best performance)",Ghost World
75,policy134,The American Beauty star goes ugly,9,12 January 2007,"I was not really looking forward to see this because I knew that it would not be your average pop corn flick, but still I could not help but be intrigued because I had heard so many great things about it.My low expectations were put to shame five minutes into the movie's running time. It starts with Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson commenting about how uncool they think everything is. I could immediately identify with the kind of denigrating attitude towards the world that they have. Certainly, many of the people I hung out with in high school had that same attitude, including myself to some degree.Add to that, a remarkable performance by Steve Buscemi, one of my favorite actors. I don't think anybody could have plays Seymour better. He is a nerd and he knows it and until he meets Birch's character, Enid, he is actually pretty comfortable with it. Seymour is a sympathetic character, not one Buscemi get to play very often, but he is really terrific. His scenes with Birch are sweet but not so much to make you hurl (I don't know where that came from).Scarlett Johansson's part is more underwritten but even in the few important scenes she has, she is able to convey the changes she goes through.Even the smallest part have some kind of edge to them, like the man sitting at a discontinued bus stop and the manager at the convenience store (Seinfeld guest star, Brian George). The always great Bob Balaban has two or three hilarious scenes as Enid's father trying to connect with her and failing miserably.This is definitely an actor's picture but the director, Terry Swigoff does a good job of not overdoing it with clever dialog and weird camera angles and still making the film as close to mainstream film-making as you can get and still make it feel like an independent movie. Look at the picture, Storytelling, for a complete opposite side to independent film-making.",Ghost World

77,Spanner-2,Good performances and interesting characters,7,20 March 2002,"I finaly caught this independant film, nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, on videotape this week. It is a well crafted storyline with interesting characters and good performances (especialy by Steve Buscemi and Thora Birch). However,  the pacing is somewhat slow and it starts to lose momentum towards the end. Still, I'd reccomend the film as a solid effort anyways. GRADE: B",Ghost World
78,nickenchuggets,"""I can't relate to 99 percent of humanity""",8,24 August 2021,"Ghost World is a good example of a recent movie that manages to have a complex storyline reminiscent of things I am familiar with, such as noir. This doesn't mean it counts as that, but I was a little surprised after seeing it because the plot has numerous twists and turns to it. At first glance, the movie didn't seem like something I would enjoy taking a look at, for the sole reason of it being about a pair of high school graduates. The movie describes high school as ""training wheels for the bicycle of real life"", which is a downright laughable statement, for me anyway. Almost nothing I learned the whole time I was there is applicable in adulthood. Regardless, the high school aspect of this movie is only really visible in the first few minutes, and no mention of it is made afterward. It's largely irrelevant to the story, but at least it does let you know the main characters are finished with mandatory education. Ghost World, as stated earlier, focuses on two girls who have recently graduated, Enid and Rebecca (Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson respectively) and the various problems that they come across in the modern world. Technically, this is a comedy movie, but the humor is so deadpan and laced with expletives that most people will not find it all that funny. Still, there are some exceptions. The movie starts with Enid and Rebecca graduating high school and are left wondering how to best spend their upcoming summer. They both come to the conclusion that they need a source of income and search around for various way to make money. This is difficult for them because they're both basically loners and find it difficult to form relationships with average people. Enid also resents the fact that her friend is more attractive than her in the eyes of local boys. To make things worse, Enid learns she has to attend school even in the summer for failing an art class. Later, the girls learn about a guy named Seymour (Steve Buscemi) who enjoys collecting old records and decide to visit him. Enid buys a record from him and they start to talk to each other more and more. Unbeknownst to him though, Enid's friend Josh has been making fun of him behind his back. Because she's antisocial, Enid finds a unique interest in Seymour because he essentially has her same mindset. He fills his life with material possessions because he can't relate to anyone. While this is going on, Enid shows up at her remedial art class, which is very awkward to watch. The students make various pieces of ""art"" and bring them in for examination. One depicts someone smashing another person's head with a large hammer, and the teacher remarks she thought it was supposed to represent the kid's father. After visiting Seymour's house again, Enid comes across an antique painting he owns, which is a racist caricature made into a logo for a chicken restaurant chain. Realizing she's taking a big risk by doing this, Enid decides to borrow it and bring it to her art class. The other students are understandably shocked, but Roberta (the teacher) likes it because she thinks it's a commentary on racism. This is where Enid's fortune really takes a turn for the worse. Seymour (on Enid's advice) starts seeing a girl named Dana, who says she doesn't like Laurel and Hardy movies because the ""fat one is always mean to the skinny one."" Enid is now envious because she's not the woman in Seymour's relationship. Rebecca's efforts to find a job finally pay off, which means she and Enid can no longer spend as much time together. In a way, this turns them against each other. Then comes a final blow. Enid's teacher takes it upon herself to display the caricature Enid took from Seymour's house at a local art show, and people are so offended by it that Roberta is forced to give Enid an F for the class. Not only that, but her promised scholarship goes out the window. All this bad luck and misfortune forces Enid to return to Seymour's house, even though she told him not to call her ever again. Seymour opts to let Enid stay with him, which requires him excluding Dana from his life. He also discovers from Rebecca that Enid drew crude, mocking images of him in a book she owns. Enraged, he drives to the store where Enid's friend works and tries to assault him, but is attacked and hospitalized. Enid goes there to tell him she is sorry, and informs him the later pages of the book depict him in a much more positive way. He just happened to skip over them. At the end, Enid sees a man we have been introduced to earlier in the movie. His name is Norman, and he waits on a bench for a bus that is out of service. Somehow, a bus suddenly shows up and he steps on. Enid goes to where he was previously waiting, gets on a second bus, and it drives away. Quite a complicated movie which a strange and mysterious ending. Many have theorized as to what the ending means, but in my opinion, it's an allegory for killing oneself. Towards the end, Enid has all these bad things happen to her, and can't seem to get a break. She even inadvertently ruins Seymour's relationship with Dana. She feels like nobody wants her around or likes her, so I think the ending implies she is dead. This would make sense considering the title of the movie. Ghost World was directed by Terry Zwigoff, who also did the dark and humorous documentary on the life of Robert Crumb in 1994. Ghost World shares many similarities with that film, since they both feature a strong presence of dry humor and laughing at other people's expense. Crumb is also involved in this movie because the drawings of Seymour in Enid's book resemble his style greatly. To summarize, Ghost World is a strange and somewhat depressing movie to watch. There are lots of moments in it that just make me cringe to the point of not wanting to continue watching, simply because they're a little too relatable. A good instance of this is when Seymour is talking to Enid at a diner, and Dana appears suddenly, causing him to spill his drink on himself. I've been in too many situations like that and it hurts to watch. There's also a post credit scene that shows Seymour actually winning the fight he has in the store against Enid's friend and the manager. The acting and dialogue in this movie is also quite good, even if it is meant to make the audience feel extremely self-conscious. Thora Birch as Enid resembles me in many respects because she can't seem to get along with many people and prefers to be alone. Scarlett Johansson is a lot more sociable than her counterpart, which ends up making Enid jealous and annoyed. Steve Buscemi here reminds me a lot of various people I know who are into the business of collecting things nobody seems to want, such as old books or cameras. He's also probably the funniest character because it doesn't take much to set him off. To summarize, Ghost World is not what I would consider a groundbreaking movie, but it is entertaining at least. My main gripe with it is that it was so difficult to watch because the fights, confrontations, and arguments the characters get into are too relatable.",Ghost World
79,FrenchEddieFelson,Adorable advocacy on the end of adolescence and the anti-conformism,8,31 March 2019,"For a few weeks, the daily life of Rebecca and Enid, two teenagers who spend their time complaining and pesting, with a decided opinion on almost everything, without any diplomatic filter. One could almost think they were educated in France, at least partially. Thus, following their 4381st perfidy of the week, they meet Seymour, a lonely middle-aged music aficionado. Surprisingly, in contact with Seymour, Enid discovers the concept of benevolence. Despite the 25-year gap, they seem connected with real affinities. In fact, the film takes place at a time when Rebecca and Enid have just graduated from high school, and what seemed to be gratuitous malice is probably more an uncontrolled anger based on the fear of leaving their adolescence to join a world they hardly appreciate: the adult society. They fear to grow up and move on. In a way, Seymour was a transition or a key milestone for Enid: the perfect guy, at the perfect time. Thanks to Seymour, Enid has matured and learned to live differently, with a significantly more open mind. The world does not revolves anymore around herself: she is now part of it. Time to take a bus to discover it! Like Jules Winnfield said during the coffee shop conversation, within Pulp Fiction (1994), she's now gonna walk the earth from town to town, meet people, get in adventures.The movie is complex, smart and well constructed. And the cast is globally awesome, with a special mention to Steve Buscemi, Thora Birch and Illeana Douglas.",Ghost World
80,DavidSim240183,Another gem in the wasteland of tired old teen movies,10,19 December 2007,"The end of high school can be a polarizing experience. On the one hand, its the start of a whole new and exciting life. But on the other, its a terrifying prospect. Its the first time in a young person's life when they can get out into the real world and see what lies in wait for them. Either exciting surprises or grave disappointments.Ghost World, my choice for best teen film of 2001, neatly captures the mindset of anguished teenagers at this particular crossroads in life. Its not always accessible, but in this day and age of cookie cutter teen fodder, that's something of a relief.The two teens Ghost World chooses to observe are Enid and Rebecca, both wonderfully played by Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson. The opening scene witnesses their high school graduation. Something Enid & Rebecca greet with almost casual indifference. Their lives are undeniably changing, they just haven't decided if its for better or worse.Ghost World is a film that seems to occupy a bizarre buffer zone between two netherworlds. Its a skewed vision of suburbia, not unlike something out of a Tim Burton or a John Waters film. And director Terry Zwigoff paints a quite appealing portrait of an oddball utopia slowly being swallowed up by ""progress"" such as mini-marts and consumerism.Enid & Rebecca are casual observers. Anything that falls below their radar, you can bet Enid will have some witty rejoinder or dry comment dripping in sarcasm on hand, while Rebecca stands off to the side mulling it over and chipping in if and when necessary.The film charts the deterioration of their friendship. Although Enid is in no hurry to grow up and get on with things, Rebecca senses an inevitability to her life. Being a non-conformist is one thing, but at some point, we all have to conform to some of life's expectations of us.Rebecca gets a job at Starbucks (or something like it) and goes apartment hunting for herself and Enid. Things like these don't interest Enid. She's trapped in a perpetual fantasy. A bubble she believes will remain intact. And when she does try to follow Rebecca's example, doing a regular job, its like watching a dog walk on its hind legs.Enid wasn't meant for normal life. She loves to stand out from everyone around her. And she has an eclectic wardrobe for each and every (social) occasion. Rebecca may be an outsider too, but perhaps she recognises it as one of life's many phases.So with Enid & Rebecca growing further and further apart, Enid finds solace in Seymour (a perfectly cast Steve Buscemi), a record collector unlucky in love. Enid plays a rather cruel joke on Seymour by responding to a personal ad he put in the paper. She stands him up, sort of, by observing him from a distance (like she does with everything), and becomes fascinated by this oddity of a man.She senses a kindred spirit in Seymour. Someone who doesn't fit in, a social misfit, and inept at life's ironies. But when she actually gets Seymour a date, he starts spending less and less time with Enid. And as Enid's perfectly perceptive world falls apart, she spirals into depression and despair.Ghost World is the type of teen film you pray for, and when it finally comes, you almost feel like slapping yourself in astonishment. A teen film that's witty, sharp but most of all, perceptive. Also one of its nicest touches is the fact it stars actual teenagers for a change, not adults ten years older.Ghost World comes with a positively anti-authoritarian stamp on it. I sense Terry Zwigoff is a bit of a non-conformist himself. And he's selected two superb actresses to carry the film off with aplomb.Thora Birch is the undisputed star. She so neatly captures Enid's character you couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. Her performance is so wonderful the way it rotates from cynicism, intuition and eventually gut-wrenching despair. Each line of dialogue she delivers to perfection. From capital letter to full stop. And yet despite being attuned to the world around her, she is naive in her way. She has the vain belief things will always stay the same. Observing the world at a coldly detached distance. But as the world makes her a participant, its something that shatters her world forever. What an impressive, heartbreaking performance from someone so young.Ghost World came at a time just before Scarlett Johansson's career took off. And although she doesn't get as much screen time as Birch, she's equally impressive. She quite modestly allows Birch to take the spotlight because she knows its Enid's life story that's captured our interest. Johansson's performance is more subtle than Birch's, but she is necessary, because she provides an effective counterpoint to Enid's role without having to do very much at all. Which is why Scarlett Johansson is such a wonderful actress. But she'd have to wait for Lost in Translation to show her true mettle, where she plays a character not all that different from Rebecca.Steve Buscemi is in his element as Seymour. He's the man we hope to never become. Buscemi is known for choosing quirky, off-centre roles and Seymour is no exception. A man of few joys and even fewer accomplishments.The crux of Ghost World is Enid. What she slowly senses is that her defiantly defended role as life's abject observer can't go on forever. One day, she will have to grow up. And perhaps she does at the end. The last thing we ever see of her is getting on a bus. Where she's going is a mystery. But at least she's getting out of town. Perhaps progress has finally caught up with Enid.Cherish Ghost World. Its the perfect antidote to predictable teen movies and their comfortable clichés.",Ghost World

Having seen 'Crumb', (a documentary, whereas this is fiction) I can warn you that it will break your heart, but in a loving tender way that makes you want to go out and protect every outsider or loser in the world.In case you haven't noticed, there's often more humanity and caring in these folks' little fingers than in the entire body and soul(?) of a corporate CEO or hypocritical current presidents of the U.S.  If Seymour were president, we WOULD sign the petition for ""Rights of Children"" as 190 nations other than ours have.

83,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,Silly and oh so realistic - but - INTENSELY OVERRATED,6,26 April 2008,"I saw this movie once when it first came out on DVD, then again today. I didn't like it the first time, and I really can't say I found much about it too impressive this time around either. I feel like this movie is highly overrated. I have no idea how it made 110 Top Ten lists that year, must've been a bad year for movies! Scarlett Johansson makes debuts in her first major role, as a totally average girl who just graduated high school and wants to get an apartment. Wow...exciting... And she's looking boyish and band-geeky as always. Thora Birch is silly and starts out likable, then slowly as the movie progresses you realize more and more that her character is just a braindead 18 year old who doesn't know how to do anything but lead people on and make her own life more miserable/difficult. She doesn't know who she is or what she wants and it's extremely frustrating to watch. You would think it would be entertaining, but it's really pretty bland and I definitely wanted to put a bullet in her head towards the end. Steve Buscemi who I must say is an amazing actor, also does his job in this movie, BUT, is also an extremely boring character. Ultra-uninteresting collecting dork. On the cover of the movie, the main remark from reviews they use is ""A visionary film!"" - all I can say is I DON'T SEE IT! What is visionary about this? It's so basic and bland, and it has no special style or atmosphere. What DOES keep Ghost World entertaining is it's well-executed sense of realism (you'd definitely believe these chicks just graduated from high school), and it's effective dry humor.

84,nobbytatoes,a great off centered comedy,8,1 April 2006,"Enid and Rebecca have just graduated from high school, happy to be free from their class mates. Enid failed her art course, needing to take summer schooling to pass the grade. Rebecca has dreamed of moving from home to her own place and securing a job. While looking through the personal ads in the paper, they decide to prank a man; hoping to meet a woman he ran into at the airport. After seeing Seymour, Enid becomes interested on what kind of person he is; while Rebecca rather not. As Enid finds Seymour more of a mystery, her friendship starts to strain with Rebecca.Ghost World is a great comedy of growing up, friendship, acceptance and their limitations. Enid and Rebecca have always lived on the outskirts of society; making assumptions in snide manner how crazy and idiotic everyone is. Enid always has to go against the grain, constantly showing how different and individual she is. Rebecca realises she's been in Enid's shadow for to long, wanting to change; not being hindered by Enid's negativity.Ghost World is inhabited by some entertaining characters. Josh with only one expression, while Enid and Rebecca torment him at work. Enid's art teacher; there is great satire on how you can call anything art.Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson work great together as the odd outsiders. Steve Buscemi is also great as the geeky blues lover, nostalgic collector of records.For a step away from conventional comedies, Ghost World is a great movie for all those people who have felt like an outsider themselves.",Ghost World
85,Ddey65,"Enid Colelsaw is no Daria Morgendorffer or Jane Lane, but that's okay.",7,28 January 2007,"Prior to the limited release of this movie in the USA, there was a rumor started by cartoonist Daniel Clowes that MTV stole the idea for DARIA from some of his issues of EIGHTBALL. I have some early issues of Eightball and I think they're cool(although none of them feature Ghost World), but the fact remains that Glenn Eichler based Daria partially on Janeane Garofalo and partially on a girl he knew in high school, and created her to have someone to play off the stupidity of Beavis and Butt-head. Nevertheless, the approaching release piqued the interest of a lot of Daria fans including myself, so naturally I saw it, which was obviously what Clowes wanted since his accusations were a paper-thin publicity stunt. Whether it's the graphic novel or the movie, the only thing GHOST WORLD has in common with Daria is that they both have two jaded, sarcastic, disaffected teenage girls as main characters, one of which wears glasses and one of which is an artist. Unlike Daria, the girl with the thick glasses and the artist are one in the same, but there's plenty more to distinguish Clowes' tale from Eichler's.Enid Coleslaw(Thora Birch) and Rebecca Dopplemeyer(Scarlett Johannson) have just graduated from high school and are glad to end that period of their lives. Unfortunately, Enid needs a few more art credits to earn the rest of her diploma, so this means she has to go to summer school. At least for the moment though, they both know they can spend their lives laughing at the blandness and stupidity around them, while they both seek a shared apartment. One day while playing a prank on a man who wrote a personal ad(Steve Buscemi), Enid starts to take pity on the target of their shared practical joke. And to her surprise starts to fall in love with him, despite the fact that a woman actually answers his ad, and they both start dating. Thora Birch looked cute one minute, and ugly the next. This is one part of what makes her character so different than Eichler's creation. To Daria, fashion whether attractive or hideous is for the Quinn's of the world, while Enid dresses in oddball outfits every day, apparently because she can't decide what her style should be.In the years since I started writing this review, I actually picked up a copy of Clowes' graphic novel, and I read the script in the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, and found a scene or two that wasn't originally in the movie. It also has photographs of some of those scenes. Let that be a lesson to those who dismiss the importance of reading. It's only a shame that these missing scenes weren't on the DVD.",Ghost World

88,bix171,Effortlessly Brilliant,10,28 March 2002,"Terry Zwigoff's first fictional film (he created the documentary `Crumb') is a darkly hilarious and poignant study of high school alienation and middle-aged despair. The two entwine when recent graduate Enid (a brilliantly prickly Thora Birch) meets shy loner nerd Seymour (Steve Buscemi at his most humane and never better) and forms a relationship that she can't help but manipulate. Enid is a perfect example of teenage angst but Zwigoff and co-scenarist Daniel Clowes (who wrote the graphic novel on which the film is based) don't let her off easy: she never matures enough to realize that as smart as she thinks she is, she still can't resolve her issues by running away. Zwigoff clearly identifies with his main characters and it's this compassion that gives the film its moral compass--he's unwilling to go for the cheap laugh (though he's merciless when he has to be, creating deliciously broad caricatures and indulging in wickedly bad taste when he has to make a point) but he effortlessly mixes comedy with pathos to create a sharply defined world of misfits and woebegones. Zwigoff is a natural filmmaker, someone with the gift of telling a story cleanly while sharply addressing concerns that are universal and deeply felt.

89,eshwarmail,A teen movie that is surprisingly mature and engaging,8,9 January 2017,"Reviewed April 2012Though treads on a familiar path, never come across a teen movie with so much wit and introspection into teen angst and all of this done in a surprisingly lighter tone. Enid (Thora Birch) and Becky (Scarlett Johansson) are childhood friends who just finished high school and are planning to move into an apartment. Both are mischievous and rebellious, Enid more than Becky and decides to call on a personal ad what seemed to be from a lonely man. They ask the ad placer to come to a specific restaurant and enjoy the disappointment of the man one Seymour (Steve Buscemi) who waits and leaves. Enid gets interested in Seymour and gets to know him and becomes friends. On her personal front, she is conflicted with her own ideas and makes some poor decisions making her lose the scholarship, Becky, Seymour's friendship and a chance to move into the apartment. How she copes with all this forms the entire story. Without knowing anything about the movie the initial 15 minutes hinted this as a girl version of Superbad. It changes soon getting more intimate on what is happening in a teenager's mind who is resorting to pride when there is a feeling of being left out. Scarlett Johansson looks stunning but she does not have a lot of role here as Thora Birch is the star. Though there is no scope here for great acting, she does a terrific job portraying the troubled teenager. The director deals with this delicate subject with steady and confident hands never toning down the spirit of a teenager. Buscemi does his character with ease as a lonely weird stranger.Never boring or awkward (as most teenage movies tend to), tells a simple story in the most effective way it is possible to.",Ghost World

91,refresh_daemon,A good quirky little film,8,1 February 2007,"I was surprised to find that Ghost World is a comic book adaptation. The film is full of quirkiness and a same-time embracing of geeks/dorks as well as pitying them. We start with two semi-outcast high school students graduating high school. From then, we primarily follow Enid (Thora Birch), who finds herself in an existential phase of her life, having escaped from her hated experience, but finding herself in a meaningless and pointless world, with little direction of her own. And this is a comedy that somehow works, even when burdened by such philosophical weight.The comedy in Ghost World is not the gut-busting type, but rather the quiet situational type that's amusing. At the same time, as we laugh at the nerds, geek, freaks, dorks and dweebs that inhabit Ghost World, the film works to humanize them in our eyes and raise a sympathy for them. Suddenly their eccentricities seem less strange and more interesting. And like Enid, we find ourselves drawn to them.This film has a bit in common in terms of tone with the heavier American Splendor as well as the lighter Napoleon Dynamite, featuring an offbeat humor style and complete with curious characters. Despite the comedy, this film is a drama at its core, dealing with a youth's entry to the ""real world"", complete with all its harshness and disappointments. As we watch the film, we see her best-friendship with Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) tested, struggle with young love and infatuation and try to find her way in a world that doesn't feed her direction, but asks her to discover it for herself. And like many young people, she finds it very difficult to deal with the responsibility.And in the drama, we find the heart of the film, watching Enid with compassionate eyes through her struggles.Steve Buscimi completes the primary cast as Seymour, a jazz/blues geek who Enid takes on as her first mission once she graduates, finding in him a sort of spiritual corollary. The performances are solid, with the humor played deadpan and the drama dramatic. The direction is of the classic invisible Hollywood style and the pace of the film is fine. I think the ending is a little bit of a cop-out, but I guess that's how some stories go.I thought it was a good, quirky little film and if you're a fan of those kinds of films, I'd recommend Ghost World to you. 8/10",Ghost World
92,bazookamouth-221-898097,Great little movie,7,13 September 2018,"Really liked this with a very young Scarlett and Thora interacting with various strange characters and the problems they occur after meeting Steve Buscemi older character. I saw this movie 17 years ago when it first came out and now I watch it it has less fascination now but still great. Birch and Johansson career paths differed in the next 17 years or so, with Johansson becoming a real superstar and Birch slid into obscurity with some terrible movies. I wonder if the old man at the disused bus stop who sat there non stop, I wonder if this was a metaphor for death for him when the bus came and later for Thora Birch character? Maybe she killed herself? Who can say.",Ghost World

94,Bob Pr.,Good story & good acting help overlook the reality flaws.,7,9 September 2002,"This is a ""slice of life"" film telling the story of Enid (Thora Birch) and her best and only friend, right after their senior year in high school as they prepare to move on with whatever's in the rest of their lives.Dialogue, actions, characterizations, casting and story are all good.  One can suspend criticism of it until after the movie's finished.I suspect the movie intends to leave us on a not quite resolved but hopeful note, that Enid's at last on her way to finding herself.The _one_ difficulty I have with the movie -- after seeing it -- is that Enid is so consistently negative about others that it has to reflect a really poor self-concept and the things that go with it.  She continually tries to build herself up at the expense of putting others down. 
And then, when she is accepted as being worthy enough as a partner by her best friend and also by a temporary conquest, she has to act in such a way as to make them want to reject her, too. One of Groucho Marx's great lines was, ""I refuse to belong to any club that would have a person like me as a member.""  While Enid's character probably wouldn't verbally agree with that statement or see its humor, her actions speak louder.  Unlike Groucho, she'd actually apply for membership in the club Groucho mentioned and then, after being accepted, force them to kick her out.  ""Ghost World"" is gifted, incredibly sharp, in the way it shows this same dynamic at work over and over again.  So my difficulty with it is that I did not think Enid's pain, the awful aching depth of it down to her toe-nails, was adequately presented at all.  We saw only the briefest glimpses of it.Everything else was well and realistically done.  Her single parent background, no mother.  How consistently Enid operated to seize defeat from the jaws of any victory.  My experience treating people like this is that while it's not impossible to change this, change IS terribly hard and until then, the old patterns are repeated painfully, endlessly, over and over.  Another town, another start, new friends -- those just can't hack it; the old patterns are far stronger. A _really_ good movie otherwise.",Ghost World
95,ArmandoManuelPereira,"Quirky At First, And Then It Deepens Nicely In the Second Half",7,5 May 2020,"At first you are tempted to believe that Ghost World is simply a quirky comedy about 2 high-school girls. But as the movie progresses past its half way point, it begins to deepen, and you realize that its main character (Enid) is going through a painful stretching of mind and heart, which opens up some profound insights into the tension between idealism and reality. All the leads are good, though its hard sometimes for me to accrpt Buscemis typical shtick. Still, he's pretty good in this. At first I thought the ending was a little wrong, and should have quit with the old man boarding the bus. But afterwards it occurred to me that their is actually something strange and almost mystical about it.",Ghost World
96,Hallelujah289,Uncomfortable; sometimes endearing; plot is thin,6,13 July 2021,"Hard film to rate because it's very original and takes more risks than other films. However I also found some parts just weird. Protagonists weren't really likable but I did have sympathy for them because of the movie which is a feat of either the acting or the story or born.The ending is kind of baseless and hard to believe if we take the common metaphor that going on the bus means that Enid took her own life. I just didn't get that from the character and it seems a conventionally accepted analysis of the ending. Perhaps Enid is in some trouble without a goal but she didn't strike me as that extremely cynical-just bratty and impulsive on a lesser scale.Otherwise not a bad film, memorable, and the lead two friends have a believable dynamic.",Ghost World
97,CineCritic2517,Entertaining but slow-paced towards the end.,7,24 October 2006,"Ghostworld was for the most part a fine movie to watch and the performances were certainly more than up-to-standard even though the deliberate under-acting was sometimes a bit overdone(does that make sense?).Much better than the average blockbuster but not completely without flaw. Because partially due to the lack of story development after the first half, it seems to linger on longer than it should have. This left me feeling that this movie had already made its point earlier on.Having said that, we still have a worthwhile movie. For me mainly because of the dark and timeless atmosphere which is played upon beautifully by Buscemi, Birch and Johansson. A nice satire about hatefulness towards people and the changes in life and the way we can either try to avoid it or reconcile with, knowing that the change will ultimately come just the same. Add to this beautiful cinematography, some good laughs and eye-pleasing costumes and you have Ghost World.Save this one for a rainy evening with a nice bottle of wine or two. But if you don't get sucked in the story after 15 minutes or so, you may want to consider popping in another one 'cause it won't go anywhere else.7/10",Ghost World

But that was the only thing she pulled off.Enid (Birch) is a young lady just-graduated from high school.  She is one of those people who thinks that the world owes them something.  She tries a couple of different jobs (she's even lucky enough that one of them is handed to her on a silver platter), but just can't seem to find her place in life. She likes to have her fun at other people's expense and when she gets told off, she always finds some way to blame them and not accept any responsibility, herself.The problem with this movie is that it gets old real fast.  The shocking thing I found out about this movie was that I actually managed to sit through it!  This is a story about a girl who waits for life to come to her.

It's an anti-teen flick with a impeccable script and great performances, especially by Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi.Going from the dark comedy to the melancholic but unforgettable final scene, this is, like Roger Ebert mentioned, the kind of film you want to give a hug. In fact, despite I'm not American, GHOST WORLD talked to me and still stays in my mind.9/10",Ghost World
101,pontifikator,Interesting movie about losers,7,25 March 2011,"This is an interesting film directed by Terry Zwigoff and based on a comic book series by Daniel Clowes.The main characters are two girls we meet at their high school graduation: Enid, played by Thora Birch, and Rebecca, played by Scarlett Johansson. Steve Buscemi has a major role as Seymour, a dork adopted by Enid as her person of interest, and Bob Balaban, Teri Garr, John Malkovich, and David Cross have roles as well.Enid and Rebecca are realistically shown as typical high schoolers who spend their time putting down other people (losers, dorks) and laughing at them. Although they denigrate everyone, the two girls offer no constructive ideas or alternatives, which is typical high school behavior for American teens. The problem brought out by Clowes and Zwigoff is that the two girls are on the cusp of becoming those others. Rebecca gets a job and has to deal with lousy customers and crappy bosses, but she has to make a living.Enid gets a job but refuses to accept things as they are, insults her customers, and gets fired on her first day. The problem is, she wants to rent an apartment with Rebecca, and that takes money, and that means having a job.One can view Rebecca as the more mature of the two, since she clearly understands the nature of making a living. Enid can't let go of her high school behavior and move into young adulthood. While most teens are aimless in high school, at some point the kids gain some focus and move into adulthood where they have goals and plans. We see Rebecca making that growth, but we also see Enid remaining aimless.Enid played a prank on Seymour, whom she identifies correctly as a dork loser, but runs into him at a yard sale and discovers that although he's a loser dork, there's a real human in those ill-fitting, ugly clothes. Seymour realizes he is who he is and has more or less accepted it. Enid makes it her project to get him dates. Buscemi is excellent as Seymour, making him human in spite of his dorkiness. Seymour seems to be the one person Enid identifies with and cares about, much to the amazement and disdain of Rebecca. Seymour briefly gives Enid something to work for, but she's unable to make anything of herself in her efforts to get Seymour a life. In the end, her aspirations remain childish.What really interests me about the movie is that there is no success. ""Ghost World"" does not have a happy ending. Enid screws everything up for Rebecca, Seymour, and herself. And then the movie ends. This is not a happy teen flick where the geeks go on to college and the cheerleaders get their comeuppance. This is not a coming of age flick where the kids all learn from their immature behavior and then grow up. The ending is something of a puzzle. I believe it was intentionally left open to interpretation, so I'll leave that for you to see and decide for yourselves. Although the main characters are high school girls, this is definitely a movie for grownups who think.",Ghost World
102,TheFilmGuy1,I'd Rather See A Movie About The Redneck With The Nunchucks,6,13 May 2014,"I can see why this film would be a cult classic of sorts, but I really couldn't get into it. It seemed like it had some kind of anti-conforming message to it, but I just really thought it tried too hard. It's the kind of movie that teenagers on Tumblr would love and talk about and think they're so hip for liking cause they love vinyl and dressing different and hating high school and society. Now, I for one love the idea of people being different and unique. I thought Seymore was a great character for this reason. He had a passion and that made him interesting. Enid was just a character who hated everything for the sake of it and tried to be alternative cause she thinks its cool. Even when people start growing up and maturing around her she sticks to her guns about being alternative. I just don't wanna watch a movie about a character like that. It had a nice message about censorship in there which was interesting, and had ideas that I do agree with, but I felt it executed them poorly. It made everything black or white, essentially saying if you conform you're terrible, but at the same time showed the idea of non-conformity to be not so good too. It just was very unclear. I just didn't really enjoy it. Although I would be interested in a spin off movie about Doug, the crazy dude with nunchucks.",Ghost World

(**SPOILER**) as she took that art class, and as she slowly started to hang out with the jazz man, her art became more risque and demented.  is that a sign that the relationship was truly wrong, and that she needed to get away from all that town, and start completely over in life? now that she graduated, she could get away, and maybe her character needed that escape. the movie was an ok movie, with a lot of cussing, which shows a lot of anger in both of the characters, enid and her best friend.  so maybe they both needed help.  heck, maybe that whole town needed help, since all the characters that we had contact with all had some issues.  so maybe it shows that all people need a break before they go crazy like enid..  who knows?  art movies sometimes have messages that i dont really understand  (B- C+)",Ghost World

She experiments to find out who she is, but not in the direction that will move her forward.  What she does not realize is that everyone around her is moving ahead, with her best friend Rebecca moving on after graduation.  Often, her decisions are made out of haste and turns out to be too little to late, like the Art School application or the moving in with her friend.  In the process, she lets many people down, like quitting jobs that others went out of the way to get her, constant no-shows and making her friend Seymour break up with his girlfriend just because she implied they could start over somewhere else, but she herself not living up to it.  I guess in the end, her life is not to be in her hometown, where everything that had meant anything to her is not there for her anymore.  So she decides to take the leap and go in the same route where the old man who took the bus that should have never arrived.

106,hippiedj,"Poignant, yet increasingly annoying at the same time",7,8 August 2002,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Ghost World. I felt like the character Enid back in the 70s in high school. I still have a circle of friends that collect old 78 records and antique telephones. However, I didn't go out of my way to be hurtful towards others. That's where I think this film went a bit overboard.I did feel for Enid as she was stuck in a nowhere of a town and just could not connect to the people and happenings around her. The film's ending was rather poignant and I actually got a bit teary-eyed over that moment. It's just that Enid's callous behaviour became increasingly annoying and tiresome by the end of the film, and it made it a bit difficult for me to relate to her and root for her.For example, she got louder and more obnoxious in the porn shop, completely ignoring Semour's pleas for her to just settle down. She also had this problem of being able to ""dish it out but not take any back"" in a manner best examplified by her constant ridiculing of others openly, yet throwing a complete fit when she was criticized for her green hair and punk outfit. I know wayyy too many teens who act like this, they feel they have a complete right to hurt others yet GOD FORBID you do it to them back. Then, there was her ""have her cake and eat it too"" problem where she was infatuated with Seymour yet continuously gave him grief. As for her father, I know he was not a strong personality, but he gave her everything she could want and she would just glare at him.The supporting characters helped this film for me, particularly Rebecca. I don't see her as ""conforming"" at all, but rather finding her meant direction. Most of her shared ridiculing of others was basically in support of Enid. We see that while others' lives might not be what we would want, but they've still found a degree of happiness: Rebecca, Enid's father, and even Seymour.I don't think Enid was a bad person, she just couldn't connect. Thus, the wonderful ending in which you get the feeling she'll find her place somewhere and that actually made me happy for her.Unfortunately the younger folk I know that have said this film ""rocked"" were of the sort that find gloomy fashionable and go out of their way to just be the opposite of everyone. Sort of like the kids on a Jenny Jones show that are all decked out in punk and goth and say ""I'm just expressing myself and being an individual,"" yet actually if they looked at the other kids saying that, they all looked exactly the same. Sheep mentality on another level. There's a difference in being ""unique and different"" and TRYING to be unique and different on PURPOSE. Many have missed the point of this film in that manner. I think Enid truly was different, just a bit more on a negative level and frustrated that she couldn't get herself to try to look a little deeper to see what she might really want in life. Aw heck, at this writing I'm 39 years old and I still am searching, but at least I know common courtesy towards others.Despite its flaws, I still was left more satisfied than angry after viewing Ghost World. If it wasn't for that brilliant ending, I might not be as nice about the film.",Ghost World

109,heyimmyx,Immy's review : A sad yet intriguing black comedy,8,10 September 2020,"'Ghost World' is an interestingly commendable movie for the various themes and issues it explores, presented in a witty yet darkly ominous way. The movie focuses on 18 year old Enid, who holds a pessimistic view of life and attempts to acquire a unique persona, detaching herself from the strange and unsettling world around her. The film delves into themes of consumerism, conformity and teen angst, as Enid's increasingly negative view of the world starts shaping the friendships around her. The acting was superb, especially from Steve Buscemi as the awkward yet unapologetically authentic Seymour, whom Enid finds solace in and as someone who also shares her grim view of the world. The movie perfectly nails that moment between childhood and adulthood, when teenagers are still figuring out who they are and what they want in life. The best thing about this movie is the relatability of every character ; We all know an Enid who is rebelling in every sense of the word so she doesn't have to be like anyone else, and we all know a Seymour whose cynical about absolutely everything. It's these human characteristics that give us some truly authentic and true to life personalities. I loved the movies eery and detached atmosphere ; It mocks the many alien-like characters we come across, and yet boldly and poignantly paints them as victims of a judgemental and hypocritical society, whilst exposing the many silly ideas and concepts that humans have on how to live a fulfilling life. For example, Rebecca's idea that having fancy cups in her new house will make her happy and fulfilled. The fact that 'Ghost World' is just a reflection of our own reality only makes this more bleak. Overall, a sad yet captivating movie highlighting the problems of the society we live in, whilst exposing the many depressing views we hold as humans. A superb soundtrack, interesting characters and satirical atmosphere make this a great watch. My only comment would be that I wished to have seen more focus or detail on Rebecca's and Enid's relationship, as it did feel a little thin. All in all however, highly recommend!",Ghost World
110,RMurray847,Best written movie so far this year!,9,7 September 2001,"Witty, clever, touching, wry, cynical, sincere...the accolaids just go on and on. This movie (whose plot others have summarized already) really creates a nice balance between the ridiculous, the cynical and the moving. It's funny and dramatic, often at the same time. The characters, however outrageous, are tightly drawn. Everyone in the movie has moments where you hate them and moments where you really empathsize with them. You see the good side and the bad...you see why people might be drawn to a character and also what parts of the character would get old in a hurry.  It's like an AMERICAN BEAUTY for a younger generation, but hey, I'm 37 and enjoyed it a lot.  And it's nice that they got two terrific teenaged performers playing the teenagers!  Thora Birch is great...she's so smart and cynical, yet vulnerable.  She's not some generic teenage girl who hates society and dyes her hair black. We actually can understand how her sympathy for the downtrodden is an admirable character.  I'd like to see Birch try a different kind of role soon, so we can see what her other chops are. Steve Buschemi is always great, and he doesn't disappoint here. He's so good at being annoying and amusing and touching all at once.  Illeana Douglass, as an art teacher, is very funny.  I gave the movie a 9 (really wanted to do 8.5). Why not 9.5? The last scene of the movie is a stinker. Why leave an audience that's followed you all the way with a feeling of ""huh?""

111,WrathChld,Where does life go?,8,9 February 2003,"I recall seeing this movie advertised on the home page of this IMDb website. After reading what it was about, I wondered if it was a good movie I had just never heard of.  Many times I saw it on sale and wanted to take a risk buying it.  Yesterday, I saw it on sale and decided to take a chance.  The cover of the DVD shows the two main characters, Rebecca and Enid.  After watching the movie, I feel the cover really only portrays Enid in the right light.  Rebecca seems to come off (how she is portrayed on the cover) in the beginning of the movie, but grows throughout.  The movie is basically the struggle of life for Enid.  The challenges one faces when they are trying to find themselves and where they want to go.  A time where you just seem to stand still because nothing seems to go your way.  You do not seem to have any idea where to go, but you wish you did.  This movie is good like that. It is like watching a television show.  Its down to earth and not trying to be bigger than what it is.  Many actors in is this movie (you might not know their names) you have seen in other movies and TV shows.  I really don't want to give allot away about the movie other than its the struggle of life for Enid's character.  Everything seems to go wrong and when you think things are going good ... that's when they go even worse.  It just goes to show, no one can predict life.  Before I end, I have to mention one character in this movie that shows up twice.  I don't recall the character's name, but he is wicked funny.  He is a total southern redneck with mullet and white trash style.  He embraces his 40oz, beef jerky, and nun-chucks well.  He is speaks out and is absolutely crazy and funny.  Got to check it out.

112,Deckard-16,I drolled in pleasure watching this movie.,10,9 February 2002,"This is clearly one of the five best movies I've seen this past 12 months. It the funniest movie I've seen since ""Best In Show"" and yet this is a drama and a very moving one. Although it is very off center it has a real heart to it. It is tempting to call this movie weird, but that would be damning it. It is a tale of 2 alienated teens and thier antics. The antics (pranks?) have real consequences good and bad on the people around them and themselves. The stories before, during and after these antics are as involving as they amusing. You feel that the characters have real back stories before they are introduced. The script is excellent. The dialogue is as hilarious as drollness can get. Thora Birch and Scarlett Johanssen are outstanding as the 2 teen girls. Steve Buscemi is probably the moral center of this movie in a role that you normally don't see in him. He is a nice and quirky guy who doesn't have much luck with women (don't we all?). Buscemi soars. Anyone who has ever seen the documentary ""Crumb"" will recognize this movie from a mile away because it's director, Terry Zwigoff, is the director of this movie. ""Ghost World"" like ""Crumb"" celebrate eccentricity. I don't think the fictional ""Ghost World"" is as ""out there"" as the real life ""Crumb"", but both are very off-beat and wonderful. Zwigoff might be in danger of categorizing himself already as a master of making the off center stuff heartfelt.

113,nqure,"An affecting, quirky rites of passage movie",8,20 April 2002,"I'd be waiting to see this, but kept missing it. I then saw 'The Royal Tenenbaums' which was flat and a disappointment.  So when I came to 'Ghost World', it was with an element of apprehension. Would this just be another quirky empty comedy?Though 'Ghost World' does meander at times, I liked this movie. It is genuinely affecting and one can identify with the main characters. 'Tenenbaums' had too many characters, but Enid (Birch) is constantly at the emotional core of this movie so that, in turn, we become interested in her life and in those she encounters.'Ghost World' covers the difficult transition between high-school and the adult world, how friendships change, evolve and grow apart. Rebecca acclimatizes to real life whilst Enid tries to retain her quirky individualism and refuses to compromise with the mundanities of real life (her job in the cinema is amusing. What I liked about this film was its obvious comments on the sterility of modern life (cameras panning down a street full of rows of fast-food restaurants) and how people are almost a 'ghostlike' shadow of themselves as they accept this standardised world of mindless conformity. The film is about individuality, and it's interesting how like attracts like: Enid is drawn to the middle-aged loner/outsider Seymour. She initially mocks him, but soon they find they have much in common. She in turn, learns that others too have an emotional life and are vulnerable.The film's humour etc is subtle, I particularly liked one apparently meaningless frame at the end. Enid, alone, walks almost in a ghost-like daze whilst behind her a man walks in the background happily eating his burger. Illyena Douglas is a caricature feminist art lecturer who comes across as a standard PC liberal. Yet she recognises Enid's individual talent and encourages her and in the end, it is PC attitudes, not this woman, who dash Enid's hopes of going to art college. I don't think the final scene was a cop-out. Rather, it establishes that an individual sometimes must leave their roots to find their own voice & identity.",Ghost World

The two girls (Birch and Johansson) reminded me so much of some of the people I went to high school with, and I am glad that someone has finally made a movie about those high school students who are so apathetic and negative and seem to others to be so unhappy. This film really did that clique well by humanizing and explaining why they are that way. And I loved the storyline about the bus line, so mysterious and creative!

Asit turns out, I was very disappointed in the end.It's not that the acting or filmmaking are bad, in fact the beautifulThora Birch, as the strangely kitsch and geek-addicted Enid, andSteve Buscemi, as the kitsch-collecting geek Seymour, were verygood.  But the film was uncomfortably vacant of any kind of energybeyond the mundane existence of a bunch of semi-quirkycharacters with no inner-energy or real engagement (for theviewer).  It was as if the director, Terry Zwigoff, raided the props,costuming, and acting departments of some old John Waterspicture, and dropped them into a vapid little plot devoid of all thereal quirkiness and off-colour charm that Waters always managesto squeeze out of his pictures.  And given Zwigoff's CRUMB was anexercise in ""uber-quirky"", it really doesn't seem to add up.Unfortunately, me and my sister found ourselves yawningthroughout and not really caring about any of the characters orwhere they were heading in this languid little journey.  The fewlaughs  in the movie came from Dave Sheridan as the mullet- sporting, nunchuk-wielding Doug, and sadly he has very littlescreen time.  The only other real selling point was the truly diverseand eclectic soundtrack which would be worth picking up ratherthan the actual DVD, in my opinion (I'll actually raise my rating onepoint for the music alone). 6/10.

123,~AleXa~,A fascinating character study that explores human nature and the consequences of our actions,6,6 September 2015,"Reviewed September 6th, 2015 - 1st viewing (IFC HD) Based on the comic book by Daniel Clowes, the film centers around two teen outcasts struggling to find their place in the world after they graduate high school. Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) has plans to get a job and an apartment, however Enid (Thora Birch) is decidedly less motivated, having spent her whole life just skating by. She must inevitably learn that there are very real consequences for her actions—even in indifference.The film makes for a very interesting social commentary about the difficulty of maintaining relationships and our struggle to find our place in the world, the quintessential tug-of-war to find the balance between being true to ourselves and hiding pieces of us to fit into society's accepted norms. It makes a provocative statement about how society and media make us feel we have to choose between acceptance and being who we are. The word normal is constantly thrown around, particularly by her best friend Rebecca, serving to illustrate the fundamental differences between the two girls, with Enid spending most of her life seeing what she wanted to see, only to discover her and Rebecca were not as alike as she thought.Enid's boredom leads her to play a practical joke on a lonely man searching for a woman he met in a personal ad. After the two girls observe his melancholy and follow him to his home, Enid discovers he collects and sells records. They hit it off and she starts to see that he's not so different than her. Believing she's found a kindred spirit in a man twice her age, she takes an interest and starts spending time with him, promising to find him a date.Her journey is an illustration of how we can get so caught up in our own lives that we fail to see that we are neglecting those important to us—our relationships—the very thing we rely on for emotional support. And when someone we care about fails us, we either internalize it or lash out. Enid's required art class poignantly illustrated that artistic license cannot so easily be acquired, but instead of working to cultivate her own creativity, she chose to use an old art piece borrowed from Seymour. This unfortunately would also prove to have dire consequences.Seymour finally got that call from the girl he'd been looking for in the ad and Enid encouraged him to meet her. After they hit it off, he sadly became self-involved and blew Enid off, never giving thought to the fact that she had genuinely cared for him. And so with that disappointment causing her to only think of herself, frustrated that he was settling for a woman he had little in common with to be 'taken care of', Enid recoiled back into her comfort zone—Rebecca. Unfortunately, she failed to see that while she was caught up with her infatuation with Seymour, she wasn't being a friend to Rebecca.Naturally, it hurt her when Enid only wanted to hang out with her because Seymour blew her off. Rebecca did not lie to be malicious, but to protect herself, as she was beginning to see for the first time that perhaps their 'friendship' was based more on convenience than true affection. I can relate on this point, as people continually undervalue the importance of balance in their lives in terms of their relationships as a whole. If you only focus on one, the others will suffer, and you can't play people like fiddles and expect them to still be around when the fog clears. Part of discovering how to be happy is figuring out how to balance all the elements within it, instead of ascribing to the misguided belief that you can hand pick a few and that will be enough.The story seemed to stretch a little beyond its reach as Rebecca grew increasingly frustrated with Enid's attitude. Instead of Enid simply admitting she didn't feel she could be honest with her, she insulted her, causing Rebecca to lash out. This hurt Enid, penetrating the walls she thought she had in place, and her pain sent her fleeing to Seymour for comfort, succeeding in getting out of him what she wanted only to turn on her heels and run. She practically begged Rebecca to let her move in with her, only to disappoint her by not keeping her promise. I found it odd the two girls never hugged despite supposedly being best friends since childhood, and I was a little miffed by Rebecca's disregard for Seymour's feelings, coming off as more malicious than jealous, which seemed wholly unjustified.The title represents Enid feeling as though she's a ghost in a world filled with people. She feels invisible and inconsequential, something I think we can all relate to. She struggled through the whole film to figure out what she wanted instead of settling on complacency. Once she realized her only dream was to disappear, she had to find the courage to take that final step.Throughout the whole ordeal, Enid didn't seem to understand that her irresponsibility and feigned indifference had real consequences, and that her actions were hurting people. The end felt a little disjointed to me, as if they were trying to wrap everything up in a bow so we knew where we left each of the characters with little statement on the friendship she had taken for granted, which is what I found more interesting, especially considering the comic focuses more on both girls which I would've found to be more intriguing.FINAL VERDICT: More interesting that it appears, the in-depth look at what lies just beneath the surface of our lives and the intricacies of our relationships made for a profound watch, if only left feeling a little bewildered by the end.6.5 of 10.0",Ghost World

Anyway, as a person who has no idea how the book was, in my opinion, Ghost World is a wonderful little find. It has appealing characters, intelligent script and it doesn't try to be one of those movies that offer something to everyone (like Stigmata). Zwigoff keeps the tone nicely in control and the film has an entertaining balance of drama and humor. Birch deserves a special thumbs-up. Not only is she very good in the part of Enid, but I find her very attractive too. In many ways, Ghost World is a gem. Give it a chance.**** / *****",Ghost World
126,dav07dan02,i can't relate to 90% of humanity!,9,13 July 2005,"Director: Terry Zwigoff, Script: Zwigoff, Daniel Clowes, Cast: Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson, Steve Buscemi, Brad Renfro, Illeana Douglas, Bob Balaban, Stacey Travis, Charles C. Stevenson Jr.Anyone who has ever felt alone, confused or disillusioned by society will probably relate to the main characters in this film. The movie begins with the graduation of two best friends from high school. Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) are two rejects that just sort of drifted through school. They never got involved in anything and take a pessimistic attitude toward life. They are now stuck in limbo land between high school and the real world and haven't a clue as to where they are headed. Because they have nothing better to do, they choose to torment those around them. On day while sitting in a diner, they come across a personal add by a man looking for a women that he met eyes with. He thought their was chemistry between them and he writes the add hooping she will call. To torment this poor guy( played by Steve Buscemi as Seymour, a middle aged geek and social outcast), they call him pretending to be the women. They 'agree' to meet in a certain diner. The girls watch him sitting in the diner waiting for the women who of course never shows. He leaves the diner broken hearted. They follow him out of the dinner. Upon seeing what they had done to him, Enid starts to feel sorry for Seymour and takes to him to the point of even developing an attraction toward him probably because she sees him as an outcast much like herself. Seymour is the nerdy,self-conscience guy who never felt adequate around women. He is this intelligent artsy type guy with a huge collection of old jazz 78 rpm records. Enid befriends Seymour and is convinced she can find him a date. About a month later, the women that Seymour placed the add for actually calls and they start to date. She is a very pretty blond real estate agent closer to Seymour's age. She is sophisticated,confident and upbeat, totally the opposite of Enid. She helps bring Seymour out of his shell. Enid becomes very jealous of their friendship and tries to jeopardize it. Her obsession with Seymour puts a strain on her friendship with Rebecca.It also results in a series of unfortunate events in her own life The outcome of all this results in a rather downbeat ending to the film.Terry Zwigoff is a director known for making films about eccentric people. Daniel Clowes is a underground comic writer and Ghost World is based on one of his comics. I have heard that the film is quite different from the comic. In addition to Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson and Steve Buscemi, the film also had a strong supporting cast. Bob Balaban was good as Thora's father. He seemed to have a hard time understanding his daughter and appeared awkward around her at times but he still cared about her. Stacey Travis did a fine job playing Dana, Seymour's love interest and if course Illeana Douglass as Roberta the art teacher. This film can be interpreted different ways by different people watching it. Many people still debate about the ending where Thora rides away on the bus that was out of service. Some people say this is a metaphor for suicide while others say that it represents her starting a new life elsewhere, her desire to start over. There is no right or wrong answer. The film does not give us all the answers in the end. One thing for certain is the course of events in this film will have a lasting effect on all the characters especially Thora, Seymore and Dana. When Seymore had to confront Dana about the future of their relationship, I knew right away that he made the wrong decision. Norman, the old man,(Charles C. Stevenson) adds an element of mysticism to the movie. Every time Enid and Rebecca walk past the bus stop on an abandoned bus line, this man is always there both day and night. One time Enid confronts the old man to tell him that the bus no longer comes through here, he says to her ""you don't know what your talking about"". Well the bus does come and the bench at the bus stop is now empty. The next evening at the same time, Enid takes that same bus. I love the line where Seymour says ""I can't relate to 99% of humanity!"" to Enid. I often feel this way!",Ghost World
127,ayric,Somewhat Overrated,8,21 December 2001,"Ghost World has done exceptionally well in the States for a small independent film. Critcs have been raving; calling it one of the very best films of the year. The audience seems content too judging by the film's 8,2 (!) average on imdb.com placing it on a temporary 231st place. I must admit I found all of this somewhat strange after seeing it. The movie is based on a comic book and unlike all the superhero comic book adaptions this is about two girls after finishing high school, trying to cope with growing up. The story is comparable to several films about facing adulthood since the girls manage by staying negative and tough. It is, however, no typical such film. For that the story is much too down to earth and the acting and directing is much too good. Steve Buscemi plays an original character, unusual even for him. This is a good film and it is a breath of fresh air in between all the blockbusters. But it is not one of the movies of the year. It didn't provide that extra something and seems a little lightweight. Some of the scenes suffer from being a low budget production, such as the editing sometimes ruining the rhythm of the film. I will not mention the contents of the ending but there was a perfect ending, which would have made me give it an 8, but the filmmakers seem to have underrated their audience by putting in a couple of explanatory end sequences after that. They should have left it to the audience to figure out the rest, but I guess we are too stupid for that. Rating: 7/10",Ghost World

Nothing happened!  I have since bought said movie and I must admit it is one I have watched many times - but there you've got some phenomenal acting.  Here you've got what?  A confused young Genexter who ruins lives? Zwigoff's tribute to people like R. Crumb?  A flowing haunting parable about idle hands?  A character study on the people in small towns that are becoming large towns?  A dark comedy that gets lost in itself long before it gets anywhere?  A rather sad comment on how (what we do for money / work / time) changes us?  Ghost World is all these things and more.  And I'm quite sure the right kind of audience will eat it up.

Quietly superior to the strip mall folk around them, they sit through life sort of enjoying kitsch and irony.  Fine.  The movie fails because it centers on Enid, who so stubbornly remains detatched that she can't even engage with those she wants to engage with: she can't follow through on a crush and instead terrorizes her object of affection; she can't commit to as simple a dream as sharing an apartment with her best friend; and the man whom she calls her hero she ignores as soon as she beds him.  The problem is that the film remains almost as detatched as Enid, who eventually drifts off into her ghost world of non-commital.

However, it's a big stretch to call it a comedy - a bit of a satire, perhaps.The beginning leads us to think about teen angst, develops into middle-aged angst, and then a more universal angst. There's a bit of ""coming of age"", but the story really goes nowhere.Just when the plot thickens and the complexities of relationships evolve to the point that resolution is needed and expected, the film ends in a ""cop out"" fantasy.Although interesting, it's not a very satisfying experience unless you skip the beginning & end, and watch only the middle 90 minutes.

But having just graduated high school, there youth is excusable as much as their sceptical attitude of people.They look at the world with the honesty and directionless behaviour of a child, even if that honesty breaches dysfunctional (but humorous) heights. The film grasps firmly by the collar how the confusion of adulthood and importance of friendship is, while not making it all too mellow key and lacking originality.It also gives Thora the chance to, again, show her embarrassment of her parentage and cherish a freedom she shared in American Beauty. Johansson is more of an addition to her rather than have enough presence to be seen as whole new character; she only really acts as Thora's better half of her conscience within the film.Buscemi is the real deal. His character knows who he is and accepts his detachment from the real world, making up for his human company with classic vinyl records and singular knowledge of the music industry.

In the midst of flag waving and the unquestioned celebration of the American life style, comes a movie that focuses on the aesthetic rather than the commercial.  Like many of us who survived punk rock, the protagonist is the pure definition of a cynic.  Long before she will ever know what she wants to be, she has identified what she abhors.  It is in this juvenile eruditeness that the genius of ""Ghost World"" is expressed.  The entire course of the film is dedicated to the notion that you must seek out more than the mundane, and that the ""Don't worry, Be Happy"" mentality is nothing more than the agiotage of soulless people who market John Tesh to the masses.  Certain to be a double feature with ""High Fidelity"" once it is regurgitated on the art house circuit, ""Ghost World"" is both a welcome escape from Ari Fliescher and a small candle of hope that we will one day rise above ourselves.",Ghost World
138,Kalle_it,"A deceitful tale about ""outcasts""",6,2 January 2011,"Ghost World is a deceitful flick.At first glance it looks interesting and thought-provoking, but the more you think about it the most annoyingly pretentious and inane it gets.Enid is an ""outcast"" just because she herself decides to become one, while her friend Rebecca slowly grows out of the whole ""I'm different! look at me but don't look at me too much!"" teeny attitude.The initial idea of playing a prank on music geek Seymour is something preppies and jocks would do, surely not ""holier than thou"" Different Girls, so that's a bit baffling. Even more baffling is how quickly Enid falls for Seymour, just to pull a 180° the morning after they had sex.Why is Enid being a self-centered tool? Who knows... apparently they felt it wasn't really important making that clear or even understandable. Enid is the way she is because she is the way she is!It's a Ghost World Enid herself has built around her, but she's still unhappy with it, so she tries looking for ways to change it. Be it by messing with Seymour (who was somewhat comfortable in his pre-Enid days), be it by sabotaging Rebecca's legitimate ""7th grade fantasy"" about living on her own, be it with ostracizing his father's fiancé, despite both of them being nothing but nice and supportive. In the end nothing can satisfy Enid, and there's no personal growth achieved.So: Enid is a spoiled brat, she doesn't learn a thing from her mistakes and her final stand is, guess what!, LEAVING FOREVER... Insightful and mature, isn't it?It's a shame, because the story had potential and the cast delivered a solid performance despite the glaring flaws of the script.

140,Preston-10,An Interesting Character Study.,10,18 September 2001,"GHOST WORLD is such an interesting character study, I just wish this movie could have spent more time on plot. Maybe it's because the movie is based on an underground graphic novel, I don't know. It certainly does dismiss the typical conventions of any mainstream film, but I still wanted more.The movie follows the lives of two girls named Enid and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson and Thora Birch) after they graduate from high school, as well as their falling out after Enid develops a relationship with a record collector named Seymour (Steve Buscemi). The relationship between Enid and Seymour is the highlight of the film because I think this is the only part of the movie that truly works. It's a relationship that is atypical of many of the romances in so many teen-age dramas, so that's one of the reasons why it works so well. Outside of the relationship between Seymour and Enid, the movie seems repetitive, and most of the film proceeds as follows: Enid and Rebecca meet some person who exhibits behavior outside of social norms or who's actions are typical of people in live in society, and then, they begin to criticize their conformity or praise their sense of uniqueness. Don't get me wrong, this movie has a lot of interesting supporting performances, including the severely underrated Illeana Douglas as an art teacher, and Dave Sheridan as a shirtless guy with a mullet, who spends way too much time in a convenience store. The characters are what make this movie interesting, and very, very funny. Even though the Scarlett Johansson character is severely underwritten, the movie does highlight two terrific performances given by Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi. As an individual who has followed Buscemi's career for a long time, I honestly say that this is his best performance that I have seen and I hope he gets at least some recognition in the various critic's circles. The movie also recycles many of the character elements from Terry Zwigoff's previous feature CRUMB. I don't mean to harbor any resentment toward GHOST WORLD since I appreciated so much of it, especially the relationship between Enid and Seymour and all of the interesting supporting characters. In fact, these are the people that make societies so special and unique, especially in a World where most people just seem so transparent, and unreal. Even though I had problems with it, I still recommend GHOST WORLD as a highlight of the acting skills of Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi, not to mention it's unique brand of comedy.",Ghost World

The delivery between both friends felt forced and artificial like a decent joke told by an unskilled comedian. I thought maybe the actresses were just too young to be crude, guttural, and honest in a convincing way.But soon they (or I should say, I) warmed up to the task. Suddenly everything started striking me as just one notch away from hysterical. There were so many weird situations (like the coffeehouse trivia scene) that just fit so well with the movie in an explicable way.And it was more than just a comedy. Steve Buscemi's storyline resonated with me. The self-awareness of the film itself, poking fun at art and music and yet holding them on pedestals at the same time. The chameleon skin dynamic of the non-conformist protagonist. All of it.Really a great movie.",Ghost World

Thora Birch was great as Enid, playing something of a cross between Tracey Ullman and Melanie Griffiths' ""Lulu"" character from ""Something Wild"". As the nonconformist high-school graduate, she is a bundle of energy that drives the film along.Steve Buscemi was brilliant once again, this time as Seymour. His first entry was so stunning that the audience at the cinema where I watched this burst into spontaneous applause. It was also great how his character slowly developed from a geek into a very likeable, very human person.There's not an awful lot of plot here -- it's mostly a character-based film, so don't expect a lot of action and don't be disappointed if not all of the plot lines are resolved in the end.

143,silva-w-pius,Cult Magic,8,20 March 2014,"It's the end high school, life is pregnant with new adventures and the whole world is your hoister; what do you do first? Go travelling around the world? Go to college to study for your dream career? Get a job and save up for that new winter coat you wanted so bad? Or just sit around random bars and coffee shops and pock fun at everything and everybody, who has the unfortunate displeasure of stepping in your path. ""You just hate every guy on the face of the earth"", ""That's not true; I just hate all these extroverted, pseudo bohemian losers"". In that one quote alone you can almost summarise all that is Enid Coleslaw, one head of the two head pseudo intellectual, cynical, misfit heroines of Ghost World. Enid Coleslaw is a walking talking cliché, who the more we get to know her the more realise that she is the very thing she hates them most, and is the epitome of what the quote says, except swap bohemian for punk wannabe and you have her down to a tee. Then you have Rebecca Dopplemeyer played by Scarlett Johansson, who also indulges in mocking all of the mere mortals in the unnamed town, but unlike Enid she has possess a lot more maturity and a better grasp who she truly is, as well as the attention from most of the guys, which is a fact Enid secretly can't stomach and most always step in to crush any possibility from love ever blossoming – what are friends for right?. The two together act as the villains of the film, slowly but surely making everyone's life as misery, even sweet old Seymour (who has a strong resemblance to Gollum from LOTR) who is the hero of this little story, which is pretty big fete seeing that Steven Buscemi who played a crazed lunatic serial killer in Con Air could be made to look like a good guy, just shows who you're dealing with in concerns to these terrible twosome. Even their first meeting was purely down to one of their mean pranks, as they coax Seymour into a 1950's inspired dinner that - plays nothing but hip hop, claiming to be the women he was searching for in the lonely hearts sections of a newspaper, only for him to turn up and find her not there – poor Seymour. But Enid doesn't count on soon becoming obsessed ( maybe even falling in love) with this weird little man and his weird little world; swamped in old vinyl's, useless junk and old pictures of racist fast food mascots he can't get rid off – which I'm pretty sure makes Seymour a hoarder. Whilst at the mean time the rest of Enid's life seems to be crumbling around her, and even the special friendship she shared with Rebecca isn't safe, as it slowly begins to disintegrate as their lives move in entirely different directions. But this the sort of rich characterisation that makes Daniel Clowes script such a walking paradox, mixing cult humour with mainstream charm, which appears as a even more impressive of fete when you realise that the film was based on Daniels originally created underground comic book sensation, under the same name, then with the help of director/ co writer Terry Zwigoff, known best for Bad Santa, they were then able to adapt the work into a commercially and critically successful piece of cinema, that effortlessly stands out by itself as a masterpiece on its own merits, completely separate from its comic book source. I loved the film so much, probably one of my favourite cult comedies; up there with the likes of Wayne's World, Big Lebwoski and Clerks. My favourite aspect were the two main characters, who made it almost difficult to hate them for two long, because as much as it may seem too easy and warranted dislike both Enid and Rebecca, but the more you dive deeper inside the minds of both girls, the more you find them endearing and lovable, because at the end of the day they are just too young girls trying to find out who they are and where they fit in this big wide world – aren't we all deep really? But as good as Scarlett Johansson (also known for Lost In Translation and Her) was at playing Rebecca when considering especially that at the time of shooting she was only 16; which I find very difficult to wrap my head around, because she played the role with so much maturity meaning that not once did she over act in any of her scenes, thus making her performance seem every time to appear so natural and thus that little bit more believable. At the end of the day I still preferred Thora Birch as Enid, because I feel Thora despite playing a similar type of cynical character as she did so well in American Beauty, in Ghost World you can really tell that she had developed well and greatly improved as an actress; bring a fresh new perspective and exuberance to her acting arsenal. If you are a fan of larger than life characters, a gripping coming of age tale and laughs galore; then sitting on your sofa on a Friday night, with Ghost World playing on your TV, would quiet possibly the single greatest achievement of your life. A must see all cool kids and misfits alike.",Ghost World

And, had the studios not figured out some years ago that strange indie flicks had a viable following, ""Ghost World"" most certainly would have been one.  Of course, ""Ghost World"" isn't an indie flick, though it has that feel; it's simply smarter than 99% of studio films.  This movie ranks with some of the more clever and memorable indie flicks of recent years: ""Clerks"", et al.  I had seen Thora Birch in a few other roles and, frankly, she hadn't made much of an impression on me (of course, she's quite young and really just getting started)...until now.  Birch is brilliant, her character Enid is, simply, unforgettable.  Buscemi is as good as he is, always, as we've come to expect from him.  But it's Birch that makes this film.  She was Enid, to a tee. Hats off to Zwigoff for the direction, as well.  He's as much responsible for brining Enid to life as is Birch.  That said, if you've not seen this film, go rent it asap.  And let's keep an eye on this Thora Birch, I expect great things from her in the future.",Ghost World

147,YellowManReanimated,"Hilarious, tender and very much worth watching",8,22 August 2021,"On a whim, I decided to check out this cult classic and I was definitely not sorry to have done so. Thora Birch and a very young Scarlett Johansson offer much more to the screen than their physical attractiveness. Their delivery of an, at times, truly hilarious script, is an utter joy to behold. Birch, in particular, provides a perfect focal point to the narrative, her physical and facial reactions are subtle and yet communicate so much. Her ironic, cynical exterior is permeated by a clear insecurity and vulnerability which lies just beneath the surface. She is the sort of person who any social outsider (myself very much included) can instantly relate to and, ultimately, will adore.The aforementioned Johansson provides a strong supporting performance as does Steve Buscemi as on older social misfit. A haunting, delicate soundtrack helps to create an off-beat yet tender atmosphere to proceedings. However, the film is not without its drawbacks.Although the most central characters are fleshed out, the rest of the film is, unfortunately, populated with caricatures. This creates humorous one-off moments but it makes the film jarring as we are presented to main characters who feel real that are operating in an, at times, exaggerated, unrealistic universe. There is also a wider issue with the film in terms of its awkward tonal shift. It begins very much in the vein of a quirky teen comedy until, towards the end of the second act, it becomes unexpectedly wistful and sombre. It left me as a viewer with a sense of having experienced two narratives, neither one fully realised.The issues with the film do not outweigh its successes, however. It has some truly brilliant writing and acting and, overall, it is a tender and authentic rendering of the challenges faced by those who are young, beautiful, talented and intelligent but who, nevertheless, just don't quite fit in.",Ghost World
148,awalter1,Join the human race... or not.,8,25 June 2001,"Best friends Enid and Rebecca graduate from high school and find themselves forced to enter the real world. Enid (more than Rebecca) is a counter-culture rebel who hates this world of frauds and losers, and she subsequently has trouble getting and keeping a job. One day the girls decide to play a prank on a lonely middle-aged loser named Seymour. Their plan backfires, though, and Enid becomes a little obsessed with the man. First she feels sorry for Seymour, then he becomes something of a hero to her, and she resolves to help him at least find a girlfriend. ""Maybe I just can't stand the thought of a world where a guy like you can't get a date,"" she tells him. Meanwhile, Enid seems to be avoiding the challenge of getting her own life started.Terry Zwigoff (""Crumb"") directs this film based on a script by Dan Clowes, who also created the original comic book. ""Ghost World"" attempts to be a kitsch-free, counter-culture coming-of-age film, and for the most part it succeeds. The characters are very believable, honest, and engaging. The downbeat Seymour is played wonderfully by Steve Buscemi, and Thora Birch in her striking performance as Enid follows up her ""American Beauty"" role with another discontent but sympathetic misfit teen character. Perhaps the greatest disappointment in ""Ghost World,"" however, is that Scarlett Johansson as Rebecca is marginalized midway through the film. Regarding the story: It is debatable whether the film is entirely free of kitsch. As with ""American Beauty,"" the sudden romantic opportunities which fall into Seymour's lap smell suspiciously of middle-aged wish fulfillment. Also, one might ask for a slightly tighter ending, as the film finishes without much resolution--except for one rather simple but touching scene between Enid and Seymour. On the whole, however, the film is a delight, producing some very memorable characters to whom, in the end, the audience will be sorry to say goodbye.",Ghost World

151,deadmanjones,REALLY annoying central character,5,2 September 2006,"Looking some reader reviews up on the net, it appears much of what would make Enid's character likable in this film has been lost in its transition from comic book. What therefore results is a interminably dull film that traces the appallingly priggish activities of a bitchy little cow. There is no background to give a reason as to why the central character should hate everyone and everything so much, so the steady stream of social meddling and back stabbing grates. Instead of giving us a final redemption we get a final escape, as what was intended to be sublime becomes anything but as you mutter 'good riddance' to the unsympathetic little witch. It's difficult to blame anyone. The acting from all is superb, especially Buscemi (natch), and the direction emulates the pacing and composition of this type of graphic novel. But by not having much on screen except the central character of Enid, much of the reason to like her is lost too. By the end you'll be desperate for Winona Ryder and Christian Slater to appear and fake her suicide for her.",Ghost World
152,gallae,A faithful but overly long adaptation,7,1 September 2015,"I just watched Ghost World again, after a gap of about 5 years. This time around I'd just read the complete Ghost World which collected all the strips, and also had additional stuff including the original script of the film. And I found it a very difficult film to watch.The pacing seemed extremely slow and with it's like watching a train wreck in slow motion (especially the version I watched which was 137 minutes over the theatrical release of 111 minutes). Rebecca gets demoted to a supporting character (and seems very dull) and Seymour, I think perhaps Seymour (who was barely in the comic) should have been a main character, but in a different film. Of course the comic was episodic in nature rather than a continuous story, so they did well to adapt this at all. Perhaps though that's why Josh was demoted to a minor character and Seymour replaces him and Rebecca in many scenes.The film (much more than the comics) is about that period between being a teenager and becoming an adult. It's funny thinking about where the two main actors after the film. Scarlett Johansson's (Rebecca) career took off after this with over 30 films to her credit (think Black Widow) but Thora Birch (Enid) has only done 12 films since. Steve Buscemi (Seymour) being a character actor has done 50+ films. Not that the number of films counts for everything, but to me it shows an interesting balance and a period of transition for them, much like the characters in the film.",Ghost World
153,Dare_Daniel,My favourite teen comedy,9,2 December 2020,"This has been a favourite of mine ever since watching it for the first time in highschool. I was the kind of guy who couldn't fit in and watching this movie made me feel less lonely.Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson have such an awesome chemistry on screen, I love the characters' friendship and their sarcastic look at the world. They can say anything going through their minds because they will still be friends and won't judge what each other says. These characters wander around the city without a specific purpose but some changes come as they enter the adult world after finishing highschool.While Rebecca gets a job and tries to fit in the mainstream world, Enid struggles to follow her best friend as she becomes obsessed with Seymour, an old and lonely guy with no hope in life who shares the same interests as her. He has a room in his house just to keep all his old records. Enid finds this man very attractive as, at this point, he's the only human that she can relate to. But, at which point, does this connection become more than that? Does she really want to become like Seymour, who is seen by society as a weirdo? Or follow her best friend who suddenly is tired of all these creeps that both of them used to feel so much sympathy for?This is a very funny and intelligent comedy with so many funny lines, I could't stop smiling the whole movie. Enid, Rebecca and Seymour are such sweet and vulnerable characters, with different yet very relatable philosophies of life. Fun fact: this is the first movie to ever to get an oscar nomination for best screenplay based on a comic book.It's important to mention that this movie takes place during the mid 90s, when the internet was still not a thing. Enid is the kind of girl who would try to connect with people online and would probably have a blog or a youtube channel to share her favourite 60s indian music!I have this movie in my number 4 spot in my list of favourite movies of all time. Ghost World and Lost in Translation are my favourite american movies, both starring Scarlett Johansson. Watching these movies from time to time makes me miss old SJ.

While Enid and Rebecca discover that life outside of high school isn't as great as they imagined it to be, Seymour (who already knows about the loneliness of life) tries for once in his life to actually start living instead of just floating through life. Steve Buscemi, who plays Seymour, has one of his most memorable performances, and Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson are perfect fits for their roles. Anyone who feels like they don't quite fit in with society will surely find something to like in this movie. There has never been a teen movie like this, and there probably isn't any that are better than this. And don't forget about the old man waiting for the bus.

155,golem3,Confronting the Realities of Post Secondary Education,9,15 April 2006,"Of course, it's not easy to follow up nearly two decades of high school movies, a genre that had its origins in the eighties. Ghost World nearly reprises many of the issues that Heathers and other fine movies had brought up, but adds this complicated aspect of arrogance, carelessness and general angst about the future that has plagued the most recent generation of high school graduates.The acting is fantastic  which is so great since much of teenage life is dictated by facial expressions and gestures, and most of all the quirky phrases and lingo they use. There is nothing like seeing colors being used in a dramatic way. We really get to see the eccentricities of teenage girls, and what they like to do in order to stand out.There is something very endearing about people who have completely lost faith in humanity  at one point Enid and Seamour agree that ""give em a big mac and Nike shoes and they're fine,"" which is so true about the mass homogeneity in American culture.But we end up sympathizing for all the characters, the two girls (although the director obviously focuses on Enid) and even the washed up old man who waits for the bus. In fact, the Ghost World is the world that people who are disillusioned live in  for those who think they already know it all, for those who think they can make their exact dreams come true.There are overdone moments in the film that really have no place: ""Well if it isn't that Jewish girl and her Aryan friend"" is exemplary of that. Aside from those certain overcooked moments, the film truly comes out showing what the screenwriter and director wanted to tell.The movie tells the viewer something very important. Regardless of how you are, you are probably going to end up the same, so might as well be truthful and real, without affectation and false pretenses.RATING: 9/10 ""I can't relate to 99% of humanity""",Ghost World

I will not spoiled the movie, so I will just say that the real main actress Thora Birch is great, so interesting and actually so full of life.

That's not an easy task, but she tries.Steve Buscemi is excellent as usual in an almost as interesting role as Thora Birch, and he's not the only one.You will feel more than you'll laugh.A last comment, this movie made me discover an hell of a music, Devil got my Woman by Skip James.Thanks a lot for that and for the movie of course.",Ghost World
157,Matt M.,"Overrated, but interesting",6,4 August 2001,"Overrated by sad critics who thirst for intelligent teenagers in their cinema, ""Ghost World"" is nevertheless an interesting, occasionally fascinating look at someone living in a complete state of oblivion - her life crumbling around her - with no real hope for the future.I won't go into any points of the plot, because they aren't really germane to the film, which is more of a character study then anything else, sufficed to say,Enid not only ruins her own life, but she takes everyone else around her down into her spiral. There isn't really hope for her, because she squanders her chances. It seems to me that she is really searching for stability, and a true, assertive father figure, as portrayed by her semi-love interest Steve Bushemi. She only asks him if she can move in and live with him domestically, after her father asks his girlfriend to move in with him. Bushemi, in turn, seems to be looking for something of the same, as his mother moves in with him to assume the role that Enid was going to, after Enid rejects him. These are lost, wondering characters, searching for a sense of stability they cannot find in their ""Ghost World"" of pseudo-everytings.Still, I wasn't entirely convinced to like this film. Despite Burch's charisma, I really dislike a character that cannot find good in ANYTHING. She literally brings down everyone else around her out of her selfishness and self-hatred. As for Burch's cohort, the actress that plays her is too bland for the part, seemingly floating between Enid's world of self-hatred and a more straightforward world of compromise. A more experienced actress might have elicited some sort of reaction from me, but Johanssen is simply too young and too bland for the part.So, it's really worth seeing this film for moments of wit and insight, but overall, it's something of a disappointment. It is worthy to note, however that it's directed with style, and edited slowly and gracefully. Not really worth the ten bucks, but go rent it.Finally, to the NY Times critic who asserted that this was better then ""The Graduate"", you should be dragged out to the street and beaten with your own stupidity. I can't believe anyone would even put the two movies near each other in terms of quality. Very sad. Perhaps he has the hots for Burch. Nothing wrong with that...~",Ghost World

Enid (Thora Birch) stays the same after graduating, but Rebceeca (Scarlett Johansson) realizes their ways aren't getting them anywhere, and as Enid sees it, starts going with the flow. Enid finds Seymour (Steve Buscemi) another outcast, and connects with him.      Some users are really bashing this film, calling it depressing and boring. Obviously, this wasn't the ending they wanted, and couldn't find a way to relate to the two outcasts.

Ghost World appear is a book called Eightball, and when in context with that, it feels like a much more biting, seedier, I dunno, angst ridden world. I always liked Eightball, the stories, and the art work had a way of really getting under your skin, like an autopsy of humanity. Anyway! the film! Enid is basically my ex girlfriend, a very nice girl, but really messed up. She is looking for meaning and love in her life, but finding the grim realities of life difficult to deal with. Very funny in places and touching in others. The tampon in a tea cup is based on real ife experiences of Daniel Clowes at art school.

The second high school finished it became a slow moving roller coaster ride for the both of them.....well, really for Enid. Rebecca refused to learn about the real world, which kept her from actually getting along with anyone, including Enid. The character of Seymour (Steve Buscemi) was done quite well, judging the fact that Buscemi is always like Seymour in most of his roles. He was your typical loser, but it was interesting how Enid fended for him, or ""stood up for the little guy,"" just like herself. That showed that Enid was not cruel and devilish to everyone in this movie, but she slowly started to learn to lay off, as she was becoming one with the world.Bottom line: Rebecca sucked.

When Thora Birch as Enid walks into her graduation party with much trepidation and coolly explains to a hated classmate that ""We graduated. How shocking,"" I was moved beyond my wildest dreams after the years of agony and frustration that have come with enduring the multi-collection of Brat Pack trash and the newest nightmare of masturbation with pies.  It was as if the clouds had suddenly lifted and I wanted to jump up in my seat and do a little dance to celebrate the end of shallow know-nothings who party and lose their virginity and the beginning of cynically delicious people-phobes who rejoice in intelligence and hatred for the unoriginal.It was as though Thora Birch had transplanted her American Beauty character into this Ghost World in an attempt to prove once and for all that she was everything Mena Suvari's character was not-original and unique.  Enid was such a testament to what I believe a lot of teenagers including myself endured.  While the shallow high-school films have always appeared to know that losing your virginity and trying to fit in is part of the high school experience, they have always forgotten the minority of kids who hate 99% of people without ever meeting them and would love to be alone to contemplate life with their vintage records collections.  And suddenly there is a film for these lost souls and Steve Buscemi is there to comfort you if the delightful cynicism is not enough.  Where exactly is his Academy Award hiding?  Perhaps a hard-target search of Jim Broadbent's 10 million dollar brownstone is in order?
Thora Birch has grown into depths I didn't realize she knew with Ghost World and the best must be yet to come.  Her Enid is the embodiment of the hatred for the typical high school girl who flaunts her cleavage for the boys and is not clever enough to realize that there is more to life than worrying about nail polish colors and what Jim did with Jane and told Jake about on Friday.  Her interactions with the art teacher who throws a baby in a toilet and considers it art are a delight as are her looks of contempt at a fellow summer school student who explains birth control with her unique contraption.  Her relationship with Seymour brings out her inner child and a girl who like other normal teenagers wants to be loved and love back.  Teri Garr is adorable in a tiny cameo and the man who always sits waiting for the bus is an interesting character.  The ending of Ghost World is a delightful little way of summing up an adorable little film.9/10",Ghost World

164,reel_emotion,More Real Than Most Movies,8,19 October 2002,"""Ghost World"" can be somewhat hard to take in the beginning. Enid and her friend seem unusually cruel to others and hipper than thou. Although I sympathize with their hatred of popular students and popular culture, they were so bratty and mean I almost stopped watching the movie. Fortunately, the movie explains itself better later on.The beauty of this film is its unhappy endings. The movie almost purposely teases the audience with the hope of happy-ever-afters. When the art teacher gives Enid the college scholarship, you think that Enid is finally going to find some happiness in her life, but Enid fails the class (twice!)--and if you think about it, Enid never did graduate from high school. When Seymour looks through Enid's sketch book and sees that she really does like him, you think they will end up together forever, but they do not. ""Ghost World"" is probably more realistic than most movies because not everybody gets what they want in the real world. In the real world, people do lose and not everything works out. But you can walk away kind of knowing that Enid and Seymour will survive because they are true to their own personalities. Enid can't be normal, work at a movie theater, or have an apartment with her friend. She has to catch the ""bus"" that everybody has told her doesn't exist. To sum it up in a cliché that would make Enid grimace: she has to follow the beat of a different drum.Who is to say what is normal? Enid or Seymour are as about as normal as anybody else. Life is just a ""ghost world"" inhabited by all kinds of freaks. Seymour says that he can't see how the rest of the world can be so normal and accept everything--especially popular music. But they are not--from his reclusive, couch potato roommate with chronic bed head to all the weird men Enid cruises at the sports bar, they are many strange characters in this film.This is a must see for fans of indie films and Sundance. The ending with the bus is a little too cryptic and too much teenage angst are its major flaws, but it's better than most teen films or films in general. And it's a must see for record collectors (but you don't have to collect blues--or, sorry, ragtime--78's to appreciate it!)",Ghost World

Ghost World's different; it's proof characters can be interesting without having problems, that movies can be smart without people going ape, and it shows movies can be funny without lame, sexist jokes and unlikeable characters. It also shows that there are people besides the attractive and popular, and the depressed and the junkies. This is my equal favourite movie with The Craft and Sucker Punch, for a few reasons; its characters, story, it relatability, and timelessness.Enid's an awesome character, arty, cynical, intelligent, talented, honest, mostly knows what she wants, stands firm for what she believes, is an individual, and won't compromise or sell out. At the same time, she's cruel (kinda sociopathic), a bit lazy, a bit dishonest, and even a user. However these flaws don't really bother me. She's not the kind of person who expects to be liked despite their faults (aka Brian from Family Guy), and she's under no illusions about who she is. Her death stares are something I wish I could do.Rebecca, despite the fact she fades from view, isn't so bad. She reaches the point where she thinks a fold out ironing board is cool, adores plastic cups, and disses her former people(forgetting where she came from). At the same time, I reckon her wish to be ""normal"" was a cop out. However she's not under any illusions about what she's doing and she sticks by Enid for most of the flick despite their drift apart. Seymour's cool. He's happy to stand out from the pack, and isn't asking for much. But he's too self-loathing, and he sells out for a time when he dates Dana, who isn't the one for him, and forgets Enid who genuinely wanted to help him.The story is great. It's set at a time that doesn't get a lot of attention in movies. Just after high school, but not yet at uni or the workforce. Most movies about young people are in high school or uni. It's setting is great, it could be just about anywhere; large town, city suburb, poor, middle class, but the focus is the characters and plot. It's easy to follow and all parts fit together. I'm never thinking ""hey wait a minute, what about what happened...?"". It doesn't take the viewers for morons; the characters're smart, they're not begging for sympathy, they know what's happening, they aren't cold hearted fish, they're not MENSA applicants and they're not nunces like the ones in Project X. They're individuals, doing the things they like.I can really relate to Enid. I love art, i'm cynical, honest to a fault, sarcastic. I love having digs at lots of people too; one of my work places is in Hornsby and it's filled with over eaters, drop kicks, teen smokers, druggies, obnoxious parents, westies and so on. I'm also mercenary to a point, and can look and act cold. I also tried to stay out of the work force, even though I needed work. At the moment I can relate to her loneliness. I barely see my friends; one now has a girlfriend, one is busy, and another and I are taking time out. Others have just drifted away.It's a timeless film. I'm able to relate to it no matter what stage I'm at; post high school, early uni, even now when I'm in the work force. Now when I'm in my lonely phase and feeling left out. I see a lot of myself in Enid, and I want to be like her; her death stares, bluntness, confidence and wit.The other triumph is the ending. It's cool. A lot of movies and TV shows end on a sugary, walk into the sunset, happily ever after note. People become attractive, get a job, get the job they want, get laid, get a date, wear a suit, get married, keep their house, realise the benefits of normal. Dexter series 3 descended into schmuck, Six Feet Under gave most characters a peaceful, healthy, happy, fulfilled future life, Blue Heelers ended with everybody moving on, and even Daria ended this way with everybody getting their wishes. Others end with death, defeat, and tears. Dexter series 4 ended in overkill.The ending is here Ghost World's ending is brilliant. Enid makes the decision not to sell out, do things her way, and be as different from the beginning, but it costs her; she loses her friends, her scholarship,and is deserted. She and Becky part on good terms, but their friendship is not what it used to be, if it exists at all. Becky seems happy with a job, flat, guys, ""normal"" hair and clothes, but she's upset to leave Enid. Seymour returns to his old life but must deal with his mother who he can't stand. The ending is up to the viewer. Enid's bus ride out of town gives her the freedom she wanted. What happens afterwards? New town? New friend? Suicide? Love? Art colony? It's a good ending. It's got the same feel as the songs Survival by America and Wonderful Life by Black.Some people have compared this to Daria. But it's different. Daria ended with friendships restored, everyone getting what they wanted, everyone happy, and Daria left the days of Highland behind her. Enid is self confident, Daria was self doubting, Enid took pride in herself, Daria hated the title ""brain"" (I'd have loved it), Enid is ready to face the world, Daria was withdrawn, Enid was liberated, but Daria took the moral high ground too many times. Daria was an awesome show, but I prefer Ghost World.",Ghost World
166,mcshortfilm,"""This falls into that high category of art I was talking about earlier...""",10,26 July 2005,"This is a superb film. It's so good that Ray Carney called it one of the best films of the nineties. If you know Ray Carney, you know that's a rare and big compliment coming from someone like him. The film is based on the comic by Daniel Clowes. The story involves two girls who just graduated high school and try to figure out what to do with the rest of their lives. They seemed eager to finish high school but they also don't seem ready for the real world. They are the types of girls who are inseparable and do nothing but gossip and secretly insult people. Although they are insulting and unapologetic, you feel apathy for them because their fears and insecurities are bare naked and they seem to know how to enjoy laughing at people not so much for their freakyness and stupidity but probably because it helps to see something familiar about their own personal traits. Other times they show true disgust for people but this is defended in one of the film's themes that nobody lives without prejudices. As we can see in the sneaky eyes of this film, life is pretty unfair. ""Good"" art is in a restricted category. Authentic blues legends are opening acts to cheap rock and roll in sleazy dive bars and historical 50's diners are transformed into contemporary looking mini malls. There is also sense of change taking place in this town and yet not much happens. With the exception of Scarlet Johansen's character who can't wait to grow up, Enid and Seymour have an emotional attachment to the past. Enid doesn't want to get rid of her toys and dolls from childhood and Seymour is obsessive about collecting old artifacts and 78 rpm records. This film is about the underdogs of society who struggle to adapt and to love and yet can't seem to adjust. This is a perfect film, a masterpiece...(even though I hate that hiearchal word)",Ghost World
167,KMR,Disappointing--if you've read the graphic novel also,8,19 January 2002,"This movie is better than probably 90% of the other stuff out there, and I would recommend it to most smart moviegoers. BUT (major but here), I was dismayed that Ghost World's original creator, Daniel Clowes, and the film's director, Terry Zwigoff, decided to rearrange the plot line and ended up destroying the main focus of the book, which is the relationship between two teenage girls, Enid and Becky, and how it eventually, heartbreakingly, dissolves. The movie is mainly concerned with the relationship between Enid (well-played by Thora Birch) and the middle-aged sad sack played by Steve Buscemi (who is excellent, as usual). The character of Becky, Enid's best friend, is basically cast aside. I was really looking forward to a smart, funny independent feature film taking an honest look at teenage girls as they teeter on the brink of adulthood, wondering exactly who they are and what their lives should become. That sounded fresh and new, if not downright revolutionary, particularly coming from a male writer and director team. Instead I got this (relatively) conventional, boy/girl quasi-romance, dressed up in post-slacker hipness - did Clowes and Zwigoff think maybe the movie wouldn't fly without a major male character? I'm guessing yes. My hope is that all the critics and other folks out there who loved the movie might be compelled to seek out the original book now. It's light years better.",Ghost World

I also misspelled assumptions if you're keeping score.  It's still a great movie.  If you took the time to read my review you're probably the type of person who would like it.",Ghost World
169,emilywes56,Terry Zwigoff' s Ghost World: Join the majorities or be a ghost,10,23 July 2017,"Ghost World, maybe Zwigoff's best-known film, is not another shallow or superficial teen comedy movie but it talks about the end of high school and the freedoms of coming of age that every teen is desperately looking for. However, it partially refers to womanhood, with the two main female characters of the film growing up together and making plans for their future adult lives. They don't want to follow the path of their classmates or their parents,as they find them stupid and losers. The music transmits feelings of a certain cosmic melancholy. There are three music tracks that characterize and depict the phases of this film. In the beginning of the movie, there is this Bollywood song of Jaan Pehechaan Ho playing on one's TV. When Seymour and Enid are getting closer and get to know each other, we listen through a vinyl record Devil Got My Woman from Skip James, which is Seymour's favorite song. Enid starts to listens to it many times. There is some kind of sadness in this song that attracts her. Lastly, David Kitay, wrote the main theme soundtrack for Ghost World, which it plays at the end of the film. This last track, reminded me that last scene of American Beauty. Steve Buscemi, Scarlet Johanson and Thora Birch were great in their roles, depicted as interesting, outlandish outsiders that lived in their own ""Ghost World"". The film is based in a comic book, and we could say that it is a black comedy There are funny things about the main characters but they are tragic in a way. Important thing is that the story is realistic and well-written, the contrast between Thora Birch and Scarlet Johanson in clothing and looks is also fascinating, due to the fact that both girls have a cynical attitude. They are living still in their dreamy world without realizing that they must face the unknown and ruthless world of adults, even if this is separates them severely.",Ghost World
170,Darren-12,Hoist By It's Own Petard,7,10 December 2004,"**** SPOILERS CONTAINED HEREIN ***There were a lot of things I liked about this movie: the humour and the characters, but it was basically Thora Birch that carried it - the character of Enid was terrific, reminding me a lot of Daria (who I also like).The movie itself reminded me of ""The Graduate"", with the main point being the search by the main character for a direction in life, and the final scene being a bus-ride out of town. The interest was held by wondering what Enid WOULD ACTUALLY DO, as she didn't seem to like any of her options.It fell down in a number of ways though: I really disliked the 2-dimensional way in which the character of Enid's father was treated - it seemed like a really cynical way of ruling out the ""family"" option. The ending was a complete cop-out - her simply skipping town on a bus is NOT A CHOICE. Even the people who like the movie don't like the ending, and have come up with various ""mystical"" or suicidal interpretations to excuse it.The main problem is that there is a PERFECTLY OBVIOUS solution to Enid's ""problems"", which is that she should GO TO COLLEGE. She would have another few years to grow up and develop proper social skills. This is what college is for. At least in ""The Graduate"" Dustin Hoffman was a COLLEGE graduate, so his struggles were more grounded in adult sensitivities.Anyway, I think I'm making this sound worse than it was. I did really like it for the most part, but felt that it lost it's way a little, and ended badly. 7/10.",Ghost World
171,Aeris4ever,"Not bad for an artsy film, but not great, either",10,13 June 2002,"I began watching ""Ghost World"" with a general idea of what it was about: two extremely cynical and rebellious high school grads who don't seem to fit into society.  Enid and Rebecca, played by Birch and Johannson, are teens who hate pretty much everything about being a teen, but still act like kids at times.  After the girls pull a prank on a low-life, played by Buscemi, the newfound empathy Enid discovers takes over as she tries to make amends for the act.  Over the course of the movie, the girls begin to part ways, a very realistic portrayal of what happens to most high school friends. Enid's carefree attitude isn't helping her - finding and keeping a job is impossible and her ""against the grain"" way of thinking collides with the norm.  The bad things keep coming, like bricks falling from the sky, and we wonder if Enid will make it through her hardships.In some ways I loved this movie, but hated it for other reasons; definitely a mixed bag for me.  As a hater of teen movies, I thought it was excellent to see girls who are not perky, cheerleader types with bleached blonde hair and size 2 bodies.  Scarlett didn't look like the best choice to play Enid's sidekick, but Thora was excellent as Enid in every way.  Enid, as a character, was refreshing, but I didn't care much for her cynicism and cold attitude.  While her troubles during the last third of the movie are genuinely heart-breaking, I sometimes thought, ""Serves you right"", which isn't good.  I think I would have shot myself if I had that kind of outlook on life.  The script got a bit gratuitous with the ""F""-word, one of my biggest pet peeves about independent and artistic films.  A sexual encounter between Birch and Buscemi had me laughing out loud.  On the other hand, the direction was great and the way the movie flowed from beginning to end couldn't have been better.If I were asked someone's advice on whether they should see ""Ghost World"", the first thing I would ask them is if they saw and enjoyed ""American Beauty"".  I think people who loved that movie will especially like ""Ghost World"", the Thora Birch connection notwithstanding.  I hated ""American Beauty"" to high heaven, but I didn't hate this movie half as much.  ""Ghost World"" had its nice moments, but overall, it's a depressing film which may turn off viewers who are into more light-hearted fare.  I'm surprised to see it ranked so highly with an 8.1, but with its similarities to AB, it's not surprising.",Ghost World
172,Aquilant,The difficulty of dealing with a world that has fallen out of tune.,7,29 January 2010,"In a small patch of America where the people are closed into their mental and material sluggishness and where some troubled adolescents are unwilling to accept their imaginary imprisonment a shadow of uneasiness finds its way among patches of thick darkness where all kinds of interpersonal relationships are inhibited. Two young girls put aside every improper form of rebellion and trigger a mechanism based on the creative power of the gaze intended as usual means of observation, taking advantage of the slightest occasions to climb the fences of intolerance and anonymity to confirm their unacknowledged existence.But the dull Ghost World which has become a symbol of the decadence of American culture and more generally of the entire Western civilization hasn't got the capacity to change the strength of the human consciences. So, it goes on prospering in his stagnant anonymity amid the general indifference while the visionary minds of some nostalgic people are completely marginalized by a world that confuses Fellini's ""Eight and a half "" with Lyne's ""Nine and a half weeks"". and the voices of old 78 speed records seem to echo the ghosts of an era and The movie is about the difficulty of dealing with a world that has really fallen out of tune; the dialogues have the flavor of dialogue balloons expressed in a direct and explicit language even if not foul-mouthed, the language of the adolescence who is looking for its individual values, in close contact with an excerpt of humanity anesthetized by strong doses of daily pettiness and unable to seize the slightest positive change but following stubbornly a customary provincial ritual properly stored into the code of a sort of stale mental microchip.""Ghost world"" is a bitter comedy that makes us think, completely stripped from frills and various paraphernalia, bluntly addressed to the heart of a problem far from insoluble because in the end even a long wait for a deleted bus route deleted can lead to positive consequences. Adapted from a underground comic book by Daniel Clowes, the film keeps the blaze of colors comics accentuated by the brilliance of the photography, a legacy which carries as consequence a series of short sequences throughout the whole narrative. Be as it may Ghost World proves once again that comics shouldn't be considered in any way a replacement for artistic discipline subordinate to other higher forms of expression of human creativity because they have a particular autonomous capacity of production of reality thank to their original and exclusive language. And this time the movie gives us the opportunity to take two birds with one stone: precisely the American Beauty Thora Birch and the glamorous Scarlett Johansson, one of my favorite actresses. And the nearly two hours in length of the film aren't certainly to be considered ""lost in translation!""",Ghost World

175,Idolprincess,Hm...,8,11 July 2004,"Since I'm a huge fan of comic books as well as ""cartoony"" or comic book based movies, I decided to review this one. When I saw this movie, one or two years ago, I was in my final year of high school, about the same age as the characters in this movie. I too have had a horrible experience in high school. However, I can't say I could relate to the dark world that is portrayed in Ghost World. I have read the comic book after watching the movie. Both of the versions of ""Ghost World"" portray a world full of sad and annoying people, pedophiles, typical idiotic high school students, and most of all, people faking individuality. I don't think ""Ghost World"" is meant to be realistic, but it's meant to portray this world that we live in. Enid and her friend are the main characters who think they are above everyone else, including the depressed guy that is Seymour. However, things don't turn out as they planned. I thought Enid and her friend were very realistic characters. They aren't shown as heroines who are greater than everyone else because of how different they are and how they don't let themselves controlled by society. On the contrary. This is a good point for the movie, since the realism isn't too overwhelming. However, the depressing atmosphere of the movie can be if you aren't into this. As the movie keeps going, it gets more and more depressing and the ending just leaves you with a ""bitter taste in your mouth"". It's not that ""Ghost World"" didn't move me. It did, greatly. But maybe the reason why I didn't like it as much as a lot of people did was because it mainly brought negative feelings to me. I really liked the story as well as the characters, but it was just too hard to stomach. There was very little optimism in the movie. It also seems to be telling the viewers that it's impossible to be an individual in this world, and that you'll always be just another [ insert a subculture or a name here ] to people, which I don't agree with personally.",Ghost World

Scarlett Johannson manages to put in a very straightforward performance that plays off of Thora Birch nicely, and of course Steve Buscemi RULES (two metal signs up) in his part here.  Sadly, I could relate to his character all too well, even though I'm not nearly his age yet.  Illeana Douglass is also great as the eccentric art teacher.  Hell, everyone in this film is great.

No there are not any ghosts or supernatural creatures flying around on screen. ""Ghost World"" plays like a city so familiar that it seems to have been in a dream and features characters with enough personality and wit for several films. Enid (Thora Birch) has just graduated high school but is not quite sure what to do with life other than move in with her best friend Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson). Enid responds to a personals ad placed by a loner, record collector Seymour (Steve Buscemi). While her intent was cruel, she soon becomes fascinated by Seymour and his quirks.The film knows its target and hits the mark with sharp, satirical accuracy. The film has a familiarity and knowledge for life and situations. Some of the bit characters and places reminded me so much of my neighborhood, I couldn't stop laughing. Writer-Director Terry Zwigoff and co-writer Daniel Clowes know exactly where the story leads and don't miss a beat. Sometimes one person's life, provides a catalyst or inspiration for someone else.

181,buddypatrick,So totally cult,10,13 September 2007,"Ghost World (2001), by cult director Terry Zwigoff (Bad Santa (2003)) is aimed at the intelligent, open minded and cultured teenagers who are aware of what is ahead of them, yet choose to enjoy the life of a child and not wanting to grow up. Keeping in mind it is a film, it could be enjoyed by anyone.Amazing to see a teenaged-based film that doesn't revolve around titties, toilet humor, beer and drugs but more so revolves around culture and intelligence and pushes the fact that not all teenagers are useless. In fact there are many teenagers out there who are rather intelligent, mature and wise beyond their years yet still like their basic humour associated with other peoples demise, which in this film, is done amazingly well and it is quite relatable when we see Enid and Rebecca laughing at the ""satanists"" in the diner. My friends and I usually laugh at that typical fat, dirty old man in the city who hits on young girls or those freaky-looking folks who have no sense of fashion, which, as mean as it is, is just a little fun, which is exactly what these girls do and this relates to modern teenagers.What Ghost World also holds is mountains and mountains of culture all dating way back to the 1960's Bollywood films and the 1970's underground music which is so satisfying to see now as so many people my age don't comprehend or care for, they prefer trash that MTV spits in our faces and know we'll love it and buy but the thing is, because the majority is rather culturally inept and likes anything dating from 2001 to modern times, leaves the other types left out, where do they go? They must dig and dig under all this modern pop culture to find the real hip stuff, the real cool stuff that our mothers and fathers listened to and watched when they were kids, and Ghost World is satisfying because its so up to date with the minority and yet references so many musicians, artists and films and its striking out to those MTV kids and others, the MTV kids who don't know who Pink Floyd is, or the ones who've never heard of the film Midnight Express or 8½ which is even mentioned in this film. It's a relief and leaves a smile on such non-conformist types, the ones who aren't ""emo"" or ""gangsta"" or this or that. It could be for everyone of course, but this film is clearly aimed at particular audiences.Now, on with the actual film itself. I would say apart from the great style and culture of the movie, its still great; acting, characters, story, ending, everything. The whole movie is brilliance in a bottle. Enid and Rebecca, best friends, alternative hip kids, have just graduated school rolling their eyes over their fellow pop loving peers but Enid doesn't want to grow up, she doesn't want to change herself for a bunch of customers at a job, she doesn't want to move out of home. She wants to be in a kid forever, which so many kids our age can relate to. Many of us don't want to grow up. Where Rebecca is mature and all, she's waiting for Enid to move into an apartment with her and get a job but Enid is far too busy with her nerdy record collecting friend Seymour who she previously stood up for as a joke. As time goes on Enid spends more and more of her spare time with Seymour, and ends up losing her school certificate because she didn't turn up to the art show and everything for her falls apart. ""Ever wanted to just disappear and no one would ever ask what happened to you"" Enid said to Rebecca. ""No."" She replies.As we saw previously in the film, an old senile man waits at the bus stop for a bus that doesn't come by anymore. Enid says to him at some stage ""ever since my life fell apart you're the only one I can rely on because I know you'll always be here"" or something along those lines, where as, this somewhat explains that Enid's entire world is changing, except this one lonesome man at the bus stop but once he says he is leaving this means her entire life is changing. He catches the bus symbolizing everything has changed for Enid. Even in the end, Enid has caught that same bus which represents after all the things Enid has put herself through she is finally accepting to grow up and start her life. A great, relatable and cultured film, with for me ranks grade A marks in my book. This film is beyond recommendation; this film should be seen by everyone, whether you like it or not, you can't just be ignorant, you have to look into this film and analysis it.",Ghost World
182,Scottie-3,Terrific script and performances; OK direction,7,26 August 2001,"The humor is extremely snarky, but convincingly captures a certain post-adolescent attitude and mindset. Enid (Thora Birch, the daughter in American Beauty), just as I did at her age (18), thinks everything and everyone deserves nothing less than her total sarcastic derision. She and her friend Becky roll their eyes at everyone else in the movie and make withering comments. ""You guys should like call me so we can get together!"" squeals a perky classmate. Enid, in monotone: ""Yeah. That'll definitely happen.""There's a lot of very funny stuff here, and Birch has her character dead to rights. When she meets Steve Buscemi, a ""dork"" and ""loser"" she targets for a practical joke, an odd friendship develops. She finds him somewhat endearing and decides to find a girlfriend for him. But the movie does not develop in the direction you expect it to.I won't spoil anything else except to say that Enid does eventually recognize a need to change. The script, however, does not resolve things patly, and instead ends on a somewhat ambiguous, but satisfying, note.I loved the script of this movie, although I thought it could have been a bit shorter: Enid somewhat overstays your sympathy. You give her a lot of slack as she struggles with the idea of becoming an adult, but toward the end, you just want to slap her and tell her to grow up already.The visual style of the film is somewhat static as far as camera movement's concerned. Director Zwigoff is good with the actors but negligent of his camera. Production design is suitably chaotic and campy.",Ghost World

This is an honest, believable story of three outcasts.Thora Birch and Scarlett Johanssen do a wonderful job of bringingto life Enid and Rebecca, making them more than just your typical,one-dimensional cynical teenager. Steve Buscemi gives probablyhis best performance as über-dork Seymour. While Buscemi isgreat, I wished the story centered more on Enid and Rebecca'srelationship like in the comic.

This is the story of Enid who graduates high school and thrust into real life, which includes drifting away from her best friend, Rebecca and falling for an older man named Seymour played by Steve Buscemi who was originally the butt of a cruel joke. Terry Zwigoff continues to prove that directing is easy, if you have talent and vision, which Zwigoff has in spades.  Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi loose themselves so completely in their roles that its difficult to think of them in any other roles.  The entire cast is amazing.

190,*(CableGuy)*,"too eerily familiar, a movie aimed at my head",10,31 January 2002,"Man, FINALLY saw Ghost World at the newly-reopened Kimball Theater here in art-starved Williamsburg.  And what a tremendous experience.  Everything about this movie just struck me so correctly (except perhaps the affair with the middle-aged guy).  I see Enid and Rebecca as myself and my best friend with vaginas.  Sure, we make ironic pokes at everything, but when does it reach the limit?  When does irony come full circle?  Is a life spent taking in the kitsch make you no better than the supposed drones around you?
Some of the best elements of the film, something Daniel Clowes so richly preserved from his own tremendous graphic novel, were the background elements, the banal passerby, the ""characters"" we're all familiar with. Fat women lugging their half-dozen kids around.  Rattails.  The pandered-to disabled.  Tubby guys in baseball caps and red jackets sucking down fast-food.  From the opening sponsors of the graduation, to the closing shots of gloomy neon signs, commercialism is both omnipresent and pretty much ignored.  Crap is everywhere, nobody would deny that, but can one escape it just through mockery?I can't commend Zwigoff and Clowes enough for this adaptation.  Though itdoes drift from the source material, and perhaps ignores Rebecca a bit much at the end, elements like Enid and Seymour's ""romance"" lend a poignant awkwardness.  No easy solutions are ever reached.  Things just change, not for the better, not any worse, they just do.  I see my own life's attitudes, the struggle to find an identity in a sea of both ""individuals"" and hives. I can't be complacent, but the ironic distance can become just as tiresome. I guess I just identify with Enid so much it's either amazing or pathetic. Anyways, I recommend this to anyone who's ever tried to look at the world through skewed eyes.  It's not just for the spazzes, mods, or neo-geeks.

He and Daniel Crowes spent five years of their lives trying to get Hollywood to make this movie. They endured and fought to make this movie their way.  The result is a wonderful film that will be just as good twenty years from now as it is today.  A film that is characther driven.  A film that young women can connect with.  How many films are their like that?  Watching some beautiful 23 year old play a 16 year old where everything works out in the end is not the reality for 95% of teenage girls.  Movies like this and The Dreamlife of Angels are much more realistic portrayals of the confusion, angst, and awkwardness of having to find your place in the ""real world"".  Thora Birch is excellent as Enid.  She obviously dove headfirst into the role and took ownership of the part.  Steve Buscemi is his usual great self.  He rarely gets this much screen time, and he really shines in this movie.  Terry Zwigoff discovered what the Cohen brothers already knew about him.  That he is a great actor!  I know this film is only playing at a few theaters but go and watch it, and then rent it, and then buy it.  If you don't support movies like this then you are failing to support good movies.

Two girls graduate from High School and face the future with little to offer, encumbered by the age appropriate self centered 10 degree vision. Thora Birch plays Enid, the more curious of the two, but is also the least able to adjust to the inevitable. She develops a tentative relationship with an older dork, Seymour - played by the man born to play dorks; Steve Buscemi. Slowly enraptured by his obsessive hobby of collecting old and esoteric memorabilia and art, she initially tries to steer him out of loneliness and into a relationship with someone of his age, only to realize that she cannot stand staying lonely, while he starts living a little, with someone less tolerant of his tastes. Her character, mired in depression, only tolerates the unhappiness of others. As others grow she becomes more panicked and confused. Seymour ends up taking the brunt of her confusion. There is no happy ending, which is an honest outcome. Still the Director can't resist ending it with a metaphorical twist, with hope for Enid, and none for Seymour.

195,bigspeegs,"The Anti-""Teen Movie""",8,23 February 2002,"RATING:  ***1/2 out of ****
The so-called ""teen movies"" offered in recent years have been of a dull and empty variation. The basic formula usually includes the geek who gets the girl/guy, the nasty popular kids, the jocks, the unlikely couple and more uses of the word ""like"" than any normal person is able to tolerate. What a rare treat it is that in the middle of the season usually full of teen movie trash that we had ""Ghost World"", a film that remembers that not everybody fits into easily accessible categories (adults and teens alike).
Thora Birch is Enid, a high school grad unsure of what to do with the rest of her life. She thinks she will rent an apartment with her best friend Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson), but with no job and summer school (for flunking art), nothing is certain. In a similar spot is Seymour (Steve Buschemi), a record collector who can't see any real meaning to his actions. Enid and Rebecca play a seemingly harmless prank on him after seeing a classified ad he put in the paper. Quite to the surprise of the duo, this little stunt really hurts Seymour. Guilty, Enid feels obligated to hook him up with the girl he was looking for in the ad. What is remarkable about ""Ghost World"" is not that it is more entertaining than your average teen entertainment. No, what strikes me about ""Ghost World"" is how astutely it remembers the feeling of displacement that plagues so many teens. Enid doesn't seem to have many friends who respect her, and as cynical as she may get, human contact is the obvious ingredient missing in her life, even though she is constantly pushing it away. Rebecca urges her to get a job, so she gets a job working at a concession stand in a multiplex. That same day, she's fired for too many wise remarks about the theater and it's customers. Enid doesn't feel the need to ""fit in"", instead she sees the whole world collapsing around her and would rather observe and snicker than get away from the problem. She tries to move on with her life, yet everyone around her is trying to keep her grounded. Thora Birch seems more alive as Enid than in any other of her roles. In ""American Beauty"", she played a similar character, but I was less than convinced with her portrayal, mostly consisting of pouting. In ""Ghost World"", it is like she has woken up, and really works as Enid. Her chemistry with the other actors ranges from comfortable to repellent as the story requires.
Seymour is just as miserable as Enid. He collects all kinds of junk- from jazz records to old posters from the fast-food company he works for. He wishes he could have a more rewarding career and a more exciting life. ""I hate my interests"", he remarks. Where Enid is a little more honest and will say anything that comes to her mind, Seymour builds a shield against pain with his collections and obsessions and rarely takes a chance. Enid does not care about the consequences; Seymour is constantly running away from them. Steve Buschemi is wonderful in this role. He does what an actor should as he doesn't overact but really gets into the character and inhabits him. As we watch him, we feel just like a picture Enid draws in her sketchbook: ""Go Seymour!"" We want him to get the girl, to succeed and live happily ever after. Unfortunately, his own self-pity comes back to haunt him when he realizes he has nothing in common with the woman of his dreams.
In the end, Enid is off to create a world of her own, while Seymour is left behind back where he started. He does have his experiences with Enid, but how far does that really take him? We will never find out, but we are sure that he will start to come into his own; we now have gained confidence in him. The film has that personal touch that most films lack. Coming from Terry Zwigoff, a man who threatened to commit suicide if the subject for a documentary he was making didn't cooperate (""Crumb""), it's easy to see why the film is so accurate in its portrayal of emotional emptiness. ""Ghost World"" has so many strengths to deem it one of the best films of the year. And as much as some would like to disagree, it is not a teen movie in any way, shape or form.",Ghost World

Attempting to compensate for this vacuum, they load-'em-up with ""edgy"" cynicism --- this from brain-dead teen bimbos who never missed a meal and always slept in their own beds.There's a really sick-sick-sick sex scene in this...this *thing*...which ranks right up there with the most gruesome horror films: When the girl goes to bed with Steve Buscemi, indie- cult fave weirdo. Do NOT eat your fill before watching this. Back when I worked in drive-ins, we played a flick called ""Mark Of The Devil"" (1971) where we handed out air-sickness bags. This film might have profited from such a marketing approach. From what I read here, this pustule got few bookings and nobody saw it. No, really ?

At the end we understand that we live in a repressive world manipulated by salesmen, a system that only offers money. But there is more and it can be found if one looks harder. Enid (Thora Birch) knows deep down that what appears to be is not and doesn't hesitate to act on her feelings. Her friend and pal, however, buys into it and after graduating from high school, their worlds begin to separate. Enid believes herself to be alone but she meets Seymour (Steve Buscemi) who shows her independence exists, that alternative realities are possible, at a price. At every step the film plays on our deeply pre-programmed feelings, surprising us with realizations of things that are not as we thought but never disappointing us. Up until the very end, the film maintains its integrity, refusing to provide easy solutions. A must film for anyone who feels angst and knows something is wrong out there.

Based on a graphic novel by Daniel Clowes, this film is the best film of 2001, with The Royal Tenenbaums bringing up the rear (thus far).  I have seen this film 9 times.  I own the graphic novel, the screenplay, the soundtrack, and the shirt (thank you, eBay).  I admit to identifying with this film in a way even Enid might find disturbing, and so my critical analysis would tend to suffer as a result of this.  At any rate, I could sit here and talk for hours about the brilliance of the film, zeroing in on every little detail, right down to the background characters sporting Hard Rock Cafe shirts...but I won't.  I will say that if the Oscars had any guts or brains, they would offer up the following nominations: Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor (Buscemi), Best Actress (Birch), Best Director (Zwigoff), and Best Picture (Ghost World).  See this as soon as you can, despite MGM's ridiculous ad campaign.  I could slaughter them for it.  And why aren't they supporting the film?

But it fizzled out and stay fizzled until the very end. Thora Birch's character's desire to be different reminded me so much of those in high school who were different just to be different.  But they did it in large groups of people who were all different in the same way.  Sort of like the phrase ""I am unique, just like everyone else"".       Her and Steve B. played decent roles but their movie was not given all that much meat with which they could sink their teeth into.

203,potterj,Terry's World,7,23 May 2002,"Ghost World Terry Zwigoff (dir....formerly did ""Crumb,"" along with ""Louie Blouie"") Steve Buscemi and Thora BirchFor many, this movie will be a knowing expression of how things look for people whose uncommon honesty exiles them in the empty world lurking on the margins of American Beauty (in the endless retail strip mall that is America's back lot).  For me, it is a cinematic comic strip based on the all-too-common and shallow conviction of so many in the art world that human beings divide neatly between the majority, who are ordinary and dishonest, and a few unavoidably authentic (and therefore tortured) people forced to share a planet with them.  This smug view of ordinary life is everywhere in the early part of ""Ghost World"", the story of a high school girl (Enid, played by Thora Birch) unsatisfied by every available option for adult life, but unable to invent an alternative that suits her.  But what hits the wrong note here is not the usual disaffected outsider teenager's alienated critique of adults (and herself).  It is the director's preposterous choice to occupy the first third of the movie with Enid reacting predictably toward a nearly endless string of people so plain, morally naive and dumb, only Zwigoff and certain members of the art and academic worlds could possibly believe these are actual people in anyone's universe, teenage, strip-malled, or otherwise.  I suppose it should come as no surprise that the script is based on a comic book, and certainly the characters that surround Enid (besides her fellow disaffected friends, high school buddy Rebecca, and the aging record collector Seymour [Steve Buscemi] with whom she ventures into her first very adult relationship during the course of the plot) are rarely more than cardboard cutouts.  I found myself rooting for all the poor people who came under the churlish gaze of the camera in these scenes (the girl in the wheelchair mouthing lines so stupid even Hallmark wouldn't pass them, or the art teacher who seems to think art = group hugs directed by social realists). Enid's ongoing commentary on their failure to adequately succeed at her game of cultural iconographic one-upmanship seems like a stream-of-consciousness lift from what passes for cultural criticism in the movies these days.  Fortunately, just as one is beginning to devise elaborate means for humiliating this girl, Thora Birch changes your mind. She is honest, which makes it impossible to quite believe it when she squeezes the required snide remarks from her mouth in the early going. Once the director narrows the focus of the lens, and we no longer have to see the idiots who chiefly people the world, we can then admit that many ordinary acts, thoughts and feelings are of great value (so long as authentic, uncompromising people are doing, thinking, or feeling them).  And in expressing these, Ms. Birch is unusually believable.",Ghost World
204,dhahn,A movie going nowhere,4,2 July 2003,"It wasn't that this movie was particularly bad. I like the pictures, there are characters you can identify it and still: The film is not going anywhere, it's just moving along. It's a series of mini-plots, loosely connected by having the same characters in it. The parts are well made, but the composition is arbitratry in a way that the movie is actually less than the sum of it's parts.The problem is that the protagonists don't have a goal. They are undecided in what they want to do with their lives, and they never actually make that decision and stick by it. That may or may not be an accurate description of real life in the suburbs, but it certainly makes for bad drama: Somebody without a goal can neither succeed nor fail, she's just going nowhere. Everything will just go round in circles, with slight changes from time to time. So what's the point in watching? Nothing will come out of it anyway.So ultimately this movie looks like somebody decided that it might be a cool idea to point a camera at two girls and an older guy and see what happens. After the time is up, still nothing has happened. So we just switch off at that point and call it a movie.",Ghost World

Even Dougs can be found in every strip mall parking lot in Anytown, U.S.A.The characters in Ghost World are exceptional in that they reflect people that are ubiquitous in real life. Rebels, geeks, superficial people, lonely divorcees, obscure music buffs, solitary and bitter adults - this is our movie. The actors were truly lucky to work from such a phenomenal script written by Daniel Clowes, who illustrated and wrote the graphic novel that the movie is based on, and Terry Zwigoff, director of the requisite 1999 artist-documentary, Crumb. Zwigoff was also at the helm of the unapologetically anti-Christmas movie, Bad Santa. Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson pulled off something truly rare in movies - completely believable and relatable teenagers. There is not a single, typical mention or scene of binge beer-drinking or marijuana-smoking here - like I said, Ghost World is rare and unique in staying away from perpetually rehashed teen-comedy archetypes.Thora Birch especially stands out as the cynically dry-humored, plucky, and lackadaisical Enid. Her breakthrough role in American Beauty, which came out two years before Ghost World, is proof of her acting chops brilliantly developing right before our eyes; bright, reserved and subtle, like a calcified silver charm. You'll see a more extroverted, stylish, and sexually liberated girl, who forms an unlikely friendship with Seymour, a man twice her age. Steve Buscemi fits the character of Seymour like an oily rubber glove. He's of course worked with the best (Coen Brothers, Quentin Tarantino, Tim Burton, David Chase, Terence Winter, etc.), and Buscemi is wonderfully cast here, breathing life into his Seymour character with aplomb. Honorable mentions go to Illeana Douglas as the school's delightfully pretentious art teacher, Bob Balaban as Enid's spineless father, and the late Brad Renfro, as her friend Josh. Dave Sheridan deserves special mention, as the corner-store loitering redneck Doug, and will make you double over in laughter. Also, if you're into classic 80's comedies such as Tootsie and Young Frankenstein, keep your eyes open for a cameo by a talented and popular actress from that era. I won't ruin the surprise, but it was an absolute pleasure seeing her again.We know these people. They made impressions on us when we struggled to make the difficult transition into adulthood, desperately clinging to a truthful existence. I too grew up in Anytown, U.S.A., which was a ghostly existence , devoid of substantial heroes to look up to, and meaningful, lasting friendships to pave the way.

Slowly as the friendship grows closer, Enid and Rebecca's grows further apart until Seymour get a girlfriend and Enid is stuck alone, in Ghost World.Based on the underground comic book, Daniel Clowes and Terry Zwigoff's script is a breath of fresh air, and Zwigoff's subtle direction is perfect for this film.

However the alienation Enid feels (even through Rebecca) I can pick up on, no one understands what its like, she has passion and is a dreamer much like myself, she wants more than what the place the resides in offers. I think this film is a perfect social commentary of 75% of 18 - 25 year olds out there. Rebecca also shines as a girl who dreamt her school life away and is very 'older' minded, she wants a house and a job and to get sorted, she is the level headed one of the duo (much like my best friend).

Forget the wonderful adaption of the original Ghost World publications... forget the supreme performances by Birch, Buscemi and the rest of the cast... forget the undeniably funky soundtrack... this film is my favourite because it dares to take a stance. It defies standardisation and conformity in favour of showing a unique and individual perception on the anxiety of life for young people.Let's talk cast. Buscemi is as touching and real as he is the comical turn off. Birch is simply outstanding as the ultra cynical Enid - the rest of the cast give the perfect support to two of the biggest, most under-rated talents in the industry.This film is poignant.

This movie isn't awful because it is well acted and funny at times, Enid's father is hilarious, but it just doesn't go anywhere. The main character in the movie, Thora Birch, plays a recent high school graduate who has this ""I'm so much better than everybody else"" attitude. Everything she sees around her she considers ""sucky"" in some way. However, she ends up befriending a lonely record collector and this is when the story began to get interesting. I won't go into spoiler details but she pretty much ruins Seymour's chance at happiness because she becomes jealous when Seymour begins to see and like a woman Enid pleaded with him to meet originally. She is a twisted little girl. I was thinking about the title too. I believe the title is not about her living in a ""ghost world"" per se, it is the opposite. She is actually the one living as a ghost in the world. She goes thru life like a ghost. Her attitude ostracizes her from her best girlfriend and her friend Seymour whom she ends up misleading into a life of misery when he was so close to finding true happiness. She went thru life, not as a person with hopes and dreams, but as a ghost, dead inside and raining on everyone's parade. And what does she do at the end? She rides off into the sunset as a ghost would...unseen, without a sound and with nobody to really care. She actually tells Seymour this is her fantasy earlier in the picture. An odd tale about what can happen if you poison your friendships and life with negative attitudes, lies, and jealousy.",Ghost World

214,andy67uk,A brilliant coming-of-age film!,10,22 November 2001,"'Ghost World' is a wonderful movie which mixes humour, pathos and the real life dilemmas of growing up with great sensitivity. Thora Birch is excellent as Enid, the talented young artist who, after graduating from the bland, conformist world of high school, is not sure whether to get a job (and there aren't any good ones in the towm where she lives) or going to college. Enid shares with her best friend Rebecca (Scarlet Johannson) a disdain for the dreariness of small town life and the unfulfilled people she sees around her. However, the girls' 'disdain' is really a factor in their growing up. Enid and Rebecca initially fool middle-aged loner Seymour (Steve Buscemi)into a false bind date by responding to a lonely hearts ad. They cruelly watch Seymour as he waits in the cafe for the date that will never come. The girls see Seymour again at his market stall selling second hand records. Enid buys an LP which she gets to like, and this spawns her interest in Seymour. Enid becomes fascinated by Seymour and his interesting record collection. She changes her first impression of him being a lame duck and grows to like him. On the other hand Rebecca still thinks Seymour is weird and this leads to arguments between them. The girls decide that they want a flat together, but as their difference of opinion grows, the real difference between them as people emerges. Enid, while appearing arrogant and diffident to all around her is a very bright, highly imaginative and talented girl with bigger sights on her future than living in a dreary mid-West town. She is enrolled by her father on part-time art class, and these sections of the film are pivotal to the film. They also mock the idea of 'art as therapy', a sickening notion to Enid, and one which is all too present both in America the UK. I won't elaborate any further on the story as I don't wish to spoil it for those yet to see the film. Life is too short to miss this film, I recommend that everyone who loves movies to see this.Finally, if you it on cinema or buy the video/DVD when released, watch the credits all the way through as Zwigoff adds an amusing vignette at the end of the credits. I'm surprised Zwigoff has made so few films in his career because this is a masterpiece and the lovely Thora Birch is a huge talent!",Ghost World
215,fearless2003,Annoying characters - critical flaw in the movie,2,20 April 2010,"The two main characters enjoy making life miserable for those around them. They are supposed to be ""outsiders""... But who do they torment? Not the in-crowd... but people that are outsiders like they are... anyone that stands out in the slightest. This is the critical flaw in the movie. They care so much about being individuals, yet when it's someone else that is slightly different from the crowd, they step all over them. How selfish... The characters never see their hypocrisy. These aren't really ""outsiders"". They're just bullies. The outsiders are the ones that are being tormented by these two vicious characters.The main character is the most selfish, juvenile character ever to be presented in a movie.

216,R_MACKEN,"Sweet, and interesting",7,10 March 2004,"Ghost World is one of the better teen or comming of age movie i have seen in a while. The story was very sweet, and it gives people who are hopeless (like myself) hope. This is because the  ugly, but unique dork of the movie gets to find true love! I don't usually see that in todays movies
The movie consists of many interesting characters, and the actors who played the characters did an outstanding job (especially Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi). The settings in the movie was good, and I liked how the movie used different room colors for different occasions in this movie.There are some problems of this movie: 1. The movie was a little bit long, and sometimes the story drags. 2. Scarlett Johanson character seemed pretty small, it would be nice to more a little bit of Scarlett Johanson character.This movie was funny, sweet, and interesting. If you are sick of the ordinary teen movies, you should watch this interesting little teen movie called Ghost World :)",Ghost World
217,vcravens,the truth about growing up girl,10,2 September 2001,"This movie is now one of my all-time favorites, and I went in nervous - I love the comic. Now, I prefer the movie, if only because I like movies more anyhow. I thought the slight changes in story and mood worked well, and that Rebecca got exactly the screen time she deserved. Zwigoff and Clowes did a super job in translating the theme and characters to the big screen, and made great choices in tailoring the story-line and the visuals to produce a screenplay, set designs, costumes, etc. Getting Sophie Crumb to do Enid's sketchbook was a stroke of genius, those drawings deserve a ""best supporting"" nomination, or something. For me, the sketchbook underscored that Enid is more creative than negative; she just has a hard time getting a handle on how to be so, and nothing is happening to help her out on this journey. Rebecca and all the minor characters - from dad to art teacher - also helped tremendously in explicating this point, and made a great supporting cast. Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi were both perfect. I was really happy to see Buscemi looking pretty attractive and playing such a sympathetic and thoroughly-drawn character.I think this movie does an excellent job of telling the truth about Enid and what goes on inside her and around her. The screen Enid is remarkably realistic in terms of portraying what girls like her experience and create in their own lives. Enid really comes close to being archetypal for a certain sort of young woman, who wants much, much more than what life is currently offering, and blunders around  - hurting and helping herself and others, by turns - in sometimes desperate attempts to find what she wants, to capture or to create what she imagines to be possible. She reminded me so much of myself and my friends, it was scary and wonderful to see.I will not soon forget how I felt when I caught this movie the first time, and plan to see it again, before it disappears from the screens. I think Dan Clowes is brilliant for letting Enid jump on the big screen and helping her do it so well.",Ghost World
218,wicket177,I can relate,8,4 March 2002,"The best part about Ghost World was the way I could relate with EVERYONE in the movie.  I know far to many people like the ""We'll totally have to do something this summer!"" girl and I usually give the same reaction as Enid. Thora Birch is amazing and gives her character so much depth that most actresses wouldn't be able to do.  Scarlett Johansson would be great too if she didnt smile... eek!  She's almost attractive until you see her teeth. Steve Buscemi was so pathetic looking and he should have gotten a nod for being Seymor.  The parts that take place in the art room were my favorites. I knew exactly how she felt when she displayed all of her ideas.  Ohh, and don't turn it off at the credits... if you do you'll miss Buscemi beating the crap outta the gas station dude... awesome.********8 stars********",Ghost World
219,gorflax,An intelligent and funny film for the open minded.,9,11 September 2002,"Ghost World is an excellent movie.  It is about teenagers yet in no way is it a typical teen movie.  It is the story of two best friends, Enid (Thora Birch) and Becky (Scarlett Johansen).  The film takes place the summer after the two girls have graduated from high school.  Terry Zwigoff and Daniel Clause are a great writing and directing team.  The two girls are well developed characters and we see them change and grow after their graduation. The audience is shown life through the eyes of a young confused, intelligent teenager.  Steve Buscemi is excellent as Seymour a middle-aged man whom Enid befriends through a personal ad.  There are many kinds of moments in this film and many of them are humorous.  There is a num-chuk wielding, mullet sporting hooligan who hangs out at the local quickie mart who is hilarious.  The film mocks a lot which may make it seem offensive to some, but it is truly funny and original.  Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansen are wonderful as the two young friends.  I highly recommend this movie to younger people and any open minded person who would like to see a different sort of film about teenage life.",Ghost World
220,ikonoklastik,Excruciatingly Overrated...,5,13 July 2004,"I do not understand the fascination with this film. For the longest time I had heard of it in the context of a very deserving cult film. People, including grown, seemingly film-savvy men wearing ""Ghost World"" t-shirts... people bringing it up nonchalantly in a serious film-oriented discussion...I saw it eventually. It was very boring, unoriginal, predictable and did not draw the depth from the characters that one would expect from an outskirts-of-Hollywood film. The only reason I watched the movie from beginning to end is because it was late and nothing else was on (I viewed it on a film channel). The characters were forced and uninteresting with the ""lets make a movie about jaded, pseudo-intellectual teenagers"" mentality, only to end up with characters that are essentially goth, minus the ridiculous subcultural manifestations. Zwigoff tried to make up for the lack of depth in characters and his inability to formulate screenplay wit by either having the protagonists point fingers and say ""That sucks"", have other stereotypical antagonists pop up and make stupid remarks that should only be used to spoof 80's highschool comedy movies or have characters make racial remarks that have absolutely no place in the story whatsoever. Also, the whole bus nonsense was very predictable; as soon as the old man was introduced, I new how the entire film was going to play out.
This movie does nothing to deserve even a small bit of the credit it has been given, but I'll throw a five-out-of-ten at it for its effort.",Ghost World
221,thechocolatebird,Arty movie with a heavy-hearted lesson,9,24 July 2014,"This movie tells people to avoid problem children (Enid) otherwise good, kind people like Seymour will get hurt. It had a light-hearted, humorous start, a draggy middle which was filled with suspense that made me want to watch on intrigued. The ending made me feel that my heart was filled with sadness. I am glad that Seymour could finally move on from his troubled but deeply connected relationship. It's tragic that people like Enid cannot or will not face the harsh reality of life. Perhaps she could be labeled an escapist. Scarlett Johansen plays the friend that is only present when she wants something. It's more like a one-sided friendship which probably caused more harm than good to Enid in the long run.",Ghost World
222,aka-valkra,Slow and Boring,5,2 August 2014,"This is the first film I've ever seen where I'd give it a rating lower than IMDb's rating (7.5). The movie was slow, from start to finish and there weren't any particularly funny moments. I didn't smile, not even once during the entire movie let alone laugh. None of the characters are likable at all and you don't really care what happens to any of them. The only exception to this would be Steve Buscemi's character. By the end of the movie, I didn't even know any of the character's names besides Buscemi's Seymour. It is obvious that the two female leads are suppose to contrast each other, each representing a different approach to the American lifestyle but both end up being unrelatable and unlikable. I give this movie a 5 based solely on Buscemi's performance. Every scene he was in made the movie more bearable. Would not watch again and would not recommend to anyone, there are far better coming of age movies.",Ghost World
223,steven-f-freeman,"The meaning of ""Ghost World""",7,16 January 2009,"I liked this movie very much, not so much while watching (we were expecting more of a comedy), but upon reflecting that night. To me, ""Ghost World,"" the title, refers to a world that's no longer alive to the main characters, especially Enid, though also to a lesser degree Rebecca and Seymour. Enid's life is no in longer in the world in which she has grown up, certainly not with her father, and not being carried along with the mainstream thoughtlessness and a lock-step life (e.g., just going to college cause everyone else does). But neither is the plan she long shared with Rebecca -- working in a whatever-type job and living independently -- working out. The idea of moving in with Seymour and becoming his girlfriend was borne of a sentiment of desperation that she almost immediately recognized as such.The movie is about growing up and moving on from ghosts and into life, and how hard, but necessary that is. I wasn't thrilled with the Norman/Bus story line, but I understand it as a metaphor. It seems as though there is no bus-line out of town, but in fact there is. Enid ""doesn't know what (she's) talking about"" when she repeats what everyone knows and what is written on the bench about this line not being in service. The one person she imagines will always be there, crazy Norman waiting for the bus, in fact, leaves on that bus. She sees both that no one is always there as you might want them to be, and also that it is possible to leave. Having attempted but not surrendered to the unsatisfactory options in her world (she won't toe the company line at her movie-theater job, won't accept life with a totally out-of-touch father and fiancée, and won't become Seymour's girlfriend/wife), she realizes after a great deal of probably necessary pain that if she is to join the world of the living, she, too, must leave what has become her Ghost World.",Ghost World
224,Louie-12,Beautifully slow and deep.,10,16 September 2001,"One of the most well written movies I've had the pleasure to see.

Just wait for the first scene in the convenience store to see an unforgettable character.",Ghost World
225,BryMan-4,Thank you for saving my summer,8,2 August 2001,"There were moments in Ghost World that I laughed so hard I thought I'd never catch my breath.  These moments are courtesy of the 80s guy who frequents a convenience store called The Sidewinder.  When we first meet him, he comes into the store sporting the most extreme mullet and aviator sunglasses. Tank top tan lines accent his bare-chested torso.  When he takes out nunchucks to fight off the advancing convenience store owner, I thought I would wet my pants.  That is not to play down the rest of Ghost World, which is a thoughtful and intelligent comedy about being a misfit while everyone around you seems to suddenly fit in.  Even as a child actor, Thora Birch has shown a great deal of depth.  She even had the ability to make the 1991 Melanie Griffith/Don Johnson drama, Paradise, engrossing.  Here, she gives a wonderful performance as a teen struggling with wanting to be a misfit yet somehow wanting to fit in.  With a weird fascination, she gloms onto an older misfit, played appropriately by Steve Buscemi, and tries to help him find his place in society while she remains on the outskirts.  In her internal struggle, she comes to realize that being an elitist rebel when you're 17 is okay, but when you're 40 it's unacceptable.Director Terry (Crumb) Zwigoff knows when to enter a scene and when to leave.  That's a rare talent these days in Hollywood, where scenes seem to drag on until the joke has been beaten to death.  The ending of Ghost World may seem unclear and unsettled, but that is okay because life can be that way, too.  Regardless, it will certainly spark conversation over dinner afterwards.  In a summer full of particularly lame movies, Ghost World is a welcome relief.",Ghost World

And it was good - very good : excellent acting, great story, and technique that left nothing to be desired. But when I sit down to see a movie I do so to be entertained - serious thoughts I have aplenty in my daily life, and movies, wether in the theatre on TV or video, I like to have fun - Ghost World is quite frankly not funny enough. I say 'funny' in the sense of sarcastically humourous. It does have its moments though. Ghost World really cannot be compared with teen movies - it's way too intelligent and insightful.Overall a very good movie - but should have been lightened up a bit.Tip: Keep watching past the end credits!",Ghost World
227,Steeffan,"Short, describing, honest",8,2 June 2002,"This movie was really beautiful! I am deeply impressed by the story and the acting. With only a few actors (good ones, like Steve Buscemi), the whole plot was overwhelming and suspensing. Maybe, the movie is more a drama than a comedy, but some things a so sad and depressing, that they are funny, too. Take for example the man, who is waiting for the bus, which never comes. This is a nice example of the large pool of pictures, the movie maker draw.
For the fans of happy endings, I can't promise you, that you get what you expect. I was little set up about the ending, but, it leaves room for further reflecting and thinking about the whole plot. This movie reflects sometimes the world of us inside. So, by watching this movie, be sure not be carried away too far, you will get back to real life after the end.",Ghost World
228,dimitriscisse,Improper under 18,7,10 March 2016,"This movie: ''Ghost world'' was a very good and nice movie. It reminded you the years when you were on school and the casual and lazy behavior as a teenager who is ready to become adult. Rebecca wants to become independent. She wants to leave away from her parents just like the most teenagers. Also I found out many differences between America and Greece. In Greece , my country , teenagers aren't so eager to go work . The ideology that exists here is that children must study at university first and then they will work with ''dignity''. Also I saw that Enid's father was very tolerant and he gave her the chance to decide for her future instead of my country . Here, parents decide for their children future and they impose their decisions . If the children react to this properly studying then the situation will be OK but if they don't then they are pressured from their parents to find a work to live. I can say that in America there isn't the same misery which there is in Greece. The pattern that all children follow is work marry children work and death. And this is supposed to describe LIFE. Enid is a different character . She is unconventional , she doesn't want to follow the same path , she feels the injustice that there is in society . When she reacts to that she becomes a ''foreign'' person that needs to be excluded from society . She tries to find a purpose in her life , a person that might have the same interests with her and this person is Seymour . I can say that Enid is an arrogant person because at the same time not only can compromise with the society but she doesn't want to study at university to get a major role in her society trying ,with that way , encounter the way that things are. Enid once mentions that wants to kill her self and I believe that this confession marks her whole character. She is a frustrated person .her mother has died , her father wants to marry the hateful stepmother . She is confused , she doesn't know what she wants ( scholarship for art class) and I believe that typifies all the teenagers of her age that are at the same situation or a similar one. I believe that Enid has psychological problems because when you are thinking suicide , when you are talking to old men its not a normal behavior but a divergent one . On the last scene Enid left with the bus . Is this means that she wants to do a new beginning or she has bored her life next to her father and she cant deal with the ''bad'' and suspicious society ? This up to you.",Ghost World
229,kevin22,A movie for the rest of us...,8,26 July 2001,"While I am no longer 18, I still felt a deep connection with Enid and Rebecca. Ghost World portrays teenage life for the rest of us: we may not have been the most popular in school, nor did we particularly enjoy extracurricular activities, but we had distinct interests and ideas and didn't adhere to the  conformist, corporate schema.
There have been numerous mediocre films made over the last four or so years (e.g. American Pie, Can't Hardly Wait, She's All That) attempting to appeal to the youth of today. Many of them are glammy `Hollywood' efforts: plot based, unrealistic drivel written by adults too far removed from their own high school graduation and first jobs to understand what being young was really like. Ghost World paints a realistic, unresolved portrait of  the pains of growing up, ambivalence about one's future, and other everyday angst, thus separating itself from the norm. What's wonderful is that Ghost World is a mainstream movie, but not excessively so. It has such a wonderful balance of counter-culture and mainstream culture that I found myself not specifically focusing on the cultural criticism, but instead narrowing in on the richly nuanced characters.",Ghost World

233,elainew32,"A gem of a movie, with spot on vignettes about record collectors.",8,12 December 2009,"I was told I had to see this film by a fellow record collector. As it turns out, Steve Buscemi's record collector in it only collects 78's, but otherwise has many of the classic earmarks of the record collector, well-displayed in an authentic performance. Turns out his record room was based on the author's own . . .I love the scene in which he is trying to sell some of his seconds to an older finicky collector who will have nothing to do with even a hairline crack, even though the record is very rare and otherwise in fine shape. . .We all know collectors like that! Although I was steered to this movie because of the vignettes of the record collector & dealer, this movie is really an under-appreciated gem. One might call it a dark comedy, one the writer-director describes as equal amounts of funny and pain, but the characterizations, dialogue, etc. are spot on, and I felt that each character, even the minor ones, were authentic. Look for a small role by Brian George as the middle-eastern owner of the Sidewinder Convenience Store. . .he is probably best known for having played Babu Batt on Seinfeld, the middle-eastern character who opened up a restaurant in Jerry's neighborhood, changed the cuisine at Jerry's suggestion, only to have the restaurant then fail, and who got deported, because his renewal Visa was trapped in Jerry's mailbox when Elaine didn't check the mail while Jerry was gone.The story is basically about 2 girls just graduating from high school. They are 2 of the many high school misfits, who seem to be down on most everyone else and everything in the world, but one of them, Becca, is starting to grow up a little and accept her responsibilities in the world (played by Scarlett Johnansen), getting a job, moving into an apartment, whereas the other one, really the main character, Enid, played by Thora Birch, can't figure out what she wants to do with her life and seems to only be able to see the negative side, losing her job by spieling out her negative views of everything on the customers. Both of them have a thing about following people and playing jokes on people, just to see what they will do, while they stand in the shadows and make fun of them. . .And that is how they happen on to the older record collector, played by Steve Buscemi. . .But as Enid silently mocks him, she develops a grudging admiration for him, because he accepts who he is, as a misfit and on one level is happy with himself about it, even though on other levels he doesn't have the happiness of ""fitting in"", but he also doesn't really want to fit in.",Ghost World

It's a comedy with teens, not a teen comedy. There's no nudity and, with one exception, there are no ""oh-so-zany"" characters who exist only as way to get cheap laughs.It's about two best friends, Enid and Rebecca, who have just graduated high school and are cast adrift into adulthood with little (Rebecca) or no (Enid) ambition. Steve Buscemi plays Seymour, an obsessive collector and social outcast who Enid first meets through a cruel prank, but who she eventually comes to see as a kindred spirit. ""He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate. In a way, he's such a clueless dork, he's almost kind of cool."" There's so much heart here in the characters that when the last third of the turns melancholic it's like a punch to the gut, but it avoids being melodramatic.In his 4 star review Roger Ebert said, ""I wanted to hug this movie,"" and I couldn't agree more.",Ghost World

My rating is 6 : writing is pretty good, as well as acting. But this remains too much a 'regular' movie, by all means too American. Focus is too much based on being a post-yougster in Hicktown, USA. I had the feeling this movie was following 'Welcome to the dollhouse'. The girl has grown, has learned that she could use people with sex and she also discovered that this dollhouse was haunted by ghosts. A big problem she is not able to survive by herself, and she needs to be linked to a rock, better : she needs to be the rock where all drifting boats are tied for the good.

Other reviews have adequately cataloged the plot, characters and substance of ""Ghost World"", so I will focus on the beauty of its flavor.
Enid sees the functioning of the adults in her life as the subject of her ironic amusement, and, indeed, the actors brilliantly flesh out the subtle (and not so subtle) humor in their struggles.  Every supporting role from the guy who brings his laptop to Starbucks every day to answer the free-coffee trivia questions to the mullet-headed bare-chested convenience store customer with his parking lot numb chuck antics are just hilarious. If ever in life you've looked at a person and wondered for a moment exactly how they got to be who they are, you might see many of their ilk here.The obvious gem is Steve Buscemi as Seymour, one of my favorite actors. His character reminds me of the Thoreau quote:  ""the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.""  He is a man approaching his middle years whose life consists of his dull job, his obese farting roommate, his mother, and his large and obsessive collection of old records that have a room of their own. Not hateful nor whiney about his lot, he simply keeps trying at life, even though his combination of intelligence, appreciation of subtlety and unfortunate odd looks keep him from the mainstream life connections that might fulfill him.  Gentle and resigning, he is man who, like many, has come to accept himself and life as things he really can't do anything about. Buscemi manages to play both the fragile patheticness of Seymour and his sweetness, so that we can see why Enid is drawn to him.This movie (as some of the reviews show) is not for everyone.  But, it's definitely one of my new favorites.",Ghost World
243,cdnfirst,"Depressing, left me empty",4,30 September 2001,"Edin just graduated from high school and is already rebelling (or is that continuing to) against society. She doesn't want a job, seems to do everything she can to tick off her friends and plays a mean spirited act by answering a lonely guy's (Steve Buscemi) personal ad. Along the way we see she is just confused and wants to be loved just like Buscemi's character does. In fact she feels a kinship for the guy. However her self loathing gets too much and brings her and the audience down. I was a bit insulted by portrayal of Buscemi's character as withdrawn for his collecting of rare records and pop culture. Go into many ""theme"" restaurants and you'll see that is the attraction. Finally the end of lack there of left me empty. If you fade to black and put ""THE END"" on screen then your story obviously did not have a conclusion. Maybe that was the point that there is no tidy endings in life however that conclusion could have been apparent if the screenplay had alluded to it. I overheard another patron say ""That's it?"". Enough said.",Ghost World
244,mackey3000,Satire of suburbia even more on the money than American BEAUTY,8,7 July 2005,"GHOST WORLD is a remarkable social satire. I've loved this film ever since I first saw it, but the more I see it, the better it gets. Thora Birch, in the role of a lifetime, is indescribably convincing as the cynical, too-smart- for-her-own-good, devout outsider Enid. The way she totally becomes this character is uncanny. She is also aided at no small part by a remarkable, zinger-filled screenplay by Zwigloff and Daniel Klowes (the latter created the comic book this film is based on). I can't think of many films in recent years that allow as many brilliant, uninhibited, thought- provoking one-liners too come out of their characters mouths with the same consistency in which Enid spews them out. A pre-LOST IN TRANSLATION Scarlett Johannson is also wonderful in the crucial supporting role of Enid's best friend, who may have an easier time than Enid when it comes to swallowing the shallow artificial commercialization of the American life. But the hidden treasure in this gem is that remarkable character actor Steve Buscemi. Buscemi's been playing offbeat, fast-talking, short-tempered, fan-favorite characters for years but, like Bill Murray in LOST IN TRANSLATION and Adam Sandler in PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE, he gives the greatest performance of his career (so far anyway) by concentrating on what was the essence in the roots of all the characters he previously played: A painfully deep social frustration that would eat him alive, where it not for his only barely successful ability of convincing himself the way of the loner is the life for him. His beautifully understated and emotionally captivating portrayal of one-of-a-kind sad-sack Seymour, who admits ""I can't relate to 99% percent of humanity"", is the stuff a film lover's dreams are made of (and in a more fair and just world, the stuff that GUARANTEES you a f**king Oscar!). This is one of my favorite films in recent memory. One of the greatest things about it is the versatility of the emotions it evokes. It has moments that are incredibly funny and moments that are painfully sad. There are some scenes that definitely hit close to home. I can't say that I can identify with Enid or Seymour on a regular basis, but there are definitely times in my life were I can feel their pain (probably more in the past than now), and there are many scenes whose effects are enhanced by how real they feel (Enid visiting Seymour because she needs someone to be nice to him, Seymour's frustration that his favorite musician is the opening act in some s**tty bar, Enid realizing that she is actually going to miss the school nerd, etc.). This is a very special film. A",Ghost World
245,joeshannongabe,A compelling portrait of the artist as a young woman,10,19 September 2002,"It's hard for me to put a finger on exactly why I love this movie so much. I think it has to do with the lead characters being so fully realized and un-stereotyped. Just as we see ourselves as more complex than the labels that others give us, the characters of Enid, Rebecca and Seymour are allowed to be complex and self contradictory, likeable and unlikeable, noble and flawed all at the same time (sometimes in the same sentence!). Enid, a recent high school grad filled with teenage ennui, is trying to make her own way in the world without compromising her (impossibly high) standards. As her friend Rebecca begins to grow away from her, Enid's fear and confusion only increase. But when she finally lets herself see beyond the surface of the lonely, middle aged eccentric Seymore, she begins to learn how to form her own identity. How they managed to capture these subtleties on film is the key to the movie. This film is driven by the atmosphere created by allowing these flawed characters to experience their lives on their own terms. This is the anti Hollywood movie. If the mainstream bores you, you need to see Ghost World.",Ghost World
246,bitterstranger,"Enjoyable if a bit too heavy on caricature, graced by a fabulous Buscemi",7,11 December 2004,"Now that I know the film is based on a comic book, it figures. As I watched it without knowing that, I was reminded of MTV's Daria, especially in the way the main character, Enid, reacts to mostly everything and everyone with a mix of sarcasm and apathy. Thora Birch plays yet another teenage misfit, it's hard to tell if she's so good at it or if you're just used to seeing her in that role. There are times when the clichés and caricatures can become a bit too heavy, but overall it works.Everything in the film has a sketch-like quality, from the photography and setting to the plot itself, which is more like a series of vignettes. Sketches are also how Enid describes the reality around her, by drawing on her diary. There's a theme of fakeness running through the film and several brief comedy scenes serve to illustrate that - like when Enid and her friend are sitting in a fifties ""authentic"" diner and 80's music comes through the juke box. It's one of the signs of the uninspiring, suspended surreality they live in. Enid's friend, Rebecca, played by Scarlet Johansson, is a marginal character, she doesn't get much of a role in the film, other than to serve as contrast for Enid. She ends up adapting more easily, gets a job and a flat, and their relationship grows colder as Enid has more and more difficulty following her friend's example, or even deciding if she wants to follow that route at all. There's a scene where Rebecca, frustrated by Enid's inability to make up her mind, blurts out rather cruelly ""good luck living with your father for the rest of your life"". That remark, along with the situation it refers to, is one of the things that lead Enid to realize she needs to take some decisions or they'll all be taken for her by others. That is what the whole film basically revolves around. There are funny bits of social satire, like the misguided controversy over Enid's art piece and the failure of her teacher to stand up for her. For Enid, even good experiences start from unpromising circumstances and her own most careless indifference. The idea of life as a matter of success vs. failure, winners vs. losers is debunked. Steve Buscemi is, as ever, absolutely brilliant as the ""dork"" Seymour. His character is also in many ways a caricature, but he gives it real depth. The unlikely affair developing between him and Enid is the most genuine part of the film. What happens to Seymour in the end is dealt with a heavier dose of comedy than perhaps would have been necessary, while Enid's future is more poetically left open-ended. For anyone expecting some sort of definite closure, this is going to be disappointing, but I don't think it is one of the flaws of the film. It just doesn't have a typical plot development so there is no contradiction in the ending being so vague. The final scene makes nice use of a tiny sub-plot that was both comical and loaded with heavier symbolism, the old man sitting on a bench waiting for a bus that never seems to come. When Enid finally catches her own bus we don't know where it leads and what she plans to do or with what money, but, as someone who really cannot stand cheesy happy endings, I thought this was a nice way of closing the film. She finally gets the courage to enact her wish about leaving in exactly the way she had talked of before. It does work as a resolution in an understated way, showing us how, after waiting for something to happen from outside, she finally decided it was up to her to start taking control of her life. All in all, an enjoyable, lighthearted and bittersweet satirical comedy, with good acting (did I mention Buscemi is fabulous?) and amusing dialogues and situations. Just don't expect too much out of it, and you'll be pleasantly surprised. 7/10",Ghost World
247,alexo-5,This quick-witted film takes a thoughtful look at the changing nature of friendship.,9,4 August 2001,"I'm not familiar with the comic strip that this film is based on, but that hardly seems necessary in order to enjoy this very funny, very smart film.Thora Birch is mesmerizing as Enid - the central character in the film. I couldn't tear my eyes away from her whenever she was on the screen. Not only did I admire her nifty sense of style and her calm, quick wit, but every time she put on a new pair of glasses, it added another dimension to her character, showing that she is still changing, growing, learning...still unsure of who she is going to become.Enid is a stubborn non-conformist who has just graduated from high school with her best friend, Rebecca. (The hilarious graduation scene opens the film and sets the tone for its sly sense of humor.) Their close relationship cools as Rebecca settles into a more traditional lifestyle that alienates the individualistic Enid.Enid befriends the older, equally eccentric Seymour (the excellent Steve Buscemi) who sparks in her a passion for classic jazz and blues. Outwardly sarcastic and judgmental, Seymour secretly longs for intimacy. In fact, he and Enid first meet when she and Rebecca jokingly respond to his pathetic personals ad. As Enid begins playing matchmaker for Seymour, they develop a unique relationship that helps them both through a difficult time in their lives.""Ghost World"" pokes fun not only at the mindless conformity of the Big Mac and Nike set, but also the deliberate and absurd attempts at non-conformity of pseudo '50s diners, political art, over-zealous sales people and all those young white boys who are suddenly into Raggae music. Many people (including myself) who watch this film will see their 'type' being made fun of. If you are able to laugh at yourself, you will enjoy this film that much more.But ""Ghost World"" is much more than a smug yuk-fest. It takes a thoughtful look at the compromises one must make in order to form meaningful relationships with others that may not share the same ideas, interests and styles. At one point, Seymour appears wearing uncharacteristically bright blue jeans, sheepishly admitting to Enid that his current date bought them for him.The film also looks at the compromises necessary for Enid to maintain individualism and a sense of self, even if it means the ending of a close relationship that has been outgrown. It suggests that this ending opens the door for self re-invention, for the beginning of a whole new chapter to life.",Ghost World
248,hectic25,Best film of the year (so far..),10,22 August 2001,"Since this is a ""commentary"" and not a ""review,"" I will not go into the plot elements or character development etc.  Rather I will explain why this movie should be as highly rated as it is, and attempt to account for those who did not like this movie. The movie is excellent because it is very funny and depicts contemporary reality in an interesting and creative way.  It also examines the coming of age in a refreshing humorous way.  However, the movie relies on in-jokes for most of its humor.  Now, if you're not ""in"" on the joke, the movie will not appear funny to you, and of course you'll say it's boring.  Now, as far as who's in and who's not...   The movie (Thora Birch's character mainly, who is in essence: ""the movie"") makes fun of people who are pretentious, dumb, ineffective, and essentially: 'not cool.'  Obviously, if you are one of these people, the movie is attacking you!  Now this is not meant to sound elitist, I'm not saying that anyone is better than anyone else, but if you get the jokes, then you're in on it, and you don't have to worry.  If you found it long, boring, or something to that effect, well, some self-examination might be in order.  This movie is for smart people who prefer to see a unique movie to a familiar one.  If you like movies where everything is neatly tied up in the end, and you don't have to think too much, don't see this one.",Ghost World
249,Dr Pepper,One of the best this year,8,16 September 2002,"Ghost World is very good, one of the best so far this year (it opened in 2002 here in Sweden). It is an amazing contrast to all the other movies set in roughly the same environment, i.e. high school students, proms, one-sided characters (nerds, athletes etc) and moaning parents. In contrast to all of the other movies Ghost World manages in a superb way to create a great story from this environment, with elements of drama, romance, sadness, happyness and mostly everything else.Thora Birch from American Beauty is fantastic in the lead role, Steve Buscemi is just as goofy as usual (maybe even a little more than usual...) and the rest of the cast does a good job. The dialogue is just as sharp as in the comic book by writer Daniel Clowes (it is at many times the exact same lines), and director Terri Zwigoff does a great job of transferring the comic book to the big screen.See it as soon as you get the possibility. 8/10",Ghost World

I will admit that it is a different sort of teen movie but I didn't find it all that funny.  Thora Birch's Enid is quirky and full of teen angst but not that humorous.  The rest of the caste all seem more sad than funny.  I really liked the actor who played Enid's father, sorry forgot his name.  He actually has a couple of the more laughable scenes.  I also like the weird guy with the num-chucks who always seems to be at the ""7-11"" type corner store. I won't say it was a bad movie but I found it slightly disappointing.",Ghost World

Terry Zwigoff is a master director who i believe deserves a lot more credit than he gets. this movie captures not just female teenage life, but teenage life wonderfully. i actually have a tattoo of this movie it means so much to me, i love it and always will have a special spot in my heart. i watch it twice a year and i don't get sick of it, in fact i pick up more every viewing.

But as Rebecca (Johansson) manages to hold down a job and find an attractive apartment for them both to share, Enid (Birch) is far too obsessed with her own bizarre life, now involving weirdo loser Seymour (Steve Buscemi as a character inspired by 'underground' comic book artist Robert Crumb), to make the effort putting a real strain on their friendship.

257,JHollis,"Mature, intelligent and haunting (but in a good way)",9,11 June 2002,"Movies that criticise the world can fall into many traps, leaving the viewer to feel jaded by the film's experience.  Ghost World's witty appraisal of 'America' successfully avoids being childishly caustic or self-important and thus emerges as one of the best films of 2001. We sympathise with Enid (the luscious Thora Birch) without being expected to completely believe that her cynical world-view is necessarily the right one. Enid's (and her best-friend Rebecca's)negativity is turned on all around them, and their obsessive need to be cool but on their own terms sees them take post-modernism to its absurd conclusion. Enid's bizarre costume choices mean that she stands out from the rest of her baggy-panted generation, and in one scene is infuriated that no-one, even Rebecca, understands her 'original 1977 punk look' she's testing out.The fact that we should not fully empathise with Enid is shown by the contrasting character arc of Rebecca. There is a definite sense that she grows up over the course of the movie, but not in a ""what have we learned about life"" Disney way. Perhaps she has sold out to the conservative ideals that seemed so repulsive to them at the beginning of the movie, but just as Enid ultimately fulfils her desires, so does Becky live out her 'seventh grade fantasy'. The important thing is not the choices people make, but whether they make choices with which they are happy.The movie's main targets are people who betray themselves in an effort to fit in, and their resulting stupidity by doing so.  But the people who have remained true to their values (like Steve Buscemi's Seymour, in a performance that should have been at least nominated for an Academy Award), are portrayed as leading equally vacuous lives.  Seymour's infrequent attempts to achieve 'normality' are galling for us to observe, and near soul-destroying for him to experience.This is an excellent movie.  Thora Birch gives her most confident performance to date, and Scarlett Johansson is superbly laconic as Enid's icy side-kick. The supporting cast all shine. Strongly recommended!",Ghost World
258,alysiakoloamatangi,Ghost World - Musings on the Creative Impulse,9,10 January 2020,"I watched Ghost World this week as part of a Terry Zwigoff film review. The film is adapted from a graphic novel written by Daniel Clowes and follows the life of 18-year old Enid Coleslaw following her graduation from high school. It is notable that Enid Coleslaw is an anagram for Daniel Clowes, thereby suggesting that the source text is somewhat autobiographical. I found this particularly interesting, given that Enid is portrayed as a precocious. Perhaps Clowes is demonstrating some self-reflection here, or providing a social commentary that we are all in some way.Ghost World's closest antecedent is The Catcher in the Rye in that Enid, like Holden Caulfield, struggles with the phoniness of the adult world that she is expected to transition into. Accordingly, the film deals with the question of how much authenticity one should compromise in order to function as part of society. This makes the film essential viewing for creative types, who often struggle to preserve their unique voice while conforming to societal expectations.Enid is a valuable case study in this respect. She is so insistent on preserving her authenticity that she is incorrigible and unyielding, unable to hold down a simple job because she can't censor her opinions. She regards the world around her with dissatisfaction regarding its lack of depth and demonstrates a level of world-weariness one would usually associate with an elderly woman. At the same time, Enid is conflicted because she doesn't really know who she is. Her constantly changing wardrobe and hairstyles are a physical manifestation of her fragmented identity.This outlook is reflected in the cinematography of Ghost World, which is rife with imagery that communicates oppressive suburban mediocrity and hollowness. Shots draw attention to extras engaging in mundane activities. Settings are bland and empty of life - strip malls and apartment complexes. An empty pair of jeans on the sidewalk simulate the human experience with no flesh or blood to substantiate them.In her search for authenticity, Enid attaches herself to a disillusioned eccentric called Seymour, who collects old records and artifacts The relationship that develops between these two outsiders is portrayed brilliantly with humour and pathos. Enid praises Seymour as ""the opposite of everything I hate"". He exhibits genuine emotion (usually anger), placing him in contrast to the emotionally passive and polite others who populate Ghost World. Further, his collection of antiques lends Seymour a connection to a culture of depth instead of modern consumerism.Thora Birch's portrayal of Enid as endlessly sarcastic and dead-pan, at once endearing and cynical, is fantastic. Steve Buscemi's performance as Seymour is similarly brilliant. His listlessness and acceptance of futility is conveyed beautifully, with Buscemi's very appearance lending a sense of weariness to the character.Like many of Zwigoff's films, Ghost World is about what it's like to be a creative person in a world that celebrates mundanity. It is therefore fitting that Zwigoff makes numerous references to Robert Crumb throughout the film. Enid's diaries are drawn by Sophia Crumb, diegetic music includes that of Robert Crumb and his Cheap Suit Serenades and a piece of art that is key to the film's narrative is drawn by Crumb himself.Ghost World doesn't give us any answers on how to thrive as a creative, but it provides an interesting commentary on the costs and benefits of living a creative life. I would recommending watching this film in tandem with Zwigoff's other pieces - Crumb (1994) and Art School Confidential (2006) - which expand further on this theme.",Ghost World
259,mariogomezg,"Nice cast and visuals, bad adaptation",4,12 October 2018,"If you've read the comic this is based on, you may be as puzzled as I am, it's so different in spirit from the movie. At first I thought this was another case of a director taking too many creative liberties, but since Clowes himself co-wrote the script, it seems he simply decided to dramatically change the personality of his two protagonists.Sure enough, the visuals of the film are a fine translation of Clowes' quirky art, but the dynamic between the two main characters and the way they relate with their surroundings is greatly changed. The comic is about two young girls interacting with all sorts of weird characters, a mostly unspoken rivalry for the attention of the same guy and both characters' feelings of inadequacy. Although they like to play jokes on people, they never really hurt anybody. What we have in the movie is Becca turned into an almost non-entity, while Enid becomes a cruel, despicable person. While in the original she had a strained realtionship with her well-meaning father, she wasn't mean to him, neither did utter such horrible phrases as ""I'm not even hearing anything you're saying"".Then, of course, we have her relationship with Seymour, a character who wasn't even in the comic. Sure, the girls tricked a hapless guy into a fake date in a diner, but that was all, he didn't ever show up again. Nevertheless, for some reason Clowes and Zwigoff choose to turn the guy into the movie's co-protagonist, a nerdy collector of jazz records who develops a close friendship with Enid. This certainly is a character who could belong in a Clowes' comic, but Enid falling for the guy and eventually sleeping with him? Seems absolutely out of place, it's as if she had slept with Bob Skeets, the weird psychic from the original. Not to mention she completely destroys the guy's life and his only chance at happiness. I totally fail to see what the writer-director duo tried to convey with this - that pretty, insecure girls can badly mess lonely middle-aged guys? Seems like a story more fitting for a Hallmark drama. Meanwhile, Becca remains at the background, the subtext of her feeling eclipsed by Enid's personality totally lost. Josh, who was a key character in the book, barely makes an appearance here. The pseudo-magical realism of the ending is quite unimaginative, too, and makes for an unsatisfactory conclusion. The movie actually has a post-credits scene, unfunny, uneeded, and that farther deepens Seymour's misery.As expected, the strong cast is pleasant to see, but the story simply isn't there. Not that everything's a total failure - the art school subplot (created solely for the film) is kind of fun, and makes a good point about contemporary hypocrisy. I also enjoyed the party at Seymour's house and Enid's failed attempt at working. Nevertheless, the movie is overall much less funny and interesting that the graphic novel, the array of extravagant characters and situations greatly reduced. Clowes had a further collaboration with Zwigoff, so you'd think he was satisfied with how Ghost World turned out. Nevertheless, for me he's a comics guy, a prollific and enjoyable one at that, and his strenghts clearly lie at that art form.",Ghost World

I had great laughs throughout the movie, and on the whole the movie was very uplifting for me. I guess, the ending, as someone pointed out, might feel unsatisfying at first. The nice thing about the ending though is that it is open to interpretation and it was very symbolic and beautiful. Apart from being funny the movie of course contains a host of interesting themes to discuss, teenage alienation in particular.
What I wanted to point out in this review was that if you liked this movie you should go check out a strikingly similar movie called ""Fucking Amal"". That is a swedish movie that I am particularly proud of referring you too, being a Swede myself :-) I think both movies are superb! Fucking Amal probably wins (I think) on realism and it touched me on a deeper level. Check out the similarities though.

The ending of the movies are very different though. I shouldn't give away more than that :-)",Ghost World

On the flip side her best friend portrayed by Scarlett Johannsen, lives the life most do take, working mindless jobs, doing what has to be done, taking the ""adult"" path. The characters show a wonderful balance, and perspectives of both are easily recognized, and Steve Buscemi's Seymour  is a brilliant performance of what might lie at the end of the path either of the girls take (until Enid's final move takes her out of that possibility) Overall, all characters developed well, intertwined perfectly, and showing the complete balance of the paths taken by those not as sure of their future.

To find out what is it you really want before you get sucked into slavish morality of middle class and lead a unwanted life, time after High School is a critical one. This has been depicted in this movie. This is certainly not a teenager movie. We all revert back some time or other and look at ourselves, and ask is this what I want to be? There is no universal solution to this question. We do get affected by standards placed in society for a good life. We might have love-hate relationship with these standards, and we sometime forget that even in our rebelling, we contribute towards these standards.",Ghost World

There are some who say this is a brilliant adaptation of Daniel Clowe's comic and there are others who say this is a boring film. For the people who think this film is boring, you just don't get it. This is about Enid, a young woman, who has just graduated high school. She has to learn what the future will be, she has to now go out on her own. This movie is about a girl maturing and dealing with friends and relationships. She finally does what she wants in the end. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good film. So far, everyone that I've sit down and watched this with enjoyed it. This is a movie I can watch a ton of times and never be bored with it.",Ghost World
270,Blad33,We enter from the world of the real into the geek-light zone.,9,4 September 2006,"The film immediately alludes to the lameness of present day American high school with a biting, brilliant parody of a ""matricuLATION"" fair well dance, and afterwards a (pretentious but charming) flip-off to it all. Also I think a comment on the paucity of talent/laughable unoriginal idiocy of new-age hip-hop style pop singers, and how it influences the culture which our two main characters, Enid and Rebecca, are now decidedly leaving behind.The introduction of Enid (Thora Berch) is lively, fun and although it certainly doesn't pertain to the rest of the more downbeat yet hurmourous film, it's a statement that shows people can be outcasts and still have fun. They're not all boring. Geeks that is.Continual social references to American suburban outcasts are made, from the hilarious red-neck, borderline psychotic nun-chuck man, to the disgruntled, morose convenient store clerk. All characters are introduced amusingly, something which we don't see very often. You get the genuine, convincing impression that the two female leads are going to be ""friends 4 ever"", but that it's more than just an immature, nonsensical teenage relationship. What they share is a mocking contempt for their peers and society in general.There's few like them at first. That is until after we start the journey, finding the ultra-geek and music fan Seymour (played by the sublime Steve Buscemi) who it sort of a proving-ground for their views. Enid really is a geek, whilst Rebecca (played by the amazingly cute Scarlett Johansson) is normal. Instead of hanging around with and eventually sleeping with people like Seymour, Rebecca gets a -- gasp --day job. This cuts Rebecca out of the main story of the film, she is no longer one of them, becoming instead the outcast of the writers' Terry Zwigoff's (also director) and Daniel Clowes's world. This is the first of two mistakes of what is overall a flawed masterpiece. Due to Johansson's talent I believe more of a role could of been made for her. I would have liked to of seen into her everyday boring world for more than just a few brief scenes. As a sort of comparison to Enid's alternative geek twilight zone. Rebecca's boring day job world can also have its high moments, just like Enid's geeky art-driven one does. They should have shown additional examples other than the ones they gave. This is a testament to the amazing actress rather than the writing, but they could have commented on down-to-earth views of life in Johansson's world.The second of my perceived mistakes is the abrupt ending: But what happens next I ask. She's escaping to what exactly? Probably to a boring day job like Rebecca's is. I believe of course this was to leave a sense of romance for the overall story, as she so does want the world to be more mysterious (the very funny porn shop!) and original (Seymour.) Showing this would have made it mundane, but the world would have some more realistic depth. When she finds it isn't so wonderful and the beauty/interest is lost she's leaving, possibly in hope of something better. Maybe to see a Seymour more her own age. It's an ambiguous and haunting ending, the specter-bus arriving to finally take her away from the disappointment. There just could have the contrast to Enid's world. However it's still about as good as films get and I love it.",Ghost World
271,teufelsdroch,Teen angst thru middle-aged men,10,15 June 2005,"Obstensibly this movie is about two cooler-than-thou high school girls coming to terms with the wider world. But its actual perspective comes from three cooler-than-thou middle aged men: Dan Clowes, Robert Crumb, and Terry Zwigoff.Much of the absurd American characterizations could go by the board, if you weren't paying attention. The video stores are populated by fat people in Nike shirts, NFL hats, and Oakley sunglasses---stuff that's way too hip for the guy wearing it. This universal idea of what's fashionable gets communicated to a girl in the suburbs, causing her to wear clothing that's suited for the beach. The culture is founded on TV, not on what the girl does or what her regional history would dictate; and so her self-identity is utterly empty. And this is a story of two girls trying to find themselves in this landscape, without a history or real culture for a compass.The final shot begins at the bottom of an electrical pole: it rises up to show a criss-cross of hundreds of wires that stretch across all our cities. It wasn't always like that. The Birch character passes a strip mall of Radio Shacks and Blockbusters---could be anywhere, is nowhere.Today, get out of your car and stand on some street corner. Look up and notice the power lines. Look around and notice the gas station, the video store, the pharmacy. A steady stream of cars pass. Vast expanses are covered by parking lots.

273,rsanders,Cranking the teen girl angst up to 11,7,30 August 2001,"I have to admit, Ghost World is a moderately entertaining character study, with some genuinely funny moments and a decent turn by Steve Buscemi. It could have been much worse, and it was certainly a better use for my $7 than, say, Scary Movie 2. That said, though, I found it a little hard to relate to a film with such a selfish, unlikeable protagonist. Enid (Thora Birch) is a manipulative, self-centered little brat who manipulates and takes for granted everyone who cares about her, topped off with the de rigeur (and grating) teen girl pose of world-weariness and ennui, rolling her eyes at the bourgeois antics of people in convenience stores and bars, bitching about how dreary and false the world is and kvetching about how she wishes she could just get away from everything and do what she wants. That character is OK for a supporting role, but it doesn't carry a whole film. The story covers territory that is quite well-trodden, and the acting (with the exception of Buscemi) is lackluster. If you've got an afternoon to kill, catch it as a matinee.",Ghost World
274,mattbauer,"Ghosts May Be Transparent, But Ghost World is Impenetrable",9,28 August 2001,"There's a scene in Ghost World where a be-mulleted, white trash loser accosts the owner of a convenient store with nunchukas, while blasting retro heavy metal from a peeling boombox atop a jalopy. While the characters (and the audience) laugh wildly at this out-of-date goon, Enid (Thora Birch, only lightly reprising her American Beauty role) hurriedly inhales the situation through wide eyes. ""That guy rocks!"" she exclaims, without a trace of irony.     The press for Ghost World would lead one to believe that it is a film about a Lolita-like romance - it isn't. Critics seem to see the characters as anti-conformists - they aren't. The trailer makes it appear as another cynical indie about brilliant losers tortured by a watered down society - I can't agree. What exactly, then, is Ghost World? Quite simply, Terry Zwigoff's debut fiction film is a very careful and thoughtful story about quite possibly the most grown-up, sincere, thrift store junkie/outcast ever.     The story sounds familiar to indie film geeks: Enid and Rebecca, two best friends just out of high school, purposely avoid college. They dress in vintage clothing and have smarmy comments for everything and everyone. After playing a cruel trick on Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a lonely, aging record geek, Enid befriends him. And this is where the story cliches cease. There are no sexual awakenings or mysterious strangers who turn things upside down. We are simply invited into the exuberant Enid's fascinating world through her eyes. She never once plays the victim, which in a world full of ""Double Jeopardy""s and ""Blow""s, is quite amazing. It is also quite sad, in the sense that Summer Catch, the latest in a series of Freddie Prinze Jr. flops, opened last week on nearly 2500 screens, whereas Ghost World lingered in the (ahem) indie graveyard at a mere 30.     I have heard Todd Solondz's name mentioned in the same sentences as Zwigoff's, which I think is quite unfair. While Solondz's Happiness is an excellent film, I would say that Ghost World has more of a perceptive, comic edge to it to and, simply put, is more thoughtful. It has more in common with, say, Kevin Smith's Chasing Amy; even, to a slight degree, Swingers. Like these films, Ghost World, and especially Enid herself, *celebrates* the realities of life.      This Summer I have sat through approximately ten films that were so insipid I am considering suing the major studios in repayment for lost brain cells (Tomb Raider, I'm looking at you). However, after seeing Ghost World, I am convinced that the suffering was worth it.                                  9/10",Ghost World
275,nawbaker,A good film that could have been great,7,2 December 2001,"First off- I'd like to say that I enjoyed this film- the acting was good, and the plot original, however I left the cinema feeling deeply disastisfied. This film lacked one thing- an ending! It felt like the writers had reached the end of their timelimit, and decided 'lets put a ""The End"" sign up now.' The film raised many interesting questions about issues such as isolation, lonliness, relationships and growing up but it provided very few answers. Instead the director (who was also the co-writer) chickened out and took the easy mystical approach by providing a mythical ending to a film whose strength was the realism of its characters.Since I'm moaning about the writer/director I should note there are a few sloppy loose ends and the general good look of the film is spoiled by a few poor cuts.The film does however demonstrate that Thora Birch has a great future ahead of her, remind us that Steve Buscemi reminds us again that he is a great actor, and Scarlett Johansson needs a better agent as her character disappears halfway through the film.Overall a good film which with a little more thought, and a lot more writing at the end could have been great.",Ghost World

There's already a category for you people, and that is the Teeny-bopper category. The point of this movie is to make fun of this type of person and their lifestyles, and show how smart the outcasts really are. This movie shows how the stupid bimbos base their lives purely on what other people want them to be, while the outcasts just sit back and laugh. The story revolves around two characters who wouldn't give a second thought about what other people thought of them. They're witty and make fun of the stupid ways people act just to make a statement or to impress other people. Enid is a sarcastic, aimless but focused teenager, while Rebecca is a naturalistic, centered teenager. They both spend the summer following people around laughing at their dumb mistakes. What they don't know is that they're slowly drifting further and further away from each other.     The only bad thing about this movie is that it was released in select cities.

Enid is an artistic, cynical girl who doesn't know what to do with her life. Rebecca is the ""normal"" girl who wants to get an apartment and job and live a ""normal"" life. While looking for an apartment, the girl's days consist of messing around with their secret crush Josh (Brad Renfro), passing by a mysterious man named Norman who waits at a bus stop that was shut down two years ago, and then on one particular day, play a prank on an eccentric loner named Seymour (Steve Buscemi). Afterwards, Rebecca is the main one looking for an apartment. Enid is drawn to Seymour and befriends him and even tries to be his match-maker.

But the relationship portrayals and the human impacts in this movie make it a most excellent movie. There are subplots going on, surrounding the nature of a long time childhood friendship that has just matured to adulthood, which couples with the responsibilities of adulthood to challenge the bonds of a friendship. This film deals with an outsiders view of a suburban life that they are not totally happy with, and always looking for ways to rebel against. Often ending up feeling misunderstood. Real emotions, ideas and actions come out in the film, making it an enjoyable watch. I would recommend this movie to most everyone, not children so much, and not anybody going through the similar issues of reaching a junction in their life that challenges their bonds with friends, family and loved ones.

284,corelli,The most entertainingly boring movie of the year,3,19 August 2001,"Like an overlong episode of Seinfeld, but with less plot and zero punchlines, I kept waiting anxiously for the movie to begin.  Maybe there's some particular tone to the ""Ghost World"" comic that I completely missed out on, but this is the most rambling and incoherent script that's been made in quite a while. (Snippets of plot, like the Batman hat or the controversial chicken-art, simply disappear rather than being wrapped together.)You can easily manage to forget all this, however, by admiring the scenery: Steve Buscemi, as well as most of the supporting characters, are quite entertaining.  But it felt like watching the setting for a really good movie...and the good movie never showed up.  Thora Birch's acting?  It seemed like she mastered the don't-make-a-facial-expression schtick in ""American Beauty"" and pushed it into overdrive here - I was unconvinced by her.And finally, the reason why my love for this movie was limited from the beginning is that I DIDN'T LIKE the main characters.  Were we supposed to be charmed by Enid's consistent, unwavering self-centeredness?  Don't get me wrong, I think it can be funny to show a couple of high-school grads driving around and being bitchy to everyone.  With ""Ghost World,"" however, I just wanted them to shut up.  Maybe if, at some point during the movie, they had actually DONE something I would have felt differently.Looks like IMDb's rating is sitting at 8.7 currently.

286,Janeway-4,Bruised People come together....,8,18 September 2001,"Admittedly I think we all need a bit of a respite from the addictive and tremendously heartbreaking media coverage on the recent tragedy. Thus, I recommend Ghost World for some necessary distraction. I am quite familiar with the `comic books' of Daniel Clowes (in quotes because they are intentionally void of superheroes and chock filled with nerds, weirdoes and the like), from which this movie was made. Thora Birch recaptures her form from American Beauty, and the ever-intriguing Buscemi give understated and earnest performances here of disaffected, disconnected and distrustful people different only in how many years they lived. Clowes, I surmise, is knowledgeable in alienation.  I can see him in high school as the shy-mysterious-yet-slightly-dingy-arty-but dangerously close to nerd status-type; the one the girls would like to go out with, but `Like oh my God what would their friends think??!?' Thus, Clowes have given us characters, like Buscemi's Seymour (who makes you want to hug him whilst saying `there, there'), who have been bruised by the world to the point of near surrender. Seymour and Enid's (Birch) relationship is built out of his finely aged bitterness and her meager hopefulness that the whole world isn't neatly packaged in Nikes and Old Navy. Directed with deliberate pacing by Zwigoff (his first crack at helm since the incredible documentary of the comic book writer Robert Crumb), Ghost World moves at it's own pace like it or notsymbolically giving the finger to Hollywood's acceptable formulas. You'll either love it or feel like your locked in your teenager's bedroom. This is no Tara Reid or (enter any ingénue name here) vehicle with a slipshod plot developed solely to ensure boob shots for the Humbert Humberts of the world  Ghost World is a character driven film with actual character growth. Clowes and Zwigoff and the first-rate cast have made a little gem of a film hidden in the bum rush of fool's gold movies this year.",Ghost World

291,spartancus,A treat for the cynical,10,6 February 2002,"At first, I only rented ""Ghost World"" because Steve Buscemi, a longtime favorite, was in the cast. But as I watched the film, I almost couldn't believe the context and dialogue. This is a great, intriguing watch for anyone who has ever felt bitter or cynical about their surroundings. For those who go to parties, only to sit in the corner and snipe at all the ""fake"" people, this movie is for you. Enid (Thora Birch) is the epitome of disallussionment. She just finished high school, but has to take an art class over the summer to graduate. Basically, she has nowhere to go and nothing to do -- mainly because she dislikes everything in the world and wants to just coast through existence. Then she meets Seymour (Buscemi, in a another great role), a pale, wispy vinyl aficionado who has eclectic taste and hates the ""regular world."" The two form a bond over time, and in between all of this drama are some genuinely hilarious moments. When Enid gets a job at the movie theater, she can't disguise her disgust for the job and the testy manager standing over her shoulder. Seymour, on his way to see an old ragtime musician, bursts into a tirade while a mother and her children slowly cross the street. His surprising comments just go to show his deep-rooted disdain for normality; even at the bar, he watches helplessly as sports fans watch a big game during his beloved artist's gig. The title proves appropriate, considering both Enid and Seymour essentially are invisible to the rest of the world. Yet they are dynamic and realistic characters, which gives anyone who feels as is they don't belong in this time some hope.Rating: 10 out of 10.",Ghost World

It was a waste of my time, just as Enid is a waste of space.Enid serves no purpose and she is, by definition, a sociopath. She was a poor student (she's repeating *art* for Pete's sake). She can't hold a job (if it was fun, they wouldn't have to pay you to do it). She's an awful friend, often jerking around her buddy in the film, Rebecca. She's an unusually cruel daughter, often belittling her father who has done nothing negative to her and allows her to do as she pleases. She's a worse step-daughter, completely at odds with the character of Maxine, whose greatest fault was being the pinnacle of normality. She fails utterly at cultivating a relationship with someone who is capable of reciprocating. Enid is also worthless to herself, often sabotaging herself, her relationships, and her place in the world.This film wasn't about 'finding oneself.' It was about the selfish actions of one pathetic girl. Enid values her own individuality above everything. Does the peppy girl who reappears occasionally not have her own individual nature? Is she not also doing exactly what makes her happy? Enid's case is not significantly different than anyone else in the story, nor was it artistically obscure. The difference between Enid and everyone else is that everyone else in the film /makes it work/- and Enid is too lazy and too self destructive to realize that she is not exceptional and actually do something. I don't think this film had anything profound to say about how awful and shallow American culture is.",Ghost World

Thora Birch plays a snobby, chubby poseur who has a crush on Steve Buscemi of all people. I can't even type the plot because I'm pretty sure it's non-existent. I work at a movie rental store and a woman came up to buy this movie on dvd and I asked if she had seen it and she said no.

The movie itself just reeks with ""Wow, what a kewl movie we made"", unfortunately it isn't, stilted dialogue, Thora Birch spanning the emotional gamut between Jan Michael Vincent and being comatose and just sheer boredom do not a good movie make. For some odd reason this movie is billed as a comedy, just not as a funny type of comedy I guess. The fact that this movie is in the IMDb Top 250 boggles my mind, but then again, Eminem, U2, Britney Spears and The Spice Girls are/were extremely popular as well, obviously popularity does not equate to quality.

This film is amazing, so original, so well acted, so different. Go back to your made for cash Hollywood bollocks. Ghost World doesn't give you any easy answers, because there are no easy answers to the problems facing Enid. If a big name director made this, or Terry Zwigoff had to kowtow to a big studio, she would have won the art prize and gone on to be a success, but life is rarely like that. The soundtrack is brilliant, Steve Buscimi has never been more vulnrable, funny, believable and with better lines. To think that this begun in a cartoon. How many successful adaptations from a cartoon can you think of? Batman? Tank Girl? Spiderman? Forget about it. It's a triumph, and one of the few films of recent years that offer an honest account of disillusioned youth without being dull and predictable. This is NOTHING like ""The Breakfast Club"" as someone on this site stated, it has NOTHING to do with glamorising the ""lost"" youth of today, John Hughes wouldn't have gotten this deep, this original, this interesting or this far off his arse to accurately portray a middle class teenager living in the USA.

The movie certainly makes you squirm and think about our current mass culture.  For example, it's display of the downside potential of political correctness -- how easliy one can be misunderstood and branded as racist when handling sensitive material with irony or other intelligent twist -- was brilliantly handled and very painful to view. Also of note, Steve Buscemi's character appears as a cleaner version of R. Crumb, the great cartoonist/artist who director Zwigoff earlier made a successful film on.  His physical appearance, his love of music from the thirties and forties, his awkward and sensitive attraction to the young and buxom Laura Birch character -- this stood out for me as another plus with the film. Not a film for everyone, but clearly worthwhile for those who are used to the off-beat.   8/10.",Ghost World

I saw it on the first day of school that year, so it started me off pumped.  It meant so much to me, and accentuated and made sense of many parts of my life. I cannot explain how close I am to this movie. My best fiend saw it with me too, and we have been a lot closer since then.It was very smartly written, realistic as hell- not necessarily the actions, but the feelings behind the actions taken in this movie.It is basically about this girl named Enid (Thora Birch) who has just graduated high school, and doesn't know where her life is going. She quickly discriminates against others, though I think that most of the time, she is justified.  Enid and her friend Rebecca are spending the whole movie thinking about getting an apartment, but Enid procrastinates. She basically stops caring about anything that will help her in life, and entertains herself by hating everything that she can.  This makes her depressed, and she loves it.  Enid becomes involved with an older jazz/ragtime enthusiast named Seymour (Steve Buscemi) who has issues relating to others. Enid likes/ is intrigued by him, and feels that he can relate to her better than anyone else that she knows in her world. Seymour is her drug. As a drama, Ghost World was great. The first half of the movie, though, was one of the funniest, darkest setups I have ever seen. A lot of sarcastic humor that many would call ______ist, but whatever. It's got some of the best one liners I've ever heard. I will not go on and on about the ending, because other reviewers have overly voiced their 10 line opinions about how it's so good that it's gone past bad and back to good again or really ""sucky and artsy"". About the ending, I will say this- It is not a normal Hollywood ending. That's good. Hollywood is redundant.

305,skmojm,There's just something in this flick that charmed me.,9,15 February 2005,"I'm not the demographic for the Ghost World audience. I'm 58, married, and usually don't connect at all with movies about young people, especially ones that concern their emotional problems. But this movie had me right from the get-go. Enid dancing to the Bollywood musical was simply entrancing. I said to myself that anyone who would seek out this music and respond to it has something on the ball. Thora Birch, as Enid, is constantly seeking a meaning to her life. She is so painfully aware that life in the 21st century in California is empty and sad, that you have to feel for her. Connecting with Seymour, (Steve Buscemi) takes her life in an unexpected direction. When you see the two of them early in their relationship, you realize that these are two peas in a pod. Seymour's weird, awkward life validates Enids's hope that there might just be some people out there who are stranger than she is. But strange in a good way. Watch the scene where Enid, alone at home, plays some of Seymour's old 78 rpm blues records. She is transfixed by their mournful sadness and honesty. At that moment, Seymour has become more than just a goofy friend, but a conduit into exposing her to a whole world that is ignored by the 21st century. This movie is charming and the ending, though unsatisfactory to a lot of people, seemed to me to be totally logical, Enid leaving the real world to find a better one.",Ghost World

Also, there were some things that were supposed to be funny, like Doug, which were in a way but it just didn't hit. I felt this movie played out a lot like the show Daria where you have this pessimistic protagonist who is just too cool for anybody and it just wears so freakin thin. Anyhow, I like Buscemi and his character and some gags were cool but that's it really.

Ghost World is one of my favorite movies of 2001, and probably even of the 2000s.

308,losborne-geo,"You'll either get it or you won't - but if you do, it's just wonderful.",9,6 April 2012,"I first saw Ghost World when it was on limited release in the UK in 2001 - I didn't know much about the film at all before I saw it, but I liked the posters that appeared on the Underground station where I worked at the time, and so I showed up at the cinema expecting a typical teen comedy. What I got was completely unexpected, and nearly eleven years later, I'm still utterly obsessed with this wonderful and pretty much unique film. I saw it four times in the cinema, and have seen it several times since - and every time, it delights me and something new strikes me.It's an adaptation from a Daniel Clowes comic of the same name, and follows school friends Enid and Rebecca as they graduate from high school and attempt to find their way in the world. The comic is a masterpiece of observational dark comedy, and the film adaptation is different in some ways, adding a couple of elements to connect together some rather disjointed aspects of the comic. Enid's art class and the character of Seymour are absent in the comic, but their presence works well in the film and does give it more of a narrative structure, something that is needed with a film.Let me just say that I fell in love with Enid right from the start, even though she isn't a sympathetic character in a lot of ways. She can be snide, sarcastic, rude, inconsistent, unreliable and flaky, and is all these things in various quantities throughout the film. Still, there's something intelligent and independent about her, despite her struggles with alienation, insecurity, depression and loneliness. All the way through the film, she struggles to find something authentic and real in a rather fake and shallow world. Whilst at school, she was close friends with Rebecca, but after they leave, they gradually drift apart, and Rebecca seems content to take a conventional path. Enid's world rather painfully falls apart, which is touching, sad and poignant to watch.Enid and Rebecca are played to perfection by Thora Birch and Scarlett Johannson, but Enid IS this film - Thora's performance is just perfect and she gets everything right. The script is amazing as well. Enid and Rebecca's world is populated by a wonderful selection of freaks and misfits who are all both funny and tragic at the same time, and some of my favourites include the awesomely pretentious art teacher (""mirror, father, mirror""), Doug at the convenience store (""you have to buy me dinner first!"") and Melorra, the girl who desperately tries to befriend Enid and Rebecca but fails dismally.The cinematography is spot-on and the film is bursting with colour, which works really well despite the bleak tone some of it takes. The pace is slow and at times it's hard to feel that much is actually happening, and some people intensely dislike the film for this reason, but if you keep your eyes open, you'll observe a huge amount of fantastic detail in the film, which is all a razor-sharp observation on alienation and the nature of the world we live in. The sets are very convincing and Enid's bedroom in particular is done to perfection, closely resembling the rooms of many of my friends when I was in my teens.You'll either like Enid or hate her, and if you can't sympathise or empathise with her, there's not much in this film for you and you'll be better off elsewhere. It's one of the film's awesome strengths that the characters are so complex - I've always really disliked films where the goodies and baddies are very obvious right from the start, and where everything is neat and tidy. It's left to the viewer to decide who the heroes and villains of the piece are, and that's enough to provoke endless discussion. It's a film that's full of ambiguity, and the end is far from neat and tidy, but that is, I feel, very much what the book and film set out to do - show us that life is often ambiguous, vague and not how we expect it to be. The ending, in particular, diverges enormously from typical teen movies and there's no romantic end where Enid gets her man, and there's no place at college or dream job. In fact, the ending has been the source of constant debate since the film was released, as it could be viewed in a number of ways.(WARNING - SPOILERS) I won't go into too much detail, as you should see the ending for yourself without me giving too much away, but Enid effectively leaves town for an uncertain future. That's the literal interpretation. A commonly-held view is that the ending is a metaphor for suicide, and that Enid kills herself. I don't think this is the view of the author or director, and it's certainly not a view I hold myself, as that would be too awful and ghastly to contemplate. I see the ending as an attempt at a new start, and my own feeling is that there *is* a place in this world for Enid somewhere, and that she's going to find it, after a long struggle. The comic alludes to this more than the film does. However you choose to view it, though, the ending is challenging and can be hard to deal with, but finishes off this clever, funny and thought-provoking film in fine style.Possibly one of the greatest films about adolescence we will ever see.",Ghost World

Sure, there was ""American Beauty"", but she was overshadowed by Kevin Spacey--it wasn't ""her"" film.""Ghost World"" is.  Her character, Enid, is so complex--so richly written AND played--that there is no doubt that you are looking at a real person. Perhaps she' been created through the filter of a couple of writers, a director and an actress, but in 111 minutes of film there isn't a single note that rings wrong for this girl.Enid is a bohemian--wait, no that doesn't work.  Enid is one of those rare people you meet, or maybe that you are, who is just a little bit smarter than everyone else and a little bit outside.  She's not a cool girl, or a nerd, or jock, or even one of those deliberate but ultimately phony rebels you occasionally see, she's the real deal.  She and her almost as smart, slightly prettier, and almost as ""outside"" friend Rebecca (played by Scarlett Johanssson-who you might have seen recently in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"") snark on ALL of those other groups--most especially the ""phonies"".The two girls, however, are just as capable of cutting on the innocent as well as the guilty.  One victim is Seymour (with a career-best performance by Steve Buscemi), a lonely record-collecting guy whose personal ad they spot, and who they decide to set up with a fake date in a diner with a non-existant mysterious blonde, who of course never shows up.  The two girls watch from a nearby booth and continue to revel in Seymour's misfortune when they later follow him home, read his mail, and eventually enter his life directly when they shop at his garage sale.But all is not rosy for the two girls--as they graduate high school, the differences between them seems to show.  Rebecca wants to get on with life--get a job, move into her own apartment, and Enid seems stuck in some head space of her own creation where she can't let go of her essential dissatisfaction with life, and the people who accompany her through it.These differences, along with a growing fascination with Seymour by Enid, set up the bulk of the film.  The problems for Enid is that Seymour is not just the loser dork she assumes--he's a real person who she winds up liking quite a bit.There's a lot more in this film--a growing sense of seperation between the two girls which is more bitter than sweet, a realistic non-Hollywood lesson about the cost of playing with people's feelings, an assortment of highly weird and wonderful music, an art teacher played by Illeana Douglass who fits right into Enid's weird world, a somewhat bizarre and passive relationship between Enid and her father (Bob Balaban), and an ending which stays true to who and what we discover about Enid--more than you could ever hope for.By the way, please ignore the description of this film on the back of the DVD case.  It sucks, and tries to position this film as exactly what it is not.  This is only a ""teen"" movie because teenagers appear in it.",Ghost World
322,mcoia,Ghost World is a spectacular film that is not to be missed.,10,4 April 2011,"I think most would agree when I say that the world has enough high school and coming of age movies and most of the time I ignore them as they really aren't worth watching, but Ghost World stands as a fine example of what a coming of age should be like. Ghost World may seem like your typical coming of age post-high school movie, but it is much more than that. What makes Ghost World stand out is the amazing performances by Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi. Birch plays Enid, a social outsider, who hates the world around her and has a hard time relating to other people. She has one best friend, Rebecca, who she hangs out and makes fun of other people with. It's clear from the start of Ghost World that Enid is not your typical teenager. When Enid's classmate is giving a speech at her high school graduation Enid whispers to Rebecca, ""I liked her so much better when she was an addicted crackhead,"" and they both chuckle to themselves. Though Enid is almost always cynical what makes her so relatable is that she also has a very compassionate side. When at a post-graduation party with her classmates she sees another social outsider and tells Rebecca that they will never see him again and comments on how sad that is. Enid also shows a great compassion for Seymour, played by Buscemi, and says, ""I guess I just can't stand a world where a guy like you can't get a date."" She goes on to form a strong relationship with him and her life will forever change.As mentioned before the performances in this movie make it what it is and that is where the film ultimately succeeds. Thora Birch does a remarkable job making the character Enid her own and whatever she left unfinished as Jane Burnham, from American Beauty, she completes with Enid. As great as Birch is the main standout of the movie is Steve Buscemi. He does a phenomenal job playing Seymour, a lonely man who collects old Blues records, and does a great accompanying Enid as she tries to figure her life out.Ghost World is a colorful film with great pacing and it never misses a beat. It perfectly shows the relationship between Enid and Rebecca and how because they want different things in their lives that their strong friendship will ultimately deteriorate. Another stand out for Ghost World is the soundtrack. The theme song for this movie is quite impressive and adds to somewhat cynical and depressive nature of the Enid and the film itself. The soundtrack is also filled with some great blues track that help set the mood of the film.Ghost World stands as one of my favorite movies of all time because I can relate to Enid and maybe even more so to Rebecca. The movie may some turn off with its cynical take on Enid's personality, but to me seeing her react to the world around her was more often than not hilarious and added to the overall experience of the movie.

324,joby-3,Great,6,1 March 2002,"Ghost World is good, but I was expecting more since it has made almost all of the critics' top ten lists.  Thora Birch was great as the lead, Enid. Her somewhat romantic, somewhat confused, convoluted relationship (like all relationships) with Steve Buscemi's character, Seymour, is portrayed well and with great realism.  Scarlett Johansson as Rebecca, Enid's friend, is a dry, seemingly uninterested teen in search of meaning outside of what her best friend Enid believes is interesting.  At first I thought the acting by Johansson was great, understated, subtle.  Then I watched interviews with her.  She played herself, understated, subtle.  Can't fault someone for that, but its not as impressive.An overlooked performance was handed in by Ileana Douglas as Enid's art teacher.  She was flawless as that teacher who you hated in school but, at the time, seemed so good at what he/she did that you thought you were wrong to hate her/him.However, the true gem in this movie is Buscemi's performance as the vintage vinyl collector, Seymour.  The greatness reminiscent of his performances in Trees Lounge or Living in Oblivion.  I have always liked Buscemi in pretty much anything, but he truly shines in roles larger than his most recent.If you like seeing great acting in movies that explore our coming of age and our infatuation of people who are possibly weirder than you think you are, go see Ghost World.If you want a ""page-turning"" plot and a less cerebral movie, check out something that played at the 30-plex for a while.8 of 10.

Although, now that you have been forwarned, it may still be worth your time to watch it, simply because of its originality.Personally, I think it I might be even worse (better?) off than 'Seymour'. I think I would replace '99%' with '99.9%', so I really enjoyed this movie because it reminds me that I am not alone, that I am not the last man on earth, and there are others who are in disgust as we witness the decline of western civilization, the politically correct hypocrasy, the starbuck and stripmall infestation, the death of traditions and age old wisdoms, the mass recruiting of volunteer consumer slaves. Enid shines so brightly within this masterfully and subtly portrayed environment that I couldn't help feel a sense of hope.

328,rajeck,Not as good as you think it is going to be,5,22 July 2001,"I rushed to this movie as both a fan of 'Crumb' and Buscemi - and was hoping for a funny yet meaningful critique on modern society, much like Crumb's comics and Buscemi's Trees Lounge.  I was somewhat disappointed as the film was both lacking real humor (tho there were a few lines which made me go 'heh') and the critique of our consumerist culture was clouded in a rather dull heard-it-before story of 'girl hangs out with old man and brings him new youth while he helps her grow up.' None of the actors truly shined - tho Buscemi plays an interesting Crumb-like character who is most entertaining when not saying anything and just standing there with a confused smile...  I also felt 'Hollywoodized' by the variety of Enid's costumes - the character seemed as if she kept her inner complexities to herself, yet the costume director apparently felt it necessary to 'spice' up the movie with designer hairstyles and kooky headgear.Every now and then the movie made good Crumb-esque statements - 'I don't understand most people - give them a Big Mac and a pair of Nike's and they're happy' - and the breathtakingly ugly suburbanscapes around strip malls (a la beavis and butthead) - but the film dragged and I couldn't really recommend it unless you are only looking for something which isn't totally boring and doesn't obviously insult your intelligence.",Ghost World

However, this depth comes at the cost of plot; the plot isn't overly fast-paced or suspenseful. Unless you enjoy thinking about a movie as you watch it, this is guaranteed to bore you to tears. It's more subtle than Spielberg, and a lot of people commenting here seem to lack the patience to think hard enough about it, so they mistake its subtlety for vapidity. Many people seem to dislike the ending, but I think the ending is one of the film's main virtues; it is unconventional and thought-provoking.It certainly has its flaws (the main flaw being the slow plot development). Not at all your usual Hollywood movie; it succeeds in ways big Hollywood movies almost always fail and it fails in ways big Hollywood movies usually succeed, and I think this makes it interesting enough to watch.",Ghost World
333,rondamico456,"Fortunately, Didn't Read the Graphic Novel......",8,23 September 2019,"Loved this movie. Many reviewers are saying the graphic novel is better, and they're bemoaning the typical 'hollywood' alterations that apparently were needed to get the film made. But then maybe it wouldn't have been made in the first place. Anyway, Steve Buscemi is terrific, as always. And Thora Birch is a revelation (literally, for me: never saw 'American Beauty'....... thought it was the film version of the Grateful dead album). The hilarious scene involving her short lived career as a movie theater employee is worth the price of admission alone.
There's something vaguely reminiscent of Salinger's 'Catcher in the Rye' about the story. It could almost be described as an updated version of that novel, with two socially awkward, overly judgemental, somewhat nihilistic adolescent females replacing the one socially awkward, overly judgemental, somewhat nihilistic adolescent male. One approving critic called the film ""an engaging account of the raw pain of adolescence....... "". Perhaps Sartre or Nietzsche, or even a lunatic like me, might prefer to simplify the thought: It's an engaging account of the raw pain of existence.",Ghost World

It never ceases to amaze me how people can soil themselves over movies with absolutely no story and not a single redeeming quality.Thora Birch as Enid is the girl who is hot but spends way too much of her time trying to not be hot. Scarlett Johansen as Rebecca makes her typical ""I just ate some bad egg salad"" frown and makes, as in everything else this no talent media creation has made, absolutely no contribution to the film other than pouting. Together, they are the girls in high school nobody liked. Basically, this movie is MTV's ""Daria"" just more smug and self-loathing.

337,RobotFreak,"Pretentious, pointless, and horribly paced.",1,9 July 2002,"*SPOILERS LIE WITHIN*First of all, I did not enjoy Enid's social critique. I fall into the loser category myself, but find it unnecessary to create such perfectly stereotyped one-dimensional characters around Enid for her to be cynical about. Enid and Seymour were in fact the only three- dimensional characters in this movie as Enid's girl companion failed to deliver a well-rounded performance. I enjoyed American Beauty for the story about Kevin Spacey realizing the hopelessness of his marriage and adopting a better lifestyle. However the preachy social commentary by Birch and the boy with the camera failed to strike home. And it is this same commentary in Ghost World, except much more cruel, that fails to create empathy for Enid. So by this point I am watching the movie with two characters with any depth whatsoever and one of them cruel and preachy. The other character, played by Steve Buscemi, was being antagonized throughout the movie and I felt nothing but sympathy for him as Enid used and discarded him. The pacing was lopsided and boring. Nothing will happen for long stretches of time and then everything will quickly happen leading on to another long stretch of irrelevant scenes. I would be willing to overlook this if there were actually some humor in this ""comedy"" but the writers try to provoke laughter with cruel social commentary that I do not fall for. The ending of this movie is reminiscent of the frog scene in Magnolia. The director just ran out of steam in a plot that was already going downhill and decided to tack on an ending that makes no logical sense whatsoever. At least the frog-raining phenomenon really happened in Mexico City, this bus-to-nowhere business is just absurd. What is the point of this movie? The point of this movie is that everyone except gothic independent spirits does not understand the world, and that we are supposed to have empathy for a heartless girl merely because she is a member of a social minority. If you want to see good independent film, go buy an old Coen Brothers flick, or better yet Memento.",Ghost World

But the screenplay is better than any film screenplay in 2001(just in my opinion of course).Ghost world is about teen anguish, not about football players and popular kids, or about uncool kid try to fit in, if you expect a Rocky kind story about unpopular achieve to be popular, go somewhere else, the movie is about the choices we make everyday, about the stupidity of our society today, about kids try to make living in this Ghost World.the plot is not the most important thing in the movie, the character is.

She and Scarlett Johansson remind me of Daria and Jane from the cartoon ""Daria.""  ""Ghost World"" is one of those films that proves how much more effective a story can be without all the sugarcoating popular in Hollywood.

342,richpotts2000,"Fantastic, original and heartwarming movie",9,8 September 2003,"When I first saw the trailer for Ghost World in the cinema, it did not interest me much at all. The story seemed very bland and one dimensional. How wrong I was. It was not till earlier this year I watched it on television, just as something to watch. I realised that the film involves great interesting characters in normal situations, such as the two young girls struggles with socialising and job problems, and Steve Buscemi's character Seymour's problems as a lonely ""geeky"" man.The film mainly revolves around the connection between Enid (Thora Birch) and Seymour (Steve Buscemi). Enid befriends Seymour after playing a trick on him and understands that they share a passion of a particular type of music, and enjoys each others company. Enid helps Seymour to find a partner and explore the modern world he does not understand anymore, while struggling to retain her friendship with best friend Rebecca.Ghost World is an example of great film making by Terry Zwigoff who seems to just suture you into the characters lives and their problems. Accompanied by a sombre score that is very emotional and perfectly done, Ghost World also has moments that will make you laugh. For example the scenes in the shop Josh works at with the strange topless man and the art class scenes with the peculiar teacher and her strange methods.Overall, Ghost World manages to hit every emotional string in a very simple way in a very simple story, with great performances from Thora Birch and the always amazing Steve Buscemi.",Ghost World

Thora Birch was nominated for a golden globe for best actress in a musical or comedy she deserved to win it for this performance. The rest of the cast includes a young Scarlett Johansson,Steve Buscemi and Brad Renfro.

I'm another person who after years of using IMDb without registering, felt compelled to register just so I could express my view of this movie. I cannot believe that this movie was so highly rated by so many people. It really tells me something about the state of the world today.The only bright spot in this movie was Steve Buscemi. I'm always impressed with his work. I would have liked to have seen more development of his character but instead we get an overdose of Enid.To say that Enid was a snotty, conniving, selfish, self-centered bitch would be an understatement. The people that stated that this was a coming of age movie have it all wrong. Enid didn't grow at all in this movie. I can't understand nor can I empathize with a person who hates everyone and tries to get a rise out of other people (the Coon chicken poster) just for fun. The only redeeming factor in this film is that she screws up her own life as much as she screws up her supposed friends' lives. If she did commit suicide at the end, the ghost world (which doesn't look like it can be anywhere like others have stated... it looks like L.A. to me) is a better place without her. We definitely know that the other people in her life would have been better off without her.Don't waste your time with this movie... it may intrigue you at first, but there is no redeeming quality to it.

A rare case of a movie that is more than the sum of its parts. I'm sure many may pigeon hole it as just another teen comedy, but the script is superbly written, and It took me by surprise the amount of laugh out loud moments. Particularly Steve Buscemi's yard sale where Thora Birch is after obscure records, and the two girls have such a cynical and subtle way of making fun of people, very irreverent style they have which obviously is masking insecurity about the real world dawning on them after high school. The relationship/friendship between Thora Birch and Steve Buscemi is compelling in that they share a sense of not fitting in despite there being at different points in life age wise. He inspires her for an art project, and what follows is more hilarity over her controversial piece which picks apart a lot of the subjectiveness surrounding the value of art. So many rip roaringingly funny moments juxtaposed with a serious message about growing up in the real world. Thora Birch's dad also chips in with very funny moments. The cinematography particularly as the film closes is mesmeric, with stand out urban nightime shots. The level of detail means this film can be viewed multiple times.

Seymour is an older man, pathetically resigned to the fact that The Way Things Ought To Be soon turns to The Way Things Will Be, Whether You Like It Or Not, though still young enough to remember when enid's dissention was his own. watching these two characters find each other and connect despite themselves is a touching experience, and a captivating one, both idealistic enough to elevate the story but realistic enough to add a crucial poignancy.quite simply, i loved this movie and am going to see it again as soon as possible (which, due to its limited release, may not be as easy as i'd like). too often, films that i admire feature stories that i cannot rightly say i enjoyed (see, most recently, american beauty, fight club or magnolia). despite ghost world's perpetual melancholia, it was still a story that left you - or me, at least - feeling better at its end than at its beginning. it is a film you can admire and enjoy, two hours worth of joy enough to match the minute of flying plastic bag communion in american beauty. simply, it is a stunner, a film without peer from during the past twelve months.",Ghost World

Unfortunately, her terrific wardrobe is the only real attempt to explain her emotions:  it's one costume change after another.  Other than the clothes, there's no attempt to explain much about her except that she's bored.  There's no there, there, which is probably the point, but...so what. If the main character watched this movie, she'd walk out or at least mock it.SPOILER:And for a movie that people rave as different and unconventional, what a cop-out of an ending!  Into the sunset?

Little wonder Peter Travers of Rolling Stone prefers it to ""The Graduate"", a film long heralded as a treasure of the movie industry. ""Ghost World"" has the feel of a charming independent film, but explores the almost-cliched topic of disturbed adolescence. ""Ghost World"", however, is far from cliched; it's an insightful, brilliant, at times downright disturbing, look at the mundane world of suburban adolescence. Malls and ""teenspeak"" abound, but this is no ""Clueless"" (even though ""Clueless"" is the best teen comedy ever made). Thora Birch and Scarlett Johannsen are possibly the best actors of their generation, and treat their characters as the deep, complex people they were written as. Steve Buschemi makes full use of his strange, caracature-like features to portray the male adult version of Thora Birch's character.

Enids befriending the lonely Seymour(Steve Buscemi) causes some conflict in her relationship with Rebecca, sending Enid down a spiral of confusion and disconsolation as she tries to mend everything but only seems to fail even worse.Great selection of cast, really good musical choices.

At first I was disappointed that the film - which Dan Clowes also wrote - downplayed the close though slowly decaying friendship between enid and rebecca that the comic version had at it's center in favor of the equally desperate relationship between enid and seymour.  Thinking back I find that this change maybe what helps give the film a distinction all of it's own.  All of the art school jokes are poignant and very funny, and Thora Birch does great justice to her character.  Her performance is so sharp and tempered it should make the entire new school of hollywood cower in their 90210 via john hughes shoes.  Most teen movies in their drive for marketability tend to sentimentalize, oversex and gloss-over adolecence so much that they ignore a lot of the confusion and sadness that comes with growing up in an alienating and often times grotesque world.  Ghostworld not only manages to portray this but it does so in great detail and with much humor.   If this is the film's success, it is owed to the tremendous accoplishment of Clowes' original comic.  Do not miss out on reading it.",Ghost World

I adore quirky, different kinds of movies from the norm. One of my favourites being the French film..Amelie. It is one of the best I have ever seen. Random, quick-witted humour always sits well with me. Miss Engid has a way of showing so much emotion with just a flash of eyes. There is so much to her! Kind of like in American Beauty where she can say so much, without saying much at all. I really like her better in this..she shows remorse for poor Seymour, and wants to make things right for him. Maybe he grew up a little, maybe not. But I am sure that no matter which it may be..he has learned a lot!",Ghost World

361,BillThrill,A Masterpiece,8,28 October 2002,"The gift of Ghost World is the range and intensity of the emotional palette it presents, similar in this way to Life is Beautiful or The Godfather, although not within such a grandiose framework.This movie is about Enid's struggle to figure out who she is.  She thought she knew, because she had her friend Rebecca as a frame of reference.  But after graduating, Enid notices (with intense awareness) that they are slowly beginning to gradually drift apart.  Enid becomes increasingly afraid that Rebecca is growing up to ultimately become another lifeless thoughtless automaton among the ""99% of humanity"".  This hammers away at Enid's confidence in her definition of who she is, and she lashes out trying desperately to figure it all out again.  But this struggle causes everything in her life to fall apart around her, and all of her options to vanish, and she finds herself completely alone, at rock bottom.   She envies the old man's belief that he will catch a bus to take him out of town.  She desperately wants to believe it too, but she knows that no bus will ever come.  Enid's reaction to the old man's death is addressed in the final scene with a compelling denouement.The only detraction I see is the original score; the composer (David Kitay) could have done the music with a little more precision, specifically the piano theme just fails, by reason of either lack of effort or perhaps some technical limitations on his part.In order to get the most out of this film, you have to be willing to concentrate on it, not just watch it; repeated viewings are worthwhile. That being said I recommend this movie only to intelligent, thoughtful people who are capable of distinguishing emotional nuances within a work of fine art.  The remainder will be in danger of watching a movie with no plot that doesn't go anywhere.8/10 for a masterpiece.",Ghost World

She happens to be my daughter, as well.  Together with some family members, we went to see the movie's debut recently.  Obviously, our opinion here would be biased.However, the reaction of the audience in the theater was surprisingly good (I'd say 9 out of 10 applauded and cheered vigorously, when the movie was over).  I'm not sure if most of these people had the same personal interest in ""Ghost World"", as we did.  They could have had ties to movie's cast or production people.  Yet, the applause seemed to be genuinely sincere for the movie itself.  I likened the affinity to to ""Ghost World"" be similar to the love of the classic 1980's era movie, ""The Breakfast Club"".  If this type of response is common at other showings in other theaters, then I'd say the movie is definitely a unanimous winner.  I'll just have to go see it again, to see if it elicits the same response.A few friends of mine, have also gone to see the film.  They've e-mailed me to announce that they enjoyed the movie very much, although they offered no further comments.Yet, apart from our own personal involvement in the movie, as a band, and as a father-daughter vocalist duo, we all agreed that the production, casting, direction, story, acting, etc., were very, very good.  Our interest never wavered from scene to scene.  You also have to pay attention to the many underlying messages and meanings, those that are somewhat obvious and those are are subtle.The story itself can indirectly make one become very introspective about one's own choices in life.  I like movies that cause me to think about life appreciation, meaningful relationships, and how some young people view life today, in contrast to the youthful days and ways of adults like myself (who foolishly think that we are finally mature, at last).Trying to understand the meaning of life and our role within it, is a never ending process for some people.  Others go through life without any kind of a clue as to what life is all about.  ""Ghost World"" offers that kind of insight, while also being heart warming and funny at times.I'm surprised that ""Ghost World"" is only showing at a few limited venues. The title itself, is a bit deceiving to the story line.  However, the trade magazine and newspaper reviews are wonderful, and I do recommend the movie as good entertainment for all ages.Ernie Hernandez",Ghost World

370,Moshmeister,"Relatable, Realised and an insight into growing up",10,5 January 2002,"Ghost World is definitely one of those films that you either get or you don't. I told a friend of mine that if he didn't like this film, I don't think I could be his friend any longer. Thats how strongly I personally relate to this story of alienation and growing into an adult world that is both frightening and overwhelming.The main character, Enid, and her best friend Rebecca have just graduated high school and have to start fishing around for jobs in order to get their own apartment and live their high school dream. Whilst Rebecca has no trouble settling down quickly, Enid is far more cynical of the real world and spends the film trying to reach out to what this world has to offer her. She meets Seymour (played fantastically by Steve Buscemi), a loner and a loser, who she immediatly clicks with. As she says ""he's the opposite of everything I hate"".The film is very funny, but the main strength is the heart running through the film. If you are like me and you feel mainstream society doesn't quite cut it, you'll get Enid straight away. To my friend (who hated the film), he said she was a bitch and irrationally hated things. But he perhaps failed to understand why someone could have this cynicism, it is deep rooted in the way one grows up and how the world accepts you. Everything about Enid is way off mainstream: her clothes, tastes in music, tastes in men and so on. You can she why she has trouble fitting in to society.Theres something magical about this film, you really feel for the characters. Seymour is sad, lonely and lost in his own world, but he knows it, admits is freely and thrives on it. The honesty portrayed by the characters in the film is wonderful, you really feel as if you're peeping through the keyhole of these character's lives.I would definitely compare this film to American Beauty (not just because Thora Birch is in both!) in that it is a realistic portrayal of life in America, and whilst showing the faults of the characters, both films do not pity them but celebrate their flaws.See this film.

It constantly took digs at the world of the arts, and yet it is only this world that will appreciate this style of film. I expect good reviews, as to give something like this a poor one would probably be considered uncultured in such circles. When it ended, or didn't as the case pretty much was (the pseudo ending 5 minute shorter would have been better), I was glad, solely as it was over.",Ghost World
372,jackbritboy,"a really really deep, intriguing and subtly",10,27 July 2007,"*CONTAIN SPOILERS*I think there are three central themes portrayed in the movie or at least three are what I discover so far: DEATH, AUTHENCITY, and IDENTITY. Death here certainly is a figurative death, the death of passion, of real authenticity, the death of life in such a busy, conventional, conformed, sexual (the adult shop, the trivial question) and fearful society which is filled with blinded, dead people who choose not to be alive. The scene of the coffee shop where Becky (Scarlett Johansson) works shows us a lot. The guy in the wheelchair who later is revealed by Becky that he does so only because he is lazy and who answers the trivial question about an organ, which is ""slightly above the uterus on the female,"" to get a free coffee, and a woman who orders the coffee and cuts off Becky's talk to her by starting with the word ""NO"" both show us how cold, unfriendly and dead the world is. Everybody is so busy and so caught up with their lives and jobs and personal issues that they just don't care for each other. There are only three people who are alive in the movie but are considered as boring, weird, or even dead people by the society: Enid, Seymour, and the old man waiting for the ""canceled"" bus. If you look closely the scene in which Enid and Becky talk to the old man, you will notice that the old man blocks out part of the phrase ""not in service"", making it look like ""NOTICE""; and near the left upper corner of the chair there is a word ""LIFE""; both of them making ""NOTICE LIFE."" At the end, Enid, in the red dress, stands right in that position, making the terms appear the same way, ""NOTICE LIFE."" Seemingly, only Enid, Seymour and the old man, despite what others may say, can see and live their lives honestly when others fall into conformity and the certain lifestyles that the society designs for them. Then, at the end, the empty bus serves as the metaphor of the gateway for those people like the old man and Enid to escape to the world they belong rather than living in such a dead world full of ghosts. However, the movie also gives you a second option, which Seymour chooses, is to stay and try to adjust in the dead, structural world. He comes back with his mother and sees the physiologist. That's what you ARE SUPPOSED TO DO when you are old and do not have a wife/ girlfriend. You have problems. Go to your mother or see the doctor. Enid is brave. She chooses to follow the wise old man, leaving this world and finding her belonging world. The idea of waiting for the bus is also nice. Mostly in life we are so busy going out and looking for something that we really need or want and we can never see it (Enid and Becky's games of following people, and trying to look for something); maybe sometimes, we should just sit down, relax, and then it will come to us. The movie starts off when the girls graduate high school. This is a good start because after high school, people must find for themselves new identities, deserting their old identities/ lifestyles which were found in high school. Becky stands for all those people. She tries to conform herself. She finds a job, an apartment. She tries to follow the rules at her job (this is just speculation since she is not fired constantly like Enid is) and to fit in. In the coffee shop scene, she tells Enid that ""you'll get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos"" and Enid responses that ""but those are our people"" and then Becky acts like she is uncomfortable or upset with that idea. Or when they talk about the neighborhood, Enid says: ""This is such a weird neighborhood,"" and Becky replies: ""This is a totally NORMAL, average neighborhood""; Becky no longer sees what Enid sees anymore because they are both so different now. Becky already adapts herself to the dead world; then both of the girls feel alienated from each other. Lastly, the authenticity smeared by the modern world is also the central theme in the movie. The thing that separates Enid from everyone is her sense of authenticity. She hates the obnoxiousness, the phoniness of the people around her who try to conform. When she dyes her hair, she is trying to find back the old true ""1977 original punk rock look,"" ""not modern punk"" and Becky, who is already changed, does not ""get it either"" like the rest of other people in the shop. Theme about authenticity is also portrayed in the fake ""authentic fifties diner"" Wowsville or in the bar in which Seymour and Enid are. The lady Seymour talks to says that if he wants to listen authentic blues, he should listen to Blue Hammers; or the rock band on stage say that they is going to play some authentic blue that ""is gonna ROCK your world."" Or the thing about the poster to show how the society essentially haven't changed that much. ""People still hate each other but they hide better."" There are also many other interesting things in the movie such as Enid is mostly in RED clothes all the time. Red represents for fire, energy, passion, or blood which is vital for life. Again, Enid is the one who is figuratively alive in the movie. Or, ""Seymour"" sounds like ""sees more"". So Seymour definitely ""sees more"" of the world and himself than Enid does. Or the old, ragged jean on the pavement, or the art class, etc. After all, this is a great movie if you choose to invest your brain energy to it. In fact, all the good movies require thinking and analyzing. GREAT MOVIE!!!",Ghost World
373,sindri611,A Touching View of Humanity,10,1 March 2002,"Ghost World is a touching view of the world and the people in it. The storyline, besides being extremely relevant to today's culture, is excellently crafted. It developed the main characters well, without forcing personalities through contrived scenes. As a result, the movie flowed perfectly and without interruption, portraying the utter mess of suburbia through the deadpan criticisms of the two main characters. What struck me was that the main characters are more anti-heroic than anything else and that despite trying to distance themselves from the ordinary, they are very much ordinary, and worse in some ways, at the beginning. The characters develop not in substance, but in realization as the movie progresses.My favorite part of the filmmaking was the director's ability to adroitly portray awkwardness, and what a huge part of our culture this awkwardness is.A+.

375,60tring,Dull if slightly quirky coming age drama,4,9 May 2003,"Ghost World doesn't actually start with the phrase 'our lives would never be the same after that summer' but it might as well. The film follows Enid & Rebecca in the summer after graduation in a small American town, as you might expect they get dull jobs and have troubles with relationships & parents. Enid is artistic & slightly nerdy, Rebecca more ready to embrace a 'mainstream' existence and surprise surprise this puts strains on their relationship.So far so predictable and for the most part it is. We have been here hundreds of times before and the average episode of Buffy The Vampire Slayer has more to say about teenage angst than Ghost World has in a very long 107 minutes (the longer it went on the more my finger was hovering over the fast forward button). One particular failing is that the film lacks any sense of the fun of being that age - yes it can be difficult but it is also joyous. Enid is particularly annoying in this respect with her 'I'm too good for this world' attitude, and Birch apparently sleepwalking through many of the scenes doesn't help.Good points well Steve Buscemi is as ever excellent until the extremely dodgy plotting in the final third undermines his character completely and there is some good support work from Illeana Douglas as the Art teacher & Tom McGowan (Kenny from Frasier) as Buscemis roommate.Don't expect too much - especially in the way of humour, and it is probably OK, but if this is the best film of 2001 I'm glad I didn't go to the cinema much that year.",Ghost World

I found the movie to be both humorous but also moving and always thought provoking. Its atmospheric setting of a 'normal' American town had the perfect ambiance to portray the 'ghost world' of Enid and Rebecca. i found myself transported into Enid's inner psyche as the film progressed, thus i felt a strong disappointment in Rebecca's acceptance to join the rat race and an unexplicable affection and intrigue towards Seymour. Ultimately i came away from the film wondering to myself, 'who exactly were the weirdos?'.

It just kept going on and on about nothing.  I personally thought that the plot was terrible, partially because there wasn't much of one. Yeah, I know, ""its a coming of age story"" blah blah blah.  Well, I went through that not long ago, and hating everything in sight (like Enid did) doesn't help matters at all.  She simply hated people because they were so easily stereotyped..... people are only able to be stereotyped if you're a stereotypical person.  I guess the main reason I dislike this movie was because it dragged so much and that I just can't agree with the main character's view on life.  Hate and stereotyping will only get you a one way ticket to unhappiness.  But the movie did have Steve in it, and I do love Steve.

Also, I've read the original comic, that the film is based on, months before seeing the movie, so I was actually surprised how much I liked the movie. Ghost World the Comic (in my humble opinion) is one of the most overrated graphic novels of our times. It was nice, but nothing so special. So when the movie turned out good, I was very pleasantly surprised.Some elements of the original comics plot were altered for the movie version, which I don't actually mind, because Dan Clowes was one of the screenwriters and was at charge (at least to some extent) in bringing his own comic to the big screen. One of the changes, that I didn't like, was the ending.

It is not a typical Hollywood movie with a major problem, the solution and the happy ending. Thora Birch(Enid) and Scarlett Johannson(Rebecca) play best friends who have just graduated from high school. Neither is opting for college. I found this refreshing. It seems to me these two are very typical in that they have no direction in life - but unlike every other kid they do not opt for college.Enid, a talented artist, is extremely cynical, unmotivated and pessimistic, Rebecca is slightly more positive and has motivation -that is to get her own apartment. They play a mean spirited joke on Steve Buschemi's character, Seymour. Enid though ends up forming a strong bond to him and much of the film focuses on their relationship. They are definitely outcasts or at least see themselves in that way each possessing a bit of self loathing.The friendship Enid forms with Seymour forces a bit of a wedge between her and Rebecca's relationship. They begin to drift apart. Very typical of life. Something always seems to come between best friends and things are never the same. People change.There is no real climax to this movie and it is a bit depressing - but still so real. You truly feel the how lost and alone Enid feels in the world.

I found the script not very believable: the dialogue was not funny and cutesy where it was meant to be. The girls just annoyed me.The art teacher was predictable. On the whole, I found the friends rude and didn't know how the audience was supposed to like them and side with them when they ridiculed strangers. I didn't realize Scarlett Johansson is such a ""blah"" actress..Meaning, she just doesn't have any emotion in her. I was ready for the movie to be over in the last 30 mins.",Ghost World
390,rluebben3,ghost world,7,29 January 2013,"Direction. Zwigoff does a good job of not getting in the way of the story. He pulls the stylizing back, and focuses on a relatively straight forward plot. Writing. The writing has a natural quality and doesn't seem like they're just putting cliché after cliché together. It's not quite art house and not mainstream, the script it somewhere in between. Whatever you may call it it's satisfying either way. Cinematography. Not much to say here, for the camera work and lighting were fair. Intentionally so, for it doesn't seem that they were interested in a lot of gimmicks. Acting. Buscemi makes good use of the material and even though none of the characters are overly complex, they're also not simplistic. Birch follows the path of her ""American Beauty"" character a bit but I liked her performance here none the less. I always enjoy Scarlett Johansson, even when her character and performance are just OK. Music. The music is fair but nothing that stands out. Overall, this is better than you average Hollywood fluff.",Ghost World
391,lewlevine,It's all happening in Seymour's mind!,8,24 September 2012,"After having read several reviews of this movie I cannot understand why no one mentions the ending. Seymour is at his psychiatrist's office and his mother is picking him up there. As the psychiatrist turns away and closes the door she has an OMG look on her face.This entire movie takes place in Seymour's mind, it's all a fantasy. His character is a total loser yet a teenage girl takes him on as her project. She eventually falls for him and they wind up having sex. She fills her book with drawings of him. Really!?!Seymour runs an ad in the newspaper hoping an attractive woman he made eye contact with responds. She actually does respond, and she's not just attractive physically but she is also a successful professional woman. Oh, and she also cannot wait to have sex with Seymour and start a relationship with him. Happens everyday! The movie is not about Enid or Rebecca, its about Seymour's fantasy world.",Ghost World
392,blue_stripy_moose,love it.,10,22 September 2005,"'Ghost World' is a fantastic film. It is hilarious at times,intelligent, thought-provoking, fascinating, honest and wonderful. Both protagonist characters Enid and Rebecca are brilliantly played by Thora Birch and Scarlett Johansson.The sound track is very eclectic, from bollywood to early jazz, it's all great. It deserves a blatant : 10/10.I urge anybody who has not seen this film to rent or buy it as soon as possible!",Ghost World
393,lucretia7777,That sexy green cardigan!,10,18 April 2005,"Every neural synapse throbs unabashedly with the sheer, brainy sex appeal of Steve Buscemi (one of the most underrated character actors/sex symbols of recent times) in this flick. Finally! Steve Buscemi gets some action!How long have all of us fellow sexy geeks waited for this? ""Wear that sexy green cardigan"" PLEASE!How is he not the studly leading man of every quit Indie film!?!?Those insightful froggy eyes, the chinless, toothy, greasy-haired nonchalant awkwardness masking a sexuality rivaled only by the divinely promiscuous Greco-Roman gods...Is it just me, or could you watch him drink malted milk eternally, and equate it with your visage of Heaven?",Ghost World
394,TheRepeatViewer,"{Deadpan} ""Yeah. We graduated high school. How... totally... amazing.""",8,4 March 2005,"Ghost World is a film that follows the misadventures of two young women, Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson), as they navigate that rocky terrain between high school and adulthood. The movie begins with Enid and Rebecca's graduation. With this newfound freedom their sole goal is to share an apartment. Enid gets sidetracked from this journey when she stumbles upon Seymour (Steve Buscemi), an older, eccentric, record collector. Enid and Rebecca meet him after answering a personal he left in a newspaper. Seymour begins as nothing more than a playful diversion for their cruel humor, but the more Enid learns of him, the more intrigued she becomes. She finds a certain kinship in Seymour through his trials, tribulations, and general disconnection with humanity. As Enid befriends him, she and Rebecca gradually drift apart as their disparate goals and outlooks begin to manifest.Ghost World is an important movie because it attempts to portray what so many so-called teen movies fail to. It shows the intangible complexities of finding direction and meaning in life when all the experiences that lead up to that moment of possibility are devoid of either. During high school, Rebecca and Enid, though cynical and disconnected from their peers, were sheltered from the tough choices and common struggles of adulthood. Now that school's over, they're each responsible for their own lives. This realization is something that Enid, in particular, struggles with as she watches everyone around her find their place while she clings stubbornly to her adolescent wanderings.The movie focuses on offbeat characters that have no clear place in the world. They fall between the cracks of social acceptability. The story's backdrop is in a town being whitewashed over by encroaching franchises and ceaseless development. The town is losing its character and becoming indistinguishable from any other. Perhaps this motif underscores the struggles of Enid, Rebecca, and Seymour; because it is this very artificiality that alienates them, and therein lays the rub. Rebecca and Enid seek a place in a world they had always eschewed. Rebecca gains direction but losses the offbeat, rebelliousness that made her and Enid so close. Enid clings to her views, and by trying to understand and help Seymour, Enid is trying to validate her own individuality. Seymour is a lonely, isolated figure who is increasingly marginalized from society. Furthermore, Seymour provides Enid with the kinship she's lost with Rebecca, and that she might not find elsewhere. He is essentially a ghost in the contemporary world who clings to the fragments of a culture that is quickly fading. Enid is aware of the uncomfortable parallels between her and Seymour. By the end of the story, Enid alone must decide what to do with her life. After watching this movie again, I feel that the choice Enid makes is the only one she could've taken.Ghost World is funny, exaggerated, caustic, insightful, and understated. Some of these qualities may seem contradictory but they serve the themes of the story well. Most striking of all is the realism shown through its portrayal of the main characters and the manner in which their problems are resolved. Ghost World is a dramedy that deals with a little-talked-about stage of life which makes it hard to easily classify and lends the film to repeat viewings. This intangibility is also what makes the movie so rewarding. Ghost World will most likely appeal only to a select few; but to those who do connect to it, this film, like a good song, is one that will have to be revisited more than once.",Ghost World
395,Bihotza_Printzesa,One of my favorite movies,10,22 August 2015,"I'm not that good at expressing my thoughts into words but this movie is simply amazing. It's vastly underrated and it stars two amazing actresses. Thora Birch, from American Beauty, my all time favorite movie and Scarlett Johansson from Lost in Translation, my second favorite movie.If you haven't seen this movie, go out, see it. It's so worth it. It's about making your way through life after high school, finding yourself, the feeling of not fitting in. Something we've all been through. It really expresses the feelings of every teenager who's ever been depressed.",Ghost World
396,medfirth-61729,Ghost world is clever,8,9 July 2017,"Dreamed up by Daniel Clowes (writer of comic series; eightball), Ghost world is a live action film that feels closer to the world of comic books.Ghost world is (almost) a 'comic-book' movie unlike most others, especially when we see it in the same category as Sin City or The Marvel/DC Films. Zwigoff kept the film as close to the roots of the comic genre as was possible - keeping the world mundane and unexciting, mirroring that of the perspective of the protagonist. It seems to this reviewer that only one other piece of media comes kind of close, and that's the MTV series; Daria.But unlike other comic book movies, or even films within the genre, Ghost world isn't shy when it comes to thinking you're a grown up. Adult themes are used in exposition that is befitting of the characters and the source material - lending this film a classification of M15+ in the UK and US. To the very end, the cynicism",Ghost World
397,StallisChick,It's like bubblegum...,7,4 August 2005,"This movie is like that tasty pina-colada flavored bubblegum that nobody ever buys. Tempting as it may seem in it's shrink rap, once unwrapped and chewed on, it loses all it's flavor by half-time, becoming suddenly gooey, sticking to your fillings. Look, I CAN'T even call this movie pretentious, which was a fine excuse not to like Thora Birch's ""American Beauty"", or Scarlett Johannson's ""Lost in Translation"". In fact, despite my better judgment, I liked this movie, for the most part. Reviews become pitiful and self aggrandizing when the author writes ""I"" and ""ME"" all the time, but I felt a kind of misfit female kinship with the two main chars. And it's not for not trying- I tried to really like this movie, on those grounds alone, but could not. There's no satisfaction. I'm just as turned off by these romantic comedies that keep being made and remade, but quirkiness alone does not a fine film make. I'll stick to DoubleMint, and watch ""Wayne's World"" again.",Ghost World
398,EternityInterface,The pain which is being a spoiled brat.,6,24 November 2005,"OK, even if everything the chicks said could be turned into inspirational quotations (ala Tyler Durden), their god-damn monotonous voices would ruin it. The dark-haired chick reminds me a lot of my sister, who, you see, had different voices for different occasions. And she could switch between them in seconds... really scary stuff. But the kinda voices the girls have just scream of pretentiousness. It also happens to be the ""tragedy"" befalling the dark-haired chick is kinda hard to grasp when she doesn't have abusive parents - and isn't getting a job. Still, one might feel for the tragedy which is not having a real mother, if not for it being EMPHASIZED that she really doesn't wanna get a job (she's given opportunity after opportunity - and like the conceited teen she is, they are directly rejected - which she then later on, to up the tragedy-factor, tries to get back and fail).Woo, anger! Still, the geek collector guy is cool, and the chicks DO say memorable stuff.American Beauty has been described as a Fight Club lite, well, Ghost World is an American Beauty lite. So with all its shortcomings I can't condemn other reviews of the film - I can understand if you that turn it off halfway, or get angry you ever wasted a minute on it, or even throw popcorn at the screen. My suggestion would be to see the 2 other movies mentioned, and when you get tired of them, maybe give Ghost World a chance.Now then, we should figure out the ever-important scoring.* Expressed emotion: null, annoying. (-3 points) * The pain of being a geek: awesome. (5 points) * Social commentary: good. (3 points) * Title: cool, about the most quotable part... (1 point) * Music: I don't even remember it, so it couldn't have been that painful... or obviously - memorable. (0 points)0 + 1 - 3 + 3 + 5 = 6 (Yes, it can get above 10, that's for cult classics and the like. I would estimate the average film rating being 3)",Ghost World
399,thelevonhelm,"Angst, angst and more angst!!!",1,8 February 2007,"This is the most boring, stupid and pointless flick ever. EVER. What went through the directors mind!?! I don't know, don't even think he knows. To have Scarlettan cast and not put her to better use, to embarrass poor Mr Buscemi in such a way! Hello!?! And the fat girl with the black hair, who is she and what is she doing there? I bet the only ones to like this movie is strange, indiepop, teenage girls with none whatsoever experience of the real world in all its beauty. I saw this thing with a friend of mine and after about ten minutes I wanted to punch him in the face. I was twitching like a heroin-addict without his heroin. FOR GODS SAKE DO NOT MAKE MOVIES LIKE THIS. THEY ARE NOT GOOD. THEY ARE NOT ""COOL"". AND THEY DO NOT TELL ANYONE ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING!!! Do not see this movie. Watch Monty Python instead. They are funny.",Ghost World
