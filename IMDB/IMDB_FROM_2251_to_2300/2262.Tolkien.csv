0,Leofwine_draca,Typical,5,15 October 2020,"TOLKIEN is a typical biopic of the kind that's familiar from the outset. Drama is added to the otherwise sedate story of the scholar turned world-famous fantasy author by playing up and focusing on Tolkien's brief time in the trenches in WW1, an experience he would have shared with millions of other young men of the period. These scenes are well handled, but the rest is perfectly ordinary, from the moments of tragedy and loss to the sensitive romance and upper-class upbringing which most of us will have no familiarity of whatsoever. Nicholas Hoult has always been an engaging actor but he can do little with his role in this one, and the same can be said of the rest of the cast. Like most other recent biopics of the last five years, I'd much rather read a biography.",Tolkien
1,SnoopyStyle,interesting bits of a life,5,29 November 2019,"This is a biopic of famed fantasy writer J.R.R. Tolkien (Nicholas Hoult). He becomes an orphan at an early age. He forms a fellowship with three other boys. He falls for fellow ward Edith Bratt (Lily Collins) who would become his wife and muse for his writing. He faces the devastation of the WWI trenches. These are interesting bits of a man's life. The problem is that there is no overarching drama to his life. The obvious cinematic move is to make every character and every incident in his life as literary inspirations for his iconic books. It alludes to that but only sparingly. Without that, this movie struggles to connect the interesting bits into a dramatic narrative.",Tolkien
2,Hitchcoc,The Writer: His Soul and HIs Work,9,24 May 2019,"This is a film which is steeped in British reserve. J. R. R. Tolkien had the roots of fantasy in his blood, put forth by his mother who dies when he is young. She was the master storyteller, so ingrained in his psyche. There were dragons and supernatural beings, some from opera, some from folklore. But the movie is about his efforts to be true to himself and follow the path laid out for him. He wanted to be at Oxford, but his social status made him quite vulnerable. It was his creativity and linguistic skills that bought him a reprieve. We forget that historically, he is not just a popular author but an academic genius, one of history's greatest linguists. This is a gentle movie but it is punctuated with flashback while he fought in the Somme, one of the bloodiest incidents in the history of warfare. This is a very good film.",Tolkien
3,boblipton,Where We Knew It Would End,5,10 November 2021,"Nicholas Hoult plays an adult J. R. R. Tolkien, Harry Glby Tolkien as a child. It largely moves between his days in public school, where he made lifelong friends, his time in college, and on the battlefield in the Great War.The editing, which cuts between the three times, helps keep things interesting, as does a fine cast, including Lily Collins, Colm Meaney, and a five-minute turn by Derek Jacobi that turns the movie into something more than a cleverly-edited piece that ends up where we knew where it all would. This movie is intended to appeal to those who are captivated by Tolkien's work, and so know something about his life. Although there are some striking images, it adds nothing to what is already understood.",Tolkien
4,nogodnomasters,"It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door.",10,7 August 2019,"This is a biopic of J.R.R. Tolkien ( Nicholas Hoult ). It ends in 1937 when he starts to pen the Hobbit. It begins with his time in the trenches of WWI using his flashbacks to maintain sanity. It is a story of love and imagination. Of Sadness and the Horrors of war. We get to see how his life was shaped and ideas were formed with the two biggest influences on his life being his mother (Laura Donnelly) and wife (Mimi Keene). Not an action film, but a slow drama.What I liked about this film is I was spared exposure to C.S. Lewis.",Tolkien
5,classicsoncall,"""I let myself believe that there were happy endings for people like us.""",8,28 October 2019,"I'm always leery of movie biopics because of what they add and what they leave out. I don't know much about J.R.R. Tolkien's real life, so if this one accurately recounts his early, formative years, then it was quite well done. Particularly effective are the film's references to familiar aspects of Tolkien's work as exemplified by 'The Hobbit' and 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. Many of those are recreated as Tolkien's fever dreams suffered in the trenches of The Somme during World War I. Even before seeing this picture, I have always been amazed by Tolkien's vast grasp of 'invented' languages, i.e., the lyric poetry and dialog that he created for the elven characters in his novels. His mind worked on so many different levels that it seems almost incomprehensible. The story here identifies in some ways the manner in which he developed that style, supported to a large degree by his mentor, Professor Wright (Derek Jacobi) at Oxford, along with his future wife Edith Bratt (Lily Collins). Much of his writing was also influenced by the fellowship of his school chums, forming their own secret society going by the T.C.B.S. - the Tea Club and Borrovian Society. Lest anyone miss the significance of the soldier Sam who successfully nursed Tolkien through his ordeal in the wartime trenches, it appears he was honored in The Trilogy by the presence of Frodo Baggins' loyal sidekick Sam Gamgee. Just one of the many references one will pick up by watching this effective treatment of J.R.R. Tolkien's early years.",Tolkien
6,CinemaSerf,Gently engaging,7,25 November 2019,"This is a well-written, gentle telling of the early life of JRR Tolkien; his relationships, studies and terrifying experiences in the First World War. Hoult plays the role sensitively and convincingly. Colm Meaney, Sir Derek Jacobi and Lily Collins all support ably. The subtle detailing of the scenes from the war are told using light and sound rather than blood and gore - and prove surprisingly effective. Insofar as there are any attempts to draw comparisons between his life and any of the Middle Earth concepts; this doesn't really address any of that and that can leave the narrative a little lacking but it's a good looking piece of cinema.",Tolkien
7,neil-476,Not bad,7,10 May 2019,"Orphaned as a child and brought up by a priest who is well-meaning but possibly somewhat out of touch with youngsters, Tolkien makes close friends at school and university, and falls in love.I don't know how faithful this is to Tolkien's life. Taken at face value, it is a tolerable biography of his early years, making the importance of his friendships clear, the rather chequered path of his romance, and signposting, but never overdoing, the events which influenced his writing.The performances are good and the film holds the attention.",Tolkien
8,ferguson-6,Middle-earth discovered,5,9 May 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. As fascinated as we are with great writers, the cinematic appeal of watching someone put pen to paper, clack away on a manual typewriter, or peck at their laptop keyboard is at best negligible, and more likely, non-existent. Still, award-winning Finnish director Dome Karukoski chose renowned writer J.R.R. Tolkien as the subject of his first English language film. Tolkien's actual writing time on screen is mostly limited to a single shot at the film's conclusion; however, the script from David Gleeson and Stephen Beresford attempts to connect the dots between his real world life to his Middle-earth characters and adventures from ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"".Harry Gilby portrays the young John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, and then Nicholas Hoult stars from college age forward. The film bounces between Tolkien's childhood as an orphan, his elite private school education at King Edward's School in Birmingham, matriculating at Oxford University, and soldiering in WWI. It's during his stay at Ms. Faulkner's (Pam Ferris) boarding house when he meets Edith Blatt, the love of his life. While attending prep school, he and three friends: Robert Gilson, Christopher Wiseman and (poet) Geoffrey Smith, form the TCBS (Tea Club and Borrovian Society), a club dedicated to changing the world through art. It's at Oxford where Tolkien's love of language kicks into a yet higher gear, though it's during his time in The Somme - one of the deadliest battlefields of WWI, that we see his 'trench fever' contribute to many of the visuals later associated with his books.Lily Collins portrays Edith at the age where Tolkien must choose between her and his Oxford education, but as often happens with true love, the two later reconnect and remain married for more than 50 years (until her death). This film doesn't cover their later years, and instead focuses on the formative ones - both for his imagination and their relationship. We see his early childhood games (The Shire inspired from his time in Sarehole outside Birmingham) and the film often slaps us with an 'obvious stick' on how certain segments of life translate directly to his familiar stories in future years. In fact, there is no mention of C.S. Lewis and The Inklings - his friends who later supported his writing efforts. We do, however, get a sequence with Tolkien and Edith backstage at Wagner's ""The Ring Cycle"" Opera ... a dot that requires the simplest of connectors.The film looks terrific - especially in the battle scenes which are staged dramatically and horrifically (much as we imagine the war was) by cinematographer Lasse Frank Johannesson. Unfortunately, that's the highlight. This is mostly a generic biography of an extraordinary writer. Adding to the frustration is the fact that Nicholas Hoult recently portrayed reclusive writer J.D. Salinger in REBEL IN THE RYE ... roles too similar for the same actor.""The Hobbit"" was published in 1937 and ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy in 1954-55, the latter being the best-selling fiction of all-time before being overtaken by JK Rowling's 'Harry Potter' series. Tolkien's key seems to have been his lifelong fascination with language. He even created his own - not just words, but complete languages. That would likely have made a better focus here. Seeing the foundation of ""the fellowship"" was somewhat interesting, although much of that segment came across like a poor man's DEAD POET SOCIETY. Supposedly the Tolkien family has refused to endorse the film, likely placing the script ""In a hole in the ground ...""",Tolkien
9,siderite,Doesn't do anything,6,26 October 2019,"Imagine a story about the man who singlehandedly invented Anglo fantasy, who wrote Lord of the Rings, invented at least one language, influenced all fantasy computer games ever made. What would you put in it? The feelings of fellowship to his closest friends? The heart shattering love for a woman that seems more magical and alive than any other? The battles he fought? The evil that seemed to permeate the world and that had to be fought, regardless of consequences? Maybe his thoughts as he wrote his works?Well, this movie tries to do that, only it doesn't go anywhere. His friendship with his colleagues is the most prominent thing, but without presenting anything that made that friendship strong except getting drunk with his mates and talking geek. Then there is the love for his lodging mate Edith, which he ends up marrying, also episodic and chaste. His children only appear at the end. The war is shown from a fever induced quest in the trenches of the battle of the Somme to find his friend. The film moves from him almost being expelled to him being a university professor in a few scenes. The story ends just as he starts writing The Hobbit, so his writing years are not even in this. The most personal conflict you see in the film is when he punches his friend and immediately apologizes.It's not that the movie wasn't accurate, I have no idea if it was, but it felt as if Tolkien was a really really boring man and the most exciting part of his life, even dramatized and stitched together was still really boring. There are no bits in the film that made me feel anything for anyone. Capitalizing on the Tolkien name, this movie goes nowhere.",Tolkien
10,JamesHitchcock,The Insight of a Wikipedia Page,6,3 June 2019,"John Ronald Reuel Tolkien is not really the most natural subject for a biopic. Apart from his service in World War I, something he shared with most young men of his generation, his was not a particularly eventful life. He went to school where he made some friends, he fell in love, got married and had children. So do most people. He spent most of his life as a professor at Oxford University, not the most dramatic of professions. He also wrote ""The Lord of the Rings"", one of the greatest works of literature in the English language, but you cannot make a movie about a man sitting at his desk writing. And yet, such is the level of interest in his works, especially since they were filmed by Peter Jackson, that a film like this one seemed almost inevitable.This is officially an American film, even though it is set in Britain and most of the cast are British or Irish. It is made in the typical British ""heritage cinema"" style, with lavishly recreated sets and costumes. There are some good acting performances, especially from Nicholas Hoult in the title role but also from Colm Meaney as Father Francis Morgan, a Roman Catholic priest who served as Tolkien's guardian after the deaths of his parents, and from Derek Jacobi as Joseph Wright, the crusty old Oxford don who was Tolkien's academic mentor.The two most important elements in this film are Tolkien's wartime experiences and his friendship with a group of boys he met at King Edward's school, Birmingham. A third element is his courtship of and eventual marriage to his wife Edith, but curiously little is made of what could in other hands have become one of the main themes of the film, the fact that they were two of the parties to a love-triangle. Edith only married her former boyfriend Tolkien after breaking off an engagement to another man, but her other suitor never even appears in the film and we never learn what he felt about being jilted in this way.The scriptwriters try to give the film an overarching theme by suggesting correspondences between the events of Tolkien's early life and elements of his work. Tolkien and his three close school friends, two of whom are killed in the war, were a ""fellowship"" which formed the basis for the ""Fellowship of the Ring"", the title of the first part of ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. His wartime experiences in the trenches allegedly inspired his descriptions of the Land of Mordor. These correspondences, however, are generally hinted at rather than made explicit, and would probably be lost on anyone not already familiar with ""Lord of the Rings"". No attempt is made to tie Edith in to this theme; she is said to have inspired the character Arwen Evenstar, but she only plays a minor role in the book.""Tolkien"" is visually attractive and reasonably well acted, but it is rather lifeless and lacks imagination. My feelings about it are perhaps best summed up by the critic who said that it doesn't rise above the insight of a Wikipedia page.A goof. Professor Wright tells Tolkien that his surname derives from the Anglo-Saxon for ""foolhardy"". Tolkien himself (plausibly but probably incorrectly) believed it to be a corruption of the German word with that meaning, ""tollkuehn"". If the name did indeed mean ""foolhardy"" a distinguished Germanic philologist like Wright would instantly have recognised it as High German. (The Second Great Sound Shift, a series of phonetic changes which separated German from the other Germanic languages, including Anglo-Saxon, means, among other things, that where words in those languages begin with a ""d"", the equivalent High German form will have an initial ""t"").",Tolkien
11,ksf-2,history of J RR Tolk family.,7,30 March 2021,"The only name I recognized in the cast was Colm Meaney, who everyone knows was O'Brien in the Star Trek films. And of course Kallum Tolkien, who must be a descendant of the main subject. Nick Hoult (from the X Men) stars as J. Tolkien himself, an orphan, who created the realm of the Hobbit, followed by the Lord of the Ring Trilogy, and its stories and occupants. The old story of Good versus Evil. According to wikipedia dot com, Tolkien was a good friend of C. S. Lewis, another writer who created an entire world of escape, right around the time of world war one. He served for a few years, but was quite sickly by the end, and was given a disability pension, according to wiki. He had based some of the hobbit on his travels to the mountains while on vacation. Forming a literary club with his college buddies, he was determined to finish his degree before serving as a soldier. And always writing.. creating languages and detailed, far-away places. With adventure and purpose. It's good. We feel the mystery and creativity that he experienced growing up. Directed by cyprus and finnish Dome Karukoski, who had just directed Tom of Finland. Story by David Gleeson and Stephen Beresford.",Tolkien
12,Rainey-Dawn,Good - But Not Long Enough,8,9 January 2020,"The film is satisfying for the most part - I just wished there was another hour tagged onto the ending which would show us how he created some of his legendarium.The film mainly focuses on his friendships and romance with Edith in school - very little of the war was shown. Also showed his relationships with a couple of his teachers.You will easily see in the film how things connected to his books - hidden references as well obvious ones.Very good movie if you like biographies, romances and/or Tolkien.8/10",Tolkien
13,Robert_duder,A nice little romance but lacks substance of the author,7,10 May 2019,I knew nothing of Tolkien's life prior to this film so it definitely introduced me to him as a historical figure but the bulk of the movie is a romance between him and his future wife. I think the film makers chose to focus on the key relationships that inspired him and encouraged him in his youth and that makes sense but it does leave you wanting more about his later life when he actually becomes an author and begins to create the universe he is known for. The cast is very good. Nicholas Hoult does an excellent job playing the young author and Lily Collins is also very good and the two of them together have excellent chemistry which really does help the pace of the film and give you something to root for. It does certainly remind me of The Theory of Everything where it is focusing on how a romance impacted a great mind. For the directors first English language film he does a good job of putting you in the era and the situations that Tolkien experiences but the inspirational moments that help him create his Lord of The Rings Universe does feel a touch forced and yet at the same time these have to be things that did inspire him. I know everyone in the theater I saw it in seemed to enjoy it a lot. There was even some applause at the end which is unusual. It is absolutely entertaining and watchable and fans of romance especially era-specific (WWI) will really find this appealing but as a biography of JRR Tolkien it does miss some marks and it could have given us more instead of hyper focusing on the one area of his life and then jumping ahead so far into the future when he's publishing. 7.5/10,Tolkien
14,Thanos_Alfie,John Ronald Reuel Tolkien...,7,19 October 2020,"""Tolkien"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we watch the life of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien the man who created ""The Lord Of The Rings"", ""The Hobbit"", ""The Silmarillion"" and many more books. We follow him since his first years, his friendships, his inspirations and finding love.I have to admit that despite my high expectations I was not disappointed by this movie. I enjoyed watching it because Tolkien was presented very well, the way he was inspired his stories, the World War I and its influence on him and his love for the languages, poetry, music and reading. The direction which was made by Dome Karukoski was very good and he presented very well the personality of Tolkien and also his work. The interpretation of Nicholas Hoult who played as John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was very good and he did a great job. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Lily Collins who played as Edith Bratt, Colm Meaney who played as Father Francis and Anthony Boyle who played as Geoffrey Smith. Lastly, I strongly recommend everyone to watch this movie because even if you are not a fan of Tolkien and his work, I am sure that you will enjoy this movie.",Tolkien
15,cruise01,An inspirational story but decent film.,7,13 August 2019,"Tolkien (3.5 out of 5 stars).Tolkien is a beautifully done biographical drama film about a famous fantasy writer J.R.R. Tolkien who went on to write The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings series. It touched the base when him and his brother lost their mother to some illness. J.R.R. then went to a school where he met a few other teenagers that he did not get along with. Until, eventually they become close friends. There bond grows stronger over the years and they inspire each other to make a difference. He meets Edith (Lily Collins) who he falls in love with. He gets separated when he is drafted into World War 1.The plot is pretty decent for a biographical film about J.R.R. Tolkien. The movie was a bit slow in the second act with Tolkien and his fellowship friends talking about stories. It could have been better handled. The plot is inspirational. Tolkien and his friends no matter how often they fight with each other, they will always be brothers. Tolkien and Edith fall deeply in love until they go on different paths. Years later, they come across each other again.Nicholas Hoult is great as Tolkien. Lily Collins was also good as Edith. The music score by Thomas Newman is beautifully done. The direction delivers the eerie tone during the World War 1 scenes. Tolkien suffering from an illness. And trying to find his friends. When they are attacked. He witnesses most of his man killed in combat. Which he feels like he is isolated and he starts seeing visions of dragons out of flamethrowers. Or the aftermath smoke from the explosions looking like a dark lord Sauron. Which he uses his experience to write a fantasy story. While his one focus theme is the journey that everyone goes too and the experiences they face.Overall, Tolkien is a pretty fair film. The plot is a bit inspirational and emotional with the journey Tolkien experiences. Sadly, the film suffers from an uneven pace in the second act of the movie. The performances and music score is fantastic.",Tolkien
16,Dr_Coulardeau,Light after the end of WW1,8,24 November 2019,"A charming and quaint film about an author who is so well-known for his fantasy heroic writings that we do not know much about him. I have often considered Tolkien along with H.GH. Wells, C.S. Lewis, and T.S. Eliot. They all lived in a way or another the drama of the First World War that led to the Second World War that did not redeem our sorry fate at all and that brought in the Cold War which was even worse than the first two, and it is still going on now the USA who believed all along they were the greatest masters of the world are confronted to the emergence of a different world in which they will not be the leaders, the global coppers or sheriffs, the supreme masters.The film concentrates on that period, the teenage and youth of Tolkien up to the publication of his first novel The Hobbit in 1937, in fact, a long time before this publication since all the children seem to be under ten. As an orphan from a rather poor family entrusted to a Catholic priest till the age of 21, his getting up in the world was very difficult. He had to win a scholarship for his studies, and he targeted Oxford. He found his way only late but surely: ancient Germanic languages? He seemed to be a born linguist able to learn languages easily and especially, to speak or at least read them. That brought him into a culture of sagas and mythologies that have to do with dragons, warriors, heroes and gallant wars and adventures. He invested in his future writing his experience of before and during WW1. Before he bonded with three other teens and then tweens in some secret society or club. But the war brought an end to that.Two of the four young men were killed, a third one survived but estranged himself from the past and Tolkien found himself alone, except that the young woman he had known before the war and he met again in Folkstone on his way to France waited for him and looked after him in his hospital bed. Tolkien was seized with a fit of trench-fever and was delirious on the battlefield and brought back in and then back to England for treatment. He apparently was unconscious and probably delirious for quite a while. But the young woman was there, and they married soon after and you know what was next in those days: many children.The sequence or sequences describing him in the trenches before the Somme Battle are probably the most horrid sequences you can imagine about this war that we still, in a way, celebrate. It was an inexcusable episode in the history of humanity, and we should be ashamed of all the monuments we have built after this war, of all the wasteful and senseless celebrations and rituals we dedicate to this war. It was nothing but a four-year-long slaughtering endeavor to kill as many men as possible, to destroy as many military equipments to get rid of what had been accumulated for decades and thus to open up the gates to produce more pf these lethal sordid and vicious tools.After four years of this devilish waste, life did not go back to normal since we started straight away to prepare for the next one. How foolish humanity can be.That makes the film slightly hollow, like the poem written by T.S. Eliot in 1925, the Hollow Men.We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men
Leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!
Our dried voices, when
We whisper together
Are quiet and meaningless
As wind in dry grass
Or rats' feet over broken glass
In our dry cellar
...
This is the way the world ends
This is the way the world ends
This is the way the world ends
Not with a bang but a whimper.It was a time when men were made of straw, men were made of tin, and when a cowardly lion and a little girl Dorothy accompanied them. That triad of males around this poor little girl are pathetic in their helplessness. They are Hollow Men à la T.S. Eliot. The only point on which T.S. Eliot was wrong was the end of this strange era. It was not a whimper. It definitely was a conflagration that brought at the very least 50 million direct dead casualties, but the millions that were maimed for the rest of their life that was shorter because of it, and all those who were not born, are not counted. That was a loud enough bang. And it took twenty years for Tolkien to transmute this horrible suffering and the horrendous experience of humanity to find some alleviation in literature, and yet it is a fantasy heroic war story, whereas his contemporary C.S. Lewis imagined a world in which conflict existed but war was banned or stopped before it ever started. True enough H.G. Wells imagined a completely white society in which all people of color, except, as he says, Jews because they intermarry, would be eliminated from the surface of the globe. That sounds like The Brave New World of Aldous Huxley where the people were manufactured in five strictly segregated classes with some kind of reservation for the savages who could not fit in this world that finds like a beastlike echo in George Orwell's Animal Farm and William Golding's Lord of the Flies. And I must say to conclude that this Lord of so many flies sounds a lot like The Lord of the Rings, and this one also sounds like The Ring of the Nibelung by Wagner that is present in the film, but from the wings only.I understand that the Tolkien Estate and the Tolkien family, apparently led by Christopher Tolkien, are strongly opposed to the film. Let me quote the Guardian a little bit.""The family and estate of JRR Tolkien have fired a broadside against the forthcoming film starring Nicholas Hoult as a young version of the author, saying that they ""do not endorse it or its content in any way"".
Out in May, and starring Hoult in the title role and Lily Collins as his wife Edith, Tolkien explores ""the formative years of the renowned author's life as he finds friendship, courage, and inspiration among a fellow group of writers and artists at school"". . .
On Tuesday morning, the estate and family of Tolkien issued a terse statement in which they announced their ""wish to make clear that they did not approve of, authorise or participate in the making of this film"", and that ""they do not endorse it or its content in any way"".
A spokesperson for the estate told the Guardian that the statement was intended to make its position clear, rather than heralding future legal action.
John Garth, author of the biography Tolkien and the Great War, said he felt the estate's response to the film was ""sensible""."" (The Guardian, Tuesday 23 April 2019)Though I find the film slightly cut off from the reality of what happened after the war and particularly how Tolkien was connected to other writers of the time who were also university professors, like him, I find the moderate position of the estate and the family totally out of place. They can exercise their privileges on the copyrighted works, and even on the moral right of the author, but they have no right to tell us what is supposed to be said about J.R.R. Tolkien who is a public figure that anyone in the public can consider and study.Enjoy the film and forget about the various interests some around the man may demonstrate.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",Tolkien
17,zkonedog,An Odd Way To Approach A Biopic,5,9 January 2020,"Generally, I'm a huge fan of biopics and tend to give them much leeway and high rankings. I don't quite know if I've ever seen one take the approach that ""Tolkien"" does, however, in that it mostly ignores the reason the audience is watching.For a very basic overview, this film tells the story of young J.R.R. Tolkien (Nicholas Hoult), who of course would later pen ""The Hobbit"" and the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Here, however, he is seen as essentially an orphaned child (or at least one with very little parental involvement), and then as a student at King Edward's School, where his friendship (fellowship, if you will) with like-minded creatives and meeting Edith Bratt (Lily Collins) shape the path of his academic and personal life. Flash-forwards to Tolkien's time in WWI also intercut within the narrative.The thing with biopics is that most of the time, an audience is watching because the subject did something special to be deemed worthy of such treatment. Recent biopics I've seen regarding Judy Garland (""Judy"") and Elton John (""Rocketman"") prove that point. Obviously, most watchers will come to this one via Tolkien's landmark LOTR or Hobbit books. As such, it would be expected that the overall narrative of this film would be to ""get us to that point"", or at very least have that factor heavily into the narrative.But that is where ""Tolkien"" does not deliver. In an odd sort of way, there is very little connective tissue between the young Tolkien portrayed here and his ultimate authorial fate. This really could be the biopic of any anonymous creative personality.The strange thing is, the story isn't all that bad! The visuals and emotions are compelling, the acting is very solid, and it is at least decently inspiring to see young Tolkien learn what it means to be a creative in a world often titled against that way of life.Ultimately, though, ""Tolkien"" lacks that connection between what is transpiring on-screen and why we (as an audience) should care about it. Most viewers will likely want to see how his early life shaped his later iconic writings, but the filmmakers here just didn't want to take that approach. Instead, besides a few hints or Easter eggs here and there, they largely constrict this movie to strictly telling J.R.R. Tolkien's ""origin story"" and letting the rest speak for itself. For me, it didn't quite ""speak"" enough to warrant the two-hour investment, even with some solid acting/themes.",Tolkien
18,eddie_baggins,A solid if unremarkable biopic,6,21 October 2019,"The granddaddy of modern day fantasy, J.R.R Tolkien (pronounced Tol-keen, much to my surprise) will always be a name that is loved and adored by many around the world, fans thankful for the worlds he created in beloved novels The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings.Shining a light on Tolkien's early life as an orphan, member of a group of outcasts and tea enthusiasts and language lover, Finnish director Dome Karukoski delivers a very watchable film that never threatens to become anything more than sturdily average, as we are given an insight into how Tolkien's imagination was inspired by real life events that helped him create stories for the ages.Here played by Nicholas Hoult, in one of his rare lead roles, Tolkien is a likeable figure whose trying to find his calling in life, aching to overcome the horrors of being a lieutenant in World War 1 and dealing with his love and affections of childhood friend Edith Bratt (played by Phil Collin's daughter Lily), meaning those that are after a LOTR or Middle Earth-centric examination will be left disappointed by how Karukoski has decided to tell Tolkien's tale.It's not to say that Middle Earth and its many creatures and happenings aren't strewn through the film, some of the film's most effective moments are those with throwbacks and nods to the tales we'd all know to come and love, such as when Tolkien see's glimpses of black robbed figures riding horses through the battlefield or as we notice tiny glimpse of dragons and horned figures in the smokes of the carnage but this is very much first and foremost a tale about Tolkien's formative years that would go onto shape his future achievements.Hoult is quietly impressive as Tolkien and gives him a nicely balanced sense of vulnerability and smarts, as we clearly come to understand that even at a young age Tolkien's love for the written word and genius with language makes us seem rather silly, and whenever him and Collins share the screen Karukoski's film bounces along with a nice sense of heart and soul but you can't help but feel a subject with so much imagination and creativity was deserving of a feature film that inhabited more of this spirit.Despite the fantasy elements that appear briefly throughout, Tolkien is very much a cookie-cutter biopic that feels eerily similar to so many other films of a similar nature, particularly those that focus on authors, and it's a shame that Karukoski and his team were unable to establish Tolkien as more than just ""another big screen bio"" that feels like it would've been at home on our small screens as a Saturday night ABC feature.Final Say -Fans of Tolkien's work would do well to check out this tale that offers a solid if unremarkable insight into what helped shape some of the most revered written works of all-time but you can't help but wish that a little more creative magic existed in this stoic bio of a man who gave the world so much wonder and delight.3 tea rooms out of 5",Tolkien
19,paul-allaer,An outright snoozefest... Tolkien the man not done justice,4,15 May 2019,"""Tolkien"" (2019 release from the UK; 111 min.) is a biopic of writer J.R.R. Tolkien. As the movie opens, we are told it is ""The Somme, France, World War I"", and Tolkien is in the trenches and in bad shape. We then go back in time to ""Sarehole Mill, England"", where the young Tolkien lives with his mum and brother. Mum tells the boys that they are moving to Birmingham, much to young Tolkien's chagrin. At school, young Tolkien has trouble fitting in, until one day he befriends 3 other boys and they decide to form a ""fellowship""... At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from Finnish director Dome Karukoski, and his first English language film at that. Given the enormous book and film success of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, it was inevitable that some day a biopic of J.R.R. Tolkien would be made. That day has now arrived, and, alas, this movie is a huge disappointment. From the opening scenes (Tolkien in WWI), we watch and watch, but at no point is there any emotional connection or investment that would make us care about Tolkien or any of the other characters. The ""fellowship"" comes across so wooden and ACTED, just bizarre. But wait, there is more. Lily Collins as Edith, Tolkien's love interest, appears 30 min. into the movie. In conversation with the ""fellowship"", it becomes clear they are now all in their senior year of high school, worrying about university applications. So the characters are 17 yrs old. Except that Lily Collins is 30 in real life, and Nicholas Hoult (playing Tolkien) is 29, and they are utterly non-believable as HS kids. Then a bit later, Edith and Tolkien are on an afternoon tea-date and Tolkien starts speaking in an invented language, which prompts a discussion between the two of them about that which goes on and on, for minutes. What the heck is going on here? I get it: it's supposed to demonstrate the genius of Tolkien. Except that the scene simply doesn't work at all. But not all is lost: Collins is lovely as usual. And I did learn the proper pronunciation of Tolkien (as young Tolkien corrects a school teacher): it's pronounced ""Tol-keen"". But the bottom line is that this film doesn't do justice whatsoever to Tolkien the man/the writer/the genius, not by a mile or two.""Tolkien"" opened this past weekend on 1,500 screens across the US, to so-so box office results. The (discount) Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was also attended so-so: all of 6 people, including myself. If you are a big fan of Tolkien's books and are eager to learn about the man himself, I'm afraid this movie is not going to be very informative, or enjoyable for that matter. Of course I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Tolkien
20,subxerogravity,Not a big enough Lord of The Rings fan to truly appreciate this drama,7,13 May 2019,"Here's the thing. Never that big of a fan of Lord of the Rings. I liked it when it came out and thought nothing of it when they stopped making the movies. Not that I'd did not enjoy them at the time but it's not my thing.
I kinda felt this movie was trying to tell is the story of Tolkien as it he was Fordo sort of, and the problem with that is that he's not Fordo, so the story telling I found boring.
It's long a boring and did not capture my imagination as my mind wonders from boredom.
It's too bad this movie was more about the brother hood Tolkien made as a child over his relationship with his wife. The only parts I found interesting was Nicolas Hoult interacting with Lily Collins.
If you loved the books go see and even if you are just familiar with the movie, which the film does give a little poke to, this could be interesting. Everyone else stay home",Tolkien
21,CubsandCulture,The film is aimless...,6,11 May 2019,"The film's main problem is it doesn't want to be about what it is about. The film is largely a series of episodes of how various things (events, people, other works etc.) influenced the Middle Earth texts. But the film resists trying to draw 1 to 1 parallels between Tolkien's life and his fictional world.The film goes out of its way to avoid allegory. This is somewhat admirable given Tolkien's famous distaste for allegory but at the same time there's too much of the Middle Earth texts in the film to avoid making the connections. And the film clearly wants you to make those connections. This split aim makes the film have no real narrative drive. I do like how sometimes the narrative unspecified symbolism allows you to read several aspects of Tolkien's mythology into a scene. There was 2-3 times an ambiguous reference to either Sauron or Morgoth.While the film is in the batting average for historical accuracy for Hollywood it weirdly ignores obvious things to discuss. The film greatly downplays Tolkien's Catholicism to the point where he doesn't seem any more devout than a random guy from that time period. Worse the film spends a lot of time on his courtship with Edith and the film just doesn't use the bit about Tolkien proposing at 12:01 on his 21st birthday. This makes Tolkien a less complex figure for removing his stubbornness.However much the film's story is lacking I love the direction-cinematography in this film. There is a ton of very provocative and lyrical images that feel more Middle Earth to me than the weaker parts of the Jackson films. The film is handsome and despite the narrative drive being missing it doesn't get bogged down. It plays out like a standard coming of age tale, abet a more artistic one.With all that being said Hoult's performance is easily the best part of the film and I wish it was in a much better film. I don't think he will ever top R but this a very touching naturalistic take on an icon.",Tolkien

24,Pairic,Engaging Biopic,8,6 May 2019,"Tolkien: Not quite the romantic warrior professor but certainly all three of the preceding in part. Tolkien had a tough early life, falling into impecunity, his mother had to move with J.R.R. (Harry Gilby as the young Tolkien) and his brother from a rural idyll to the satanic mills and factories of Birmingham, an early model for Mordor no doubt. Then getting excessively MisLit, his mother (Laura Donnelly) dies and he is fostered by an elderly rich lady and along with his brother gets scholarships to an exclusive school. His family's benefactor, always working behind the scenes, is Father Morgan (Colm Meaney), benevelovent but steely in his determination when Tolkien's romance with Edith threatens his chances of getting an Oxford scholarship. Morgan may have been the inspiration for Gandalf.At school Tolkien founds a Fellowship with other artistically minded students bur the Great War will wreak havoc on that brotherhood. The film cuts between Tolkien's earlier life and the trenches of the Somme. This is literally Hell, a real Mordor. The adult J.R.R .(Nicholas Hoult) is on a (perhaps allegorical) quest to the Front to find one of the Fellowship who is missing in action. He passes through mud holes full of bodies and fever stricken imagines that a german with a flamethrower is a dragon. The film suggests many inspirations for his books, Edith (Lily Collins) as an Elven Princess, his mother's reading tales of dragons when he was a boy, the War, his schooldays. A great influence on him was the philologist Professor Wright (Derek Jacobi) who won him over to the study of Old English and Gothic languages. Directed by Dome Karukoski from a screenplay by David Gleeson and Stephen Beresford, Tolkien is an engaging account of the earlier life of the scholar and author. 8/10",Tolkien

27,jadepietro,A Well-Rendered But Predictable Bio-Pic,8,15 May 2019,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A beautifully realized, if contrived, biography of one of the most lauded fantasy writer of the 20th century.JIM'S REVIEW: As a character states midway in Dome Karukoski's visually stunning bio-pic, a word without meaning is just a sound. Taking that concept one thought further, a script without focus is a failed but noble effort. Tolkien has lofty aims and often achieves its goals, despite some shortcomings and flawed lapses in vision.The major fault with the film is in a script which becomes too enamored with words and language itself rather than developing its characters and their relationships with acuity. The screenplay by David Gleeson and Stephen Beresford cannot seem to avoid cliched events and poetic speechifying in telling the tale of J.R.R. Tolkien's life story. It embraces contrived situations in its non-linear storytelling and over-romanticizes the author's own legend. The screenwriters needed to be more plot driven. They heavy-handedly sprinkle in familiar words like ""brotherhood, rings, quests, and dragons"" in case any moviegoer misses the connection whenever inspiration is nearby our literary genius.The film's structure follows a standard biography format with its fast forwards and backwards to define its subject. Jumping from the muddy trenches and battlefields of WWI to the stately halls of Oxford or Tolkien's abrupt childhood through his lonely teenage years, we learn about his family, loves, and friendships with no real surprises.On the plus side, and there are many pluses to this film, is the director's assembling of a splendid cast and his artisans behind the lens. Mr. Karukoski films his movie with much skill and delivers impressive images. It is a beautiful looking film, technically impressive, with much to admire. Special mention goes out to cinematographer Lasse Frank, Grant Montgomery's gorgeous production design by and fine period costumes by Colleen Kelsall. Thomas Newton composes a lovely musical score that provides the emotional core that is missing in the movie's often stilted and sentimental words and actions.The cast is splendid. Nicholas Hoult plays the adult Tolkien and he is excellent in the role. Lily Collins is his love interest, Edith Bratt, and she has some lovely moments. The entire ensemble is strong, including a memorable Anthony Boyle, Patrick Gibson, and Tom Glynn-Carney as Tolkien's loyal fellowship. Well cast are the young actors who represent their youthful counterparts: Adam Bregman, Albie Marber, Ty Tennent, and Harry Gilby as the impressionable young writer. The reliable Colm Meaney is there too, as is Derek Jacobi in a wonderful, if short, role which only confirms his remarkable acting prowess once again.Tolkien is conventional and predictable in its narrative, but there is much romantic lyricism and artistry on display, which makes the film a very worthwhile moviegoing experience. It plays like a British version of Dead Poet Society with a stiff upper lip, which, as words go...ain't bad in comparison...if you get my meaning.",Tolkien
28,rgkarim,Fellowship Of The Ideas: Uniting Artistic And Symbolism For Portraying the Artistic Mind,8,11 May 2019,"The legendary story of adventure, quests, love, magic, and fellowship. To many, the legendary adventures of Frodo and the game are immortalized in the epic film franchise crafted by Peter Jackson, whose world crafting and adventure were the stuff of legends as the realm of Middle Earth was brought to life. Yet what about the man who imagined it all up, who came up with the language to give birth to the fantasy world beloved by so many. Well, tonight's film hopes to give some insight into his life and perhaps motivate us to craft our own tales through the journey he took. Robbie K here to craft another review as he takes on:Movie: Tolkien (2019)
Director:
Dome Karukoski
Writers:
David Gleeson, Stephen Beresford
Stars:
Nicholas Hoult, Lily Collins, Colm MeaneyLIKES:Acting

Symbolism
Picking Out ThingsSUMMARY: A biopic such as this requires engaging performances to bring the legendary figures to life and fortunately this movie has brought it's cast together to form its own fellowship. Hoult's group bonds with that English wit, full of fun and sarcasm as the brotherhood forms with each passing year. Lily Collins as the love interest is a usual role for her, but the direction grants her some options to bring out her motivational monologue skills that were a wonderful compliment to the struggles Hout portrays in the legendary writer. This duos chemistry is impressive, capable of bringing the tale to life.
Of course, we need to see the vision of Tolkien's mind brought to life so that we can potentially get an idea of how he viewed the world to make his own world. Director Karukoski achieves this through the use of a number of camera work, special effects and audio tricks to help make this come to life. The result is that the movie is an artistic wonder, bringing the dark designs of Jackson's work and simplifying them into a version that seems to match the ""hallucinations"" of Tolkien's mind. As the story evolves and more of his journey begins unfolding, the movie continues to evolve the art style to show the beauty of the hero's journey and the struggles about discovery. All the beauty of the life events and symbolism of what each part of Tolkien's life meant in relationship to his works makes is captured in the wonderful cinematography and acting, all blending together to portray how the spirts of the art work in the harshest most brilliant ways. To help add that extra magic, the music they chose in the forms of sonatas, piano work, and dynamic music pieces was something I particularly liked the most. Captivating scores are what add that emotional beauty to me as well, almost mirroring the inner soul of the characters involved.
Yet all the artistic licenses they took in this movie, the thing I particularly liked was the treasure hunt of references to the book in Tolkien's life. In his journey for the Hobbit, Tolkien is all about dropping hints of motivation for his world and the characters that inhabit them. Some of the hints are obvious in the mind's eye sequences where the beasts and creatures manifest in some weird hallucination, while others are a little harder to pick up, hiding in the common dialogue or background much like the elusive treasure his series is about. It's that element that adds a level of fun to the movie for the fans like me to help offset some of the slower parts to the film.DISLIKES:Slow
A Little Too Artistic
Predictable Story
A little disjointed
Perhaps Over Dramatized
Not Quite the Quest I envisioned.SUMMARY:
My fellow reviewers are right in the terms that Tolkien may be a bit boring for the common audience member and much of this has to do with the very thing that makes it beautiful, the artistic presentation. Tolkien's pace is about hitting key points of his life and some of these moments don't have quite the entertainment aspect we've come to love as an audience. Instead the disjointed moments are sort of skipped, tied together in his memories as he goes through the war, are a little too nonlinear causing a semi-coherent story about how he came up with work. The fact that the ending is predictable makes the constant circling around the obvious ending a little tiresome given the pacing.
Yet the biggest dislikes have to involve the missing that movie magic that makes the entertainment factor for the movies some of the most enjoyable. I needed that cohesive story and liberties to help glue the story into a cohesive tale that wasn't so artistic and a little more direct to help capture the spirit of the quest. I was hoping that we would see more of him walking through the world with an eye for his motivation, sort of seeing the story's writing as he planned it out. Instead, getting caught up in the life drama and how he struggled to write was not quite the quest I had envisioned upon watching the trailers for this film. Without this uniting quest and cliché look at the creation, the artistic liberties got a little too in the way of the storytelling which is going to limit the audience scope they may have looked for.The VERDICT:Tolkien is a beautiful film, showing that much like Tolkien's journey, artistic splendor is all about the journey to find the strength to create. It has fantastic acting, great use of audio and visual works to make it a symbolism of beauty and wonder, and does enough subtle hinting with the references to make it the treasure hunt mentioned at the beginning of the movie. And yet, while it is the strongest part of the movie it also puts a lot of limitations on it as well. The movie gets lost in the symbolism and artistic license, making the film a little more segmented and denser than what most will look for and limiting the audiences scope. Therefore, this movies is not going to be for the common fan and would recommend checking this one out at home unless you are a diehard Tolkien fan.My scores are:Biography/Drama/War: 7.5

29,rannynm,Heartwarming film showing how eents of Tolkien's life fueled his imagination,10,12 June 2019,"Tolkien is an incredibly heartwarming film telling the story of John Ronald Tolkien's life and how he drew inspiration for his books. This film is extremely entertaining for a biopic. It tells his life story in a way that shows how events throughout his life fueled his imagination to create his incredible fantasy stories. It brilliantly represents how people make connections with other people and events that inspire creativity.Tolkien begins with J.R.R. Tolkien in a small camp in a WWI trench, where he is having visions of mythical creatures battling. It then cuts to him as a child and shows how he always loved these mythical creatures that he wrote about. Suddenly, due to a lack of money, his family is forced to move to the city where he has no friends. He and his brother are admitted to a prestigious school on scholarships where he makes some lifelong friends.The use of imagery in this film is incredible. Lots of normal things are transformed by John's imagination into incredible creatures from myths and legends. Many of the things that John experiences over the course of his life are mirrored by the events in his books. The film excels at showing that Tolkien was really passionate about his writing and the use of language. The war scenes in the movie are quite graphic and hard to watch, but show the inspiration for Tolkien's epic battle scenes in his writings.One thing I disliked is the way the movie starts. It begins with a scene of two CGI horses being ridden into battle. The CGI used isn't that great and is a terrible choice for the opening scene, because it instantly turns down the audience and makes it just a little bit harder to get their support. However, the story is strong enough to compensate for that and you become quickly lost in the world of Tolkien's imagination.The moral of this film is that you should try to accomplish your goals and overcome obstacles. This is told throughout Tolkien's journey. He constantly tries to accomplish different goals and is incredibly dedicated to finishing them. There is also an integral message about dealing with loss. This is shown in how he deals with the many devastating losses in his life.The music in this film is great. It is exciting and conveys a strong tone that matches the film incredibly. It is very interesting and has a lot of variety.
I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 11 through 18, because it covers some heavy topics that are unsuitable for younger viewers. Any fan of the writings of JRR Tolkien will love this. It is one of my favorite films and I am certain I will watch it again.Reviewed by Rohan F., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

31,eric262003,Great Look At The Early Years of Tolkien,8,13 June 2020,"Even if you've never picked up a book based off of his Middle-Earth series, J.R.R. Tolkien is a familiar name that rests in the annals of literary geniuses like Lewis Carroll ,C.S. Lewis, and Mark Twain. But very little is known about the author and what events influenced him to write one of the greatest fantasy stories ever created. Under the direction of Dome Kurokoski and from Fox Searchlight, we embark on a journey to the early years of Tolkien to get some insight of his early life and the trials and tribulations that inspired him that led him to write his fantasy stories that has encouraged others to follow his footsteps in imagination and creativity.The early years of Tolkien's life like everyone else in the world has been plagued with its fair share of ups and downs. However, what stands out from Tolkien's perspective is that he can take whatever troubling moments he had encountered and transform it into something creative and adventurous. The successes and the hardships of his life can almost have similar visions of a painter looking for his muse. And sure this is not a lost chapter of ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""The Hobbit"", it's a biopic after all so I ask you will the intended audience be interested in the man behind the works or are they expecting to see the iconic characters pop up here and then?When I was young I was infatuated with adventure and fantasy stories. Though I could never read a bunch of chapters in one day. I would read a chapter and then saviour each chapter to get a better understanding of what I read and take down notes of details that I found that were important.In 2001 Peter Jackson directed ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" and I was one of the many who was excited when it first came out. Then I got to watch the entire trilogy and have never looked back since then.In the end you ask yourselves, how did this movie turn out in the end? Overall, ""Tolkien"" is a riveting story that is both visually stunning and the storytelling is superb. It's about life's journeys through love and loss, overcoming the odds and living another day. What it's not is about a young filling his dreams, but a man who was oblivious to the hidden talent he never knew he had.In his youth, he was sent to an orphanage where he bonded with three other well-cultured individuals who would become his ""Fellowship"". The four friends would become The Tea Club and Barrovian Society. Their bonding was met with intellectual thoughts rather than just casual bonding that most men tend to interact the most. Overtime, Tolkien (Nicholas Hoult) eventually meets a fellow boarder named Edith Bratt (Lily Collins) who he would later fall in love with and would be the catalyst for his 'Lord of the Rings"" which was a love letter to his wife.All of the sudden World War I comes into play and Tolkien eventually serves his time there especially during the bloody Battle of Somme where millions of people met their fate.While into battle, his visions of story writing were becoming more idealistic.The weak part about this movie is that Hoult lacks in charisma as the titular character. Unlike a lot of films where we find the artists struggling with their inner feelings and their anger and passion is driven by their work of art. And though he has experienced heartbreak, he seems quite laid-back and lives in his own world filled with imagination and languages which would wind up in his stories.The strong connection between the reality he faced and the fantasy world he created are absent here. Instead the correlations of the events in his life will pave way to the stories he will eventually write.When coming to see this movie there are a few things to take into consideration. You may not have to know everything about Tolkien's life, but if you read ""Lord of the Rings"" you might get a better understanding of the world he lives in. Lily Collins was really wonderful as Tolkien's lover/wife Edith. She's also the daughter of music legend Phil Collins. Patrick Gibson is also very good as fellow fellowship member Robert Gilson.For a simplified biopic, drama I was enthralled by the movie in its entirety, even managing to get a little teary-eyed in the end. And sure some important details in his life were left out, I can understand, it's a movie not a documentary. If you you'd like a look into the author's early life, you won't be disappointed.",Tolkien
32,denis888,Rather Weak Attempt,2,16 August 2019,"The third biopic in recent times, and again a very big disappointment. It would seem - well, this time everything should work out - the biography of the great writer John Ronald Roel Tolkien, so many details, so many things can be shown. And again, two hours of screen time, and the result is an incredibly slow, dreary and monotonous film, very casual and superficial, showing us either young John, his service in France in 1916, or courtship for Edith, his future wife. At times the film is well leveled, military scenes are shown very severely and accurately. The scenes in the theater, behind the scenes, or small (offensively short) fragments dedicated to the university period are also a succesl. And then - again, boring and very tepid pieces about four friends. Clearly, it's impossible to show everything. But how the creators of the film managed to ignore the figure of Clive Lewis in the script, is incomprehensible. The theme of Catholicism has been completely bypassed. There is not even a hint of the future ideas of the Lord of the Rings. The feeling of hurried and obviously crude script does not let go all the time By the way, the Tolkien family wholy refused to participate in the preparation of the script. What also speaks volumes against this work.
My impression is that it is an unsuccessful attempt, but it will cure insomnia.

Starring Nicholas Hoult, Lily Collins, Derek Jacobi, Anthony Boyle, Patrick Gibson, Tom Glynn-Carney, Harry Gilby, Colm Meaney, Albie Marber, Adam Bregman, Pam Ferris, Mimi Keene, Owen Teale. (PG-13)Genteel, reverent biopic of the early life of writer J. R. R. Tolkien (Hoult as an adult, Gilby as a teen) jumps through different episodes of his life with little thematic cohesion; be it his friendship with fellow students, his romance with the love of his life (Collins), or his vigorous bid to study philology at Oxford, Tolkien's developmental periods are compartmentalized into either being the lone focal point or discarded for long sections of the narrative. Those scenes are further divided by ones set during the Great War, as Hoult moves through the horrific combat trenches, envisioning dark riders and dragons and other images that would inspire his fantasy fiction to come. Though handsomely produced, the storytelling can be stodgy and simplistic when Tolkien's writing could rarely be described as the same (the two best scenes involve lengthy discussions of the lovely musicality of the phrase ""cellar door"" and the roots of the word ""oak""). Creating a passionate film about a man whose passions were tied up in language, mythology and academia was bound to be a troublesome endeavor, so why waste so much time covering the familiar encyclopedia entry highlights?49/100",Tolkien
34,nancyldraper,A quiet film that takes its time,7,29 September 2021,"The works of Tolkien are seminal and this film tries to pull gently from his first 24 years the threads that may have begun the weave of those later writings. It is also a story of the love within a brotherhood. And, the love of Tolkien for Edith Bratt, played beautifully by Nicholas Hoult and Lily Collins.

Boy goes to posh school, mother dies, adopted by wealthy patron, goes to university, goes to war, gets married and becomes a Don. Insufficient.Had it not been the brilliant acting of both the young and older Tolkien who threw their all behind the project that made this movie vaguely watchable.What I thought was frustrating but perhaps because it was equally uneventful the film stopped before the Hobbit and LOTR was written so we had no insight into his creative process.",Tolkien

It portrays friendship, love and loss perfectly whilst also having links to his famous world a thoroughly interesting and touching look at his life although it would be nice to have a 2nd film focusing more on his life after the war also as I'm sure there was still plenty of story left to tell. Overall though great performances from the whole cast and great storytelling you could really connect to much like Tolkien's work itself.",Tolkien
39,rockman182,Tolkien (2019),6,14 May 2019,"I had doubts about this film based on the trailer. I mean, we all love The Lord of the Rings trilogy and some of us (not me) like The Hobbit series. Was a film about the mastermind behind those books something that we were dying for? Probably not. However, I was somewhat interested in the inspiration for such a grand universe set in Middle Earth and wanted to get a bit of back story to the life of J.R.R. Tolkien. Its a fairly by the numbers biopic but I thought it was decent.The film is about the life of J.R.R. Tolkien from his humble beginnings as a young imaginative foster child, to his lifelong friendship with a group of boys, to the encounters with the love of his life. Most importantly the film shows Tolkien during the first World War, the horrors he witnesses and how the war influences a lot of the imagery of his future work. The film stars Nicholas Hoult as Tolkien and Lily Collins as Edith Bratt, his wife.Lily Collins is beautiful. Now that that's out of the way, lets talk about the film. Its a bit generic and stalls on portions of Tolkien's life that don't feel like they needed a lot of focus. I personally wanted to see more his inspiration for writing The Hobbit. The film does try to be inclusive of imagery that is representative of his works during the war, which I thought was a good touch. Ultimately though its easy to get bored with the life and friendship of Tolkien and his mates.This is the story of a fantastic fantasy writer but gets bogged down on showing other things for me. The imagination of Tolkien and the inspiration for his writing still needed more focus. Its not a bad film by any means but I think it needed to be better. The film probably was not necessary and I don't see it making LOTR level waves. Its a passable biopic at best but overall needs to capture the magi of Tolkien's work to inspire. Hey, at least we will finally learn how to pronounce ""Tol-keen"" though.6.5/10",Tolkien
40,agmoldham,Not quite sure of the point of this movie,5,23 October 2019,"Tolkien tells the story of the writers formative years and the friendships during college and onwards into the first world war. I was already aware that some of the mythology of the Lord of the Rings was based on his wartime experience. I guess most writers base their novels on their lifetime experience to some extent.Tolkien forms a close bond with his friends at college and the movie plays out their relationships and experiences going forward. The movie shows Tolkien imagining scenes from his books during battle sequences. This doesn't really feel true to me. I wouldn't say the film was bad, but I couldn't really see the point of it either. As mentioned it was already common knowledge that the war influenced some of his books and I can't really see why we need to go further than that.",Tolkien
41,jrarichards,"Inevitably insufficient, but offers the milieu in which JRR found himself well enough",9,5 January 2020,"Given the extraordinary power, popularity and (literally) ""magic"" of both books and movies, we are obviously in need of explorations of Tolkien's life and creativity, even as we know that you can't make a film out of a biographical book (of which there are several in this case - each of 300-400 pages), and even as we know that a person of brilliance and imagination flowing through the pen does not necessarily (though may) have a brilliant and imaginative life.Ultimately, Tolkien was a language expert at British Universities (notably Oxford), though his early life (to which this film devotes itself) was not dull, even if it was not untypical for the late 19th and early 20th centuries in featuring imperially-motivated travel/adventure, disease, death and bereavement, uncomfortable schooldays and - of course, in time - war with a capital W.Indeed, one of the greatest achievements of this work by Cypriot-born Finnish Director Dome Karukoski is its instinctive, near-visceral feel for the times. Edwardian mores are injected into the content, and they go so perfectly hand in hand with omnipresent scientific, but also pre-Raphaelite and Arts&Crafts-type influences, history and modernity coming up against one another. Maybe the movie is almost trite in doing this, but it seems meaningful to suggest that the Hobbit, LOTR and the rest were near-inevitabilities for the boy and man we learn a little about, in the time and place and circumstances he found himself.Tolkien always denied that his work was over-influenced by World War One, even if none of us out here really accept that - yet the film (which the Tolkien estate and family had no truck with) does indeed build a kind of case that every aspect of the author's life pushed him through to what he achieved. Surely the War was in there, but so was young friendship, young love, loss of parents at a tender age, and a strong urge to become learned and expert in subjects that mattered to the man.An ironic conclusion from this would be that the works were great, not just because the man was great, but because his times were. Of course, WWI was hateful in almost every way - as this movie makes abundantly clear - yet men (including several I myself spoke to) said ""I wouldn't have missed it for the world, for the camaraderie"". And in the end, both of Tolkien's great works are stories of loyalty and companionship in the face of suffering and danger.The centrepiece here - though really only sketched out rather impressionistically - is the so-called ""Tea Club, Barrovian Society"" of 4 (we see 4, though there were a few more) clever and imaginative boys who pushed the artistic and behavioural boundaries just a little, in the actually very serene and safe surroundings of the cafe at Barrows exclusive department store in Birmingham (England).Just re-read that last line in all its enigmatic, eccentric and ridiculous glory, then imagine the same people (still not much more than boys) in the Trenches or (in the case of Christopher Wiseman) in the Royal Navy. Only Tolkien and Wiseman came back, and Tolkien not entirely ""whole"" for some time.The acting in the parts of the boys here is quite good enough, and Derek Jacobi works his usual magic as linguist Prof. Joseph Wright (in real life an academic of humble origins who got to study at Heidelberg but walked there from Antwerp in order to save the fare money!)But this whole piece is so somehow ""instinctive"" that individual acted parts don't seem to matter too much. Our star in the form of ""Cumberbatch Junior"" Nicholas Hoult does not seem to give too much away, and certainly looks too young for the later scenes; but the wonderful, devout and devoted love portrayed between the young Ronald and his Edith (played by the ever-mesmerising Lily Collins) is well-done and certainly has its on-screen chemistry. Sad that the truth had to be departed from in places - the couple had already married (in March 1916) by the time Tolkien left to fight in World War One. He had loved her from the age of 16 on (when she was already 19). This is somehow significant, as it is widely felt that the Middle Earth books are not great at dealing with male-female love. Actually, I in the end beg to differ, as I think the developing love between Faramir and Eowyn in LOTR is actually one of the most touching and meaningful portrayals I know of. And since that was love on the back of loss, wounds, war and hopelessness one wonders how autobiographical that too might have been...Perhaps we don't actually need a film to offer us the basic biographical details, but in terms of mood-setting this work is - for me at least - far more than adequate, and in fact rather entrancing. The fact that we see moments of battlefield visions of black riders, orcs and so on as our hero suffers trench fever is a bit of a turn-off, but for me by no means enough to ruin the film.",Tolkien

43,MrDHWong,"A well-intended, yet muddled look at the acclaimed author's legacy",6,20 June 2019,"Tolkien is a biopic about the early life of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy/The Hobbit author J.R.R. Tolkien. Starring Nicholas Hoult in the lead role, it is a well-intended, yet muddled look at the acclaimed author's legacy.As a young man, John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (Nicholas Hoult) befriends a group of three outcasts at school who help him to find his place in the world and support him in his creative endeavours. Over time, John meets Edith Bratt (Lily Collins), a young pianist with whom he falls in love and becomes his muse. Eventually, however, World War I breaks out and John is sent off to fight in the trenches at the Battle of the Somme, separating him from some of his friends and the love of his life.Despite a solid premise, Tolkien ultimately struggles to elevate its intriguing subject matter above merely being another outcast author. The film chooses to omit important details about Tolkien, such as his strong Christian faith influencing his writings, instead opting for a more fantasy driven approach. In addition to this, the pacing is painfully slow most of the time, showcasing some of the least interesting aspects of what inspired Tolkien to write his novels in the first place. With that said, the film is at least nice to look at thanks to some creative cinematography during Tolkien's musings and Nicholas Hoult's well-acted performance in the title role. It's a shame that so much overall effort was put in to producing so little of interest.I rate it 6/10",Tolkien

48,FrenchEddieFelson,Entertaining and poetic,6,24 June 2019,"A story as romantic as biographical of the first three decades of J.R.R. Tolkien, who is best known as the author of the classic high fantasy works The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and The Silmarillion: his childhood and adolescence just before the first world war and his decisive encounters (Edith Bratt who will become his wife, the professor Joseph Wright who will turn his mentor and help him to to enter to the University of Oxford, and his friends with whom he will form a brotherhood, or even a fellowship).
The analogies with his novels are obvious: the Ringwraiths a.k.a. the Nazgûl between the German trenches of the Bay of the Somme, or even Sauron on his black horse and his huge sword. The film portrays also the manifold sources of inspiration such as Nordic cultures / languages or operas like Der Ring des Nibelungen composed by Richard Wagner.
The photography, the Computer-Generated Imagery and the costumes are excellent. The movie reflects reality more or less closely (the audience shall then dissociate the real from the fantasy) but is globally poetic. 6/7 of 10.",Tolkien

Tolkien as he finds friendship, love and artistic inspiration among a group of fellow outcasts at school. I saw the trailer once a while ago and to be honest I didn't think it looked that great. I got a little interested as it got closer. When I saw it I was actually surprised a little since the reviews were mostly mixed. I can see why but I liked it as much as audiences from what I've seen. The plot was interesting and different from what I thought it looked like in the trailer. The very beginning 20 minutes and the very end we're not my favorite. I thought they could've been a little better. So his whole past is recollected as he's in war. I didn't like the war parts. There was just something off about them. Though it was cool what they did with some of the imagery and visual effects. I understand why those scenes were there but I didn't enjoy them really. I shouldn't say ""enjoy"" but it could've been executed differently. The rest of the plot was enjoyable. It did move a little slowly and there were some scenes that were boring. It didn't feel super slow but just a tad slow. Nicholas Hoult and Lily Collins helped with it though. Those two were the standouts to me. Obviously Nicholas did well as the lead role. I learned more about Tolkien and he portrayed him well. I think the scenes with his friends and Lily Collins were the best. His friends made for a fun time and I felt a connection. Every scene with Lily Collins was good. I think she's a wonderful actress who doesn't get the acclaim like she should with any role. Other than The Blind Side I think this is my favorite role of hers. I loved her scenes that had to do with music. Edith played piano and loves operas and they say she lit up felt so genuine. Speaking of music I had mixed feelings on the score by Thomas Newman. All of his scores sound the same: either ocean or space themed. It didn't work with this at all. Also with the war sequences it sounded like Blade Runner 2049. It totally threw off the mood so many times. I haven't had a score really effect a movie in a negative way in a while so I guess that's why I'm a little more upset. Overall I think this movie is good but nothing amazing. Fans of Tolkien's work should see this in my opinion. It's better than the trailer looks and a likable watch that I would recommend.My Grade: B",Tolkien
50,David-240,An exquisite masterpiece - ignore the critics!,10,17 June 2019,"Tolkien is a wonderful film, I venture to say it is close to a masterpiece. Derided by some critics, who seem to have expected Tolkien's life would be full of the kind of fantastical adventures that populate his novels, this is a subtle, beautiful and deeply moving film about the genesis of creation. I knew little of Tolkien's life, so the film was full of refreshing discoveries for me. It's about how the deep friendship between four young men, who were all thrust into the horrors of World War 1, created the heart of the Fellowship of the Ring; how a real life platonic love, that overcame the deeply entrenched English class system, inspired the fantastical adventure at the centre of one of the Twentieth Century's greatest literary works; how real life acts of bravery, sometimes quite small, helped create in the mind of one person a story that would en-trance millions of people. Nicholas Hoult is one of the finest young actors working today and he cements that reputation here - a whole world comes alive in his eyes. Lily Collins glows as the great love of his life. The other seven young actors who portray Tolkien and his friends at various ages are all outstanding and there are sublime cameos from the great Derek Jacobi and Australian actor Genevieve O'Reilly. You wouldn't expect this quintessential English story to be directed by a Finnish director of Cypriot heritage, but that's exactly who Dome Karukoski is - he does a gorgeously delicate job here, helped by a fine screenplay, beautiful cinematography and an exquisite music score by Thomas Newman. There are some truly sublime moments of beauty, sometimes merged with moments of great horror, in this film, with expressionist battlefield images that really linger in the mind - special effects that really are special. Above all this is a deeply moving film that will ensure you will never look at Tolkien's work in the same way again.",Tolkien

53,movieman6-413-929510,Tolkien can come across in a different way to fans.,5,9 June 2019,"Tolkien is a new film adaptation of a biography. The film is directed by Dome Karukoski, the director of Tom of Finland and Lapland Odyssey.
The film is about the biography of writer J.R.R. Tolkien, who wrote the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit book series. J.R.R. Tolkien is played in the film by Nicholas Hoult.The film is about the younger years of the orphan J.R.R. Tolkien. He finds a group of co-writers and artists at an artistic school. Just like him, they are outsiders. This ensures a common connection, so that they easily become friends with each other and thus form their own group.Later Tolkien also knows how to start a relationship with the girl Edith Bratt (Lily Collins). Tolkien knows how to fascinate her with his imaginative outlook on life and the stories he manages to invent. Their relationship is at stake when Tolkien has registered with the English army during the First World War. During all his life events, Tolkien tries to use the events and his fantasy to be able to come up with stories. That's how he comes up with ideas for The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit book seriesThis film is not told chronologically and is filled with flashbacks. In these different flashbacks you can see how Tolkien came up with some ideas to use in later book series. By telling the story in this way, the pace of the movie does slow down when they switch to a flashback. For people who are familiar with his book series or the later adaptations of these series, they can often predict which objects, characters or events you will see about the origin story. This way, this film can look different to the fans. The half may find it interesting to see and learn where the origins of certain things from the books and film series come from. Many of these things are somewhat exaggerated or further explained. For the other half this can come across as somewhat predictable. They may know what is meant in the film, but in the film they choose to explain many of these things in a long-winded way for watching that may be less familiar with the books and film series.The acting is well done by the cast. Nicholas Hoult comes across as J.R.R. Tolkien. It is nice to see him fantasize and how he continues with the ideas of his book series. He also communicates it passionately when he shares his thoughts and plans for his stories with his friends or girlfriend. Lily Collins also likes Edith Bratt. You can see the chemistry between the two in the film. The other cast members who play Tolkien's friends are also doing well in the film, but not everyone gets the same amount of time to play their role well. With some you can see a bit how Tolkien later incorporated them into his stories. For example, some of the cast come across as characters from The Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit films.",Tolkien

Well I certainly didn't find out from this movie since its a jumble of scenes thrown together in strange order. The begin was just annoying boys doing annoying boy stuff.. Maybe that really happened that way and somehow the director thought hey this explains a lot to the audience? I don't know..The back and forth in time was annoying and added nothing. I had no idea Tolkien was suppose to be 17 because all the actors look and probably are 30 or so. Female lead falls for male lead cliche.. Unless once again, maybe that actually happened in his life and he didn't know or date other women in his early life Idk..What was with the multiple rugby games? They are English they love rugby?? Huh. Pointless filler. The acting was good, the script was ok. His fantasy delusions were confusing because I didn't know if it was him coming up with ideas and thinking about it and relating his reality to fantasy or him actually seeing things and he was kind of crazy. The professor he keeps talking to randomly starts speaking a language the audience can't understand just to point out that Tolkien can understand him? Its a very subtle nod to his learning done in a clunky way.. Just a side note. They could get all the hair styles and clothing right but the lead actresses eyebrows look like they are the Instagram fad of 2019.

Even the war scenes are ludicrously unrealistic.In essence, this film is just plain boring.

The production values and the acting were decent, but it was just a slog to watch and not all that engaging. It was like watching your average by-the-numbers biographic movie. Maybe you have to be a hardcore The Hobbit/Lord of the Rings/Tolkien fan to like it more, perhaps?There were some okay parts like Tolkien bantering with his younger friends here and there, but most of the movie was just not that interesting. It seemed they added parts that felt like filler and tangents that didn't really go anywhere to fill the runtime. You know where it will be heading and the many inspirations being spelt right in front of you. The visuals during the battle sequences were probably the highlight. The musical score is appropriate and used effectively, but I don't know I just found it mostly forgettable. Honestly, for a large part of it, it probably could have been a made-for-TV movie.So yeah, Tolkien was just an average at best biographic movie that most likely wasn't really my cup of tea. I really wanted to like it and get the gist of how Tolkien got inspired to write The Hobbit/Lord of the Rings, but it was so average and forgettable to me that I struggled to stay engaged the whole time.

60,dussaultjulien,Horrible. What a disgrace,2,7 August 2019,"I feel like people today see being religions as a weakness, or that it somehow inherently makes you weak to enjoy believing in a religion. This movie really shows that fear that people have today of religion, and that maybe it could actually be good for you.JRR Tolkien had a moral compass that has shaped me, and millions of other people, into who I am today. To take away one of the biggest aspects of his life, just because you were afraid to talk about it is cowardly. The fact that Tolkien was a Christian, made him a better writer if you ask me, and a better person because it gave him a moral compass to live by. As much as people don't want to believe that about religion, it does give you moral to live by, which I feel a lot of people don't have in their lives anymore in these modern times.
They left that side of him completely out of this film and that was a disgrace.

We barely see any of Tolkien's childhood and the stories that inspired him as a young boy or the relationship with his mother. We barely get any information on his actual inspiration for The Lord of the Rings (we just know he really loves the study of language and fairy tales; we never even get to know how he got so passionate about either in the first place). On top of that, the story is basically just about friendship and war, and cuts messily back and forth between both storylines. The good news is that the main leads performed their roles beautifully and the cinematography was downright beautiful. Other than that, it's a very big letdown, especially for Tolkien fanatics.C-",Tolkien

Settle back and let it flow past.,8,12 May 2019,"If you like the style of Downton Abbey, and you're a Lord of the Rings fan, then you're almost certain to enjoy this film. You'll probably enjoy it even if you aren't, just for its inherent love of the human spirit. I went in to the theater not certain what to expect, but it was a delight. Anyone who thinks this movie is ""too slow moving"" is missing the point. In an utterly non-Hollywood vein, ""Tolkien"" is built out of reflection, silences, and genuine conversation -- no false energy, snarky dialog, or character ""development"" that is nothing more than posturing. I loved its ambience and wish that more directors and writers would have the courage, or license, to do this kind of thing.As a bio of JRR Tolkien's early years from boyhood through college and World War I, the basic facts of the story are pretty accurate, at least if you go by the nice Wikipedia article about him. Some of it feels (and is) romanticized, and there's a certain lack of suspense in how it all unfolds because we know Tolkien came through all of this to become an Oxford professor and the most famous fantasy writer in the world. But the main point is to draw out the formative experiences that led him along that path. The heaviest emphasis (I suspect a bit too much) is on his late-teen years and his close bond with three college friends (a self-declared ""fellowship"" -- where have we heard that before?). But there is also the love of his life, Edith, who really was the inspiration for Luthien, his mythical elf princess and one of the founding inspirations for the whole Middle-Earth mythological world. The ""Tale of Luthien and Beren"", which was the centerpiece of The Silmarillion, is the one he really cared about. (and btw that story would make a terrific movie, as good as LOTR in the right hands.)Then, there is Tolkien's time as a soldier and the war in the trenches, which can never be portrayed as anything less than horrific. As we've seen and read over and over again, the reality was just as bad (see for example Peter Jackson's documentary They Shall Not Grow Old, released earlier this year). These scenes in the movie are so vivid that they feel like a fever dream. Over an utterly blasted landscape covered by fire and fog, dark shapes loom that in his imagination might be dragons, or Black Riders, or demons. This is a fanciful choice on the director's part, but I think it's easily forgiven: Tolkien did come down with ""trench fever"", a vicious disease that put him and many other soldiers out of action for good, and nobody escaped that environment without being changed forever. It's only a tiny step from that WWI ground to Mordor. But the academic influences on his early career are happily also given their fair innings. JRR had unusual skill with ancient languages and the myths that went with those, like Beowulf, the Ring of the Nibelungs, the Kalevala, and all of those found their way into the elements of Middle-Earth.The actors are I think without exception very good here. Nicholas Hoult is in almost every scene and commands things well. He's a young actor growing in stature almost before our eyes. Lily Collins (as Edith) doesn't have quite as much to do, but she too is a real person here and not just a sidebar. There's a key interchange between the two of them fairly early on in the film that I can only describe as a love scene -- yet it is nothing more than the two of them sitting in a quiet restaurant together while he shyly lays out his love of words and language, she urges him to make a tale to go along with them, and they build a story together. The erotic undercurrents are fascinating, a masterful setpiece that is given the time it needs to develop. The award for most watchable cast member, however, has to go to Derek Jacobi. He's got only a supporting role, and he appears fairly late in the game as the Oxford professor Tolkien wants desperately to study with, but he quietly takes over every scene he's in seemingly without effort.Spend a couple of hours immersed in this film and you'll come out inspired. I did.",Tolkien

67,maximovlE,Excellent,10,14 February 2020,"I've watched the movie, read the reviews, and partaken in some research of my own. Many complaints and low ratings are due to accuracy. I agree, not everything in this movie is accurate. but in my belief the key points are. This was the only thing keeping me from giving it a 10. I understand however that movies are a big money industry, and sometimes they have to elaborate, and sometimes they get that elaboration wrong. The main thing wrong, that matters, was that of his religious beliefs, or the omittence of such. I really don't think that took so much away though. The film makers wanted you to like Tolkien, and very often heavily religious charters are not liked, especially from that era.Moving on, the movie itself. I think it was exceptionally well cast. Nicholas Holt has definitely become a great actor, if he wasn't already, and his cast companions helped greatly.The story telling moved at a great place. I've never been a fan of time hopping, but they didn't over do it, thankfully.I loved the characters, I loved the direction, and overall loved it enough to overlook the details. If anything, it gave me the will to read more about Tolkien, and I will. Definitely worth a 10.",Tolkien
68,eelen-seth,An aimless journey with a fellowship that has the uncontrollable urge to talk literature,5,12 June 2019,"J.R.R. Tolkien's biopic can best be described as a modest period drama. Tolkien's estate has objected to the making of this film, from the start, in fear of smudging the well known author's name and legacy. If only the film would be somewhat entertaining, but no, Dome Karukoski's film is anything but that.This pacified look at the storyteller's academic life stays very close to the facts, where we get a look into our titular character's fascination with ancient and fictional languages. Stephen Beresford and David Gleeson's screenplay could've focused a bit more on Tolkien's forbidden romance with Edith Mary Bratt (a waste of Lily Collins' talent), because this storyline felt rather thin.If Tolkien was a bit more romance and a lot less talking, maybe it wouldn't be this boring. The Lord of the Rings books (later films) are well known and anything but soulless. Watching a portrayal of the man's early life and how he came to the idea of writing his biggest work ""The Hobbit"", sounds more exciting than it actually looks like. The film is also very safe, an aimless journey with a fellowship that has the uncontrollable urge to talk literature. The only thing I can applaud it for is its attempt at showing us the etymology of Tolkien's work.Nicholas Hoult first shows up on screen as a soldier wandering in the trenches as if it was Middle-Earth, and recalls his past through flashbacks while imaginary dragons and Orcs pass him by. We then witness his entire challenging childhood: from Tolkien (played as a younger version by Harry Gilby) and his little brother getting placed under care of Father Francis Morgan (Colm Meaney) after their mother dies, to seeing him earn a spot at the fancy King Edward's School, where he gets bullied by a group of boys who eventually become his closest friends.We get to see boys sipping tea while creating daydreams, but these somewhat compelling characters (all due to the promising acting skills of Patrick Gibson, Anthony Boyle and Tom Glynn-Carney) seem wasted in the end when all three of them grow up and thus recast by an older group of actors. The script also tries so hard to make Collins' and Hoult's characters connect romantically, but watching the clumsy conversations take place, is just too painful to look at.The road of these group of friends leads eventually to creating their own fellowship and constant reminder of Helheimr's spirit, which becomes some sort of code to seize the day and don't back out because it looks hard or ethically incorrect. Several situations turn out more challenging, but just like shouting the word ""Shazam!"" can turn anyone into a superhero, Helheimr can turn every chicken into a daredevil. Backed up by Thomas Newman's score, the Lord of the Rings-trilogy is never far away and sometimes feels too closely inspired by Howard Shore's score. Careful there Newman, many others have dipped their toes in other people's waters with consequences..To me, Hoult feels miscast and that's a pity. The leading cast can't seem to catch a break with failing box office results and critical abominations (X-Men: Dark Phoenix having been released in Australia just a week prior to this is not helping Hoult's career..), so I really wish for them to try something completely different. Hoult and Collins are brilliant actors who know how to deliver their lines, but don't look challenged and mostly bored.Tolkien tries so hard to convince us how talented the writer himself was, but the Lord of the Rings trilogy already showed us that. And that's something no one will ever underestimate. Undoubtedly a film that didn't have a purpose or destination.",Tolkien
69,eyeintrees,A good attempt at knowing the person,8,23 February 2020,"I once saw an interview with Tolkien when he was an old man. He clearly stated that his books were not about the first world war but that they were so much more. I think the man was a genius who touched otherworldly things and that's why we love his books.
This movie tells a story, I can't know how much is true since movie makers these days embellish where they want to and make stuff up but I feel it was a good attempt at reaching something that Tolkien saw and understood and felt about life and it was delivered in an almost magical way. I enjoyed this movie and that surprises me since I seemed to read so many bad reviews of it and yet it took us for an interesting ride into a world of friendships and intellects that felt quite wonderful.",Tolkien

This movie is intelligent, subtle, a realistic portrayal of the time period and genuinely sincere about the good and bad sides to life. The comradery in the movie was beautiful.If you have teenage children, I recommend you consider this movie carefully as it shows just how important it is to have bonds with others. It shows that these friendships may be strained or built in the most unusual of circumstances.In a period of superhero movies that are both shallow and insincere, it's so important to have a change of pace.

While this film is no adventure it is both funny and touching as the subject evolves like one of the characters in his stories.

73,pritol,Lightweight Tolkien biopic...,6,4 January 2020,"I am a huge fan of Tolkien's work, and have often read about his personal history and the development of Middle Earth.The film is effectively anchored on the love story between JRR Tolkien and his future wife Edith Bratt. Whilst the performances from both Nicholas Hoult and Lily Collins are strong, the acting from some of the cast does often come across as hammy with some rather cliched dialogue.Whilst there are some nice touches, such as Edith dancing in the woods, which would later be Tolkien's inspiration for the story of Beren and Luthien...Unfortunately the film doesn't focus enough on any of it's central themes; the creation of middle earth, the effect of the war on Tolkien, the loss of his friends, or actually his love for Edith.All this makes the film seem a little bit rushed, shallow and lightweight. It is enjoyable but it's a very easy watching film that doesn't require much attention.",Tolkien
74,JankiSharma,It all began with a great mother,10,24 May 2019,"The movie ""Tolkien"" about J.R.R. Tolkien , the writer of great novels, directed by Dome Karukoski is very inspiring. Mabel Tolkien ( very pleasant Laura Donnelly) raised her 2 sons John Ronald Tolkien and younger son Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien. She instilled in Ronald love of books by reading stories and enacting characters. Mabel gave her sons freedom to experience the outdoors and encouraged imagination. She taught her sons the fun of finding treasure in life. When she died in her early 30s, both brothers had to be on their own. Ronald had three great friends who made a pact to face life with courage because in the end all have to die. The movie is beautiful and emphasizes how upbringing of pure, innocent and beautiful minds can lead to great imaginative adults. J.R.R Tolkien wrote great novels and Lord of the Rings and Hobbit are product of great imagination. I enjoyed the movie a lot and cherish knowing and understanding JRR Tolkien's childhood and adulthood events.

77,trevorwomble,Very earnest if uneven drama,7,12 May 2019,"The early life experiences of celebrated author J R R Tolkien are told to see how they affected his future works and the person he became.Although born in South Africa, Tolkien was brought up in England in the early part of the twentieth century. This film tells his story, in a fractured linear style, taking in his early years, the death of his mother, his schooling and time at Oxford University, through his wartime experiences and into his early academic career, before he became famous. The film deals with how his early experiences affected him as a person, his relationships in particular, and how his Lord of the Rings novel can be seen to be an indirect metaphor on these relationships and conflict.Nicholas Hoult has a very hard role to interpret here, an un-showy one of a man surrounded by repression and rules and how he navigates the misfortune he encounters. Perhaps Hoult felt a little bit wooden at time but I think that is more down to how the character Is written rather than Hoult's acting skills. And whilst at times the film feels slightly bogged down with the human drama, it redeems itself in some visually stunning scenes of life on the front line in WW1, intercut with the academic starchiness and order of life at Oxford as a student. The blood, mud and slaughter is extremely well portrayed and helps to keep the film going when I felt the story was in danger of to flagging and slowing the film down to an almost Merchant-Ivory pace.Reminding me a bit of the 2017 film 'Goodbye Christopher Robin', which treads similar ground about another famous author, 'Tolkien' lack's that films' cohesiveness and strong characterisations but it is still a story that is worth watching. Both Tolkien and A.A Milne's wartime experiences had a lasting impact on them (as it did on everyone) but for those interested in what it was that made Tolkien write such unusual stories and where the inspiration came from, this film may help shed some light.",Tolkien

It sadly doesn't offer too many tip offs to Lord of the Rings in the movie other than the World War looking a bit like the dead marshes, as well as the Nasgul coming in when Tolkien runs through no mans land.How accurate the movie was I can't say, but it told an interesting story, particularly Tolkien's journey with his friends during high school and university. Tolkien is shown to be a gifted linguistic, and the surprise of his university and romance failures were a great chance to see how he rose from the bad hand he was dealt (including his mother's death). This makes him quite relatable and an inspiration.A great movie if you're keen for an easy watch.",Tolkien

Unlike many viewers, I'm not bored by biopics that present things dryly. However, just 20 minutes into this movie I knew why Tolkien's family refuses to endorse it. I guess that there is something remarkable about a biopic that seems fictionalized yet is profoundly boring. If you think that people tossing sugar cubes at random strangers' hats is subversive and entertaining, you might love this film. As for me, I wish that they had drawn more material from Tolkien's experiences during World War I-- especially if his non-military life was so boring. If he was truly at The Battle of the Somme-- one of the most hellish battles in human history-- then it's definitely worthy of further study.This film also seems to veer away from its subject and focus too much on his acquaintances. There is a very sluggish and drawn out scene during which of the characters confronts his father in a very passive way (yawn). The father slowly yields to him. Yay. Someone who knew Tolkien won a sotto voce faceoff with his father. How fascinating..........

82,quiqueperezsoler,An inspirational journey to any day dreamer out there,8,14 June 2019,"Granted it might not be fully accurate to what might have really happened, but boy, this movie takes you to places you might have long forgotten existed.With a score as magical as the artistic journey J R R Tolkien goes through, this movie is not trying to be a biography of how he wrote the Hobbit nor any of the nearly 200 books he ended up writting in his life but rather it centers on who Tolkien was as a person and the struggles he went through in his life. It is filled with symbolism and iconography that reminisce of the Lord of the Rings movies in terms of music style and aesthetic choices. These not only provide a visual cue to match the imaginative descriptions narrated by Tolkien but also enhances these to provide a bit of fantasy and insight to how the author imagines it.The movie does hurry up in some scenes that may benefit from allowing more development as they lack further explanation but when it's time to deliver his Middle Earth inspirations the movie does so in such a poetic and inspirational way that you may even start to wonder if this is more of ""the legend"" of how Tolkien came to write that story rather than a facts-dumping biographical approach. At times we seek a way to escape reality through fantastic stories that would carry us to astounding worlds and the movie provides hints at the world building behind Tolkien's mind as well as creative decisions influenced by the many tragic and wonderful events in his life. He draws from loss, comradery, philology and most importantly: love.It could have been just another addition to the well-documented life of one of the most prolific writers in history but it chose to rather approach it similarly to how 2004's Finding Neverland did with the Peter Pan tale and provide a sort of ""inspirational journey"" to the creation of Middle Earth. At first I feared the audience would be treated to yet another ""expose"" of the horrors of war and how they can destroy a person's spirit but instead the movie take the more optimistic approach while staying true to the true events. As delivered in the trailer, the film provides a story of how in hopeless times of turmoil a person can find a way to escape that reality and create a wonderful adventure in a far away land where, in a hole in the ground, there lived a Hobbit....",Tolkien

The musical score is lush while the original script by David Gleeson and Stephen Beresford, telling the captivating tale of four young men and a lovely girl, is delightfully written. Dome Karukoski's superb direction brought out impeccable performances by the brilliant cast of young and older actors, from newcomers like Harry Gilby to seasoned veterans like Colm Meaney and Derek Jacobi. Nicholas Hoult as Tolkien and Lily Collins as Edith Bratt are reliable as always. The only downside for me is that the movie's spirited first half took a dark turn following the outbreak of the First World War.

85,JamesIan2021,....Awkward,4,7 May 2019,"Nicholas Hoult has given some great performances in the past, from his insane turn in Mad Max Fury Road to his sweet and memorable role in About A Boy, so the man has proven his acting chops, but what happened here?Nicholas Hout, dare I say it, single handedly ruined this movie, in my eyes at least. He is incredibly bland, emotionless, one-note, tired and overall flat as J.R.R. Tolkien. In the last 5 minutes of the film, he almost cries, almost, and that's about as much expression you'll get.The rest of the cast dance around Hoult with stellar performances. Lily Collins is an absolute joy to watch, and the young actors playing Tolkien and his friends are that good, that I would've happily seen a movie that was just about them, their time together at college and their fellowship.Hoult's monotone line delivery sticks out like a sore thumb, so when his co-stars Anthony Boyle, Patrick Gibson and Tom Glynn-Carney come onscreen, their already strong performances are elevated even further because of how flat Hoult is. I'm so surprised.The film itself is at times slow, but then at times rather enjoyable. It's shot nicely, with a very clean image and vibrant colours, though it feels like a 3-4 part BBC TV drama. The war sequences are so dull, with a horrible mish-mash of wobbly fantastical elements mixed in with war, it doesn't work yet they keep clashing together through monotonous flashbacks to Tolkien's time in the trenches.Thomas Newman's score, though, is terrific. It's warming, soothing and fits every scene perfectly, at times it sounded like something out of Harry Potter, which is a positive, allowing me to remember the good times watching those films compared to sitting through this rather slog of a feature.",Tolkien

89,Paddy-49,"Searching for the early roots of the genius of the author of ""The Lord of the Rings""",7,9 May 2019,"Towards the end of this biopic of the early life JRR Tolkien the author describes his relationship at school in the first decade of the Twentieth Century with three friends. It was more than ""friendship"" he says - it was ""fellowship"". This is a signal about the passion that was to drive Tolkien's great work ""The Lord of the Rings"". The long and at times tortuous journey of that fantastical trilogy is matched in this movie by the journey of that youthful fellowship, a journey that was to be ended in the horrors of the Battle of the Somme. Here, in a brilliant depiction of the tragedy of that dreadful war, we see at the most intimate level the effect of warfare on individuals. There is courage, and love and death on the desolate battlefield of the Somme a precursor of Mordor in middle-Earth. The craters are battle craters full of blood surrounded by death - Tolkien is rescued and survives but his memory is forever scarred by what he saw - memories that recur frequently in his writings.Before the outbreak of war we are in an english idyll where youth and friendship seem to have a permanence that was to be shattered by war. We also see Tolkien's courtship of Edith Bratt (Lily Collins) a love match that had its problems but was soon to triumph despite the stresses of the times. If the ""story so far"" sounds a tad unoriginal and derivative to be frank that is true. Tolkien's work was much more interesting than his life, though the connection between the two is convincingly covered. Where the life catches the interest is when Tolkien switches course at Oxford from classics to language and literature and comes under the influence of the brilliant philologist Professor Joseph Wright - a fine portrayal by Derek Jacobi. Here his interest in language is given solid academic underpinning and the roots of his Elvish languages are planted.Tolkien is played with restraint and sympathy by Nicholas Hoult who captures the unique brilliance of the character rather as Eddie Redmayne did Stephen Hawking in ""The Theory of Everything"". Because the story in the movie ends before Tolkien's great work began publication we see only some of the roots and sources of his creative inspiration not their flowering. The Great War was rich material for great Art, and still is. As an influence on JRR Tolkien it was relevant to what he later did as well as to his personal life - how could it not be? But as with Hawking there was a unique genius without an equal in his creativity and the intellect that underpins it. We only get hints of that in the movie.The production values are high in ""Tolkien"" and the performances are consistently good. I did not, I confess, find the theme of the fellowship of the four school friends particularly interesting. I wanted perhaps to dig deeper into Tolkien himself - his genius may not be easy to explain - maybe it is impossible to do so.",Tolkien

It was only when he started writing The Hobbit that you felt that shiver of recognition, and then it ended. In all, I wanted it to be set in the time just as it ended.

Though this movie never quite reaches that movie's level, it is very good, very well acted and directed for

97,Essex_Rider,A very good adaptation,9,21 April 2020,"Having read the Humphrey Carpenter biography, This is a pretty good representation. Of course, you can't pack an entire work into a movie, but you can see where many of the words Tolkien wrote had their beginnings. Tolkien himself acknowledged his great admiration for the officer's batman (orderly in the U.S) so you can see where the inspiration for Sam Gamgee sprang from. You can also see why later fantasy writers came nowhere close. Tolkien was a professor of Philology (languages), he had been 'inside' language, he invented these languages from a love and knowledge of the Norse and Welsh languages. This movie tries to explain this, a little clumsily but a really good show. Tolkien was also greatly moved by his experiences in WWI, the loss of friends, the unbelievable numbers of dead. He often said he hated allegory, yet in much of his work, you can see where his experiences show through in almost allegorical terms. I think this movie was directed, acted and made out of love, love for the greatest modern author ever and what he gave us. A world so rich and full, with a working language that had a rich syntax and structure. It's why it's so believable. I will watch this again because I always seem to miss the little nuances the first time around, and I dropped a star because much of his early years in Sarehole were 'so' important to him. All in all, a very very good movie.",Tolkien

The portrait of Edith is probably mostly accurate and ""Silmarillion"" fans will appreciate inclusion of a key scene, although more could have been done with it. Unfortunately, the movie adds a lot of made-up scenes that certainly did not happen as they would have been out of character. They were standard Hollywood cliché scenes with manufactured drama. Any serious Tolkien fan would either guffaw, or like me, be offended. It's a real person's life and should have been more accurately portrayed. I also would have liked some scenes from Tolkien's early life in South Africa, but there were none.The film stops when Tolkien is a young professor with a young family, so it is not a biopic in the usual sense. It is about Tolkien's youth, the TCBS and his romance with Edith.",Tolkien
99,jhboswell,Lovely Film About the Greatest Writer of the 20th Century,8,18 May 2019,"Professor John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, author of The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and other related and non-related works, has now become the object of a biographical British film, directed by a Finn. Since Peter Jackson's films were so successful a few years ago, it is natural the film world would explore the possibility of another success, and so now we have this fairly nice take on his life. Tolkien was a private man: he didn't give many interviews and there are very few biographies available. He was first and foremost a scholar of languages, and not a pop icon.Let me interrupt my comments on the film to share with you my own association with Professor Tolkien's works. I first read The Lord of the Rings in the late sixties, and like most people I was swept away with the breadth of this otherworld, Middle-earth. I joined the Tolkien Society of America and wore ""Frodo Lives!"" buttons (briefly). When I first went to England in 1974, a year after the professor had passed away, I visited Oxford and met Charley Boswell, his last caretaker; and phoned his son Christopher to ask when The Silmarillion would be ready. (He thanked me for ringing.) So, I'm a big fan.This movie, then, does a pretty good job depicting his tragic childhood, his early struggles, and his courtship of Edith Bratt. I liked the premise of visions and flashbacks during his combat experiences--tantalizing views at Sauron, the Nazgul, and other objects of his horror were very nicely placed. There wasn't much said about his Christianity, but he wasn't very explicit about it either, and his deep Catholic faith was portrayed as a negative influence on him. Like other reviewers, I wish it would have gone on a little longer, perhaps until we met C. S. Lewis and the other Inklings, who were such a powerful influence on his creativity. I would have liked to have seen him submitting The Hobbit typescript to his first publishers, Raynor and Unwin, and to be reminded that it was the publisher's ten-year-old son who approved its publication and thus began the Tolkien furor.The acting was good, the settings were lovely (though I wish we had been treated to more of Oxford), and the story moves along pretty well.

100,downthehobbitholeblog,Don't need to be a fan of LOTR to enjoy this movie!,8,8 May 2019,"JRR Tolkien is considered one of the greatest fantasy writers of the century (And I'll add- one that really empowers women). But who and what was the inspiration behind his mythology and the fantastic worlds that he created? He was orphaned as a child, a soldier in his twenties, and an Oxford professor who wrote one of the most prolific sagas of our time. And while you may have heard of the fellowships he had later in life, have you heard of the original fellowship? The first ring? His real life fairytale? This movie tells the tale of what influenced Tolkien in the first two decades of his life.
Check out our family review and discussion guide- along with what parents need to know before you go!- on our blog at Down The Hobbit Hole Blog dot com.
Our team all felt a little differently about the film- coinciding with our varying degrees of LOTR fandom. We are excited about the movie though. The acting, soundtrack and filmography were all done very well! And while we all reacted differently to what was or what was not included in the film- I think we all can agree that the movie is worth seeing! It skims the surface of the epic life that JRR Tolkien led and hopefully will make you want to go read more of his stories and more about his life. You DO NOT need to be a fan of Lord of the Rings to enjoy this. And if you are a superfan you probably will not be terribly upset over the authenticity of the storyline. More than just an origin story, more than just a romance, it's the beginning of a really engaging fairy tale. If you love LOTR and D&D or if you don't but you liked the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society book or movie- this movie has something for you. It's an inspiring watch.",Tolkien
101,smoothrunner,Flat and boring melodrama about some fictional character (not actual Tolkien),3,12 August 2019,"The main problem with this flick is that despite its title it is not about Tolkien at all. This movie takes some actual facts from Tolkien's biography (like his name or name of his wife) and connects them into the new story in the way that this story has nothing in common with the actual Tolkien, his views and writings. When facts of Tolkien's life aren't feet into the movie's narrative it simply ignores them and invents new ""facts"". You don't have to be Tolkien's scholar or read his complete autobiography to notice this disconnection. It would be enough to read some Tolkien's letters and to be briefly accustomed with Tolkien's life and activities to see that this flick only uses Tolkien's name as a vehicle of propaganda of views and ideas completely alien to the protagonist of the story. So if you want to learn something about Tolkien's life or views you should stay away of this flick as its title is misleading and the story is about someone else - flat and one-demensional character, like all fictional characters in poorly written stories are.The flick itself, though not about Tolkien, at least could have been interesting in its own fictional narrative. But the movie fails here as well. It is boring and unimaginative, the characters are flat and dull. The movie tells about some triggered emasculated boy, ""rebelling against the system"", while being separated from the ""strong independent woman"" (his love) by the ""evil priest"" (it is quite funny if you actually know that Tolkien was a dedicated Catholic, who, as he wrote to his son, did never regret his decision to ""drop"" the love-affair until 21 and married Edith only after she converted to Catholicism from Protestantism, moreover, he was a conservative and convinced monarchist who volunteered to participate in the Great War). The storytelling is melodramatic and pretentious to the extent that you should know nothing about actual Tolkien and should really be into the same ideological pattern with the creators of this flick to enjoy this caricature.",Tolkien

111,REVVINCENT,Gripping . . .,9,9 December 2020,"Having watched ""Tolkien"" 4 or 5 times (I lost count!), I likely will watch it again. I am a HUGE fan of Nicholas Hoult, seeing him first when he was in the Jaguar Motorcar TV commercials. Hoult has a striking sense of presence.The brilliance of JRR Tolkien is revealed superbly. I have not explored what is fact or fiction in this movie, because I am happy to accept it ""as is"". The interplay between Tolkien and Professor Wright is absolutely awesome. The genius of Tolkien is displayed wonderfully.The early segment of the movie, where JRR and his brother are orphaned upon their mother's death is sorrowing. When John Tolkien (JRR) corrects the professor for mispronouncing his last name is totally awesome. Done with full respect in a most stately manner, the professor is somewhat miffed. Yet, John gains enormous respect when speaking from memory a passage from a book the students are trying to read aloud. Harry Gilby as young Tolkien is superb.Lily Collins as Edith exudes warmth and love. It is only appropriate that she and John would later marry. The ending segment is inspiring.The segment featuring the Battle of the Somme is uncomfortable, at least for me. The violence is somewhat exaggerated, inspired by Tolkien's trench fever. The clip where he is lying among soldiers' dead bodies above a pool of blood did not lend well to the overall personality of the movie.The energy in this film is powerful. Each time I have watched it, I catch something anew. Hoult's brilliance as an actor, a strikingly handsome one at that, is on full display.",Tolkien

115,orgrinrt,"A beautiful, heart-wrenching portrayal",8,16 June 2021,"This is a story very close to most, I'd imagine. Of course, only a select few will ever touch the humankind in the way people like Tolkien do, to ever leave such a mark, but I believe this depiction has themes that touch and have touched most, if not all of us.I will mention first and foremost, that I am a big fan of Tolkien's work and the worlds he has built. I've always been the type of person to get immersed in the characters, stories and the lore of the worlds I read, not their authors. As such, I don't have much exposure into Tolkien himself.So, I can not say whether this portrayal is authentic to the subject, but I find it irrelevant in this context. Whether things happened this way, whether these stories are true, doesn't change the experience one has when experiencing it.As with most things, I tend to put things in perspective. Historic productions, unless explicitly produced as documentaries, will always have a great deal of fiction in the mix, if only to fill in the blanks. I don't regard this any different just because it's a more modern period and a much more recent person being portrayed.There are a few different things here that I could relate to personally; The struggle as a younger man to find one's place in the world, the constant battle between the things you love and what you have to do. The sacrifices that inevitably come with it.The kind of friendship portrayed here -- a fellowship, as the movie makes a point of saying -- is one most can probably relate to. Not to the same extent, of course, and not everyone, but most would probably recognize that feeling of bond and brotherhood.This makes the latter parts of the movie all the more heartbreaking. I won't go into spoilers or anything, but as we close the end of this tale, it starts hitting fairly hard.The pacing of the movie feels a little off at certain points. Generally I like my movies slower rather than fast-paced, and this movie is no exception, so the problem doesn't lay there. The pacing problems come with the wildly different time periods the movie has to jump between. As a whole, the movie is a perfect compromise in terms of speed, but has way too much to show and tell in one go. I think it could have benefited the movie greatly if it was at least an hour longer. But alas, we are talking about a movie, and as a movie I think it hits the correct spot as a whole.This is a beautiful story with inspiring arcs. The scenery and props work wonders to immerse you in and it's all directed and shot very beautifully. The actors do a tremendous job across the board. But there's a very heavy undertone looming under the shiny surface, and some absolutely heartbreaking moments that left me, a grown man, crying. Not to say that grown men are less susceptible to cry, it's simply a rhetoric way to emphasis that for those of us that do relate to many themes involved, this movie can conjure the famous lump in the throat.Of course, there are a lot more to it -- love and courtship, inspiring characters that help guide one's way to a legend and of course, the war. I don't want to get too much into it, since the things stated prior are the things I wanted to say.I want you to experience it for yourself, if you haven't.Now, as to the hot topic of being true to the source... I can not say whether that is truly a major problem with the movie. But I will, inspired by this movie, be seeking out some materials to read about Tolkien's life.And I think I will re-read the adventures written by the protagonist of this story, from the very beginning.",Tolkien

The acting was wonderful, the script very well written with a small gripe and the structure and pacing of this movie were perfect.Lily Collins is stunning and elegant as Edith. However, after seeing her in several interviews it was a sore disappointment to learn that she's a far cry from the admirable lady she portrays. A testament to her acting, of course, less so for her personality.Nicholas Hoult as Tolkien was very good, as the character in the movie he was very convincing however as far as the real Tolkien goes, far less so. But that's not his fault, that's where my main gripe with the writing comes into play. None of Tolkien's wit and mastery of the English language was really shown anywhere.

121,s-maniatopoulos,"Beautiful, poetic and touching",8,12 August 2019,"""Tolkien"", the movie about the formative years of JRR Tolkien is beautifully shot, and tells the story of friends who grew up together only to perish in WW1, one of them being -of course- Tolkien himself. This movie stands out because it presents the coming of age with an air of sweetness, nostalgia and lyricism that one cannot help but to think of their childhood, adolescence, growing up and (maybe) the good friends that got lost along the way.
The direction and photography are excellent and so is the remarkable soundtrack.
Though this movie does not delve deep into the lore of Tolkienfandom, it makes an excellent case about how a young man found happiness in philology, the study of Gothic languages and eventually turned out to be the famous writer we all know.
I highly recommend Tolkien, because it makes everyone who watches it feel special, by reminding us that our memories, our friends and our youth are important; and that despite the tragedies that we all eventually encounter sooner or later in life, we must always move on.Though not everyone can be a Ringbearer, we all deserve to be proud of our own myths.",Tolkien

123,epaulguest,Opportunity sadly missed,5,6 July 2019,"J. R. R. Tolkien is best known for ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Hobbit"", but Dome Karukosi's film focuses on his early life till he becomes an Oxford don and suggests how his prodigious flair for philology and early Germanic languages developed. However, there's no strong focus on this and I think too much time is spent on his antics with fellow pupils at a grammar school in Birmingham.Flashbacks from his service in WW1 (in which he suffered tragic losses) and scenes from his early childhood, which was rather complicated, are more substantial; likewise the beginnings of his relationship with Edith Bratt, his future wife. All these and his school life could, however, have been secondary to his intellectual development and achievements.On his first day at the grammar school we see him reciting lines from Chaucer in perfect Middle English, with a convincing accent, after an obnoxious teacher mocks his surname. While it's not clear if there's any truth in this, he did teach himself Old English (Anglo-Saxon) as a boy. By the way, having studied Old English though not very good at it, I was pleased to recognise a quotation, near the end of the film, from the epic poem ""The Battle of Maldon"": ""Courage shall be the greater as our strength lessens"" (maybe not the same wording as in the film).Tolkien's specialist fields are rather esoteric, but less so than those of the mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan, central to ""The Man Who Knew Infinity"" (2016), directed by Matthew Brown. The latter film succeeds, even so, in charting Ramanujan's life and work very clearly. I wonder whether it influenced this film: Ramanujan had a mentor at Cambridge, the distinguished mathematician G. H. Hardy, while Tolkien seems to have had a mentor at Oxford, the great philologist Joseph Wright. It's not certain, though, that Tolkien begged to join Wright's course as he does in the film.The scene in which Tolkien recites lines from Chaucer by heart could have been a major turning point. Sadly, the opportunity to explore his development as an extremely distinguished scholar and imaginative writer was missed.As Tolkien, Nicholas Hoult is quite charming and Lily Collins portrays Edith Bratt as both sensitive and yet forceful. They formed a very solid, enduring relationship. Derek Jacobi only has a minor role as Joseph Wright but makes a real impact.",Tolkien
124,austincoleman-66971,Helheimr!,8,10 May 2019,"It seems as if most of the complaints about this movie lie in the fact that Tolkien fits a pretty conventional mold for a biopic. But lets be honest, it would be extremely difficult to tell this story with the same imaginative flair as the person of Tolkien himself. That is just the nature of this beast and frankly should not detract from being able to find some sort of connection with Tolkien as a person.For me, this was a touching story of friendship that although didn't explore their ultimate depth, highlighted several themes found throughout Tolkien's work. Though this is not an origin story of LOTR, in some ways it portrays the types of events that led to its conception.I absolutely loved Tolkien and was able to relate to him through Hoult's performance far more than I expected. The supporting cast is also great...obviously Lily Collins steals the show and the T.C.B.S. is a joy to watch (seriously...every ""Helheimr!"" moment was genuinely moving and perhaps even inspiring). I thought these supporting characters in particular were bolstered by the writing, which I was thoroughly impressed by.Of course I am a little biased, but I think Tolkien does about as good as it could have trying to capture the life experiences of one of the most influential writers we have ever seen. The only real issues I have is that it feels a little long and sure, despite its source material it did feel afraid to take certain imaginative risks.Regardless, I highly recommend this film and would like to think that even if the viewer isn't a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien, they will walk away from this movie as one. Stylistically conventional or not, is this not what a biopic should primarily be?",Tolkien

Unlike other biopics which are not much more than the greatest hits albums of some musician or all the tabloid scandals of some celebrity played out, this film goes out of its way to avoid overtly using Tolkien's works as a crutch to draw in audiences. It instead focuses on the man and his life. Although, I must state that having read Tolkien's books in advance allowed me to understand the film better. It is chock-full of scenes that illustrate the origins for many of his fictional locations, people, and themes.

128,gandalf_theWise14,Intriguing depiction of the life of the greatest fantasy writer ever,5,10 August 2019,"Starting off, I am a huge fan of Tolkien and all of his work. I have always been fascinated with the way that he tells stories, and this film gives some insight into what he was like, as well as the events and people that influenced his stories.Being a biopic, this film does not have any real focus or plot line, rather it follows the life of Tolkien from his school years to the war, and then a small amount of time after the war. It moves in a bit of a weird way, as most of the storytelling of his younger years seems to be in flashbacks he is having during a critical point in the war. We visit moments of his life in the years before the war before moving back to where he is in the war, searching for one of his best friends, hoping to find him alive. The film seems to be building up to the time when Tolkien will find his friend, but then this never happens, and the war is suddenly over and Tolkien is back home. We then get very little time after the war before the film ends, and most of this time is spent showing Tolkien talking with the mother of one of his friends who died in the war. We then get a look at Tolkien coming up with the stories of Middle Earth before the film ends a bit suddenly.The main focus of Tolkien was the friendship he had with his group of friends. I really liked the way they depicted this as the most influential thing in Tolkien's life, as you can tell from his stories that he truly values friendship and knows the importance of it. The film shows where this strong feeling comes from for Tolkien, which I think is really important. I also liked the focus on his fascination with language, albeit mostly later in the movie. Language is such an important piece of Tolkien's work (he came up with entire fictional languages by himself!) The plot point about the relationship between him and his future wife is also done very well, and shows the influence that she and their story had on his writing. There are many emotionally moving moments around this story that can be truly great to watch. However, I do feel like there were elements of his life that seemed quite important that felt skimmed over, as if there was more to tell but they either ran out of time or just didn't feel the need to include it. For example, the professor that he meets at Oxford seems like he had a huge influence on Tolkien, at least from this movie he does, but we spend very little time with his character which was quite disappointing.Both Hoult and Collins give great performances in this film that do the characters they are playing justice. They both create very likable personas, and you want to see them succeed as you watch the movie. Tolkien's friend group is also portrayed very well throughout the film and holds their own acting-wise as well.The pacing in this movie is, however, a bit off at times. It seems like we might spend a ton of time on one very small thing in his life and then just skip over a few months, or even years of his life. When making a film about someone's life, it can be very difficult to work around problems like this, but it felt like it could have been done a bit better. At times there isn't much excitement going on for extended periods of time. As a Tolkien fan, I was not bothered and found most of the film quite interesting. Someone who is not familiar with him or his works, however, may not.Tolkien works well as a film showing the early years of the life of the titular writer. The actors nail their performances, and Tolkien fans will have a good time with it, despite some pacing problems. However, it doesn't really offer enough for non-fans to get into the film, so it would likely be boring to anyone not interested in Tolkien or his work. Otherwise, it's a good depiction of the life of one of the greatest writers ever.",Tolkien

Authentic fellowship and tragedy about Tolkien that helps you understand why he created languages and eventually The Hobbitt. Love every minute of it.",Tolkien
134,Robotvideo,Ultimately missed the point,5,16 May 2019,"I'm a big fan of Tolkien's work and was expecting a film about his life to be about how his experiences are reflected in his writings. We see some of this in the film, but by the end it seemed that the makers didn't really understand the connection. The actors were very good and the scenery was spectacular, but we only received very small glimpses of how the events paralleled his writing. For example, the area he grew up in became The Shire. His school friends were the Hobbits. No Man's Land in WWI became Mordor. The film presents a few transition images to suggest this, but someone unfamiliar with Tolkien or his work will not make the connection. The most the film acknowledges this is at the end when a statement appears before the credits stating that later in life JRR Tolkien became a successful writer. If you completely remove the aspect of his writing as an expectation, the story had little drive or payoff at the end, and did not make for an engaging romance.One aspect that was interesting is realizing that schools aren't what they used to be. The movie depicted old Oxford University, which was more like Hogwarts from Harry Potter then the online based money driven degree factories of today. The environment nurtured his talent for languages in a way that does not happen today.Overall, not a bad movie, but if you are a Tolkien fan you will walk away wishing you could have made it yourself because too many things just didn't resonate. The illustration of how significant the phrase, ""In a hole in the ground there lived a Hobbit."" really was, doesn't happen.",Tolkien
135,elenipnyc,This film made me weep,8,11 May 2019,"Tolkien's friendships and literary circle are wonderfully depicted and this is what makes the ending so moving. The young men from school have a certain friendly chemistry onscreen that makes you understand how they inspired one another to excellence. I had visited the Tolkien exhibit at The Morgan Library a few weeks before seeing this film and so was prepared a bit for his biopic. JRR Tolkien's life is that of the person with a talent and a calling who follows and uses them. He wrote and illustrated his own work. He created languages and wrote the stories that would give these languages ""a home."" He was in love with a girl and they married and had four children. The scenes in the trenches of WWI are woven throughout the film as the Great War was the turning point in his life. This film is worth watching if you are a fan of his books. You will learn how he came to certain ideas.",Tolkien
136,kylere,Fanboy level tripe,2,13 August 2019,"To save you some time, the Tolkien wikipedia article is far more interesting than the Tolkien biopic in EVERY REGARD.The Film is written with the depth of a Duran Duran video and it hammers you over the head with imagery meant to invoke Middle Earth. The problem is that it is not done artistically, but ""monied-artistically"" to the point it is gaudy, as if walking into the home of a billionaire who is desperate to impress you with his baseball card collection.The time spent on Tolkien at the Battle of the Somme throughout the film does not contribute much other than hamfisted attempts to draw allegories back to the books. Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" did a better job of saying war is hell with less, was more artistic and had a better score.Tolkien's love affair is as exciting as toast, and his entire life story is presented with him as a magical Mary-Sue type character who can do no wrong.Yawn.I am sure some acting was done, but the writing and direction made this flick absolute tripe.",Tolkien

But I'm not completely sure how I feel about it.I don't mean that in a bad way at all, it has some great moments and the acting is particularly good. The theming and set was also beautiful and I wouldn't say at any point was I bored, in fact it is a very gripping film.But I'm just not sure what the point was. Of course, as a fan of some of his stories, I love getting a glimpse of his life and learning about his adolescence was fantastic. But what did the film makers desire to achieve? They seemed caught in between signposting what they deemed the most important moments of his life were, the relationships with his friends, his courting of Edith and his involvement in the war, but without giving any of those story strands the focus needed to make them truly impactful. Also on top of this I'm still very confused as to what really inspired him to write The Lord of the Rings, other than he had some great friends who called themselves a fellowship and the war was a particularly horrible experience for him (bearing in mind that it was for anyone at the time though). I just felt like the story needed narrowing down a bit more on things truly life changing. Surely it's not right that a mother's death is written off with nothing more then her falling off of her chair.Yet, even though I felt the film has certain areas for improvement, it still does deliver on what you wanted, and enjoyable so.

Oh and the fairy tale romance he is blessed with in his darkest hours. I almost felt jealous of the happy ending he gets after its mentioned several times how they were just impossible for people like us.

171,Le-Petit-Antoine,Karukoski ... has lost so much of the credibility he could've gained through this film,5,28 August 2019,"Tolkien (2019) - (M)
Tony Saad - Monday, 17 June, 2019(STAR), (STAR)The era of live-action biographies continues with the latest film by Dome Karukoski: Tolkien (2019). Portraying the life of bestselling author J.R.R. Tolkien, the film, focuses heavily on Tolkien's friendships and relationship with Edith Bratt. However, the movie lacks many of the moments that made the life of J.R.R. Tolkien so special.Set during Tolkien's (Nicholas Hoult) youth (Late 1890s to Early 1910s), the film focuses first on his early life as a child, then as a young budding linguist and artist who falls in love with a young girl named Edith Bratt (Lily Collins. This film evolves quite a bit on their romance, as she is seen a lot in the film.I like to watch star-crossed lovers myself, but this is not the most interesting aspect in a biography. Sure it's nice to see Tolkien and Edith together at the theatre, but surely there are more interesting things to look at. The film is also criminally unfaithful to Tolkien's life, as very little of it is actually covered in the 120 min biopic. Tolkien tries to be a coming of age story, a love story, an action film but cannot sew them all properly. That said, there does exist a good amount of chemistry between the actors.Karukoski should've taken the approach that Bharat Nalluri took in his biopic The Man who Invented Christmas starring Dan Stevens. That film focuses on Charles Dickens's life and its inspirations for A Christmas Carol much more fluently than Tolkien did. All the people in Dickens's life were vital to his creative energy, hence why that film is so good.The World War One scenes were a little surreal, with some claustrophobic moments inside the trenches. The sounds of the war were quite overwhelming, as if I was brought into the real thing, which was impressive to say While WW1 did serve as a creative inspiration for his books, revolving the film around the war scenes did not send their intended messages. Tolkien's friendships are tested at this time, and this worked fine. The war scenes were also cut in between different moments from Tolkien's life in a feeble attempt to suggest that he is reflecting on his experiences. The scenes did, of course, have Lord of the Rings and Hobbit themes and references to them. For instance, Smaug flies around the battlefield spewing fire at him, which turns out to be a hallucination. That was pretty clever use of CGI, but that's it.Tolkien tries, in vain, to revolve around WW1, rather than the author's most significant aspect: his Catholicism. That is the worst crime that any Tolkien biographer could possibly commit. Did you know, for instance, that it was his Catholic faith that inspired The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings? Did you know that it was Tolkien who converted fellow writer and beloved friend C.S. Lewis to Christianity, or that Tolkien's wife was Anglican? Unless you are a die-hard Tolkien fan, you'd probably be unaware of these amazing facts. At one point in the film, during a World War 1 flashback, there was a cross in the middle of the battlefield. It was cropped out to the right side of the frame, which I find to be the worst mistake a D.O.P can make.Nowadays, religion is increasingly becoming a taboo subject among many people. I bet if Tolkien lived in our modern society, he would not see much success for his works because of his Catholicism. What happened to open-minded people who listened to all arguments, good and bad? Today, religion is less seen as a guide for good, and more of a nuisance. People must accept that not all our heroes are as we imagine them. As a personal example: Steven Spielberg supports Israel and I am Lebanese.I am not suggesting that Karukoski focus only on Tolkien's religion, because to do so is to neglect his other angles. The film approaches religion subtly; supposedly like the Lord of the Rings books. But the books are more open about the faith; in fact they are metaphors of Catholicism. Karukoski, I believe, has lost so much of the credibility he could've gained through this film, but this does not inherently make him a vile man. I guess he could've been trying to stay neutral, but in biographies, there is no such thing as neutrality. A biography will always have some form of bias.Tolkien, as a film, is not too bad; it has good scenery and good chemistry between the characters. As a depiction of the real J.R.R. Tolkien though, it feels somewhat ashamed of itself, and as though it unwillingly touches on some of the most important elements of the author's life. A better biography would be Tolkien: A Biography (1977). That book does a much better job at depicting his life and history than Tolkien could ever hope to.© Tolkien Film Review, 2019.

As far as the negative comments about religion -- these people are blind. (spoiler alert) How much more do you need to know when he is put under the care of a priest who judges a relationship because of religion, but Tolkien's life of spirit/faith shines through.

174,avinashb75,An episodic narrative with a lot of padding,7,10 June 2019,"It seems like the movie is, through Tolkien's story, trying to tell a larger tale about love, friendship and loss, and how people deal with it. The narrative is surprisingly impersonal at times, purporting to be about JRR but straying through his friends and the impact of WW1. In a similar way that Bohemian Rhapsody was not strictly about Queen or Freddie, this movie is not strictly about Tolkien nor the Middle Earth world he created, but something in the middle.

I was intrigued how the director of this film was able to show Tolkien's childhood, and the one place that would forever influence his writing. Torn from his home, Tolkien faces adversity over and over and triumphs by gaining friends, who become as close as brothers. I enjoyed watching him grow up, find love, heartbreak, and then journey into a nightmare that was probably the seeds for future use in his writing.

182,brucelevitan-61732,"Great acting, shame about the accuracy",3,15 May 2019,"One knows that any ""biopic"" can never stick 100% to the facts about the people it portrays; but one hopes it will stick close enough to be true to them. When you make a ""biopic"" I guess it's a bit like reconstructing a jigsaw but with fewer pieces than the original. So what you have to do is change some of the details on some of the pieces in the hope that when you view the whole thing the picture is more or less the same as the original. However, if you tamper with too many of the pieces the resulting picture won't be a true reflection. In my view this movie has erred too much to that end. This is a really well made movie with great acting. It's very watchable and moving. But, for me, spoilt by the too many changes effect that I just described. Here are just a few examples (NB they include spoilers).
When Tolkien goes to university, there's a scene where he confronts his mates and says he's been ""sent down"" for not doing well enough in his Mods. This never happened. True, he didn't do too well, but he was never in any danger of being sent down.In the movie, the way he gets around this is by wooing the professor of linguistics, Joe Wright. At first the professor will have nothing to do with him, but is eventually won over and this ends with a scene where Tolkien starts to attend his lectures, having successfully transferred from Classics to Linguistics. In reality, Tolkien did indeed attend some of Wright's lectures... before the Mod exams just mentioned. His move to linguistics was at the suggestion of the Dean of Exeter College, and when he did transfer he was put under the care of a Canadian lecturer Kenneth Sissam, assistant to the Professor of English A.S. Napier. Wright's impact on Tolkien was great, but came much earlier on; and Tolkien's wooing of Wright never happened.Then there is his relationship with Edith Bratt, who he comes to love and marry. In the movie he makes a last moment declaration to her before going to war, and asks her to cut off her engagement to another man (and they kiss, of course). In fact they declared their love for each other in 1909, got engaged in 1913 and were married shortly before he went to war. Edith was briefly engaged to another, but Tolkien went to see her in Cheltenham to ask her to marry him (in 1913). The throwing of sugar lumps onto people's hats, as depicted in the film, did happen though (although not quite in the way illustrated in the movie). Father Francis' ban on Tolkien seeing Edith was, however, accurate.Now we come to the harrowing experience during the war where the sick young Tolkien desperately searches for his friend G.B. Smith in the trenches and out on the battlefield. In reality they did meet up a few times during the Somme campaign, but when Tolkien was taken sick with trench fever he was actually 12 miles behind the Lines at Beauval, was almost immediately hospitalised and removed even further from the front. The search for his friend simply never happened.I could quote other similar disparities. What emerges is a film that has deliberately over dramatised and over romanticised his story to the extent that what emerges is at best a ""rose tinted"" version of the real man. Tolkien did not like the idea of biographies, and would be turning in his grave at this mess I think. What really saddens me is that most people who see this movie won't read the excellent Humphrey Carpenter biography, and will take this movie version as the ""truth"".",Tolkien

Nicholas Hoult gives a very charming performance closely followed by Lily Collins and the two have great chemistry on screen. The way the story is split up between two distinctly different parts makes the movie feel fast paced and gripping.
I loved the way that the story ties in for his inspiration for the stories.

That said, I enjoyed the parts that your average movie-goer might find boring - most people wouldn't enjoy studying The Silmarillion, either - but like most contemporary Disney flicks it deliberately avoids dealing with Christian faith. In this respect, the movie is deliberately wrong.It's probably true that the makers could make more money by ignoring this aspect of history, and perhaps they sought to avoid social-swarming Alinskyite ridicule. An even simpler explanation might be that they don't understand or value faith well enough to portray it in a positive light.Regardless, for a Christian and a purist, this movie is more about ""Hollywood"" in all its money-making inaccuracy.

191,lfree-65889,"Excellent Film, So So Biography",6,2 June 2019,"A very British film about Tolkien, family, friends, and associates whose characters are well represented. As to events, most seem to be composites that happened somewhat differently than depicted. It's a story about the influences in the early life of John Roland Reuel Tolkien, first in family, then as an orphan. Comradeship between schoolmates through college and Word War I. Exploration of language, the play of words, what is love in its various forms. What is important in life and overcoming the obstacles. One sees imagination, story telling at play influenced by the activity around. One also sees a respectable courtship growing with Edith.
The scenes are intermingled with being in the trenches os the first World War on a quest of sorts. Largely absent is how Tolkien's Christian faith influenced how he lived life. From this film one would believe he's a secular moral man. It ends with the beginnings of family, being a professor, and the beginnings of becoming the writer for which he's known.This is an excellent film as to a life well lived, more for the thinking person, not one to be mindlessly entertained. As to biography, more pseudo that substantive. You get a good sense of the man and those around, the circumstances and places, but not so much as to accuracy. For this, read the biography.",Tolkien

195,deborah_leibundgut,A movie like a love poem for Tolkien,10,9 June 2020,"This movie is visually mesmerizing as it effortlessly weaves reality with imagination and inspiration. The story follows a young Tolkien through his formative years and the strong friendships he forms. His relationships and his experience of brotherhood during the war would inform his writing later on. The movie tells the story in absolutely beautiful pictures and less in so many words. It's a visual and music experience and a love letter to languages, words and the power of art and imagination.If you have read the Silmarillion, the true piece of writing that Tolkien worked on his entire life and which eventually birthed the stories of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, this movie will be perfect for you because it dives into the world that Tolkien lived in and imagined to create his narrative.It's not a classical bio pic telling you a straightforward, historically accurate life story but more of a dance of sound, music and pictures around the life of Tolkien.I think it's a perfect movie for the imagination and power of Tolkien. I love the earthy tones color palette and the fever induced visions of balrogs and ring wraiths on the battle field of WWI. If you know the story of Beren and Luthien, then you will see the love Tolkien has for Edith and how he immortalized her in this story.It's true that there are only a few women in Middle Earth, but if you know where Tolkien comes from and which Old Norse sagas inspired his writings and the love and friendship he experienced from his male peers, his storytelling becomes clear and seems natural. And the women he does describe, above all Luthien but also Arwen, Galadriel, and Eowyn are powerful, death defying, destiny changing, evil fighting, ethereal, overcoming odds power women. They are few and select but forces to be reckoned with. Galadriel has a very long backstory that is only lightly touched upon in LOTR and Eowyn defeats the Which King of Angmar who no man could kill.But above all, I love the love of trees that the movie shows, and if you truly have read the books and not only watched the movies, you would know how important and prevalent trees are in Middle Earth. The story Tolkien tells Edith during tea about Sellador is clearly a story that would eventually become Treebeard.A movie for Tolkien lovers to be honest, and if you are only a casual fan, I invite you to willing suspension of disbelief and to step into a visual poem of love and friendship that tells the story of one of the greatest story tellers of all time.",Tolkien

197,yankoulofska,Extremely well-produced...,9,14 November 2020,"...insight into the marvelously inspirational beginnings of Tolkiens world.Did not know what to expect from this - actually about Tolkien - when pressing play, and believe that was an advantage.Cinematically beautiful and visionary awaking made, it brings one straight to the edge of the in between , which is JRRs world of reality and 'Middle Earth', as we know so well. From the start hints to that this story is about what JRR lived, perceived and envisioned, while not so much about specifics of creating LotR per say.Would point out, for someone who as a kid was read his work aloud, and envision his stories, just as is portrayed in this film, that of course adds a sentimental value which positively heightened my appreciation and also understanding of this interpretation. Especially with a parent whom which both had an appreciation for the written, and later excitement of theatrical, rubbed of on his kids.Without the background of experiencing either the books, movies (or even so the history of JRR and it all), or lack of appreciation for what Middle Earth is, I can see how the movie could become lost on others.Of course, some might feel like it did not portray JRR's actual writing of books, or give enough attention to them. But in actuality it does more than that. With same tenderness and fluidity, as Tolkien himself saw and wrote, life and fantasy comes together in this movie to relay that.As read, in a fellow review above, which reflected (and complimented) the excellent portrayal of male tenderness and sentimental vulnerability without removing any masculinity. I couldn't agree more about how refreshing it was to see again, not since watching the trilogy... which was also pointed out. This hadn't been gathered into thought by myself yet, but ever so evident made one of the most rewarding and fundamental aspects of the film.
And in such binding together the main notion of brotherhood, from Tolkien's life and characters in LotR.
These constant underlying nudges & mentions to detail big or small, spoken or unspoken, referring and intertwining LotR & Tolkien again, showed just how thoughtfully construed and done the movie was.",Tolkien

199,bpododo,"A movie honoring Tolkien, done with gentleness",10,5 May 2019,"This are just a couple of my thoughts, not an actual review.I can't believe how tender the portrayal of male characters was, including Tolkien himself. And more specifically his friend group in his youth. I mean these men loved each other, cared for each other, cried and laughed together. Tell me one major movie in recent years with so many male leads who are not afraid of being so vulnerable sentimentally with each other. I'm honestly listening, I want to watch. The first one that comes in my mind is of course LOTR but you know who wrote it.The main theme that played whenever he started forming thoughts about Middle-earth was amazing. I could honestly tell each time a new idea was forming in his mind.I can't actually believe they included the time when he stole a bus in Oxford.And for the matter Oxford as a whole and the conversations he had with his linguistics professor.I absolutely adore how interested everyone seemed in his ideas and that no one laughed whenever he started talking in whatever language he chose to. Be it latin or old english or the elven languages. I have never been able in my life to talk freely about this side of myself, or my interest in languages or fantasy without being mocked or laughed at. It was so nice a change of pace to see him appreciated for his interests.I swear everyone in the theater cried towards the end of the movie when he meets with the mother of one of his deceased friends and they decide to publish his poetry.I love how they portrayed the idea of the nazgul, sauron and the balrog forming in his mind during the war scenes. Absolute amazing.And of course Edith. God I love how they show that she was a major influence in his writing. And that basically the entire Lord of the Rings is a love letter to her love for the Ring of the Nibelungs.",Tolkien

It follows Tolkien education and formation, as well as his love life. I believe it was inspiring, especially when the four boys got together and studied together, it somehow pushed my consciousness to be more dedicated to studying or adopt an attitude of constant improvement.However.. and perhaps this turns out to be a personal preference (or call it fantasy if you like), I was expecting more of the writing itself, the post publishing life, his years as a professor. I was expecting more of his research, of his dedication, of his world building, of his... but some people find these things boring. Perhaps LOTR fans will relate.From this point of view, I would rate the movie 1/10, because the actual writing that happens takes two to three minutes of the movie, which is sad, but I still want to believe the movie was quite good and that it catches key moment of Tolkien life that had a certain impact on his inspiration and world crafting.For me, it just ended unexpectedly where I actually hoped it would start.

They could never truly capture the splendor of Tolkien's words.I had always wanted to know more about this amazing man who created a world of magic for millions of children like me. This movie delivered in ways I could never imagine. I sat in awe watching his life, his struggles, as well as his joys. I was reduced to tears in many parts of the movie and sat in stunned silence when it was over. This movie is a story of loss, survival, fellowship (friendship is inadequate to describe the relationships), love, and the power of an indomitable soul.

214,independentdreamer,Visual Poetry,9,12 May 2019,"This film had only came to attention within the last week, which no doubt is the result of not a strong enough marketing campaign, and that is okay, especially when this bio pic is crushed in between a long list of anticipated blockbusters. With that said, if you love the world of JRR Tolkien, then this movie is for you. If you are interested in a movie that asks you to go on an emotional journey, this movie is for you. Yes there is action sequences defined by Tolkien's harrowing experience in WWI, but overall, this movie touches on a deeper level and promotes strongly: the bonds of fellowship and love.
I call this a ""visual poetry"" film, it is elegant in its approach with scenes and dialogue (for the most part) flowing into one another. There were a few transitions that felt a little bumpy but overall everything ebbed and flowed to move the narrative along.
Beautifully acted by the cast, you felt immersed in Tolkien's journey with his friends and the love of his life.
Now, the biggest criticism I have seen and one I would like to address, is do not, DO NOT compare this film to the completed Lord of The Rings. This film is not about Lord of the Rings, but the foundation of concepts/inspiration/language/history of Middle Earth. The sequences involving the fantasy references are the start of the ideas that go on to take shape for Tolkien's writing. They are only loose references towards the iconic creatures/characters of the books that Tolkien had yet to write.
So please, make a consideration to see this film if you wish to step into something slower paced and a break away from the Hollywood heavy-hitters, and surround yourself in a film that is a breathe of fresh air in the industry.",Tolkien

With all the difficulties and horrors JRR endured, I doubt he would have been able to extract so much from it had he not possessed a deep faith and belief that God can transform the deepest suffering into something good--Tolkien's writings in this case. JRR was good friends with CS Lewis and played a significant role in his life and his conversion to Christianity. The Hobbit is both a high fantasy novel and an allegory of the Christian journey that all true Christians need make.

This guy lived till 1973 and was alive when Led Zeppelin sang the word Gollum in their song. And we watch a young man's flashbacks! It seems like both screenplay writers were only briefly familiar with Tolkien's real biography (and left me, the viewer, still unfamiliar as well), and the director wasn't confident what genre of movies he shoots.Yes, I do not like the modern approach to biopics - to interrupt the story at its most interesting moment.

Music: 100/10 (hats off to Thomas Newman)
Accuracy: 3/10Exactly, although a beautifully crafted film with brilliant acting and story telling, the film does a terrible job at portraying Tolkien and his life.

221,jordanjpayne,"Great cast, solid acting, not such a stellar story",6,22 May 2019,"I'm a part of a small movie club group on Facebook, we aren't all very active, but with the amount of time on my hands I thought I'd try writing a more in-depth review of a film I went to go see a couple of days ago, Tolkien. I saw that it was getting mixed reviews and as a fan of his writing, I thought it might be interesting to learn more about the man being these epic stories, even if it is fictitious. Having read up on the movie since, it wasn't endorsed by the protective Tolkien estate, but the writers claim to have researched his story at length. Nicholas Hoult and Lily Collins are both great actors, I think Lily Collins will have a great career ahead of her.The movie is essentially a story of war and a romance between Tolkien and the love of his life, Edith Bratt. I had hoped for more inspirational and 'magic' movie moments that speak to his real life and brilliance. The movie doesn't deliver to that end, the story itself spends a great deal of time delving into a difficult childhood and the budding romance between two orphans. The former, establishes Tolkien as a exceptionally talented young man who forges a lifelong friendship with three of his peers, who form the T.C.B.S (Tea Club, Barrovian Society). Apparently this is a true part of Ronald's childhood. These relationships between classmates are well written and their personalities are bright and optimistic but suffer from being archetypal.I found it especially strange that, as an orphan, Tolkien's story is told as though he virtually didn't have a brother (his name is Hilary). Perhaps this is intended to focus our attention on the romance or maybe to avoid a legal response from the Tolkien estate, but it was a very obvious omission. The movie breaks out at times into Tolkien's experience in WWI and in my view these scenes are often an unwelcome interruption. Here the movie seeks to emphasize Ronald's lasting ties to the T.C.B.S. while weaving in visual flourishes that we are to interpret as Tolkien's imagination at play. These scenes ultimately serve as part of the inspiration for his novels.That aspect of the story isn't uninteresting, but it's certainly not unique. And while it was a large part of the story, it didn't draw out the desired emotional response for me, and I'm usually pretty open to it when watching movies. I think the magnifying glass was too focused on that love story, and falls short of evoking a sense of wonder or intrigue about how Tolkien's mind works. There are moments and flares that try to show what inspired his stories and there are scenes that are 'genuine' and very well acted by the two leads. The third act of the movie fell drastically late in the movie and seemed like something of an afterthought.All that being said, I enjoyed the movie enough to recommend it (stream/rent it!) but I was let down by a partially unoriginal love story that strays too far away from Tolkien's motivation and what truly inspired some of the most successful books of our time.",Tolkien

229,mtabrown-32191,A Classic,8,6 May 2019,"I have read quite a bit about Tolkien and his life. Whilst this film was not formally endorsed by the Tolkien family, I felt that it was great tribute to Tolkien and his wife Edith. The film I felt showed how WW1 had made a considerable impression on Tolkien and some of the battle scenes that were later written into The Lord of The Rings and The Hobbit.",Tolkien

231,ptc96,The Lord of The Rings set in the real world,9,28 October 2019,"First of all, you can watch this film if you have never read or watched anything Tolkien related. Will you enjoy it tho? Probably not that much in my opinion.
This is a story about love, magic, adventure and friendship. It is also about how stories like these were born from the mind of Tolkien himself.
What i really got from this was the message that words, music and art can really change the world. Tolkien made friends, found his life's purpose and found love through those simple things, and so he will inspire anyone who reads the work of his.
The technical side of this movie is excellent in every front: the score and music are always a perfect fit to the scene, the composition is spot on, so is the photography and also the acting is superb.I'd definitely recommend this film to anyone who has seen or read Tolkien and to anyone who is curious about him.",Tolkien
232,alever-46823,A beautiful and moving film,9,5 May 2019,"I am a huge Tolkien fan and after reading some of the critics reviews I was a bit wary of seeing this film. I do not know which film the ""critics"" have seen but from their conclusions I do not recognise this film. I have literally just left the cinema, I found it so moving that I found myself in floods of tears. Beautifully acted, and set against the backdrop of WW1 the sense of loss and the harrowing reality of what war is came across in such depth. I loved the focus on language and the weight it can carry, It made me feel that words are in their own right living creatures. This is one of the few films that has not just entered my brain but is also in my heart. Please go and see this film whether you are a Tolkien fan or not, it is truly captivating.",Tolkien
233,jyrkilahde,"It's a story about love, fellowship and loss",10,5 May 2019,"A beautiful story about JRR Tolkien's growth from an orphan boy into a writer, professor and a husband. A plausible explanation how a mind so unlike any other before could develop. Horrors of the Great War frame the story, but it is not a war movie. It is a movie about friendship, love and strong feelings. The visual outcome is dramatic, and I liked th",Tolkien
234,dibleyy,A tasteful biopic that any LOTR fan will enjoy.,8,13 May 2019,"This film is not for everyone, it is a little slow at times and definitely not a mega-blockbuster but if you are a fan of Tolkien's work and you enjoy biopics such as The Theory of Everything and Imitation Game then you will love this. It is tasteful in the way it portrays Tolkien's early life, it does not shy away from his hardships but neither does it seem exaggerated. There are not many overt references to his writings except for right at the end and possibly the imagery during the war scenes, however there are many subtle hints and influences throughout such as the shots of the Mordor-esque Birmingham, his love of forests and tree as a child, his 'fellowship' of friends, Private Sam in the War, his Professor at Oxford and many more.This whole host of subtle imagery combined with the wonderful cinematography and the visuals he sees during the war scenes really build a great picture as to how his early life heavily influenced his later writings. But it further shows there is more to Tolkien than just his writing, with a lot of layers and complexity to his character, extremely well portrayed by Nicholas Hoult.His time in the Great War seems to take a central role in the story but by no means is this a war film and there is not too much gore (considering the film is only rated a 12A). Tolkien's negative experiences in the war are pivotal inspiration points for many of the Antagonists in the world of Middle Earth, we see Imagery of Sauron, Morgoth, Balrogs, Black Riders, even the screech of the Nazgul is based on the whistle of bombs from the War.In conclusion, this is a pleasant and visually pleasing watch for any LOTR fan who wants to learn more about the author's life and inspirations. It should become an honorary member of any marathon but would you watch it at the start or the end?",Tolkien

238,tracyannneville,Something for everyone,10,14 May 2019,"I saw this film twice within the space of a week and I NEVER do that. A story about friendship, love, imagination, language and the powerful impact of experience on a great literary mind. I simply don't understand the complaints of some reviewers that the parallels between Tolkien's experience of the trenches and his written work were not explicit enough. That's simply not how influences work, it's a far more subtle relationship. This film has everything - it's a war film, a biopic, a love story and an intriguing period piece about a fascinating time in history. There are some wonderful performances and it really does contain something for everyone.",Tolkien
239,susanpeck-13255,Don't listen to critics,10,10 November 2019,"Beautifully portrayed film. Well acted and directed. Knew nothing about his early life or experience in the war. Wish we had seen it in theaters. Luckily on the DVD we got to see deleted scenes as it brought even more insight into characters. Still amazed this was the first biopic. Surprised to see the Tolkien family wasn't on board as I see nothing objectionable.
What a lovely film all round, including Thomas Newman's score. See it, rent it!",Tolkien
