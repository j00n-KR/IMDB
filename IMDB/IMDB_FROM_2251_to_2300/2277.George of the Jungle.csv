0,MartinHafer,dumb and awful and solely for kids or those with very low standards,3,10 June 2007,"I was very surprised when this movie debuted, as the reviews were generally quite good. And, since I had kids who were seven and three at the time, I took them to see this film. Unfortunately, while they liked it, I thoroughly hated it and felt that the film was designed almost exclusively for kids or those with very low standards. The problem was that Brandon Frasier was NOT enough to carry the film--even with the assistance of John Cleese as his best friend. And to make matters worse, the writing was just stupid and awful. The original George of the Jungle cartoons were pretty bad and it's a shame that this film didn't do much to improve on this. This film is strictly for young kids, as even teens will most likely think that this is a hokey mess.",George of the Jungle
1,TheLittleSongbird,"""George, George, George of the Jungle, watch out for that treeee!""",7,2 May 2010,"What can I say? An entertaining and fun movie. It is however a little too overlong, Thomas Haden Church is underused and some of the story leans towards the predictable side of things. However, it is very nice to look at, the scenery is colourful and the sets are splendid. Even the cinematography is very good. The music is fun and catchy, it is probably just me but after seeing this film I have had the main title song stuck in my head for days. The script is witty and quotable and the jokes are funny. And then the performances really do add to the sense of fun. Brendan Fraser gives a very likable lead performance, and Leslie Mann is appealing as Ursula. As the intellectual ape ""Ape"", John Cleese is fitfully amusing. But the star of the show is the sardonic and hilarious narration from Keith Scott. Overall, a fun and entertaining movie, not perfect, but I recommend it. 7/10 Bethany Cox",George of the Jungle
2,SnoopyStyle,one-joke character,4,28 April 2016,"George (Brendan Fraser) was lost in a plane crash in central Africa as a baby. He grows up with his animal friends talking gorilla Ape and Shep the elephant. Twenty five years later, heiress Ursula Stanhope (Leslie Mann) is on a safari. She is annoyed by the arrival of her fiancé Lyle Van de Groot (Thomas Haden Church) who is traveling with poachers Max (Greg Cruttwell) and Thor (Abraham Benrubi). George rescues Ursula from a lion and brings her back to his home. Lyle finds them and shoots George. Lyle is sent to African prison. Ursula takes George back to San Francisco. Her mother (Holland Taylor) refuses to accept the jungle man.Brendan Fraser is essentially redoing Link from Encino Man. This is an one-joke character and he's does the one-joke great. The section I like the most is on the bridge. The rescue was fun and everybody gets to say ""Watch out for that...!"" The narration is reminiscent of the cartoon. The plot created around this character isn't that compelling. It can't expand beyond the animated shorts. I also think George needs to be dumber for him to be funny.",George of the Jungle
3,jboothmillard,George of the Jungle,5,6 September 2005,"When I was young this used to be quite a funny Walt Disney Pictures live action comedy about a young boy dropped in the jungle and becomes like a Tarzan type character. Brendan Fraser plays George, the King of the Jungle and Leslie Mann as Ursula Stanhope is the woman who ""finds"" and takes him to the city to try and become like a normal man. After a while George becomes quite used to the city, and falls in love with Ursula, her parents obviously don't approve. Meanwhile, the bad guys including Lyle Van De Groot as Thomas Haden Church, Max, Van De Groot's Sidekick Thug (Greg Cruttwell) and Thor, Van De Groot's Sidekick Thug (Abraham Benrubi) plan to kidnap an ape. John Cleese also voices An Ape Named 'Ape' who is quite amusing in places trying to explain to George about things. For a live action comedy, this used to be quite fun. Worth watching!",George of the Jungle
4,Woodyanders,A hugely enjoyable hoot,8,16 August 2008,"Brendan Fraser, looking really buff and fit in a loincloth, gives an endearingly goofy performance as the lovably dim-witted and accident prone titular character, who's kind of like Tarzan's dumber and more good-natured primitive man cousin. Things seem to be going well for the extremely luck George when he encounters his first ever female human being, the spunky, pretty heiress Ursula (the adorable Leslie Mann). Alas, big problems ensue when Ursula's smug wealthy jerk fiancé Lyle (a sublimely smarmy Thomas Haden Church) won't take no for an answer. Leslie's snotty mom likewise disapproves of George and when two greedy mercenaries kidnap George's best friend, an intelligent, sarcastic, bespectacled talking ape named -- what else? -- Ape (Monty Python's John Cleese supplies Ape's marvelously plummy Brit-accented voice), it's up to George to save him.Proficiently directed by Sam Weisman, with a smart and witty script by Dana Olsen and Audrey Wells, this film does Jay Ward's seminal character proud: there's a refreshing dearth of sappy sentiment, the cinematography is gorgeously expansive, we've got lots of clever, self-referential jokes (a bunch of guys who speak perfectly comprehensible English are subtitled anyway), plus there's cool supporting characters like Tookie the Toucan bird, a pack of drum pounding gorillas who at one point deck themselves out in ninja garb, and Shep, an elephant who thinks he's a dog (!); an agreeably cute'n'campy sense of humor which never becomes too self-consciously hip, an enjoyably cornball score by Marc Shaiman, terrific special f/x puppet work by Jim Henson's Creature Shop, a nifty animated opening credits sequence, a fantastic rockin' cover of the classic theme song by the Presidents of the United States of America, hilariously overwrought narration (""Meanwhile, back at a really big footprint in the mud""), a great coda with Ape slaying audiences in Las Vegas with a glitzy casino lounge act (he belts out a hearty rendition of Frank Sinatra's ""My Way""!), and Richard ""Shaft"" Roundtree as a genial native guide. Why, we even have a solid and positive central message about how there's more to a person's overall worth than the station they hold in life. A sweet, funny and charming little winner.",George of the Jungle
5,ccthemovieman-1,A Few Twists Make This A Fun Movie,7,6 June 2006,"This was a pretty entertaining comedy with a few twists added, such as a talking gorilla, which made it fun to watch. We also see an elephant act like a dog and along the way our hero (Brendan Fraser) is a likable boob. Sometimes it's just plain stupid but that's what you get with any comedy. Disney has this in the ""PG"" mode so we get some of the standard peeing, farting, sex jokes and innuendos, kicking people in the groin....you know, all those supposedly-hilarious gags that have become so commonplace in modern family comedies. There is enough original material in here, though, to enjoy this a couple of times.",George of the Jungle
6,anaconda-40658,George of the Junk Hole.,1,30 July 2015,"George of the Jungle (1997): Dir: Sam Weisman / Cast: Brendan Fraser, Leslie Mann, Thomas Hayden Church, Holland Taylor, Richard Roundtree: Pathetic family film with elements of marriage and blackmail that isn't of interest children. Title suggests upbringing with George raised outside humanity. His friends are an ape named Ape and an elephant named Shep that thinks it's a dog. Poachers hunt for ""the white ape"" and one of them is a woman who will become his romantic interest. He is wounded and as a result she spirits him off to the city. Now George must venture back to the jungle to save Ape from poachers. Children create better effects by scribbling over wallpaper with crayons. Directed by Sam Weisman reduces adults to second graders. Idiotic narration accompanies stupid dialogue and cheesy special effects. Brendan Fraser as George overplays the whole crashing into a tree bit. The life of George is too mirrored to that of Tarzan. Leslie Mann pretty much plays the standard love interest and nothing more. In other cardboard appearances are Thomas Haden Church and Holland Taylor. Richard Roundtree is a guide who should have guided Leslie Mann off the set and onto the set of a movie more deserving of her talent. Pointless and stupid film that carries one great line that states, ""It's easy to be outnumbered when you're a zero."" That pretty much sums up the film. Score: 1 / 10",George of the Jungle
7,Wuchakk,Brendan Fraser as a goofy Tarzan-like ape-man along with sweetie Leslie Mann,8,20 July 2020,"An expedition to the heart of the Dark Continent discovers a white man (Brendan Fraser) raised by apes. Captured by the wild man, it doesn't take long for the heiress from San Francisco (Leslie Mann) to see that George is a better man than her arrogant, condescending fiancé (Thomas Hayden Church).""George of the Jungle"" (1997) is an over-the-top spoof of Tarzan inspired by the 60's cartoon which I've never seen. You have to be able to appreciate fun, goofy humor to enjoy this quirky family comedy/adventure. It helps that Fraser is both likable and amusing in the eponymous role (I should add that he really inspires guys to improve their fitness). Meanwhile Mann is as sweet & beautiful as Bernadette Peters in her prime. Everything clicks for great entertainment; I laughed through practically the whole flick.The film runs 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot in Kaua'I & Maui, Hawaii, and the San Francisco Bay area, California, as well as other parts of that state (Middle Fork American River, Stockton & Los Angeles).GRADE: A-",George of the Jungle
8,Sylviastel,Definitely Childish Slapstick Fun!,7,4 July 2011,"I have to say that this film has a lot of dumbness mixed in there with a lot of potential. First, it has a great cast like Holland Taylor as Mrs. Stanhope who you don't see enough of in this film. The animals are largely added in to talk and the elephant acts more like a dog than an elephant. John Cleese is a hoot as the ape who can speak Queen's English and you raised George in the jungle. Anyway, Thomas Haden Church plays Lyle who is with his fiancé Ursula Stanhope played by Lesley Mann in the jungle but the jungle sets don't look real. Anyway, it's a comedy aimed at a younger audience. Brendan Frasier is fine as George of the jungle but I don't like when he acts like an ape, grunts, or howls. But still there is a sweet love story in there. Abraham Benrubi plays a poacher and the narrator even has a sense of humor too. It's silly childish humor!",George of the Jungle
9,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Well, Brendan Fraser gets back to what he does best: Grunting",6,1 August 2004,"Not to say that I didn't enjoy the movie. There are a couple of cute moments I enjoyed. And it's not a bad interpretation from the cartoon from the 60's. This is a movie mostly for the kids though. Of course, it could never be taken seriously. What caveman movie can? Or jungle man? It's kind of rare. The acting is silly, and it is meant to be. Although you will get a laugh from the movie. It's mostly slapstick. The plot is basic Disney. There is always a bad greedy man. They do find the sillyest ways of finding a villain in these movies. Over all, it's a good movie for the kids. Nothing really that an adult can enjoy too much. If you did enjoy the cartoon though, I would recommend.6/10",George of the Jungle
10,cricketbat,"Yes, it is silly. Yes, it is sappy. Yes, it is juvenile.",8,23 November 2018,"I never really watched the George of the Jungle cartoon, but I watched this movie a lot when I was younger. Yes, it is silly. Yes, it is sappy. Yes, it is juvenile. Nevertheless, this movie is a nostalgia trip for me. I even still laugh at some of the jokes (and I still kind of have a crush on Ursula).",George of the Jungle
11,Bored_Dragon,A movie that makes me happy,9,18 December 2019,"George of the Jungle (1997)A movie that makes me happy.9/10George of the Jungle 2 (2003)Sad attempt to get more money on old glory...This is a disgrace in almost every way. I have nothing against movies that are meant to be in more than one part, not even those meant to be single movies but then inspired sequels, but when they knock something together just to try and get a few dollars more of the old glory... yuck.The new cast is not bad itself, some of them are maybe even better than the original cast, but they miss the charm that we fell to in the first movie. It simply isn't it. Music is copied from the first movie. The story is unoriginal and dumb. Humor is rerun or exaggerated or simply pointless. CGI is a story for itself. In the original movie, you could not tell that the elephant is not the real one, while here all animals look like they skipped from a cartoon. Not only unconvincing, but also very irritating. The screenplay was obviously forced without ideas or inspiration and then put into the movie that I barely forced myself to watch till the end. In one word - sad.3/10",George of the Jungle
12,ironhorse_iv,"George! George! George of the Jungle, friend to you and me! Indeed, he was. This movie is a guilty pleasure of mine.",5,2 December 2016,"'George of the Jungle' is one fun goofball movie that most people will love. After all, the movie humor is based off the 1960's cartoon of the same name made by Jay Ward & Bill Scott, the same guys that help made 'the Rocky and Bullwinkle show'. A parody of author, Edgar Rice Burroughs's novel, 'Tarzan of the Apes'; the show and film tells a fish out of water story of an extremely clumsy and dimwitted, wild man named George (Brendan Fraser) trying to live with his wealthy love interest, Ursula (Leslie Mann) in the big city. However, the call of the wild is calling him back, to save the jungle, from some unwanted poachers wanted to capture, his friend/mentor Ape (Voiced by John Cleese). Without spoiling the movie, too much, if this plot sounds familiar, yes, it nearly a carbon copy of the plot of 'Jungle 2 Jungle', also released by Disney on the same year. Honestly, if you take away, most of clever take itself not so serious, self-aware humor from this movie, you're left with a generic somewhat cheesy tiresome plot with bad CGI, and men in badly made ape costumes. Thank goodness, the movie directed by Sam Weisman is so funny, that we can overlook that, and see it for what it is: a light-hearted parody. It's as close to being a live-action cartoon as possible. Surprising, that's a good thing since the plot is so plain. The way the movie was shot in slapstick form remind me, of the Looney Toons shorts with the Roadrunner and the Wyle E. Coyote. As the narrator explains, in this film nobody dies, but they will ""get big boo-boos"". George smashing into trees is particularly a Running Gag. Even without the dialogue jokes, the physical comedy is that universal. While, yes, the violence might led to kids accidentally hurting themselves emulating moves learned from the film, but I have to say, it's a risk worth taking, because physical comedy in a live action Disney movie has never been so funny. While, yes, there is some cringe-worthy dark moments, like apes wanting to rape the villain, Lyle (Thomas Haden Church) or a bird getting shove in somebody ass. For the most part, the childish slapstick and toilet humor, are used correctly to the point, that it's not too annoying, or offensive to watch. Surprising, most of jokes are not even that low brow. I like how the film has some wily humor to counteract the few amounts of juvenile absurdity. The way the film used cool, 'breaking the fourth wall' moments, risky sexual innuendos, exaggeration narratives, smart wordplay and puns, and some fun surrealism were great. Not only, did those jokes hit the funny bone for adults, but it was clear enough for kids to understand as well. Perhaps, that might turn off, some viewers off, but I do like comedies which the whole family can enjoy together. Also, I like how the actors delivered the jokes, throughout it. Fraser, Cleese, Mann & Thomas Haden Church gave us, some of the best facial reactions ever. I wouldn't call it, the best acting, but it was fine, for what they were given. All of the characters were pretty likable. Nevertheless, I like George the most. He's sweet, soulful, courageous, in touch with his emotions, and spends most of the movie running around in nothing, but a six pack chest and small loincloth. So, it was no surprise that most women love this movie. The title song is catchy, however, I can do, without the flashing light, title opening, after the cartoon, as it can potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy. I also can do, without the fake looking locations mixed with the real-life locations. It was a bit distracting. Plus, I didn't like the whole shooting in the head gag. It probably should had been change. Better yet, have it cut like the delete scenes, where George saving Ursula from a quicksand pit, George exploring the mall and Lyle returning from jail with a shaved head and eye patch. It was not funny. It was a bit disturbing. Still, it's weird that everyone thought this movie was going to flop, but its things like what I listed, that made this movie into a box-office success and relatively well-received with critics. Even Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert love this film. Indeed, Disney presents the smash hit comedy that families everywhere went bananas over! Overall: For a movie that clearly should've been dead on arrival, it's actually very enjoyable. Kids love it, adults seem to like it, what's not to enjoy? In the end, go ahead and swing on it. It's that fun to watch. Highly recommended.",George of the Jungle
13,John6Daniels,"Dumb version of Tarzan (Review 1,200)",4,7 August 2021,Basically a cheap children/family movie about George of the Jungle the dumb version of Tarzan. Usually 90 cartoons to live action movies are decent or pretty good. This version was kind of hash.Nothing too special about it to write about to be honest.,George of the Jungle
14,filipemanuelneto,A great family film,7,3 October 2016,"This is a film that marked the generation that had 10 to 16 when it opened in theaters. Unquestionably fun from beginning to end, is one of the best family films that Disney did at the end of the century, out of the animation field. This is obviously a film partially spent in a jungle with a man, George, who is literally clumsy version of Tarzan. Made to play and laugh a lot, the film is full of funny moments and even the bad guy, Lyle Van de Groot (played by Thomas Haden Church) is the most humorous I've seen, even in films of this kind.The involvement of actors is very good, but the spotlight go to Brendan Fraser, who played the main character in an absolutely brilliantly. Leslie Mann gave life to the little girl, Ursula, whom George predictably falls. She also had an inspired interpretation, and even his shrill voice gave a hand in the creation of the character, which is a rich and spoiled girl. John Cleese, one of the greats of the current mood, excellent as was voiced Ape, a monkey gifted with a very human intelligence. Thomas Haden Church also did not disappoint the audience, eager to laugh.",George of the Jungle
15,lisafordeay,Hilarious spoof on Tarzan based on the TV series of the same name.,7,15 June 2013,Brendan Fraser (from The Mummy franchise) plays George a Tarzan lookalike who's been reared by a gorilla(voiced by John Cleese) as he got lost in the jungle as a baby due to a plane crash which killed his birth parents.Problems arise when he meets Ursula Stanhope(played by This Is 40 star Leslie Mann) who he saves from a lion and falls in love with her. Of course Ursula is engaged to a borish douchbag named Kyle (played by Thomas Haden Church from Spiderman 3)who tried to shoot George but ends up shooting Ape(Cleese) instead causing George to travel to San Francisco with Ursula to get some medical attention while also trying to fit in with the crowd by getting clothes and meeting Ursula's parents especially Ursula's mother (played by Holland Taylor) who isn't impressed with George as she wants Ursula to marry Kyle. So will George and Ursula end up getting together or will Ursula marry Kyle instead?The story maybe a rip off of Tarzan but the over the top humor is hilarious. Brendan Fraiser acting like a complete idiot prancing around with a loil cloth and acting all crazy and goofy( while also being charming and handsome at the same time) was really good as the title charcther.As well as that you gotta love the theme song and the romance between Mann and Fraiser was really good as they reminded me of Tarzan and Jane.Bottom line I enjoyed this movie alot as I grew up watching this as a kid and although it comes across as a silly comedy it actually works. Even today I can still watch it and never get bored.Im giving it an 6.9 out of 10.,George of the Jungle
16,MissSimonetta,A masterpiece of joyful stupidity,8,25 August 2020,"Words alone cannot do justice to this wonderful comedy. It's the best attempt to turn a live-action movie into a cartoon I have yet seen.

17,TheOneThatYouWanted,Not to be the only IMDb is failing. I can not see sh$&t,4,17 March 2018,The CGI elephant was cool. But I had to quit this after 30 or 40 minutes. Maybe I wasn't in the mood for this type of comedy. The jokes are geared more towards children or whatever but whatever. It seems well directed at times. Just silly in repetitive way. But I did not give the film an honest chance - I did the math and quit it before the halfway mark. Maybe the second half is a freaking masterpiece but I wouldn't know; and ultimately the director is to blame. Unless this did good back in the days. It must have came out around the time of Disney's Tarzan animated film.,George of the Jungle
18,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A fun live-action cartoon adaptation,6,27 May 2014,"Cartoons are difficult to convert to movies. With a short running time of only 20-25 minutes of plot, it can be fatal to drag it out for more than an hour. This is not the first of its kind but it possibly one of the better live-action adaptations that have been presented to broader audiences of recent memory. There are a number reasons to why this stands true compared to other cartoons but it also contains flaws that many others have too. Therefore, it only constitutes as slightly above average.Audiences are introduced to George (Brendan Fraser), a simple-minded man brought up by the local Apes of Africa. One day he stumbles upon a beautiful tourist named Ursula (Leslie Mann) and they immediately began to fall for each other. To George's dismay, Ursula isn't single, for her fiancé Lyle (Thomas Hayden Church) is also in love with her - thus beginning the plot. There are a number of pluses that come with the bad here. Thankfully, there's a tad more good than bad. First are the characters. Brendan Fraser as George of the Jungle was perfect. Fraser not only can do action but also handles comedy with ease. His persona resembles that of a human cartoon; like Jim Carrey but not as extreme. Leslie Mann as the damsel is OK. She is definitely cute enough for the role but doesn't make her character stand out. For a female character that stands up to some high-end people, she's still ditsy. However, the other cast members help overshadow her performance. Thomas Hayden Church is funny because of how naive he is and his perception of the lower class locals when in fact; he is the lowest of the low. Heading the locals is Kwame (Richard Roundtree from the original Shaft (1971)) and he too has funny moments. Along with that is John Cleese's voice work as George's friend Ape. The intellectual dialog that he is given sounds preposterous but in a silly fun kind of way. Topping it off is Keith Scott's narration; he is possibly one of the more comical of characters even though he is never seen. What helps these characters actually make the film worth a watch is partly due to the writing, which involves breaking the fourth wall. This is not done once or twice, the count exceeds far more than many comedies actually do nowadays. But this particular element is what help makes it work and be funny. Unfortunately, the other part of the writing that doesn't work is what every other live-action cartoon movie includes; throwing the main characters into the current day. Relying on a character from decades before to make scenes comical by putting them in real world situations don't work very often. It's clichéd and it doesn't give a unique universe for the main characters. Originally it started out fun and different because it took place in a jungle where things would happen that many audiences don't see, but in the city? If it's called George of the JUNGLE, why is it taking place in the CITY?There's also some noticeable loopholes in the story that don't give any explanation to how certain characters knew or remembered various information. However, in some cases some of the situations that take place should not be considered because the movie does play out like a cartoon, which is important if it's based off of one. That also doesn't mean the special effects should remind audiences of that. Since this movie was released at a time where CGI was really starting to boom, it can be seen clear as daylight what is fake and what is real. Unfortunately, that badly dates it. It could be worse though because Marc Shaiman's score kept fidelity to the original theme but made it fun to listen to for the whole ride of the movie. It's better than most.The majority of characters and parts of the comedy are funny at times along with appropriate music. Yet, the story is cliché and the special effects are dated.",George of the Jungle
19,Lady_Targaryen,Watch out with that tree!,6,31 January 2006,"'George of the jungle'is a silly movie,but we can have some laughs. One of the reasons why the movie is worthwhile is Brendan Fraser's hot body,because in all his career I personally think this is the movie that he is in his best, physically speaking.This movie is a Tarzan's parody, where the baby George,after an airplane accident, gets lost in the Africa (specifically in the jungle) and is raised by apes. 25 years later, he is a beautiful and strong man, and he turned to be the king of the jungle, even being a little clumsy and naive in many times.Ursula and Lyle are the rich couple who are walking in the Africa's jungle where Tarzan lives. They are engaged, but Ursula is not very happy with that decision. (What I personally think is very acceptable, once Lyle is a stupid materialist coward)But when Tarzan saves Ursula and they start to get close,many things are about to change, and Ursula's marriage with Lyle is one of them.Ps: funny facts: 1-The talking monkey, who is an intellectual with British accent 2- Shep, George's ''dog'',who actually is an elephant.",George of the Jungle

To this day I quote this movie with some of my favorite scenes.Sure this movie isn't a masterpiece based of a classic cartoon show but nevertheless the movie did some things right to make everyone laugh and it still rank this as one of my favorite movies that I saw in theaters. Brendan Fraser was brilliant as George, this is one of the few rare times in comedy films were an actor was born to play a role and Brendan was just the right man for the job because he help brought the film to life. When you watch his performance you'll be laughing for sure. Leslie Mann was beautiful as Ursula and she made for a interesting character for the film. Thomas Haden Church as Lyle Van de Groot was just a smart choice because he played a character we all hated Keith Scott was brilliant as The Narrator and he help made the film a good one to watch.

22,Beta_Gallinger,"Definitely more for kids, but not absolutely revolting for adults (at least not for all of them)",6,21 June 2007,"I did not see this movie while it was on the big screen, but shortly after it came out on video, I got a copy for Christmas. I was eleven years old at the time, and didn't know that ""George of the Jungle"" was based on a 1960s cartoon series of the same name, but I still loved the film! I watched this live action Disney flick a lot for a while, and from what I remember, it made me laugh much more than anything else had in a long while! Watching it again after not doing so for many years, I didn't find it very funny at all, but I could have been more disappointed.As a baby, George is lost in an African jungle after surviving a plane crash. He grows up in this jungle, raised by an ape named ""Ape."" After he has grown up, a young American heiress named Ursula Stanhope goes on a trip to Africa. She finds herself in trouble when a lion sees her, but soon, she meets George for the first time, when he appears and rescues her! After this happens, George takes Ursula to his home (a tree house). As the two fall in love, Lyle Vandergroot, Ursula's fiancé (though she really doesn't want to marry him), searches for her with Max and Thor, and when they find George's tree house, trouble ensues! Make no mistake about it, this 1997 ""George of the Jungle"" movie is extremely silly and juvenile. While watching the movie recently, I may have snickered a bit around the beginning and smiled occasionally throughout, but for the most part, I kept a straight face. I may have even found some parts a tad embarrassing. It really didn't mean much to be anymore. However, it was still far from the worst movie watching experience I've ever had, no doubt about that. This movie does have its positive aspects, such as performances from certain cast members, especially the legendary John Cleese as An Ape Named ""Ape"" (you can always recognize his voice), and some parts of the film may be somewhat suspenseful.I have never seen any episodes of the original 1960s ""George of the Jungle"" cartoon series, so I can't say how much resemblance this 1990s movie has to it, nor can I say what fans of the cartoon would generally think of it. However, focusing on the movie, this 1997 live action Disney flick is definitely more for kids, who could find it very funny (like I once did). For adults, well, I can't really guarantee much. There's a chance you might hate it, but there's also a chance that you would find it mildly entertaining, if you're prepared for extreme silliness.",George of the Jungle
23,vip_ebriega,About as fun as it should have been.,5,9 December 2008,"My Take: Pure mindlessness, but young 'uns will be amused. I purposely avoided GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE many times, with thoughts that the film will be loved by children and loathed by anyone above its age-limit. But when I finally saw the film, I'm pleased to say I was right about one thing, wrong about another. GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE was indeed a movie made for kids, and they'll loved it, yet somehow, I was surprised how decent the film was. I think that, to possibly enjoy the film's low-key charm is either to lower your expectations or at least, try to take a long with you the part of your mind that's still 8-years old. It's amateurish at every opportunity, but occasionally amusing. Brendan Fraser is acting like a total idiot, but is actually appropriate as the character of George, a man raised by apes in the uncharted jungles of Africa, so said by the film's narrator which is probably the film's funniest character. Leslie Mann plays Ursula, a woman from San Francisco who joins her fiancée Lyle (Thomas Haden Church) in his perilous adventure across African wilderness. But don't worry kids, nobody dies in this movie. They just get really bad boo-boo's.Part of the cast is funny, but not throughout the movie's running time. Usually, the movie relies on silly, immature slapsticks to attract its audiences. Unfortunately, only the kids will get a real kick out of them. Still, there are some funny moments in this film, mostly coming from the said narrator as well as John Cleese, offering his voice to the Ape called Ape. Rating: **1/2 out of 5.",George of the Jungle
24,CharltonBoy,A monotonus movie,5,10 October 1999,"George of the jungle could have been a quite good Childrens movie if the editors or script writers hadn't decided to replay the same jokes over and over and over again in the film. i lost count how many times the stupid and irritating george hit the tree when swinging from his vine but i do know that after the 34th time it lost it's appeal! My advice would be to stick this movie on for the kids but get the hell out of the room if your an adult , it will do your head in! 5 out of 10",George of the Jungle

26,Hollywood_Yoda,Good Fun For 10 Year Olds,7,20 September 2018,"""George of the Jungle"" was released in 1997 to moderate critical acclaim, children love the movie, it is very cartoonish. What some people fail to recognize or don't know is that this film is a remake of a 1967 cartoon TV series.As this film nears it's 25th anniversary (wow!!), it has become somewhat of a cult classic among Disney fans. It's not a great film, but it had its moments and it stars Brendan Fraser in the lead. It was good family fun for the time, mediocre by the early live action fare at Disney. And better than the early 2000s films they churned out.Fraser as George was a great fit. There was a great blend of comedy and action that he was known for at the time. It's a great film to introduce kids to, as long as they're around 9 and up. Otherwise, they might not understand it enough.John Cleese co-stars as the voice of the ""Ape named Ape"" which is probably the funniest part of the film. Also, the elephant who acts and thinks he is a dog, Shemp is pure Disney fun.Thomas Haden Church plays the seemingly bad guy Lyle Van de Groot, and Leslie Mann plays Ursula Stanhope, the good girl. They went into the jungle as a couple, but Ursula and George leave together.A love story like Tarzan & Jane!",George of the Jungle
27,brookenichole-98054,Unreal,8,13 April 2020,"This movie is hilarious in every way possible. It knows what it is and goes for it.
The acting is funny and great. No one falls flat. The whole movie feels very insane as it goes on. With the gorilla talking and the jokes it just feels so weird that Disney made it. But, I did love it!
I'd say give this a try because it's so fun to enjoy with the family!",George of the Jungle
28,manitobaman81,Good,7,4 September 2014,"After seeing the previews I thought I'd be disappointed; it just seemed wrong. Quality work that draws you in and doesn't let you go. There are some films that you can watch over and over again and get the same enjoyment. Rarer are the films that you enjoy more each time you see them. This is not one of these. Certainly the characterizations are shallow and quickly changeable, often for little or no reason. It's worth seeing for some inventive uses of writing and the actors. This one is much better than other reviewers would have you believe. What I liked best is that the movie never take itself seriously. This film is worthy of all the hopes you have.",George of the Jungle
29,raymond-15,I hope there isn't a sequel!,6,10 July 2000,"Edgar Rice Burroughs who wrote about Tarzan and his animal friends would have a fit if he could see this movie - then again, with a very special sense of humour, he might just have a good laugh.  Myself I gave a chuckle or two, but I didn't shake with uncontrollable mirth.  Brendon Fraser has the difficult task of translating the cartoon character George of the Jungle into a flesh and blood man who has an intelligence somewhat lower than the apes who reared him. There is plenty of ""Bang!"", Crash!"" and ""Wham!"" as George swings among the treetops colliding frequently with a sturdy trunk. Maybe it was funny the first time, but it goes on and on and ends up like a stale joke.  The idea of apes sending messages on the drums when danger approaches is a cute idea and the playful elephant who behaves like a dog is quite original too.  Even the toucan has his moments.  One of the funniest scenes is the ""kissing"" lesson where naive George is taught how to shape his lips for an ensuing kiss.  When Ursula finds George in his tree-house, she is much attracted by his physique and handsome face.  She decides to take him home to San Francisco. The outcome is obvious.  He embarrasses the civilized population with his jungle antics.  A shower bath becomes an unusual waterfall for George, and the cranes, bridges, lamp posts etc are irresistible objects to swing on.  Ursula, the daffy blond defends George to the end and they ride off into the sunset on an elephant with ""Just married"" painted on its rear end.  Funny? It's a whole lot of nonsense, of course and the actors probably had a great time bringing the cartoon characters to the silver screen.  I sincerely hope they don't make a sequel. Once is quite enough!!",George of the Jungle

Tree!!!!!Disney's other 1997 jungle movie, ""George of the Jungle,"" is based on the cartoon series (not Disney) with the same name (sorry, no Super Chicken in this version!!!!!) that my dad used to watch when he was young.It is about George, who was lost in the African jungles and had grown up there. He met Ursula, who was on a jungle adventure. He was very interested in her, and it made Lyle, the man who she used to be interested in, jealous!!!!!I think that this movie is sooo funny!!!!! There are funny moments along the way, and, about that ""the jungle"" comment in my last review, at the engagement party, George told a bunch of businessmen that he was from ""the jungle."" How funny; those men were thinking of New York, not Africa!!!!! LOLOL""George of the Jungle"" is sure to please anyone! This was also the very first Disney movie to be released on DVD, as I remember, 9 years ago!!!!!10 stars",George of the Jungle
31,bigverybadtom,Another Cartoon That Didn't Translate To The Big Screen,2,5 July 2013,"The only truly memorable scene in this movie was the stunt at the Golden Gate Bridge-it was actually rather impressive. The rest, however, was trite, dull, and repetitive. George, an inept Tarzan-like man, is found by Ursula in the jungle, and she takes him to the city, and of course there are problems with that.The original ""George Of The Jungle"" episodes were short cartoons, not necessarily suited for conversion to a feature-length film, as other such efforts such as ""Dudley Do-Right"" have proved. Though the movie does make a real effort to keep as close to the original cartoon as possible, the sad truth is that the whole thing just didn't work. Fortunately, the fad for such efforts has long died off, so we don't have to worry about seeing Hong Kong Phooey or Tennessee Tuxedo getting such treatment.",George of the Jungle
32,EmperorNortonII,This Movie Swings!,8,6 December 2000,"A lot of movies have been fashioned after cartoons, but not all of them are successful.  ""George of the Jungle"" is one of the few that score a hit in that department.  The movie captures the slapstick feel of the original cartoon.  Brendan Fraser plays his part well, as the dimwitted but lucky George.  And I can't really imagine a different voice for the ape named Ape than that of John Cleese!",George of the Jungle
33,beresfordjd,It is what it is,1,30 December 2014,"Yes this film is what it is. But what it is is terrible. It is a badly conceived load of utter rubbish which could only appeal to the lamest of brains or children. I like Brendan Fraser a lot, he is a good comedic actor but this is not a good comedy. Richard Roundtree must have been desperate to appear in such a film and has completely blown any credibility he used to have. I am aware that John Cleese has to pay loads of alimony to ex-wives so needs to do whatever comes his way and as he does not actually appear (just a voice performance) I imagine he simply did it for the money. It is a stupid movie for kids and has no other pretensions but when one compares it to , say Nanny McPhee, which is in similar unrealistic tone then it suffers very badly. It is the sort of film in which actors appear and then spend most of the rest of their career living it down.",George of the Jungle
34,Java_Joe,Decent live action remake.,7,4 April 2019,"Growing up, Jay Ward cartoons were a staple around my house. From things like Bullwinkle and Rocky to the ever popular George of the Jungle. So when they said they were making a live action version of this with Brendan Fraser as George I figured it was worth a look, and it was. I've never understood the dislike people have for Brendan. He's got great comic timing and literally throws himself into a role and commits to it.The story follows George, an orphan who's been raised by apes to become the lord of the jungle. Think of him as a really stupid Tarzan which is essentially what the character is supposed to be. This is a movie that doesn't take itself seriously which might explain why a lot of people didn't quite get it. Personally I loved it as they kept it rather true to the original series. The inclusion of John Cleese playing the refined and articulate Ape was a treat. And Brendan's George would have made Jay Ward proud.It's a silly movie that's just fun to watch. Avoid the sequel however, that was just painful.",George of the Jungle
35,SKG-2,Disney blandness weakens this film,7,21 February 1999,"I never saw the original series as much as the other, more famous, Jay Ward cartoon ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE, but what I did see had that show's same inclination towards subversive humor and bad puns (like when a white hunter named Weevil was tracking George, but George thinks he's thrown him off the trail because ""See no Weevil, hear no Weevil, speak no Weevil"").  This movie, however, blunts that edge.  The narration by Keith Scott is funny in of itself (like when Thor wonders why he's taking glee at the misfortunes of the bad guys, and he replies, ""Because I don't like you""), but I would have liked to see more interaction between him and the other characters.  More importantly, there's more emphasis on ""Watch out for that tree!"" and other physical gags than on the verbal humor.  And while the film is on solid ground in the jungle, the CROCODILE DUNDEE type second half is a retread.It should be said that Fraser and Mann make an appealing duo, and Greg Cruttwell and Abraham Benrubi (from ER) are good villains, but Thomas Haden Church quickly becomes tiresome.  John Cleese is droll as the Ape named Ape, but that joke is stretched too thin.",George of the Jungle
36,mdm-11,Just when you thought dumb couldn't get any dumber,2,21 May 2005,"I teach 4th grade and have opportunities to treat my class to down-time in form of ""video afternoons"" about once each month. When I screened this ""comedy"" for possible viewing in my classroom (I can't afford unpleasant surprises), I was soon convinced that 10 year olds' intelligence would be insulted if presented with this nonsense.This ""big budget"" film version can't hold a candle to the cartoon series I remember from my childhood. What happened? Why do Hollywood executives assume that today's kids are a few notches behind their parents? The jokes seemed ""dummied down"", which makes them appear ""forced"" and completely unfunny.This film, obviously, did not ""make it"" to the show. The only film I've ""screened"" lately even worse than this one was ""Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls"". Destroy that one on sight! This year's biggest hit with my 4th graders: ""Dennis The Menace"" (with Walter Matthau) and anything starring the character ""Mr. Bean"" (available in bite-size TV show format, 2 30 min. episodes per video).",George of the Jungle
37,Mort-31,Bothers about nothing,7,6 April 2001,"This movie is so exaggerated that it's good again. Maybe adults will enjoy it more than kids. The characters are so flat that it doesn't disturb you any more. The jungle looks so artificial that you can't believe it was supposed to look real. But the whole story, though easily understandable for kids, is completely crazy and freaky and bothers about nothing. George` is a cheap little trash movie, happily spoofing not only the Tarzan movies but also some Disney cartoons. 7 out of 10!",George of the Jungle
38,stormhawk2021,"Very funny, friendly and entertaining...what to ask for more?",8,13 July 2017,"I liked it a lot, I laughed a lot watching it. It is a humorous version of ""Tarzan"". Brendan Fraser is really nice and the story is unique to spend some time distracted and entertained. Also, Leslie Mann was good as a Jane-like character and Thomas Haden-Church as the villain, too. It has good moments and a touch of absurd comedy that convinced me enough. The kids in the house are sure to have a good time and adults who do not ask for too much and just want to have fun will enjoy it too. It's not that I'm fascinated but I certainly have a special affection since I saw her as a child. It is a movie with the charm of children's films that have not been made for a long time and that are missing from time to time.",George of the Jungle
39,Cedric_Catsuits,Family fun,5,1 May 2006,"There are some genuinely funny moments here, as well as some awful ones. It will appeal to a wide age range, and is too silly to be considered purely an adult movie. As is often the case, accuracy goes out the window so we have Indian elephants with African lions with orang-utans etc etc, but some of the scenery is stunning.I always think Brendan Fraser is a better actor when he's not speaking too much - e.g. in Encino Man - and although dialogue is pretty limited here I still think it's too much for him! He looks the part but as soon as he opens his mouth .... well, it's a bit of a let-down. The talking ape (voiced by John Cleese) is a nice touch but very badly dubbed at times. The CGI elephant is a step too far insofar as it isn't really necessary and doesn't fit with the real or animatronic creatures too well. Also, everybody knows elephants can't jump! My favourite has to be the monkey, although the lion is a close second and at times it's hard to tell what's real lion and what isn't.Thankfully they didn't go too far down the 'jungle man kicks ass in the city' route and the bridge outing is mercifully short (I hate heights.) Mann, Taylor & Perry play the Stanhope clan perfectly, but the stereotypical English bad-guy doesn't impress. Nor does the unpleasant Lyle. The essence of this show is in the animals and the scenery, and some very funny if basic slapstick - although why they cut short the hilarious kung-fu gorillas scene is puzzling.A good family laugh-along movie, and most enjoyable as long as your expectations aren't too high.",George of the Jungle
40,BadWebDiver,Hilarity runs riot,9,30 April 2004,"This is a great slapstick comedy film (and to think I used to think Hollywood had forgotten how to do these!); and I haven't even seen the original cartoon.Brendan Frazer has such an amazing sense of comic timing it's uncanny. He can really deliver the most outrageous situations with totally deadpan mock seriousness, which is the clue how to make these stories work. You have to be convinced the characters totally believe in what they're doing - otherwise nobody will. In fact I have a saying that you know you're watching a great comic performance when you get the impression that the actors know they're in a comedy, while the characters think they're in a drama. I also agree the Narrator is one of the highlights of this story, and adds a lot to the fun.I think Thomas Haden Church is actually slightly under-appreciated in this movie; making a comic villain work is rather tough, especially in a G-rated movie. You don't want to come on too strong and be a completely gut-wrenching psycho (though I know a lot of you sadists out there would prefer that), but you still have to come across as a legitimate threat.(Spoiler warning)My all-time favorite scene from this movie is the climactic leap George does. Brendan Frazer's delivery is spot-on. The dialog goes something like; ""George is about to make the biggest leap in the history of the world. George knows it is going to hurt a great deal, but George must do it."" Brendan then gives an extremely pained wince at the camera. That's pure comic gold.",George of the Jungle
41,len-21,5 on a scale of 10,5,9 January 2000,"Please recognize that my unbelievably generous 5 is based on a rating a kid would probably give this movie. I realize most kids will like it, but most kids will like almost every kid movie. I am claiming that GOTJ is a very weak movie on the kid-o-meter, though I am light years from being ""kid-o-meter"" hip.As an adult, it is the worst piece of stupidity I have seen in a long, long time - probably ever. I generally like kid's movies, but this was just junk. I'm not fond of talking animals, humans in gorilla suits, the same gags repeated at least 100 times, subtitles, slapstick, idiot behavior, etc. The problem here is that it had all of those things - and I really hate the compounding effect miserably created.Actually, to be fair, I only watched the first half. It is a metaphysical impossibility for the second half to be worse than the first half. But as bad as the first half was, I think it is also (strangely) a metaphysical impossibility for the second half to be any BETTER than the first half as I believe both halves were written, directed and produced by the same persons.I have not seen a movie that I would rate less than a 4 in years. I try to be reasonably careful before I spend my time. However, I would rate this movie at about a 0 (negative, if allowed) for adults - easily the worst movie of all time! I hate to use up such a wonderful stigma on such a meaningless three year old film, but I have waited for many years to assign such a lowly title and now I feel really, really good!",George of the Jungle
42,jaredpahl,"Exceptionally Dopey, Unusually Delightful",8,3 December 2020,"George of the Jungle is a seriously goofy film. A slapstick live-action summertime cartoon aimed directly at young kids. One might be tempted to review it with bumpers; because it's for kids, give it a break. But George of the Jungle is better than that. It's a smart, witty family comedy, bursting with charm and good cheer. It may be silly, but it's a real film, with real filmmaking qualities, and a real heart.The movie is based on the short-lived 1960s Jay Ward cartoon of the same name, but the words 'based on' are misleading. George of the Jungle takes the basic vibe (and banging theme song) from the show for use in an original comedic tale of a meathead Tarzan knockoff (Brendan Fraser) and the wholesome romance that sparks between he and Leslie Mann's big city heiress, Ursula. In the way is her slime ball fiancé Lyle (Thomas Haden Church) and the requisite 90s goon partners who want to capture the swinging white ape. The premise is excellent comedic fodder. Early jungle shenanigans are great fun, showcasing a confident, free-wheeling slapstick spirit. Writers Dana Olsen and Audrey Wells are unbound to the lazy conventions of the family comedy, instead having an obvious blast with inside jokes, fourth wall breaking narration, and knowing winks to the parents, before that became cliche unto itself. And of course there's the pratfalls too.But better than that is the fish-out-of-water turn the film takes when George is taken to San Francisco. George of the Jungle separates itself from its contemporary self aware live-action cartoons (a big craze in the late 90s and early aughts) with a downright charming love story at its center. Brendan Fraser and Leslie Mann are doing deceptively impressive work as the puppy lovers. Fraser gives a role broader than a barn door an amazingly lovable sweetness. Almost any other actor on the planet would be an abrasive embarrassment as the sculpted dork. Fraser is adorable. His goofy naïveté is more naturally enchanting than maybe any rom com lead I've seen. Mann, on the other end, is equal to Fraser's masterful clown act. She's a winsome presence as the uncommonly cute city girl who falls for George. Here's another tricky acting challenge, trying to straddle the line between cartoon character and real girl. She might have been a disaster if she pushed too far in either direction, but she turns out wonderful.Wonderful. Apply the word to everything about George of the Jungle. It's a movie I have cherished since the days watching it religiously with my cousin and brother on my Grandma's ancient VCR. Some of my most beloved memories are attached to Sam Weisman's innocent little kid's flick (I'll proudly admit to tightly lacing up a pair of Nikes and running shirtless through the middle school football practice field like George through the African savanna). Nostalgia is a powerful drug. It's the primary reason for George of the Jungle's spot among my top 10 all-time favorites. But nostalgia is not all this delightful film has going for it. Squint your eyes, and between all the hilarious absurdities, the apes named ""Ape"" that sound like John Cleese, the elephants that play fetch, the ""Oo oo, ee ee, tookie tookie""s, you'll find genuine sweetness. A real air of good-humored joy. I'm always surprised that such a goofy, screwball adventure picture would end up feeling so impressive, but George of the Jungle is really that good at what it does. I could call it ""a very funny live-action comedy, with a playful stupidity that delighted the kid in me, and a core of clever wit that tickled my adult sensibilities too"", but that wouldn't tell the whole story. I see a more special quality in this colorful entertainment. A sense of truthfully felt innocence. Most childhood favorites don't stand up to adult scrutiny. George of the Jungle does one better. It keeps growing in my appreciation as the years pass.88/100",George of the Jungle
43,Snowgo,One of the Worst Films,2,4 October 2015,"Don't get me wrong: I like Brendan Fraser. He was great in Encino Man, Still Breathing, Bedazzled, Airheads and Extraordinary Measures. Those are some of his films I have seen.George of the Jungle (and Dudley Do-Right), are two of the worst films ever made. I don't know why Brendan accepted this role: At least he had the sense to reject acting in the (cough) sequel. Sam Weisman should have been banned from Hollywood for his directorial work on this picture, but I suppose he redeemed himself, six years later, with Dickie Roberts, Former Child Star.This opinion is coming from a reviewer whose #1 comedy of all time is Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls, so that should tell you just how bad George of the Jungle is: There is only one joke in the movie, and it is duplicated relentlessly: The protagonist swings on a ""rope or vine"" into a tree. I think it may have been done ten times in the first ten minutes of the movie, and it was about as un-funny as it was in the original cartoon: Another person's misfortune and injury is not funny. It just isn't. At least, it shouldn't be. This is the type of insidious de-sensitization that is fed our kids, in its candy coating, unless we are good enough parents to help them see clearly and feel a sense of empathy and responsibility for those around them.Oh. Yes: I forgot about the talking gorilla. Okay, there were two jokes, both gratingly dull.George of the Jungle has no redeeming qualities, and the only reason I am not giving it one star is because it has Brendan Fraser, who tried to do what he could to vitalize a horrible script.",George of the Jungle

It actually got to the point where I found myself hoping that George would, indeed, seriously injure himself the next time he came face-to-face with another tree trunk. But, my wish was never granted.Not only that, but, I found that the annoying & unfunny voice-over narration that cropped-up throughout the story didn't help matters much, either. And as far as the George character went, I thought that Brendan Fraser was clearly miscast for his part and his performance unbelievably irritating, to boot.When George arrived in the ""civilized"" world, that certainly made his character look even more stupid than ever.If you ask me - This $55 million, live-action cartoon tried way-way too hard to be funny, but regardless of all of its zany, slapstick comedy, it only succeeded in falling flat on its face for the most part.Based on the characters from a very mediocre TV cartoon series from 1967, George Of The Jungle was strictly geared for an audience that has very low expectations about what encourages them to laugh.",George of the Jungle

Whats also Hilarius that George hits the tree then he falls down on the trampoline then fly in the air then he land on the tree. The apes are very interesting too so does the lion. My favorite part is that Shep got the log then he drop it on the rose. Whats terrible that Lyle shots George.

The moments with the gorillas bring out consistent moments of hilarity, and the giant pet elephant is sure to give a few chuckles.

In a lot of ways, the plot is like ""Titanic"" -- nice new boy steals girl away from sleezebag fiancée she's just marrying to please her mother.

George with the aid of his faithful companion and spiritual advisor Ape, originally played by Ronald Colman in a marvelous uncredited performance, perservered and lived to conquer evil in the jungle.

Not Naked Gun funny, but still funny nonetheless. It is definitely worth the price of rental or purchase, so long as you like silly/unrealistic circumstances, talking animals, etc.For those of you keeping score, this movie was much funnier than Dudley Do-Right, which had some similarities.",George of the Jungle
57,harj-41-607090,Poor hardly funny family flick,4,29 December 2011,"This promised to be an entertaining family flick. The ingredients seem just right, talking animals, lady falls in love with a jungle man, fiancé gets jealous etc. Brendan Fraser pulls of the role reasonably well. John Cleese is well cast as the voice of an ape. However the rest is pulled off terribly. Barring the special effects (which are actually very good), there is little more in this film that might move it up the 'must watch holiday family flick' list. A lot more could and should have been made of this and what little slapstick there is could have been even funnier. the action however is reasonably well choreographed. The problem is that most of it is quite 'reasonable' and not a single element is outstanding.",George of the Jungle

59,Zombie-Kermit,An Awesome Kid's Movie,7,13 May 2008,"When this movie came out I loved it. My little brother loved it. My older brother loved it. My little sister loved it. It's just a really fun movie, and I'm really shocked it has a rating this low.It's a movie that really can't be taken too seriously. It's not meant to make you stop and think ""Hmmmm, could a boy raised in the jungle function in our world?"" No. It's meant to be a fun and enjoyable movie. And in that respect in succeeds greatly.There are lots of laughs with John Cleese as a talking gorilla, an awesome narration, and just all around great characters. Brendan Fraser is great as George.Of cause being a Disney movie it has the basic love story, bad guys and toilet humour... and there special effects are far from spectacular, but I don't think people should let that hold them back from enjoying this awesome movie.I see this as being one of those movies you look back on when you're older and still find a lot of the scenes really funny. It seems impossible to me that people could not find this funny. It kinda makes me feel old.... and young at the same time.As I type this review I remember more and more scenes from the movie and it makes me feel like watching it again. If you have kids... buy them this movie. If not.... buy it anyway.",George of the Jungle
60,Budd-5,"It's so stupid, it's hilarious!",7,30 August 1999,"Thumbs up to the director and the stars of George of the Jungle. They have made one of the funniest children's films that you will ever see. You know that they had a great time making it because it's clearly evident on the screen. George of the Jungle is simply just a Tarzan parody. (Ape-man meets girl, falls for girl, leaves for city, returns to jungle). But the predictable plot doesn't destroy the performances and the movie is peppered with some laugh out loud jokes.Of course the special effects are impressive - a talking ape, an elephant that thinks he's a dog - but it's the humans that steal the show. Fraser is fantastic as George - he is one of the most talented actors out there at the moment - though this film doesn't test his range much, he shows a nice comic flair. Mann is a lovable foil for our hero, though her squeaky voice is at times too cute. None of the other characters disappoint. Both Mann's parents are great in supporting roles and Lyle as Mann's nasty fiance is sensational.Kids will love this. Adults, I think will find a lot to enjoy in it also, but don't bring along any cynics. They'll miss out on all the fun!!",George of the Jungle
61,mt7176,Rediscover George,10,9 December 2006,"I remember seeing this movie in the movies and enjoying it a lot. It was just as silly as the cartoon I had watched when I was younger. This weekend, as I sat down on the couch, and was flipping channels, I landed upon that movie and began to start laughing almost immediately at all the silly jokes, stunts, and effects. I noticed some people have a lot of problems with the maturity level of this movie but isn't a little senseless humor a good thing from time to time? I mean at the movie this December (Christmas season for crying out loud) beside the run of the mill Christmas comedy's, you have movies about end of civilizations, and diamond trafficking, and other over dramatic Oscar seeking films that turn up the drama. Well no thanks. I mean this past year has been nothing but hum drum action and drama films. If there is a comedy it is usually R and filled with sex and gross out humor. I can handle a little of that stuff but it gets old real fast. Where are the up beat screw ball comedies? Well I'll just say for what the film makers were trying to capture they got it perfectly down on the film. The comedy acting, the clever narrator and the spot on pacing of the film. Good for 9 or 90.",George of the Jungle
62,lgilbertom,George is a very funny movie,8,1 March 2003,"Really, i don't understand because the rating of this movie is low. In my country, this movie bring on the theatre thousands. I give to this movie rating 8. ""George of the Jungle"" is a adaptation of the cartoon that has the same name. Really, i prefer a thousand times the movie than the cartoon. This movie it's very funny, Brendan Frasier is hilarious played George also his co-star Leslie is lovely. Also, we don't forget the George's friends, Ape and Elephant that are responsible for very good moments in this movie. There are few movies that i laugh so many times as ""George of the Jungle"".

Sometimes it was over-the-top, but it was supposed to be.This one is certainly not to be taken seriously.All of the characters in this movie fit into cookie-cutter molds, and that is one of the things that makes this film such easy viewing. No pretense. No trying to be 'real'.It feels like a great children's book or comfort food. It doesn't have to be perfect, you love it anyway.**There is a scene of comic violence that I wish was missing, but the rest of the film is positive and fun for the whole family.",George of the Jungle
64,Erik G.,Hilarious!,10,22 February 1999,"What a zany, goofy, good time of a movie.  Obviously, judging by the other comments, this type of humor is a matter of taste.  But if you like inane humor, you'll love this flick.  The plot is...well it's idiotic, but nobody really cares, that is the great thing.  This is not a situation comedy!  It has lots of tongue-in-cheek humor, slapstick, and of course, the infamous fake trees (this is a comedy...remember?).  The narrator is the funniest character in the whole movie--he scolds the characters, adds smart-ass remarks and talks to the audience, reassuring them that ""nobody dies in this story...they just get really big boo-boos!""  If you are the type of person who just likes a big laugh, and aren't too worried about what kind of elephant Shep is, you will like this one.",George of the Jungle

WRONG! This movie, which has so much humor for kids, doesn't lack in keeping adults entertained and laughing as well. With the extremely charismatic Brendan Fraser leading the way, George is romp through history. I remember watching the Saturday Morning Cartoon with my sister and thinking how funny it was. Not only is there silly slap-stick, but the dialogue is quite witty. Many of the jokes are geared toward the child mind, but there is an equal amount for adults. I say, finally a movie to watch with EVERYONE in your family.",George of the Jungle

The drums beats never fail to get me in the mood for George.",George of the Jungle
67,limelemonrocks,Strong as he can be!,5,11 October 2015,"George of the Jungle is a cool movie about an ape man living in the jungle. This movie is kind of a copy of Tarzan, but it isn't awful. This movie was funny, and it was also a little boring. This movie to me wasn't making since at times. A guy falling of a bridge 30 stories high, then he survives, and there's another scene where a bad guy shoots George in the head, and then George lives! Brendon Fraser's performance as George was wonderful, and this movie also has John Cleeese, and Thomas Haden Church. The song at the begging of the movie was cool because it starts out as a cartoon, and then after the song, the live action starts. I would only revisit the funny parts of the movie, I would rather not watch the whole thing.",George of the Jungle
68,flickaddict,Stupid smiling ape-guy swings into ( fake ) trees.,1,10 August 1999,"I'm sorry, but this film is one of the worst I have ever seen. I rented it because of Brendan Fraser ( who plays George ). I saw him in ' School Ties ' , a delightful film and one of his earlier ( and I think best )roles. Because of that film he caught my attention as a great and promising young actor. After seeing this horrible, not-funny-at-all copy of the Tarzan movies, I'm beginning to have second thoughts about his acting talents. Why does an actor with so much talents agree to star in a film like this ???? That's what I asked myself the entire 88 minutes of this absolutely boring film. I've seen a number of other films ( like ' Still breathing ' or ' Blast from the past') in which Brendan Fraser is really great, so why on earth did he need to accept a role in which the only thing he seems to be doing is smiling stupidly, flying around in a jaguar-print bikini and making irritating attempts at being the funniest guy in the jungle ?And not to mention the 'special effects'.....fake trees, silly puppet lions, and actors in shabby gorilla-outfits............. The only thing that I thougt could be called a ' special effect' was the computer generated elephant Shep, who thinks that he's a dog. It was the only thing in the film that looked ( sort of ) realistic to me.For little kids it might be entertaining, but I actually found this film in the adult section of our videostore, and thought it to be a little bit out of place there. As I said, I only rented it because of Fraser, and expected it to be silly, but at the end it proved to be even more stupid and meaningless as I imagined. Not funny at all, and a real shame for such a promising actor as Brendan Fraser !I give this wouldbe comedy 1 out of 10 for adults, and 6 out of 10 for children.",George of the Jungle
69,Oer-6,"It may be a bit cheesy, but the rest is so damn well made!",10,21 March 2018,"If you can get past a couple of cheap toilet humor parts, the rest of this movie is so well made.

And anyone who sat through the Thomas the Tank Engine movie knows that the movies your kids are able to see are either unbelievably boring or bordering on socially unacceptable. George of the Jungle is a very light comedy which is enjoyable for everyone. This is the first movie during which I heard my daughter laugh out loud... even after the 500th viewing. Yes it is silly... but, Brendan Fraser is at his hottest in this film. It is worth watching just to see the bod!",George of the Jungle

75,balone21,Very cute and funny in that whimsical cartoon sense,10,15 October 2002,"I think this movie was a great depiction of the original cartoon.  The humor used in the film is very much like what would be found in cartoons, and is designed to be taken that way.  I mean, any show where the narrator and the characters actually interact should not be treated/rated the same way as, say, a movie with dirty-humor.  This really seems like it was designed both for children and for adults who remember the original cartoon, and I feel that it capticated these ideas very well and also captured the hearts of teens who secretly love cartoons but didn't want to be caught in a cartoon-ish movie theatre.  I say that it was a great job all around, and that the acting very accurately fit the characters as well, in that cartoonish type way...a hard thing to do, but they pulled it off.",George of the Jungle
76,queencav,A Jem of a movie,10,20 October 1998,"""George of the Jungle"" is one of the most enjoyable movies I've ever watched. Usually when you turn comics or cartoons into live action something goes wrong but 'Jungle' is unique in that it has been transformed with immense success.This potentially cheesy movie made me laugh for its entire duration. The Narrator (voiced by Keith Scott) is particularly hilarious. The bronzed and stone-bellied Brandon Frasier is delightful as George - a role similar to the one he had in his prior film 'Encino Man'. The comic-looking Leslie Mann with her girlish curls also masters a voice that conveys cartoonish qualities to the big screen and she is the perfect 'mate' to Frasier's George.This is a great movie because it is not just one character that you love, but it is the entire cast. You will come to hate the baddies and adore the goodies. A lot of the comedy especially towards the end is slaps- stick but you would expect nothing less from a Tarzan wannabe who swings into trees, cakes, boats, vans, cars and anything else that's in his path.This is a great movie to watch with your family. It is light, funny and I'll guarantee you'll leave it with a smile on your face!!!",George of the Jungle
77,bigguns,Not quite what you expect...,8,25 April 2002,"I have now seen this movie a number of times and I must say that it does improve with each viewing. The key to really enjoying this movie is not to take it seriously. The movie does not take itself seriously.Yeah, some of the gags (visual or otherwise) are corny...BUT they are meant to be! That is this movie's appeal. An unpretentious romp! It reminds me a bit of the Crosby and Hope ""Road to films"". Not that there is any similarity in the the style of film but rather in the essence of the movie. Pure fun. So the plot is near non-existent...so what!",George of the Jungle
78,MarkA-21,The TV-to-movie that worked!,9,4 January 2008,"This is one of the very, very few cases of a TV series being translated into a movie that worked well; it was sympathetic to the original, and was good viewing in its own right. The translation from cartoon to real-life action succeeded because the spirit of the original, the sense of fun (without taking itself too seriously) - and even the theme music - was maintained.Movies based on popular television series made a generation ago almost always flop. Thunderbirds, Lost In Space, Bewitched, and especially The Avengers, prove that people making modern movies to cash in on popular old TV shows keep making the same mistakes. Before another producer rolls out another bastardization of a good old TV series, would it be too much to ask that they consider why so many fail, and why George of the Jungle succeeded? This movie appeals to those of us who remember the old TV cartoons; it doesn't change more than it has to, it does not rest heavily on expensive effects, nor does it change the style of the original. But it also is popular with a new generation - my sons enjoyed it without knowing the original, because it has good (over)acting, innovative gags, and a deep-rooted sense of fun that comes from people who know what they are doing and can resist the temptation to rely on a known name to grab an audience. In particular, some of the best parts of the movie are slapstick - like slapstick of old, it must have talented actors and perfect timing, which this movie does.",George of the Jungle

That was until my 6 year old niece watched it with me. Twice in a row. One of the few movies she will actually sit there the whole time for, just staring at the screen. After seeing the enjoyment on her face I began to look at the movie from a child's perspective. Take your mind back to when you were a kid. Then press play. You'll enjoy it a lot more.

83,bubba-35,George is jungle king and will stop at nothing (except trees) to protect his jungle and his friends.,10,23 October 1998,"George of the Jungle is a feel good movie. It has some suspense but mostly is a comical, romantic film. Casting Brendan Fraser was a good choice. He was entertaining and believable. Although the movie had some corny scenes, for the most part it was a good family film. It was enjoyable for both kids and adults. The casting of George of the Jungle was a good choice. Each actor seemed to play well off each other and timing was right on the mark. Although the effects in the film were not always believable it was easy to overlook them. The movie had a very entertaining quality. It was endearing and sincere. I think for most people it reminded us of our childhood and growing up with the cartoon. Brendan Fraser never strayed from the quality that makes George seem naieve and genuine. Leslie Mann made her character sweet but not fraile. Her charm made her character likeable and easy to cheer on in her struggle to help George. All in all it was a good movie and definitely one I would recommend.",George of the Jungle
84,ejl-41750,A Fun and Delightful Family Romp,9,29 September 2016,"Being a 90's and early 2000's child, I wouldn't have heard of the original cartoon series if it weren't for my parents having a couple VHS's of them. I watched them and I enjoyed them, so when the movie was coming out, I was excited. Unfortunately, we weren't able to see it in the theater,but my parents did buy the VHS of it. When we did watch it, we loved it, especially me, and maybe even more so now. Why?First, the most important step of a good comedy is to make your audience laugh, and it did just that. How it managed to keep me laughing both as a kid and now was that it switched between different types of humor rather than sticking to just one. The best done here is the physical gags including the swing gags and the slapstick style fight scenes. Of course, there are very effective verbal humor that adults will enjoy, and that's not to say that there is an abundance of mildly suggestive comments, only like one or two, but even they make the adults laugh while just flying right over the children's heads. And there is also some mild toilet humor that will definitely make the children giggle.Second, the film has plenty of heart. The movie does a great job of depicting a nice and believable love between George and Ursula. At the same time, it shows great friendship between George and his friends Ape, Tooki his toucan messenger, and Shep his elephant dog.Third, the characters and the performances from the actors playing them are spot on. First of all, we have the naive but lovable George played in a hilarious performance by Brendan Fraser, the beautiful and sweet Ursula played by Leslie Mann, the shady egotistical and idiotic villain of the movie Lyle played by Thomas Haden Church, Ursula's snooty and not-so approving mother played perfectly by Holland Taylor, and last but not least: George's hilarious intelligent and sometimes sarcastic friend An Ape Named Ape voiced by John Cleese.Fourth, the backgrounds and scenery are some of the best you'll ever see from the jungle to the waterfalls and rivers to the savannas.With all the things about the movie that are great, are there any negatives about the movie? Yes, but they are extremely minor. First is the story, which is a bit unoriginal therefore having some predictability, but because of all the things positive about the movie, chances are you won't mind it. Second is that there are a few moments from the film that feel a bit dark, but they are very brief and won't do anything that will ruin or contradict the all around goofy and lighthearted tone of the movie.So, all in all, this is a great family comedy. Parents, I highly recommend you share this movie with your children. I really think they'll love it.9/10",George of the Jungle
85,roberta-38524,"Funny, sweet and enjoyable for adults but NOT appropriate for children (disappointing if that was the intended audience)",6,22 January 2018,"Disney screwed up big time by including a line from the narrator in the film about ""don't worry, none of the people die, they just get boo boos"" and then DID NOT make the same statement around a scene involving beating up on a lion. BAD FORM DISNEY. There was also a fight scene that was unnecessarily violent and long. The one scene catching George out of his clothes was cute and nothing showed, but it was done in a way that made it clear he was really naked, one more thing knocking it off the list for children under I'd say the age of 13 or 14.",George of the Jungle

87,tbkbabb,A funny film based on the cartoon of the same name.,9,3 December 2001,"The cartoon George of the Jungle might not have been Bugs Bunny in terms of wit, but it had it's own somewhat simpler charm and was always among my favorite cartoons as a kid. This film captures the fun of that cartoon; Brendan Fraser was a great choice to play George, the rest of the cast is quite good (especially John Cleese doing the voice of the talking ape), and the special effects with the elephant was well done. If you want to see a simply fun film, you could do worse than George of the Jungle.",George of the Jungle
88,jeffgoss-91523,Silly but holds up since my childhood,9,4 July 2020,"I watched this movie all the time as a kid and haven't seen it since I was ten. It's definitely made for kids but I understand far more of the jokes as an adult. The comedy isn't necessarily high-brow, there's a lot of slapstick humor (George falling off things, hitting trees), but if you don't take it too seriously, it's enjoyable for kids and adults especially with the 90s styles and technology dating it significantly, adding an unintended layer of humor (""Ursula, I found your scrunchie""). The bridge-swing scene still thrills me.",George of the Jungle
89,qcvgjac,Love Brendan faser,10,25 March 2021,"Loved this film as a child and still do now, cute and funny.",George of the Jungle
90,Dolphindancer101,"Good movie for everyone who isn't to ""mature"" for they're own good",10,2 December 2007,"I love this movie. Sure, the jungle's fake as all get out and some jokes are repeated a little more than they probably should have been but we all need some good old fashion slap-stick. So long as your not to stuck up on your own maturity, you can get a laugh out of this movie. I personally, this coming from someone whose 17 (almost 18), think it's a great movie for laughs. Sure it's not a Oscar winning earthshaking artistic masterpiece but it's not supposed to be. It's made to be fun and goofy with a silly plot that kids can follow. For it's genre and the audience it's aimed at, it's awesome! Even for those who aren't in the intended audience group. 10 out of 10 in my opinion!",George of the Jungle
91,seyschmitz,Family Fun,10,2 March 2019,Nothing wrong with a little bit of fun in a movie. Just watched it again with my daughter after many years ans we had a good nostalgic laugh.,George of the Jungle
92,Melli-4,"Refreshing, funny and enjoyable",10,28 September 1999,George of the Jungle gives Brendan a chance to show how confident he is with himself by showing his funny side. I believe he will go far in his acting. I'll admit he does have the looks to go with it. I love the eyes.,George of the Jungle
93,titanic62,i truly love this film.....,10,8 October 2000,i truly love this film and i like it alot i think it is so funny and i like the characters in the film.....thank u for ur timeur friend titanic62...,George of the Jungle
94,repmonkey,Gloriously Silly.,10,3 March 2001,How many times can you laugh at George swinging into a tree? Every single time!! I fell out of my chair laughing the first time I saw this movie and every time since. Anyone who has not seen this movie should immediately endeavor to do so. The whole movie is flawlessly put together to provide sensational entertainment for anyone with the merest hint of a sense of humour.,George of the Jungle
95,tjsa1969,Slight remake of slighter cartoon,8,13 November 2003,I had to vote for this. I think some people must be thinking too seriously about themselves. You can watch this time after time and still get the same dumb laughs. Brendan Fraser is a great actor who is just really good at these cartoonish parts.,George of the Jungle
96,jemmie211,So Dang DUMB I LOVE It!,8,28 November 2011,"Those who know me know I HATE stupid comedy. I must admit that I watched this movie simply because B. Fraser starred in it: I have a long-standing crush on the man.I knew, going into it, that it'd be a silly movie with dull humor. Still, I was pleasantly surprised.The humor is dry and stupid most of the time, but the storyline makes up for it. And, as I recall from my childhood, George was always a bit dimwitted anyway. So I could deal with the stupidity of the movie and enjoy it for what it was--a child's film with adult undertones.And Brendan Fraser in a loincloth......need I say more?",George of the Jungle
97,DJ_ana_,Absolutely positive:),10,12 September 2004,"I've seen this film for about 5 times and I still laugh every time I see it. It's not the usual Cake-in-the-face humor, but it's somewhat more sophisticated, and with a bit of sarcasm, I pretty much does the trick. From the beginning to the end, it was a very enjoyable bit, and if it comes again, then I'll probably watch it. The actors were quite nice in their parts, and the animals fitted into the picture, too. If I had to find anything not-so-good about the movie, it would probably be the computer graphics, but otherwise the scenery was beautiful. The whole film was positive. It was quite naive, but in a sweet kind of way:)",George of the Jungle
98,wjportes,why comedies are not well rated?,7,15 February 2007,"I believe this movie is good, my family enjoyed it and I think it's better than others higher rated ones. I hope that there will be more movies like this so I can sit on Sunday night with my family to watch TV.The scene where the small monkey fakes to be George is the one of the most hilarious scenes I've ever seen, so let's be honest and put things in place and give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar.Next time you want to spend a nice moment along your family buy or rent this movie.Waldys",George of the Jungle
99,theklek,The Worst Movies of All Times,1,11 August 2005,"George of the Jungle is hands down the worst movie of all times. Here you have it all rolled into one: incredibly bad acting, yawnfully unstimulating story, flat characters, hollow jokes, cheap sets, budget television cinematography, and half-hearted stunts.This movie doesn't offer any of the appeal of the original cartoon which was funny and charming for what it was. In typical Disney fashion, beloved concepts are smashed and rendered into something that can be singularly translated into mass marketing. From videos to fast-food kid meals, we're served up a dish of slop that used to be a tasty confection of light entertainment in it's original form.Watching Brendan Fraser (who's budding career was luckily not destroyed by this movie) and Leslie Mann do the jungle dance to an uninspired Disney tune was terribly painful. One can only imagine the conditions in Hollywood that lead actors to gleefully sign such Devil's pacts.",George of the Jungle
100,ltn5087,One of the best childhood movies.,9,20 February 2013,"I used to watch this as a child and thoroughly enjoyed it back when it came out. I recently watched it again after decades and even though the CG is vastly different from what it is today, it is still an enjoyable movie. The talking monkeys in the movie look very realistic compared to what they would try in this day and age. The narrator in the movie is not annoying as I thought it was going to be as I watched it again as an adult, instead it added to the amusement. I recommend it for parents that like to pass on this movie to their kids. They may not understand some jokes but the majority of it is still understandable. George's antics can make the whole movie for a child. It did for me. It doesn't hurt to look at Brendan Fraser neither!",George of the Jungle
101,nicohillman,So good you forget it's a parody,10,2 August 2020,I've loved this movie since a kid! I still watch it! People forget it's a parody! It's also a cartoon and it's a classic to me,George of the Jungle
102,nigelwaring-24913,Great family film,8,31 October 2019,Silly humour makes this a great family film. It's a film that all three of my children have loved.,George of the Jungle
