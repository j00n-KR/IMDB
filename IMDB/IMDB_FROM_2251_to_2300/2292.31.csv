0,Leofwine_draca,Crass nonsense,2,18 January 2020,"More crass nonsense from Rob Zombie. 31 is another 'underground' horror feature in which an unpleasant group of travelling misfits find themselves captured by an even worse group of misfits, a random family of desert-dwelling clowns who subject them to depraved torture and random games with often fatal outcomes. It's a plotless, pointless affair, only notable for wasting old-time genre stars (Meg Foster, Judy Geeson and Malcolm McDowell) in nothing roles and generally going over the top in every respect. The whole thing has a grubby, dirty look, with a mindless script littered with profanity and endless gore and nastiness. I feel that Zombie watches the likes of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre on repeat but has no idea what truly makes classics like that work.",31
1,claudio_carvalho,"Unoriginal, Pointless and Awful",2,23 September 2016,"In 1976, on the eve of Halloween, an itinerant troupe is forced to stop their truck and attacked by strangers. Charly (Sheri Moon Zombie), Venus Virgo (Meg Foster), Panda Thomas (Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs), Levon Wally (Kevin Jackson) and Roscoe Pepper (Jeff Daniel Phillips) survive. They are forced to participate in a sadistic game called ""31"" for 12 hours, and whoever survives will be released. Soon they are attacked by sadistic killers dressed like clowns. Will someone survive to the ""31""?""31"" is an unoriginal pointless awful slasher with an absurd and stupid story. The greatest challenge is not for the group forced to participate, but for the viewer to see this film until the very end. The only thing good to see is the veteran cast with Malcolm McDowell, Judy Geeson (""To Sir with Love"") and Meg Foster (""They Live""). Unfortunately they are wasted in a poor story and screenplay. It is better off watching ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" again. My vote is two.Title (Brazil): Not Available",31
2,nogodnomasters,I'm not crazy. I'm in control.,9,2 October 2017,"Rob Zombie does his version of ""Running Man"" in this film. A group of carnival travelers are taken prisoner by Malcolm McDowell (replaces Richard Dawson) and company and are forced to participate in a survival game called ""31"" because it takes place on Halloween. They are placed in what appears to be a steam plant while hunters are introduced as in ""Running Man""...odds are established and wages made. The first killer was a Hispanic midget Nazi (Pancho Moler). Sheri Moon Zombie plays the same oversexed vulgar character that she normally does. Since her husband wrote the script, she gets to play Arnold and if you are thinking of a final girl... Doom-Head played magnificently by Richard Brake in bad clown make-up reminded me of the Heath Ledger Joker as he keeps telling himself, ""I'm not crazy. I'm in control."" The film delivers plenty of blood, guts, bad jokes, sex, full frontal nudity, vulgarity, torture, abuse...all in good fun. The theater version was cut to go from NC-17 to R. After the first cut, it was still NC-17. It took a second cut to get it to R. The Blu-Ray version is supposed to be uncut. It's Rob Zombie, you know what to expect.Nudity includes: Andrea Dora, Ginger Lynn, Devin Sidell, Shawn Rougeron, Megan Albertus",31
3,kosmasp,Just another Halloween,7,16 April 2017,"Obviously the title is a give away, though I'm not sure if Rob meant to riff on his critics or was just exclaiming his love for the last day in October. Whatever the case is, this movie is mental to say the least. Just the beginning alone which sets the mood should tell you so. Is it something you want to watch? Are you ready for this? The answer lies within yourself.Richard Brake is phenomenal in this, although he's not playing the main role, he does steal the show (no pun intended). Some may call this a return to form for Rob Zombie, but then again he does seem to tend to love making movies like that anyway (small budget, very violent, over the top and offensive). If that's not your cup of tea, don't watch it, plain and simple. This is not a masterpiece, it is violent, anarchic, fun splatter all the way. Enjoy it for what it is then",31
4,Woodyanders,Going the distance for twelve hours of pure hell,8,21 December 2016,"Five itinerant carnival workers are forced to participate in a savage survivalist sport for twelve grueling hours in which they are pitted against a wild assortment of merry psychos made-up as freaks and clowns.Writer/director Rob Zombie does an able job of creating and sustaining an unflinchingly grim, nightmarish, and nihilistic tone, vividly captures the raw, grimy, and sleazy aesthetic of vintage down'n'dirty 70's horror exploitation fare (the film takes place in 1976), delivers plenty of in-your-face nasty gore, gives the luckless protagonists some depth and humanity (Zombie also deserves extra praise for departing from the usual young people in jeopardy formula by making said protagonists folks who are in their forties and up), and concludes things on a nervy downbeat note. Sheri Moon Zombie as the sassy Charly, Jeff Daniel Phillips as the surly Roscoe Pepper, Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs as the easygoing Panda Thomas, Meg Foster as the scrappy Venus Virgo, and Kevin Jackson as jolly horndog Levon Wally all do solid work in their roles.Moreover, this movie further benefits from an enjoyably outrageous array of colorful and grotesque villains: Malcolm McDowell hams it up grandly as foppish ringmaster Father Murder, Pancho Moler attacks his part as Spanish-speaking Nazi midget Sick-Head with the unbridled ferocity of a rabid pit bull, Lew Temple rips the scenery to shreds as the maniacal Psycho-Head, Elizabeth Daily struts her scorching stuff as giddy femme fatale Sex-Head, and, in an especially bravura turn, Richard Brake makes a potent impression as the fearsome and remorseless Doom-Head. The startling moments of brutal'n'bloody violence pack a vicious punch. The pulsating score hits the throbbing groovy spot. David Daniel's gaudy widescreen cinematography provides a right-on funky look and makes neat use of freeze frames. A satisfying serving of grindhouse horror grit.",31
5,BA_Harrison,White trash grind-house horror from Rob Zombie. For a change.,3,19 September 2016,"31 opens with a quote from Kafka. Pretentious, moi? Then some dude wearing white face paint tries to bore another bloke to death by talking a load of old claptrap to him; when that doesn't work, he whacks him with an axe instead. It later transpires that the axe-happy chappie with the bad attitude and teeth to match is Doomhead, one of a group of psychos paid to hunt and kill unwilling participants in an annual game organised by some twisted geriatrics in powdered wigs. In the latest game of 31, a group of carnival folk fight for their lives against a variety of foes, including a Nazi midget, a tall bloke in suspenders and a tutu, and a pair of chainsaw wielding loonies.Having suffered through both of Rob Zombie's Halloween movies, I approached 31 with trepidation, longing for a return to form for the director who gave us the fun House of 1000 Corpses and the excellent The Devil's Rejects, but expecting the worse. Sadly, Zombie met my expectations: a wafer thin plot that lacks originality (check out Maurice Deveraux's $lasher$ for a much better take on the deadly game-show theme), horrible characters (the protagonists are so scuzzy I actually wanted them to die), trite grind-house affectations, and repetitive, uninspired action made this one a real chore to watch. C'mon Zombie, I know you can do better than this lazy, predictable tosh.",31
6,paul_haakonsen,"You know what they say, kemosabe, in Hell, everybody loves popcorn...",5,4 October 2016,"Right, another movie from Rob Zombie. And after the last disastrous ""Lords of Salem"" movie, then I had very little expectations to ""31"". I did read the synopsis of the movie, and it did seem like it could have potential to be something violent and gruesome, but then again it also could totally flop and just become a parody on itself.And now having seen ""31"", then I will say that while it certainly was better than ""Lords of Salem"", then it is by no means an outstanding movie nor a particularly entertaining movie.The story in all its simplicity is about a group of people getting trapped in a maniacal game of survival on Hallows Eve.Yep, the movie is that simple. The storyline is very simple and offers nothing, absolutely nothing, in terms of challenging the intellect of the audience. This is solely a movie about showing off violence, bizarre characters and Rob's obsession with clowns.Sure, I did enjoy the graphic violence in the movie, and some of the means of maiming, torturing and killing people was interesting. And the characters in the movie were interesting and colorful, both the protagonists and the killer clowns. But the storyline was so shallow and predictable that it served as an anchor around the movie, dragging it down.As for the cast in ""31"", well I can't really claim to be a particular fan of Sheri Moon Zombie, so she doesn't really appeal much to me in terms of having lead roles. However, I will say that, in my opinion, it was Jeff Daniel Phillips, Pancho Moler and Richard Brake whom were lifting up the movie with their performances and portrayal of their respective characters.The effects and make-up in the movie was quite good, and having that advantage in the visual department surely did work in favor of the movie.""31"" is hardly going to be classics like ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"", but it is worth a single viewing if you enjoy the weird results of Rob Zombie's imaginary thinking.To me, ""31"" was a very mediocre movie, especially since the killing and mayhem could only do so little to try to make up for a proper storyline.",31
7,Coventry,In Hell everybody loves popcorn!,7,1 April 2016,"Here are a couple of things that must have gone through Rob Zombie's mind whilst shooting 31: ""Who needs a plot when you got a psychopathic Nazi-midget?"", ""Who gives a damn about plausibility when you have Malcolm McDowell himself dressed up like a French Aristocrat and depicting a character that is named Father Murder?"" and ""Why would I make ambitious when the crowd simply wants sadistic & graphic violence?"" And you know what? If Rob Zombie really was thinking these things, he was damn right! Personally, I'm an enormous fan of Zombie's ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"" and I remotely enjoyed his remake of ""Halloween"", even though the critics were quite harsh about it. But then he suddenly went psychedelic and experimental with ""Halloween II"" and ""The Lords of Salem"" and many fans – yours truly included – were disappointed. I, for one, was extremely happy to read that, with ""31"", Rob Zombie would return to the basics of crude and repulsive horror/shlock cinema! Because, after all, the revival of 70s grindhouse/drive-in exploitation cinema was largely the deed of Rob Zombie and not of Quentin Tarantino! So, ""31"" actually doesn't a have a real plot but is a mixture of homages to genre classics (for example ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") and borrowed ideas of cult classics (""The Most Dangerous Game"", ""The Running Man"") A ramshackle old RV full of traveling circus artists/carnies is driving through the middle of redneck nowhere on Halloween's day 1976, and pretty much all they ever do is foul-mouthing and fornicating. When night falls, however, they notice the road is blocked with immense scarecrows. Before they properly realize what's going on, the RV and all its passengers are brutally attacked by mysterious creeps and three people are killed instantly. The remaining five survivors, two women and three men, awake tied up and chained in an abandoned factory where three elderly lunatics dressed up as French Aristocrats joyfully inform them that they are the players in this year's traditional game of 31. They are released in a dark and creepy labyrinth and have to survive for twelve hours while being chased by some of the most demented sickos ever caught on film, including a Spanish babbling Nazi-midget, clown siblings with chainsaws and deranged German sex deviants. The group defend themselves quite well, though, and thus the crazy tormentors bring in their ultimate secret weapon, the unbeatable master-psycho Doom-Head! There isn't really too much to write about Rob Zombie's latest film, in fact. Either you're a fan of extreme and relentless violence and ""31"" is a must-see for you, or you'll completely detest the film for its lack of plot, character background, style or overall lack of taste. If even writer/director Zombie himself repeatedly stated that this is his most brutal movie to date, there isn't any reason to not believe him. ""31"" features numerous scenes in which people's heads are smashed in with a bludgeon, torsos are cut in half by chainsaws and throats are slit with rusty knives. Still, I can't help mentioning that most of this gruesome stuff also featured in ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"", but those two were suspenseful and haunting on top! ""31"" is sheer mindless horror entertainment but it won't leave a long-lasting impression. As usual, Rob Zombie surrounds himself with a cast that he worked well with before, including his own wife Sheri Moon, Meg Foster, Jeff Daniel Philips and many other familiar faces. The soundtrack is terrific as well, which is another Rob Zombie trademark, and features for example the beautiful song ""California Dreaming"" during a rare quiet and peaceful scene.",31
8,michaelRokeefe,Revolting and gruesome Rob Zombie project.,7,7 February 2017,"If you like your horror disgusting, revolting, gruesome and almost vomit inducing...31 is just your bucket of guts. Rob Zombie directs and writes this gag-fest with no holds barred. I don't recall easily too many movies that I had to turn my head and hold my breath.On Halloween eve, Roscoe (Jeff Daniel Phillips) and his band of carnies are searching for their next venue, when they find themselves abducted, and held prisoner in a sinister compound and are forced to play a brutal game, in which they must survive 12 hours of bizarre torment dealt by a horde of backwoods hillbilly clowns.The strong lead is given to Sheri Moon Zombie, who shares the bloody splatter with Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, Richard Brake, Pancho Moler, Meg Foster, Kevin Jackson, Andrea Dora, Lew Temple, Malcolm McDowell, Judy Geeson and Jane Carr.Some very disturbing images are backed with a soundtrack featuring: Wolfman Jack, Lynyrd Skynyrd, James Gang, Kitty Wells, The Mama and the Papas and Stephen Tyler.",31
9,Hey_Sweden,How could a nightmare be any worse than this reality?,6,6 February 2018,"Five travelling carny workers - Charly (Sheri Moon Zombie), Panda (Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs), Venus (Meg Foster), Levon (Kevin Jackson), and Roscoe (Jeff Daniel Phillips) - are abducted by a sick bunch of freaks and made to play a sadistic game of survival. The proceedings are run by macabre Masters of Ceremony - Father Murder (Malcolm McDowell), Sister Serpent (Jane Carr), and Sister Dragon (Judy Geeson) - and the mean s.o.b.s who torture, taunt, and kill them have names like ""Sick-Head"" (Pancho Moler), ""Death-Head"" (Torsten Voges), and ""Psycho-Head"" (Lew Temple). The absolute worst of the bunch is a monster named ""Doom-Head"" (Richard Brake), who revels in his job.Rob Zombies' crowd-funded movie was a return to the sort of blood-soaked depravity with which he made his name, after too much disappointment was expressed over ""The Lords of Salem"", his attempt to step outside his usual wheelhouse. Once again, he shows that his way with dialogue tends to be hit-and-miss; sometimes he comes up with something quotable, but most of the time it's just insipid. The opening scenes that establish our protagonists are rough going, and don't exactly endear the characters to this viewer. Therefore, it's hard to care much about what happens to most of them. Zombies' inane script, which lacks imagination and wit, makes a waste of some good atmosphere, production design, and cinematography.All of that said, the casts in his films are usually pretty eclectic. Tracey Walter, Daniel Roebuck, and Elizabeth Daily also put in appearances. The standouts include old pro Foster, who gets to be pretty badass, and character actor Brake, who's definitely relishing this moment in the spotlight. His is a villain who obviously enjoys what he does.One more good thing about Zombies' efforts are the soundtracks, and this one is no exception. The music that plays over the closing credits is especially groovy.Fans of hardcore horror and Zombies' loyal fan base are certain to be amused, but this will likely be a struggle to get through for most folks. Brake and Foster raised the rating a bit for this viewer.Six out of 10.",31
10,FlashCallahan,"In hell, everybody loves popcorn......",10,27 September 2016,"1976, All Hallows' Eve, a group of Carnival workers travelling are forced to stop their truck and attacked by a gang of masked strangers. A few are brutally murdered, but the survivors are forced to participate in a sadistic game for 12 hours led by someone called Father Murder, and whoever survives will be released. Soon they are attacked by sadistic killers dressed like clowns........Imagine The Running Man meets Escape From New York, by way of The Purge: Anarchy, and you have this utterly grimy, dirt filled, but wondrous new film by Rob Zombie.I don't know why, but I've always had a weak spot for his work, I thought his first two films were genre changing horror films. His Halloween remake and sequel were something else, and The Lords Of Salem was just a complete work of art.And here, for me at least, this is just as good as his others. I know most people will completely disagree, but his filming style, gives it this dirty, organic feel to his films, and the editing offers a kind of nightmarish element to the narrative.It starts with a monologue by uber clown hunter Doom-head, explaining to a pastor about his inevitable death. It reminded me slightly of a Tarantino monologue, sans the clever with and pop references. This is one person mocking another about his imminent murder, and sets the tone for the rest of the film.Like previous Zombie movies, the characters are wholly unlikable, which makes you sit on the fence a little regarding who lives and who dies. Mrs Zombie takes the lead as usual, and she does a good job as the heroine, but is over-shadowed my McDowell, who puts in one his most over the top performances in a long time.Some may say he may be phoning it in, but as Father Murder, maybe he is getting fed up with his life as a murderous ringmaster, and needs a little bit of ice in his killings, hence this elaborate set-up (even though this appears that it's been going on for a long time). But this is just my observation.This could be a commentary on the rich ridding themselves of the poorer, less educated people who share their country, slightly digging Trump in the ribs, winking at him and saying 'is this what you want Donald?'.But whatever the message, it's a grimy world Zombie has created, with some gorgeous cinematography thrown into the mix, and some pretty messed up characters.Certainly not for everyone, but I loved every minute of it.",31
11,zetes,Not bad,7,20 October 2016,"I kind of liked this, although it's definitely a guilty pleasure, at best. It's basically a grindhouse Running Man. A group of carnies are kidnapped and forced into a twisted game of survival against several murderous clowns. There are tons of things one could complain about, from the unnecessarily shaky camera to the constant flashing lights to the uninspired soundtracking to the God awful dialogue (why say anything else when you can just say ""fuck"" over and over again?), but it's a pretty straightforward splatterfest, and it's fun for what it is. Of course, Sheri Moon Zombie stars as one of the five carnies. Malcolm McDowell plays one three faux-aristocratic kidnappers (they are supposedly watching the proceedings but I have to wonder how, since there don't seem to be any cameras involved). The murderers are the best part of the movie. It's hard for me to dislike a movie with a Hispanic Hitler dwarf clown who wears a stuffed bunny head. I also really liked Richard Brake as the ultimate villain, Doom-Head. He's a much better take on the Joker than Jared Leto was earlier in the year. It's a movie most will hate, but I found it worthwhile.",31
12,trashgang,"too much shaky cams within the killings, but Richard Brake saved this flick",6,19 September 2016,"I'm always looking forward for a new Rob Zombie flick. All of them are controversial and always the talk of the town. Some were gory, others too arty like The Lords Of Salem (2012) and some do hate his remake of the cult classic Halloween (2007 - 2009). 31 came again with some issues amongst the fans and geeks. I can fully understand their concern. I also got mixed emotions about this flick. The positive thing is the acting and face of Richard Brake. Well casted and that creepy goth feeling he delivers do add toward the feeling of this horror. But on the other hand the story itself isn't that strong, a survivor flick with some gory moments but it's just there that gives some problems. Some of the killings especially the stabbings are done off-camera and when they do kill it's shown with shaky cams. Not the thing I would expect from Rob. Others did have issues with the nudity. I've seen reviews with a Five out of Five for nudity. Guess I have seen another movie. There are of course juggs here and there and we do have full frontal nudity at the end but to say it's over the top, can't say that.This is the first Rob flick that I had problems with. Not that it's all that bad but the Hitler type didn't work for me. Great opening though, Richard Brake again. And great at the end. You guessed it, doom-head saved this flick...Gore 2/5 Nudity 1,5/5 Effects 2,5/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5",31
13,deloudelouvain,It has Rob Zombie's signature all over,6,30 March 2017,"When I saw the credits in the beginning of the movie and I saw that it was a movie by Rob Zombie I immediately knew it was going to be a bit psycho, weird and violent. Nothing wrong with that if you like those kind of movies. The story is not very far fetched but which one is in this genre? It's all about the gore and the violence anyway. The different psychos are really well done and will scare more than one. So if creepy clowns are the thing that you're afraid of than you will be served. There is a lot of bloody gory scenes so don't watch this movie if you don't like that kind of stuff. Malcolm McDowell has a smaller part in the movie so don't expect A Clockwork Orange performance. In conclusion, if you like gore and Rob Zombie you won't be disappointed, if you don't like that then just pass on this one.",31
14,Hellmant,Richard Brake is totally classic as Doom-Head!,7,7 November 2016,"'31': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Writer/director Rob Zombie's new horror flick; about five carnival workers who are kidnapped and forced to participate in a sadistic game, where they're stalked, and violently murdered, by maniacal clowns. The movie once again stars Sheri Moon Zombie (Rob Zombies wife), who stars (or costars) in all of his films; and it costars Jeff Daniel Phillips, Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, Meg Foster, Kevin Jackson, Richard Brake, Malcolm McDowell, Judy Geeson and Jane Carr. Zombie raised a lot of the movie's budget through crowdfunding; and the film received a limited indie theatrical release, before going straight to VOD next. It's received mixed reviews from critics, and fans alike. I mildly enjoyed it. On Halloween, in 1976 (the year I was born), five carnival employees are attacked, in their van, and kidnapped. They're then taken to a large compound, and held captive there. Three rich elderly people (McDowell, Geeson and Carr) then force them to participate in a murderous game, where they're hunted, and killed, by sadistic clowns. The object of the game is just to survive, for 12 hours; while the rich people find immense joy, in betting on which of them will die next. The film is everything you'd expect from a Rob Zombie flick; intense (and very gratuitous) violence, laced with disturbingly dark humor. The characters, with the exception of a villain named Doom-Head (played by Richard Brake), are not that memorable though (but Brake is totally classic, as Doom-Head). The film is entertaining overall, if you like this type of slasher flick, but it's definitely nothing that original. It is definitely an improvement over Zombie's last movie, 'THE LORDS OF SALEM', though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/AZDkLpTvRzc",31
15,cosmo_tiger,A standard cut-em-up movie that we have come to expect from Rob Zombie,4,21 November 2016,"""I'm not here to make you happy. I'm not here to brighten your dismal day and I am certainly not here to illicit an amused response. I am here to end your miserable life."" Charly (Zombie) and her group of traveling carnival workers are moving to their next stop when they are attacked and kidnapped. When they wake up they discover they are part of game where they must survive for 12 hours. The night of terror has begun. This is a pretty standard Rob Zombie slasher gore fest. There really isn't a whole lot else to say about this one. If you like horror movies along the lines of Saw or Hostel then this movie is for you. If you are even a tad squeamish I would avoid this. Overall, a standard cut-em-up movie that we have come to expect from Rob Zombie. I give this a C+.",31
16,UniqueParticle,I'm a rare speck distended from many others,10,28 March 2019,"I love this movie. I got a chance to see it in theaters luckily when it was available only for a short time back in 2016! I think it's a blast the way it is, sure it's dark in many aspects some may not like how there's not really a character that isn't a glow of positivity & that's ok with me.Doom Head/Richard Brake really stole the show in the best way possible with his menacing presence early on with clever morbid lines the first bit with him is very intriguing & leads the rest of the film in a exciting way. Many other characters are great too in my opinion, then others not so much. I don't usually do this but I'm glad some got killed off!I love the teasing/banter some scenes have; the music is great as always in a Rob Zombie film, it's gross in a fun way, disturbing, even ridiculous in some parts, & it's important to note there's a part with shaky cam with lights flashing a fair amount if someone is at risk with seizures that'd be very bad. I wouldn't recommend those people see this otherwise I love this movie a lot which is rare cause it's gotten a lot of hate; I'm like a rare needle in a haystack. I'm pleasantly happy being one of few that appreciates this movie!",31
17,Fella_shibby,"Zero tension, zero suspense, non scary, boring, quick-cut, shaky cam stuff.",4,12 October 2016,"Saw this on a pirated DVD for 50 rupees. Rob Zombie's The House of 1,000 corpses was good and The Devil's Reject's was better. I was disappointed by the Halloween remakes. Yet to see Lords of Salem. I was hoping that 31 might be his best. I was totally wrong. This is a very boring, unoriginal movie. There is no character development, you really don't care who kills who or why. The worst was the editing n camera shots. The quick-cut, shaky-cam gave me a headache. I almost fell asleep. Couldn't make out what was going on. The movie had excessively annoying hand-held shots and bad editing. Most of the scenes were shot in dark. One cannot make out the place or the set up. There was zero tension. Zero suspense. It was simply not scary at all. Zombie's wife, Sheri cannot act. I mean she can't even cry or scream properly. The story was lame. There was no proper explanation given. The ending tried to be more ambiguous but failed.",31

They were quite fine good quality remakes. Here, we've been tricked rather than treated, where we're back at the bottom of the barrel with this messy schlock horror piece, that really paves the way for major disappointment, especially when judged against it's first, black and white face to camera scene, of our lead villain, brilliantly played by an actor who relishes the role. All the actors are good/wasted, some really impressive ones, Lawrence Hilton Jacobs for one, where Jeff Daniel Phillips and Sherri Moon Zombie deliver really striking performances too. God, if we could get this good actress, in something that could really show off what can do? They're just lumbered with this stupid mess of a movie, with a couple of moments that make us jolt, almost non suspense, and predictabilitie's. I feel like it's a movie that's short sheeted me on many things. Even the ending fails to satisfy and again suspend. It's just plain stupid until the final frame. I was totally in awe here, and let down again. The story basically has another Running Man, Turkey Shoot scenario, with shades of Hostel. Our five sorry carnival workers, (I mean we even have Meg Foster here, who's wonderful by the way, being wasted in crap like this) are kidnapped, and taken to this mansion and horror set piece and warehouse, where they're hunted in a game called 31, played every Halloween, where the survival rate is zero, for it's unfortunate victims, where may'be this time, there may be a winner. I was expecting frequent gore in this one too, where here there's some really excessive ones, that push the envelope, and really go for it, probably the only satisfaction you'll get from this mess. Believe me, there are better ways to spend Halloween, than this.",31
19,gwnightscream,Rob Zombie's Psycho Circus!,5,5 November 2018,"Rob Zombie's 2016 horror film features 5 carnival workers who find themselves in a Halloween nightmare when they're forced to participate in a deadly game in the course of 12 hours. They must try to survive against a group of psychotic clowns that inflict carnage and terror. Sheri Moon Zombie (Halloween), Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange) and Meg Foster (They Live) are featured. The film isn't too bad, it's basically your typical Rob Zombie flick with violence and profanity, it has good, bloody make-up

20,subxerogravity,You do have to love Rob Zombie cause it makes it better.,6,3 September 2016,"Yeah, it's one of those movies for fans of Rob Zombie movies. It's funny, because if you are a fan of White Zombie and Rob Zombie, you'd expect his movie career to more reflect Frankensten and Wolf-Man, but his movies seem to take on more on a slasher monster vibe.Zombie has a love of trashy and violent 1970s movies. Those low end ones like I Spit on Your Grave and Ten Thousand Maniacs. What's good about Zombie is that he's able to take homage without copying what they are doing. It's most likely why the film takes place in 1976.A group of carnie folks are kidnapped by some elite society that put them in a game of survival.It's a bizarre film with an ensemble of interesting characters, especially the clowns that are tracking down these five victims Hunger Games style. The one clown called Tube-Head was far better than Jered Leto's Joker in suicide Squad.So I must admit, I hate to say it's not for everyone, but it definitely is not. It more follows the the lowest of the low Grind house cinema and if you like that stuff than it's for you cinemagardens.com",31
21,jtindahouse,Somehow Zombie gives a film like this a soul,8,20 September 2016,"I'm not entirely sure how I feel about Rob Zombie as a filmmaker. He's done films that I adore (both 'Halloween' films and 'The Devil's Rejects') and he's done films that I didn't enjoy much at all ('House of 1000 Corpses' and 'Lords of Salem'). And yet I can guarantee I'll watch every film he ever makes, because when he's at his best he's absolutely superb. '31' isn't him at his absolute best, but it's not far away.I read a quote from him before seeing the film that said it was his most brutal film yet. This was not an exaggeration, and yet I see they had to cut a lot of stuff to get it down to an R rating. How brutal was it before that I can't help but wonder?What I like about most about Zombie is his ability to make merciless horror films and somehow keep a soul in the mix. He leaves you with a desolate and hopeless feeling, but also makes you care. His characters are often unpleasant people (even the protagonists) and yet again, you still care about their fate. The dialogue he's writing is also getting better with each film, which undoubtedly helps this.The character of 'Doom-Head' is unquestionably the show-stealer here. He's captivating to watch when he's on screen and Richard Brake did a fantastic job bringing him to life. Some of the other 'Head' characters are fun, but none come close to comparing to him. I'm not sure whether Zombie will ever come back for a sequel to '31' (he could, there's plenty more to be explored about this scenario), but if he does it would be a pleasure to see another performance from Brake who truly was in top-notch form here.",31
22,jadavix,What went wrong?,3,12 September 2017,"""31"" is the kind of movie that makes you wonder what went wrong. It seems unlikely the filmmakers were happy with the final product. It's confusing, hard to follow, and the pacing is all messed up. It feels like it's probably missing scenes that would have explained key details, or given us time to catch up and actually care about what we're seeing.The plot is something to do with a group of people traveling in a camper van in the '70s when they get kidnapped by a murderous group of side show freaks and forced to play some kind of survival game.Apparently this group of people are carnival workers themselves, though I missed where that was explained. Aside from Sheri Moon Zombie none of the characters make any impression anyway. One of them looks so much like a young Sid Haig you wonder why the man himself wasn't cast.The movie has one great moment, and that's the very beginning. Richard Brake, a great discovery of Zombie's, breaks (no pun intended) the fourth wall and I had the uncanny sensation he really was talking to me. I can't remember that happening in a movie before.Apparently this movie was crowd-funded ""twice"". Perhaps that is a sign that something went wrong behind the scenes. Did they run out of money the first time?",31
23,kevin_robbins,This may have been one of the more entertaining Zombies movies I've ever seen,8,25 May 2021,"31 (2016) is another movie that I recently watched for free on Tubi. The storyline for this movie is around a traveling caravan that gets boarded, kidnapped and then wake up in a game called 31. It's sort of like ""The Running Man"" where at each stage you find another serial killer trying to kill you and you must be resourceful and kill them before they kill you. This movie is directed by Rob Zombie (House of 1,000 Corpses) and stars Sheri Moon Zombie (The Lords of Salem), Jeff Daniel Zombie (3 from Hell), Malcolm McDowell (Clockwork Orange) and Meg Foster (They Live). The storyline for this is very straightforward but still fun and entertaining. The kill and action scenes are pretty awesome. I loved the midget scenes, circus tent and entire battle with the final killer. The dialogue and writing in this was probably among my favorite of any Zombie film. There's some really great interactions and lines - the opening monologue (""in hell everyone likes popcorn""), the gas station conversation with the old man and the ""I'm not crazy I'm in control"" self motivation was great. This may have been one of the more entertaining Zombies movies I've ever seen. I'd score this a solid 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend it.",31
24,parry_na,Spoilers follow ...,3,16 March 2017,"He gets a lot of stick for his style of horror films, does Rob Zombie. It is heartening in many ways, to find he appears not to care, and continues to release projects in his own raw, coarse style. It is no surprise to find wife Sheri Moon pretty central to the plot here; no surprise either that she goes through a pretty punishing time.She (as Charly), alongside a Carnival van-load of other horny, chain-smoking Rob Zombie (RZ) staples, find their rock'n'roll lifestyle interrupted by a gang of organised game-hunters who insist they play the game of '31' (this is set in the 1970s when a rock and roll lifestyle actually existed). Zombie stalwarts Malcolm McDowell and Judy Geeson star alongside veteran Jane Carr as the powdered and coiffured ringleaders of these 'games', seemingly set in some improbable palace with an interior comprised of dripping corridors and warehouse-sized killing grounds.The killers are lazily-named Sick-Head and Doom-Head etc. Schizo, Psycho, Death and Sex make up some of the other Heads. All unable to growl through a sentence without at least a handful of 'f*****g's' therein, they present a destructive, unhinged ensemble not dissimilar in personality from our alleged heroes. Pretty soon, we are knee-deep in campy, OTT gore, shrieking and black, tar-like blood, where the identity of the characters all melt into a melee, and come a distant second to the graphic killings. I certainly have no problem with this if in the right mood, just as I had no problem with RZ's re-imagining of the 'Halloween' franchise – those films remain underrated in my view. Equally, his earlier 'The Devil's Rejects (2005)' is somewhat over-rated, and it is this film with which Zombie compares '31'.The problem with this for me is, after a while it ceases to shock and just becomes monotonous. Even the introduction of a German-growling fellow in a tutu attempting to club someone to death isn't as much fun as it sounds. All the characters seem to have the same character, any lines are screamed and littered with so many profanities it goes beyond parody, and everything  just is. There is no lead-up to speak of, each violent act is loud, in your face and the familiarity with this repeated approach quickly wears thin.I enjoy RZ films for their mad violence, wall-to-wall grotesques and graphic horror, but when that's all there is, the results are a little wearing, but too loud to allow you to drift off.",31
25,joiningjt,"Actually better than most zombie films, watched the RARE 3d version!!",7,9 January 2021,"1st off Rob zombie is an extremely OVERRATED writer/ director his version of Halloween was TERRIBLE!! Cant believe people liked it, especially the added rape scene that was totally unnecessary. He butchered a John carpenter classic that didn't need a new version. His other movies are all 2s and 4s with the backing he gets hes overrated. This movie was actually decent , only because of the actors especially the beginning villian that again appears at the end. He saved this movie with a phenomenal performance and character he created if they would have used him through the whole film it would have been a 9 maybe 10!! The 3d bluray that's rare to find had just basic 3d. I'm still not a zombie fan he mainly uses violence, rape,gore with no story or emotion.",31
26,NateWatchesCoolMovies,not Zombie's finest hour,4,4 December 2016,"I couldn't help but feel fairly underwhelmed and a bit let down by Rob Zombie's 31, which is a reaction I never thought I'd have to a film from one of the most dedicated and talented artists working in the horror genre these days. Now I'm not saying saying I hated it or even really disliked the film, there's actually a lot of incredibly creative visual material and good old fashioned practical effects to feast your fangoria loving eyes on, but the fact remains that Zombie has regressed to the primal state he opened up his first few films with. There's two phases of his work so far: a rip snortin' hoo rah gross out redneck scumbucket pile of profanity and bottom feeding trailer trash human garbage, which is what we saw in The Devil's Rejects, House Of 1000 Corpses and somewhat in Halloween. Then there's quieter, more thoughtful and meditative Zombie, using an art house, Argento psychedelic slow burn template that he brought hints of to the table in the excellent Halloween II and then full force with The Lords Of Salem, which to me is his best film so far. Now I love the trailer trash aesthetic to bits. It's mile zero, the genesis of his fascinating career so far, and his writing is detailed, character driven, lifelike and oh so hilarious. But there's a natural progression to any filmmaker's career, moods and states which ebb and flow into new regions of stylistic exploration, and 31 just feels like a detour down the wrong road. I expected the atmosphere we got with Salem to churn forward and be a leg on the table of whichever phase came next. But alas, he has done a willful throwback to his earlier work, and although solid (I believe he's incapable of making a truly bad film, there's just too much creative juice with him), it's sadly the least memorable among even phase 1 of his work. 31 is essentially a variation on The Most Dangerous Game, with a dirty dustbowl setting thrown in. A group of potty mouthed carnies, including Meg Foster, Jeff Daniel Philips and the ever present Sheri Moon Zombie, trundle through the desert, reveling in promiscuity and lewd behaviour, another trope that is getting old and icky, even on Rob's barometer. Attacked and kidnapped one night by a band of scarecrows, they find themselves unwitting contestants in a vicious game called 31 (why is it called that? I still don't know), on Halloween eve. The masterminds are a group of creepy aristocrats led by a plummy Judy Geeson and Malcolm McDowell, sporting a powdered wig, attire of french royalty and going by the name Father Murder. They release Moon and her peeps into a dismal maze and set a group of demented cackling psychopaths called the ""heads"" after them, dressed like clowns and seriously adjusted I'll adjusted, these folks. Now you'd think that premise would be just a bucket of horror fun, and it's nominally entertaining but just never really takes off into the desperate, visceral fight for survival I wanted to see. The clowns are varying degrees of scary and amusing. EG Daily fares well as whiny creepshow Sex Head, and there's Sick Head, a chatty midget dressed up like Hitler who yowls at his prey in garbled Hispanic incantations. The film's real energy shows up in the form of Richard Brake as Doom Head, a repellant maniac who is the only actual scary one of the bunch. Brake is a criminally underrated actor who I had the honour of interviewing some months ago, and when asked what the favorite role of his career is so far, he promptly said this. One can see why, it's the most he's ever been given to do in a film and he milks it with virile ferocity and animalistic sleaze that will leave you crying in the shower. McDowell and his cronies are here and there, but feel oddly disconnected from the events at hand, and while visually ravishing, ultimately aren't given much to work with. I will say though that Zombie has a flair for the musical finale, and the end sequence set to 'Dream On' here is a blast that does indeed touch the epic heights of his older films. And there you have it, kids. I wanted to rave about this one, I really did. But it use felt loose,cobbled together and nowhere near as cohesive and brutally mesmerizing as his earlier work, all of which still hold up. There are elements here that work, but unfortunately just not enough, and framed by a whole lot of choices that feel copied and pasted. Now Zombie at his worst is still better than most in this sagging genre these days, but for those of you who know his work well and have expectations for the guy, you may just feel a little let down, like I did",31
27,jfgibson73,Not Recommended,5,2 March 2020,"In this movie, five people are trapped in some old industrial building and hunted for sport. I'm still not sure why I watch movies like this. I'm not into the kills or the gore. I suppose I'm just looking for something a little different. Well, this was brutal and twisted, but not especially memorable. The characters fend off some of the killers, but the final boss eventually gets them all. The Firefly movies at least have memorable performances, even if they are too over the top for some. The characters in this movie were pretty bland. I can not recommend it.",31
28,TdSmth5,Another step in the wrong direction for Zombie,5,4 February 2018,"In the black and white intro some guy gives, I kid you not, a 6-minute speech to the camera. Well, he's supposed to be talking to a priest he's been torturing and eventually kills him with a hatchet.Next we meet perhaps the most unremarkable and dullest cast of character this side of a lost-footage horror. They are driving somewhere when they run into a bunch of scarecrows blocking the road. When they stop and get out, they are attacked by a bunch of guys. Two of the characters are killed for some reason. The rest are taken to what looks like a church where they are chained. They are told they are now part of a survival game called 31 (why 31?). They have to survive a bunch of killers who will go after them one by one. The game will last 12 hours. The organizers place bets by ranking which on of the goofs will last longer.The first killer is a Hispanic little person dressed up as Hitler (what the...) who delivers most of his lines in Spanish for no good reason whatsoever, even though he can speak perfect English. Yup, so here you have 5 adults (3 male, 2 female) each with a club or some weapon, screaming, running in horror, and hiding from some little person cursing in Spanish.Next they have to face two guys with chainsaws. Then a big German dude and his sexy girlfriend. At last the survivors have to face the guy from the intro who is the expert killer. In between the challenges we hear the organizers talking about the odds and placing their bets.Of course one person survives for the weirdest of reasons. And then there's a very dissatisfying ending, not just in terms of the main villain and the main good character but also in terms of the organizers of the whole thing. No answers about anything are provided.31 just doesn't work. The cinematography is dark and ugly. Dialogue is utterly pointless. Direction is a mess, editing is a disaster. The music is good though. The main concept isn't bad, or new for that matter. A game of death where a group of people have to survive attackers so the decadent rich can entertain themselves and play with the lives of regular folk, but with a touch of Rob Zombie. It should have worked as a gory movie. Instead they cut this movie down to an R-rating and it bombed anyway at the box office. When will they ever learn? The only thing they get by censoring a horror movie is alienating the fans. And Zombie must have fewer and fewer of those with every movie he releases. And it's understandable, his movies are getting worse and worse. It leads me to wonder, just who did really direct The Devil's Rejects? The long behind-the-scenes feature explains a lot. Zombie's movie-making process is a catastrophe. He has a ""whatever, anything goes"" improvised approach with little in terms of a vision. He doesn't care about the end result the audience will see. He opposes a ""polished"" product, which is fine if you go with the ""raw"" concept and actually take it seriously and do something with it. He seems rather disinterested and bored with making movies. Personally, I don't have a problem with the performances. Sure, not all are that good, but many are. Elizabeth Daily is just adorable. Richard Brake gives a remarkable committed performance.There's some nice nudity, the occasional gore but not much else worthwhile.",31
29,dworldeater,I dug it,7,9 January 2017,"31 is more of a return to form for Rob Zombie after the surreal and atmospheric The Lords Of Salem. If you dug House Of 1000 Corpses this should be up your alley. Basically, the film is a old school slasher version of The Running Man. 31, takes place on Halloween in 1976 and is heavily influenced by Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, there also are nods to John Carpenter and is very much in a 70's grindhouse style.I can't say I cared for the plight of our ""heroes""/victims much, but one of the things I love about horror is, it is one genre where it is cool to root for the bad guys. There are no doubt some great villains here, Malcolm McDowell, Jane Carr and Judy Geeson are excellent as the hosts of the game. Robert Brake is absolutely brilliant as murder master and all around brutal sadist Doom Head. While I would not regard this is Rob Zombie's best work, as a fan of his films I did enjoy it. There are killer clowns, hippie carnies, macabre extreme violence, black humor and a 70's rock soundtrack taking place one Halloween in the rural southwest. If you are a fan of old school horror you should also enjoy 31.",31
30,aidanratesmovies,"Personally, I think its Zombie's best",6,3 August 2021,"A surprisingly fun film from Rob Zombie, 31 may contain some similar antics from Zombie's lesser works- but it somehow manages to take itself not to seriously and prove to be quite an entertaining and gory ride. The concept itself is far more interesting than any of Zombie's other films- a group of 5 working together toward survival as they are each picked off by deranged serial killers. Pretty messed up stuff right? But also rather fun to watch. What I noticed immediately from this film is that it was often so ridiculous it was funny to watch. I don't know if that was an intentional decision to make it more B-movie like, or if it really is just that bad, but I enjoyed it nevertheless. The acting is nothing special, the films main standout out is Richard Brake as Doom-Head whose character I oddly enjoyed- and is so incredibly eccentric that it all somehow works. The story is a mess, and Zombie could have definitely taken a bit more time to clean this film up a bit. The editing feels choppy at times, and with a bit more care, the film could have reached its full potential of the plot instead of settling for more gory nonsense. Luckily though, the gory scenes throughout the film aren not over dramatic or incredibly drawn out like in Zombie's other flicks- instead they play out far more like an action movie, and again are much easier to watch (in a sense of pacing that is). It's a rather shallow film with an interesting concept and some weaker parts, but I enjoyed it for what it was- a surprisingly scary good time.My Rating: 6.2/10.",31
31,peterp-450-298716,"Wanted to watch this on Halloween. Well saw it and now I'm going to watch ""Bad Moms"" instead. Scares me even more ....",7,22 October 2016,"""I'm not here to make you happy. I'm not here to brighten your dismal day. And I am certainly not here to elicit an amused response. I am here to end your miserable life.""I'm not a real hardcore Rob Zombie fan. In a dark past, I saw ""House of 1000 corpses"". A kind of ""Texas Chainsaw massacre"" story, where a group of nobodies fall into the hands of a crazy family. And a few years ago I saw the not so brilliant ""The Lords of Salem"" with a pack of elderly witches haunting a local female disc jockey. Far from impressive and filled with absurd scenes. The most exciting part were the seductive curves of Zombie's wife (Sheri Moon Zombi). And that's all I knew about Rob Zombie's oeuvre. Had I known this was another movie from him, perhaps I would have skipped it. It may sound a bit morbid, but eventually I thought it wasn't so bad.Don't expect a thoughtful story or some masterful twists in this film. This is nothing more than a straightforward slasher with the keywords sadism and survival. The film is ideal to watch next Halloween. The film title is also linked to this horror holiday. The number 31 refers to the 31st October (Yes, Halloween). And just as in ""All Hallows' Eve"" there are again ugly, cruel clowns who make some traveling carnival workers' life miserable. Along the way to Ardleyville they are attacked by some unknowns dressed as thugs and five survivors are transported to a kind of indoor circus. Here they are being received by a trio of idiots who look as if they came from the Renaissance time (looks like it when you see their clothes and old-fashioned wigs ). The five are told that they participate in a game called ""31"" and they need to survive the next 12 hours so they are free again. However, they have to stand up to five clowns, called ""Heads"" (Sick-Head, Psycho-Head, Schizo-Head, Death-Head and Sex-Head), in this endless-like maze.And when those mad clownish figures are equipped with terrible weapons like a bat full of nails, chain saws and sharp knives, you'll realize that this will become a macabre party. And the murderous clowns are not only unhinged psychopaths who ruthlessly slaughter their victims, they also look grotesque in terms of clothing. A cruel dwarf with a Hitler look, equipped with all kinds of SS attributes, is really confronting. What follows is a sadistic cat and mouse game with bloody massacres as a result. The film is not only filled with barbaric scenes but the language is as coarse as the violence. The five not very intelligent-looking victims and their executioners use unambiguous expressions peppered with sexist and foul mouthed terminology (in several languages).Ultimately, it isn't very original and it only revolves around the senseless killing of the hunted individuals who try to defend themselves as efficiently as they can. A concept that has already been used several times (as in ""The Purge: Anarchy""). However, there was one majestic moment in the beginning. The opening scene in black and white with the Satanic-looking Doom-head (Richard Brake) who gives an impressive speech to a forthcoming victim. A fascinating moment perfectly imaged with a stunning use of light effects. This raises the expectations towards the rest of the movie. Unfortunately, those expectations aren't met. But it's still a good alternative to add ""31"" to your ""to watch"" list at Halloween night.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",31
32,a_chinn,Freakin' chainsaw wielding Meg Foster!,6,24 November 2019,"Entertaining though lesser Rob Zombie grindhouse outing. Zombie takes inspiration from ""The Running Man"" by way of grungy 70s drive-in horror flicks (i.e. ""Funhouse"" ""Last House on the Left"" ""Tourist Trap"" etc.), telling the story of five carnies who are kidnapped and forced to play a violent game for a powdered-wig wearing Malcom McDowell and Jane Carr. The hapless carnival workers are locked in a warehouse/arena of sorts where they must fight to survive increasingly challenging opponents, all who have the hyphenated name -Head. Some of these villains include Sick-Head, a knife wielding Nazi little person, chainsaw wielding clowns Psycho-Head & Schizo-Head, coquettish clown Sex-Head (E.G. Daily) and German clown Death-Head, and the penultimate baddie Doom-Head (an excellent Richard Brake). ""31"" is filled with Zombie's usual stock company of actors, including Daniel Roebuck (""Carrie"" ""Miami Vice""), Lew Temple (""The Devil's Rejects"" ""Halloween""), Jeff Daniel Phillips (""Halloween II"" ""The Lords of Salem""), Torsten Voges (""The Big Lebowski"") looking very Alexander Godunov, Ginger Lynn (ex-adult film star), and Judy Geeson (""To Sir, With Love""), but of special note are the hero, Zombie's wife Sheri Moon Zombie, Lawrence-Hilton Jacobs of ""Cooley High,"" and Meg Foster of ""They Live"" and ""Blind Fury"" fame. For my money, a chainsaw wielding Meg Foster alone is more than enough of a reason to watch this film. As a writer and director, Zombie is not really stretching himself with this material, although ""31"" is somewhat of a return to form after the disappointing ""The Lords of Salem"" where he was less successful in creating an arthouse style of horror film, ALA ""The Wicker Man."" Still, although this is pretty familiar territory for Zombie, it's awfully fun, especially (SPOILER ALERT) the film's finale where Sherri Moon barely escapes with her life, bloodied and staggering down a sun drenched country road ALA ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", only to find Richard Blake pulling up in a van, pulling out his menacing switchblades as Sherri turns to face him, balling her fists as Aerosmith's ""Dream On"" builds to it's climax when the film cuts away before the two actually do battle! It's a badass bold move to not show this final showdown, which made me far more excited than annoyed. It's also a smart move for a low budget film, which this most certainly is. Overall, this is easily Zombie's most conventional film in terms of story and is pretty short on any character development, but it remains true to his over-the-top throwback style and in some ways is arguably his most polished movies as a filmmaker, which makes this well worth watching for fans. Non-fans should probably subtract a star or two.",31
33,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Interesting Concept, but Issues with Execution",6,13 October 2019,"This was a film that I remember hearing about, but didn't get around to seeing it when it dropped. I was turned off a bit when I heard a lot of negativity toward it. I still added it to my list of films to check out as I like to decide for myself. I thought the title was interesting and especially when it came out, in that this takes place on Halloween. The synopsis is five carnvial workers are kidnapped and held hostage in an abandoned, hellish compound where they are forced to participate in a violent game, the goal of which is to survive twelve hours against a sadistic gang.We start this off with a monolgue from Doom-Head (Richard Brake). His face is done up with white paint and there's blood around his nose and mouth. We finally see that he's talking to Pastor Victor (Daniel Roebuck). He pleads to be let go, but is murdered instead.It then shifts to a group of carnival workers. We know that it is Halloween in 1976 and they're traveling through the desert. They're led by Venus Virgo (Meg Foster) and with her is Charly (Sheri Moon Zombie), Roscoe Pepper (Jeff Daniel Phillips), Panda Thomas (Lawrence-Hilton Jacobs), Levon Wally (Kevin Jackson) along with two other women and their driver. They stop off to get gas at Lucky Leo's (Tracey Walter). While Roscoe fills them up, a woman shows up and flirts with him. She is played by Elizabeth Dailey and she seems really concerned if they're going hunting or not.This group gets back on the road until they come to a roadblock of what looks like scarecrows. They get out to move them and are attacked by people. They then wake up in a grand room where Father Murder (Malcolm McDowell) is dressed up as a French aristocrat from back in the day along with Sister Serpent (Jane Carr) and Sister Dragon (Judy Geeson). The odds are revealed on Charly, Roscoe, Panda, Venus and Levon to survive this night They also meet the first person that is going to hunt them, Sick-Head (Pancho Moler). He is a little person who is dressed like Hitler. The goal is for the group to try to survive 12 hours while they're hunted by a gang of clown like killers called 'The Heads'. They're separated and each given a weapon, but this game becomes darker as they go.Now I wanted to go a bit vague with this recap, because to be honest there's not a lot to the story and it really doesn't take too long to get into it. I really love this concept though. This actually feels a lot like the game Manhunt that I used to play in high school, but just inserting the idea of these killers we get here. I like that there are bets being made, but I do have issues as well. The three people we see who are running the game are rich, but who are making the bets? Just them or are others watching this? I think that they could have gone deeper with this with more story actually.I do think that the killers being clowns are a bit misleading as well. Yes, all of them are wearing white face paint of some kind, but that's really where it ends. The names aren't the greatest, but that is really me knit-picking a bit here if I'm honest. I don't get why they have a Hispanic man who is a lover of Hitler. The rest of them make more sense, but that one really just confused me. I do love the idea of these killers having personas a la The Running Man.This is also writer/director Rob Zombie making another attempt at making grindhouse cinema. I do have to give him credit, with the filters used, it does look that way and before they head into the game, it does feel of the era. It is also brutal with the extreme violence and some of the gore. I actually think though the film needed to either deepen the story or go more gory to actually work better for me though.Going from what would work better, I just found this to be boring for stretches. There were a couple times the film cuts away from showing us the blood that this film really feels like it needs. It also just didn't capture me to really follow where we were going. The ending doesn't fit the build of this game they're going for, especially with how they build up Doom-Head. It just kind of feels like it wants to do more and doesn't deliver. I also feel that they establish our 'heroes' are very trashy people. I really don't care about them as it feels like bad people vs. worse people, which is an issue I have with previous Zombie films.That moves me to the acting here. Sheri Zombie is fine, but I think this is just another vehicle for Rob to show us how good looking she is. I think her performance is just kind of there and doesn't really add a lot. Phillips I think is best of the 'heroes'. I wasn't overly impressed, but he doesn't hurt the film either. Jacobs, Foster and Jackson are all fine in their roles, but don't add a lot. McDowell I felt was underused and being with Carr and Geeson are fine in support of him. I just think we needed to know more about them or the game to work. Brake though was absolutely amazing. His monologue to start the film was a bit out of place, but he is the one bright spot for sure. The rest of the killers are fine and round the film.I'm going to shift this next to the effects of the movie, which when they're showing it look good. Blood and what not looks realistic, but there are times that it does cut away and that hurts a film like this. I think the setting they're in is quite creepy and you never really get a good idea of the size of the building they're in. I think that really gives it a disorienting feeling. The look of the killers is pretty interesting, except I'm confused by Sick-Head's concept. The film though is shot fine as well.Now with that said, this film I think had some really good potential, but really just falls a bit flat for me. I like the idea that on Halloween, a game like this run, but I really think we needed to know more. Who is watching? Is it just these three rich people or others? I also think it is a misstep to make the heroes as trashy people as they are as it doesn't work to root for them against the villains, even though Doom-Head and Sick-Head are as worse than they are. I think the acting is fine aside from Brake, who is great. The movie is really just kind of boring unfortunately and the ending is anticlimactic. They cut away from some of the death scenes, but when they don't, it does look really good. The soundtrack is fine for what is needed, but it really didn't stand out to me overall. I was quite disappointed with this one. I still think this is slightly above average, but I would really only recommend it if you're a fan of Zombie. Overall though it's definitely his worst film from what I've seen.",31
34,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of 31,5,6 January 2017,"31 is my latest review. Directed by rocker-turned-shocker Rob Zombie, it's twisted, dark, and bloody. Heck, it's what you've come to expect from the guy whose own childhood involved seeing someone getting their head bashed in at a carnival riot. Zombie goes grainy, using freeze frames and throwing elements from The Running Man, The Warriors, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre into a cinematic blender. This helps him justify 31's running time of 102 minutes. In the Rob Zombie film canon, I would rank this thing higher than The Devil's Rejects but far lower than Zombie's underrated classic, House of 1000 Corpses.Taking place during Halloween (that might be where 31's title came from) and filmed on location in Los Angeles, CA (I thought it was Texas), 31 has all the necessary elements for a Rob Zombie concoction. He loves the 70's so you gotta have the appropriate tunage from that era (""Walk Away"" by the James Gang opens things up). Then you gotta include Zombie's penchant for sadistic violence and cocky torture along with his need to create a funhouse-like atmosphere. Finally, you gotta incorporate the actors/actresses that he likes on his template. Malcolm McDowell, Welcome Back, Kotter's Lawrence Hilton- Jacobs, and Judy Geeson are all featured in 31's supporting roles. Oh yeah, did I mention Rob digs the 1970's? Mmm hmm.Anyway, 31 has a couple of its villains dress up like extras from the period drama, Barry Lyndon. And Zombie's trouper wife (Sherri Moon Zombie) gets to play the protagonist and/or girl in peril for a change. Towards 31's conclusion, she looks like a bloodied up Marilyn Burns from ""Texas Chainsaw"" circa 1974. She appears exhausted and you the viewer might feel the same way (that's exhausted, not elated).The opening ten minutes of 31, involve a few unlikable denizens riding in a bus, chatting about weed and sex and such, and looking for their next gig as full-time carnival workers. These ten minutes are a clear homage to Tobe Hooper's opening sequence a la The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. While they are traveling down a dirt road, they run into a roadblock with what looks like scarecrows and other Halloween-themed structures. As they get out of said bus, they are attacked and taken to a remote building. There, a game is played that will last about twelve hours. The helpless workers are put in rooms that appear to look like mazes. They have to fend off evil characters with names like Sick-Head, Psycho-Head, and Death-Head. Lots of chainsaws, knives, and other weapons are involved in these gladiator-like battles. The Mamas and the Papas, The Wolfman Jack Show, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Lynyrd Skynyrd all play in the background. Oh Rob, you scallywag! Now as mentioned earlier, Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses really shook me upon first viewing. In my book, it remains his best movie to date. Watching ""Corpses"", I realized that Rob Zombie would never make a flick this manically effective ever again. I was right. For various reasons, 31 just doesn't have the same upshot as something like House of 1000 Corpses. Yeah it has nasty dialogue spoken by the antagonists (most of it pertains to rape and assault), lots of decomposed bodies, standard torture porn, and non-stop bloodletting. However, 31 doesn't come off as fresh, or original, or groundbreaking, or radical. Instead, it feels like an excuse for Zombie to make yet another horror vehicle that probably won't get much of a nationwide release anyway. Flaunting his main plot point as a savage game of life or death, Zombie has clearly run out of ideas to make you squirm. And what's worse, he kinda holds back which is rare for the same dude whose bloodcurdling voice belted out ""Thunder Kiss '65"" (ha ha).In conclusion, 31 isn't awful but let's be honest, there's ""31"" reasons to see something else in the fright department. Rating: 2 stars.",31
35,Kamurai25,If Escape Room stopped being so passive aggressive,8,26 March 2020,"Great watch, will likely watch again, and can recommend to horror / survival fans.A Rob Zombie film in the vain of his others: he has a special flavor to it, and if you already know you don't like his films, then stop looking at them: he's not about to make a rom com you'll like.This premise is interesting as there is a fighting chance: moreso than usual. Imagine the kind of chances they had in ""Escape Room"", but more fighting than puzzle solving.",31
36,Howlin Wolf,Bare Bones,5,5 September 2017,"Some memorable moments and images, as always - but this is the least amount of story and character work that Zombie has ever done... which, when you consider his other films, is not particularly flattering!All that crowdfunded money went to his head, and made him a little gore-giddy, at the expense of more sturdy narrative elements. Say what you will about the studios, but they do insist upon a sense of structure that this movie is lacking.",31
37,michaeltrivedi,Nice Horror Flick From The Master Rob Zombie!,6,6 July 2017,"This was a good movie. I tried watching it the first time, and the diversity of the characters and the monotonous plot of characters running from their captors really made me turn it off. However, in my second viewing, I was surprised by my lack of trust in Mr. Rob Zombie. I think the ending may have solidified this as a good addition to the director's filmography. The killer in the white face paint is a pretty damn good villain! The story is simple. Circus employees get captured, and are sent to a place where the game is for them to stay alive. All of them die slowly, except the blonde, who wins the game just as the ""guy in the white face paint"" is about to kill her. Let me just end this review by saying that the guy in the white face paint is the man.6 Stars",31
38,Pumpkin_Man,The Most Dangerous Game & The Running Man Remixed by Rob Zombie!!!,10,18 September 2016,"Rob Zombie has become one of my favorite directors since 2007 when he remade Halloween (The original is my all-time favorite) I always look forward to what he'll bring us next. Four years after The Lords of Salem, we get his newest film, simply called 31. 31 is a brutal kill or be killed game played on October 31st by some sadistic clowns. They kidnap 5 carnival workers named Charly, Roscoe, Levon, Venus and Panda. They put them in a facility called Murder World and they have 12 hours to survive the night. They must deal with Sick-Head, Psycho-Head, Schizo-Head, Sex- Head and last but not least, Doom-Head. The gore was pretty toned down, but still decent enough to satisfy me. There wasn't much character development, and I was hoping to see more of the Halloween nightlife. I'll definitely buy the unrated version when it hits blu-ray. If you want a fast-paced scary flick to watch around Halloween, you'll love 31!!!",31
39,PimpinAinttEasy,Rob Zombie should re-watch The Devil's Rejects,6,16 January 2017,"Dear Rob Zombie, you should re-watch The Devil's Rejects (your one and only masterpiece!) very carefully. It had some of your best writing. I loved the way you handled the character development in that film with short, powerful, funny and even touching scenes. One actually felt affection for the characters even though they were total psychos. The performances were sensational. It wasn't just gore and fancy set pieces and songs and weird characters.You nailed it in the first twenty minutes of 31, Rob. The opening scene was powerful. Richard Brake is a really good actor. The carnival gang was very interesting and I liked the bawdy jokes. The scene at the gas station was very promising. The first twenty minutes had everything one looks for in a Rob Zombie movie - the offbeat characters who are the very opposite of squares, beautiful women who openly flaunt their sexuality and great music (the title sequence was excellent). I think deep in your heart, you are someone who is sick and bored of square society and all its rules. So like William Trevor said ""I get melancholy if I don't write. I need the company of people who don't exist."" Maybe you want friends like the candid characters in 31 and The Devil's Rejects. That's probably why you keep making the same movie over and over.But it all fell apart after the carnival gang gets kidnapped and is pushed into a violent game of survival. While the house where they played the violent game had some amazing set pieces, the writing and the action were completely uninspired. Some of the villains were entertaining, but without proper backstories and character development (like in The Devil's Rejects)they became screaming nobodies. Gore does not shock horror movie fans anymore. I mean, it is impossible to take all the violence in horror movies seriously. We are that desensitized. The film does pick up slightly towards the end thanks to Richard Brake. Elizabeth Daily deserves special mention. She was awesome. I loved her body language and dialog delivery in the scene at the gas station where she tries to seduce Jeff Daniel Phillips. Meg Foster's character could have been one of the greatest redneck female characters of all time. It was a wasted opportunity, frankly.(6/10) because I am a hardcore fan of your movies. Looking forward to the next one, Rob.Best Regards, Pimpin.",31
40,Stephen_A_Abell,A Totally Average Slasher Flick,5,12 July 2017,"If it hadn't been for The House Of A 1000 Corpses, The Devil's Rejects, and The Haunted World Of El Superbeasto then I would not have watched this movie, especially after what Rob Zombie did to the Halloween movies. Unfortunately, this is not as good as his earlier works.This is just another load of people who are captured, tortured, and killed for pleasure. What Zombie adds to the story is a triumvirate of puppet masters - Father Murder (Malcolm McDowell), Sister Serpent (Jane Carr), and Sister Dragon (Judy Geeson) - who run The Murderworld where they run a torturous gauntlet of games. The triumvirate gives their prisoners twelve hours to survive the trials they have arranged for them. Each trial is to survive the psychopaths they send in dressed as clowns.However, most of this doesn't work. My heart started to sink when the group of carnies are talking about the rides and attractions that they run, though their RV isn't towing anything and there's no lorry travelling with them. Then you learn they're travelling with a fair, yet again there are no other vehicles. It's these little things which annoy, and there are quite a few throughout the film. For such an unoriginal story ironing out ALL the kinks would have made it stronger.As for the direction, it's pretty standard stuff though Zombie does try to add a little art to the affair by working in vivid colours. This isn't fully utilised due to the average camera work. There's also an alarming lack of suspense and tension, which a film of this type really requires. That said there are a couple of nice scenes with Richard Brake, who plays Doom-Head, where the close ups are so sharp and crisp. This brilliantly captures his Brake's magnificent rendition of his psychopath character. To be honest, it's Brake that steals this film. This actor should be used more often, he has some serious skills. As for the rest of the cast, they are okay, none of them particularly stands out. I would've liked more details in both the story and characterisations of the triumvirate as this was a missed opportunity to add a spooky and eerie element. Also the other clowns - heads - aren't anywhere nearly as disturbing or sinister as Brake's Doom-Head. The brothers Schizo and Psych-Head, played by David Ury and Lew Temple, are your routine slashers, complete with chainsaws. Though it's Sick-Head which lets the film down. This is not due to Pancho Moler playing the part, on the contrary, his acting is pretty solid. It's down to Zombie dressing him as a Hitleresque character - complete with swastikas and moustache. I'm sorry but I think if anybody was confronted by him they would probably die laughing.Then there's the name of the movie... 31. This actually references Halloween and is another missed chance to tie the games into Samhain or another ""Dark"" holiday, which would have made the story stronger.This is an average film which has a few small drawbacks and a couple of benefits that levels the film to average, once again. If you're a Rob Zombie fan then you may like this. If it's cold and wet outside you could turn off the lights and settle back with this slasher flick, it's worth at least one viewing.",31
41,reddiemurf81,"I am not here to brighten your dismal day,,,",4,30 July 2021,"The first 7 mins or so of the film (where Richard Brake (Doom-head) is speaking to Daniel Roebuck (Pastor), in his menacing, joyfully depraved, psychotic rambling of who he is, why he is there, and what he is going to do), imo, was SO GOOD!! Brake is just amazing at creating terror like that (the old timey music playing was a very nice touch). If they had never shown who he was talking to and just held the focus on him, I think that would've been perfect.From there,, the film goes down,, down,, down,,, and doesn't really come back up.

42,FieCrier,"why ""31,"" someone asked?",3,13 July 2019,"As to the title, presumably because the game of ""31"" is played every October 31st. Not a very inspired name for the game or the movie, which gets to the central problem of the movie: it's not very inspired.I liked The Devil's Rejects; for what it was, it was extremely well-done. FWIW, I dig White Zombie too.When it comes to horror, though, I don't care for retreads. A genre which arguably has a greater freedom to be transgressive than any other mainstream genre arguably should be taking advantage of that freedom. But just as many people with the freedom to vote don't bother to vote or even to register to vote, so too does horror often fail to deliver.Part of the problem, I guess, is there's a lot of horror fans that DO like the same thing over and again. Rob Zombie was apparently catering to that.Does he himself like the same thing repeatedly? It certainly seems that way. I'd be curious to see what he might do if he stepped out of his comfort zone: direct a film written by someone else (and not one written specifically for him), do not include Sheri Moon Zombie in the cast (have her work crew if he dislikes being away from her for too long), do not set the film in the 1970s, do not use clowns, do not reference Nazis, do not over-rely on blood & gore. Could it be done? I have my doubts, but would be delighted to be proven wrong.",31

44,DarthVoorhees,Zombie knows his Horror but he is an awful screenwriter,6,20 February 2017,"'31' is the latest from Rob Zombie and if you know him you know what he does. It bears all the hallmarks, extremely creepy imagery, clever homage to (better) horror films, a nice retro feel and a terrible script. Zombie has talent as a director. He has a style that is uniquely his and his movies do invoke a sense of dread. The problem is he absolutely cannot write any sort of dialogue. It's no surprise that Zombie does follow the formula of the slasher here. The problem is you have to relate to the sacrificial lambs on some sort of level. I didn't really. Zombie's dialogue is at it;s best inorganic and at it's worst migraine inducing. So much filthy disgusting language and I am not a prude whatsoever. I actually do swear quite a bit. I don't mind filthy language in movies but Zombie has no rhyme, reason, or poetry to it. It's like a ten year old kid who has just learned to say ****.That being said I still think the movie has it's moments. He can generate suspense and he can cast his films very well(aside from his wife in the lead role) The highlight of the film is Richard Brake as the demented clown Doom-head. It is one of the best performances I've seen in a horror film in a long time. I say this and I don't even know if the material he is delivering is as bad as the other stuff. He has a manic energy and intensity. The character is despicably cruel but I couldn't keep away. He isn't humorous really but he's unpredictable and each line deliver is grim. Like I said I don't know if the material is any good. I imagine Zombie was writing Manson-esque gibberish but you feel intimidated to the core by this character and Brake's performance.A very mild recommendation. I would love to see Zombie direct a script he didn't write. I think it would be his best film yet. At the very least I'm concerned/intrigued to see his next film, an adaptation of 'Raised Eyebrows' the story of Groucho Marx's last years",31
45,mjsreg,31 to (almost) 0 in 102 minutes (or $1.5 million),3,14 October 2016,"Over-hyped and run-of-the-mill below average movie.If you like profanity and jive talking right from the start that has no relation to the action, then you might like this movie.As usual, this 'Rob Zombie' film tries to mimic the 70s in a tired and overplayed attempt at producing something which may be different or art house. It fails miserably.The story is plain stupid and is about as scary as a Disney princess movie. There is the usual odd bit of blood and guts, but nothing that draws the viewer in to feel part of the experience.The characters are one-dimensional and rely on the aforementioned profanity and jive talking in an attempt to garner some credibility. This movie seems to be a vehicle for Zombie's wife and an old has- been actress in the form of Meg Foster - who seems to be 100 years old with dentures and who is desperate to be 20 again.Don't bother paying to see this lame rubbish - no doubt it will be on an obscure cable channel before long.The only reason I gave this movie 3 is because of Richard Brake's portrayal of Doom-Head.",31

47,MattBrady099,31 - Movie Review,4,22 October 2016,"""31"" is your typical Rob Zombie film that if you've seen one film, then you seen it all.Over the top gore - The writing is trash - The editing is awful - Sheri Moon Zombie is a terrible actress - It's predicable - Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs accent in the movie was pretty embarrassingSo yeah, I'm not the biggest fan of Rob Zombie. The only movie I like from Rob is ""The Devil Rejects"" and that's it. There's something about Robs work that doesn't click with me, but hey, that's just me.But what made this movie watchable is Richard Brake as Doom head. He was pretty damn amazing in this and at times I saw a little bit of the Joker in him. Well, he should have been the Joker and not Leto, because he's madness feels natural and not forced. He's violent and he loves every second of it. Even with he's opening monologue, how it was shot and the B&W look, it was everything that a movie can do to get you as an audience member engaged. It's too bad that he's not in the movie for that long as we are stuck with characters that nobody cares for.I guess less is more.",31

49,dcarsonhagy,I Ain't No F*****g Clown,3,16 September 2016,"Rob Zombie's latest movie, ""31"", is well so far his worst. Now before your bloomers explode, let me just add that I have liked most of his movies. From his first (House of 1000 Corpses) to his best (The Devil's Rejects), to his most underrated (Lords of Salem), he has managed to entertain me, which is pretty hard to do. And then there's this mess.""31"" tries to spin a frightening yarn about some carnival workers who are kidnapped and then forced to participate in a game known as ""31."" If they can survive 12 hours, they can live. They are put into some sort of maze and then the loonies are loosed on them. Oh, and these loonies are not unarmed. Had Zombie bothered to develop ANY of these characters, his film might have worked. Trouble is, he didn't. The only character Zombie tried to push on his audience was the laughable Doom Head, played by Richard Brake. He should win HANDS DOWN the award for most laughable bad guy--and not in a good way--to ever grace the screen. Brake was so over the top, so much a caricature, I could only laugh at him. I don't know if it could have worked, but Bill Mosley might have been much better suited to this role.When the watchers of the game (Father Doom played by Malcolm McDowell, Sister somebody, played by Judy Geeson, and Sister Fat Ass, played by another somebody) release the first ""terror,"" I just about fell out of my bed laughing. He was a midget. Now, c'mon guys. Who in the hell would be afraid of a midget? Then came the ""chainsaw brothers,"" who (again) are supposed to be bad, but all they managed to make me do was role my eyes.Of course Zombie cast his untalented wife, Sheri Moon, in the lead role. For the life of me, I just don't think she was acting in any scene she was in. Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs (he of ""Boom Boom"" Washington fame in ""Welcome Back Kotter"") also was cast as a victim. He had the worst Jamaican accent ever...mon. Oh, and someone PLEASE tell Meg Foster to eat something. She looked like death eatin' a biscuit.I will not divulge the ending. You can suffer through what I did and see that for yourself. The movie is rated ""R"" for constant language, strong violence, and nudity. No wonder Zombie had trouble getting/finding funding for this thing. It needs a complete rewrite, recasting, and character development before it would stand a chance. What a waste of time.",31
50,coreyjdenford,Game of kills,2,23 September 2016,"This is my review of 31 (spoiler free)* (1/5)NATURALLY THERE IS a recurring theme with other slasher movies they have a bunch of vulnerable protagonists who end up getting kidnapped some way or another, and maybe have a psycho killer who will be maybe wearing a mask and not be human and they get a few good blood drenched kills off. So, naturally psychosis and murder loom out of the shadows in any slasher whether they are just general hack n slash or maybe even put a few traps and have victims in those traps, generally all these slashers are added to a scrap and just every so often a director will come along and try to copy those themes that other good slashers did. That is the general idea of 31 when rock legend-icon-writer/director Rob Zombie decided to make a 102 minute scrapbook of other ideas that decent slashers like Saw, Friday the 13th, Halloween (not the Rob Zombie version, although that is considered to be one of his best ever films) had and made the ideas monotonous and frankly, generic. Mainly because it has the same theme all the way through once one psycho killer dies another one gets added and then another etc. This keeps the idea of masked psycho killer with a sharp weapon and then you think one of them will die. The good thing is this starts off slow, but with bad writing mixed with bad directing you want this end fast and it doesn't. With a 102 minute run time it is one of the longer slashers apart from Saw 3 which was 103 minutes but they were fun unlike this. With every moment there isn't one scare it wouldn't be hard which is a lot considered that this is a horror. Also instead of masks this decides to have the idea of the killers have clown-like makeup but they are not funny well they are when they meet their sharp edged demise.In terms of character development or depth they're not even slightly likable so you can't root for them they are so repulsive that you eagerly await their deaths. At the beginning the only character who has depth is Doom-head (Brake, making a terrifying performance without being covered in prosthetics and silver and blue paint) but he loses the depth as he makes a kill at the beginning after his fourth-wall breaking speech and killing a priest. It turns out as the film goes on he is the main killer who doesn't like leaving survivors. The characters that this focuses on are the five circus workers on a long road trip the day before Halloween lead by Charly played by Zombie's wife in real life Sherri Moon Zombie who tries her best with her performance but is as bland as a cube of tofu. Not only is she bland but the rest of the co-workers are too. The only good performances they do are when they try to escape and Zombie keeps to the natural theme of keeping his wife alive. The main set-piece of the film is the abandoned compound which is yet another theme of general slasher films there is always an abandoned warehouse of some sort just like in Hostel, Saw or even The Collector and the victims these films focus on mostly the protagonist's end up being left for dead after being held in the warehouses. This decides to go a step further by taking the protagonists hostage on Halloween, and they are forced play a sick game with Malcolm McDowell in his most ridiculous outfit ever dressed as a Georgian fop wearing clown-like make up and making a close approximation of the Joker voice this game is called 31 hence the title. He is the ring leader of this game. And every hour he makes new odds basically making it a game of survival of the fittest, along with these new odds he puts in a psycho killer ranging from a little person with a Spanish accent making an impersonation of Hitler with a swastika plastered on his chest, all the way to Richard Brake's with the theme of if the other guys haven't killed you then this guy will. So essentially it's between Halloween and The Purge.The third act is more white-chapel style and turns into even more of a mess than it already is after Doom-head comes in it becomes predictable as soon as he puts on his makeup making him paler than he already is, he hunts for the first kill and so this turns into an escapee style horror when the characters that are left alive have to run away from the last psycho killer but before they can he catches them so essentially the story is predictable if it wasn't already and the general theme is now run or be killed. Which is exactly what our heroine Charly does but before she gets too far out comes the killer but before he can make his final it's the end of the game and the end of the film. Lacking in originality Rob Zombie's is filled with endless themes of better slashers as he tries desperately to make them themes his own, and fails massively. What happened to the originality? It just seemed to have disappeared.VERDICT: Rob Zombie's new slasher is an inept, monotonous scrapbook of better slashers that fails to even muster slight ingenuity or originality. It's a bloody mess.2/10 unnecessary.",31
51,jackmeat,A fun ride for Zombie to create,6,24 September 2016,"My quick rating - 6,2/10. This movie can be summed up in knowing it was for Rob Zombie to just have fun. Group of people get abducted and put into a haunted house, so to speak (abandoned warehouse basically) and hunted to the death by hired killer clowns. The action is often impossible to tell what is happening due to some massive quick editing that leaves you with a headache. Put this flaw aside and you have a standard fare of ""The Running Man"" but with clowns who get paid to kill people. The lead ""hunter"" so to speak steals the show (Richard Brake) as he plays the sinister doom-head. Right from the opening you can tell he will be the focus and with good reason. Surprisingly the movie doesn't use the gore in excess for shock which is fine. There is plenty of it though, don't worry. Overall the aristocrats betting on the outcome is held together by the phenomenal Malcolm McDowell as Father Murder who runs this yearly event. I would be not doing my job if I didn't mention one of the contestants is the often used daughter of Zombie, Sherri Moon, and she again plays her role quite well. Overall a fun ride but doesn't bring anything new out to speak of. Seems the killer clown craze is picking up steam and I have no problem with that.",31
52,AndyVanScoyoc,Devil's Rejects/House of 1000 Corpses meets Carnies...,1,30 July 2019,"Nothing personal against Rob Zombie. LOVE his music (Hellbilly Deluxe is pure genius!) ...but his filmmaking skills...Nope...another loser.I didn't like Devil's Rejects OR House of 1000 Corpses. I know I'm in the extreme minority on that, but I consider the, ""people kidnapped, tortured and if any of them survive, scarred and psycho for life,"" angle of films, done to death with the Texas Chainsaw films.How many ways can you kidnap and torture people before it gets OLD.Wait...it is.I read a review that said this was crowd funded?If so, films such as this is why I will NEVER contribute to crowd funding films.Carnivals and carnies creepy me out anyway, so I was really hoping for a SCARY film.Instead, I got just another cheap, stupid freakshow that, while Carnies and carnivals are still creepy...I'm not scared.REALLY disappointed.",31
53,trublu215,"Despite Rob Zombie's best dialog and his best effort, this film feels watered down and very incoherent",4,2 September 2016,"Rob Zombie has become synonymous with the horror genre over the past decade. From House of 1000 Corpses to The Lords of Salem, Zombie has solidified himself as a household name right around Halloween time. Whether it'd be The Devil's Rejects or the Halloween remakes, you've heard of his name, you've more than likely seen his films, and whether or not you like him, you know what he does. So when you hear that Rob Zombie is doing a film about a bunch of circus performers who are kidnapped by a band of psychotic killers and forced to play a cat and mouse game called 31 on Halloween night for survival, you can imagine exactly what Rob Zombie has in store for us. Unfortunately, our imaginations are left running rampant especially after seeing the final product. The film leaves you feeling uninspired and very empty, all in the worst way possible. Sure, The Devil's Rejects left me feeling empty but that was because I was so scared and frightened by that film that there was nothing else left to feel. Mostly every film that Rob Zombie has done, I've ended up really liking just for the mere fact that the man is extremely dedicated to getting the 1970s right on screen. He succeeds every single time. There isn't a filmmaker working today that can submerge you into a time period like Rob Zombie does. The clothes, the environment, the people, the sounds, and even the camera work. He does a brilliant job at period pieces in the 70s. 31 is no exception. Despite this attention to detail, the film is a whole other beast, one with a couple good points and many bad points. First, let's start off with the bad and get that out of the way. First off, the biggest problem I had with the film was the camera work. The cinematography was so lackluster and amateur that it lacked any sort of punch when watching. The violence came and went without any real repercussions from it, no reverberation like The Devil's Rejects and no overt gore like House of 1000 Corpses. It just happened and it happens through the eyes of a very shaky cameraman. The film felt more of a Bourne film than this summer's abysmal Jason Bourne. It didn't allow for you to take in what had just happened and leaves you wondering whether you are ready to see a horror film or a hand-to-hand action film. It doesn't fit very well with the style of Rob Zombie and, at the end of the day, it hurts the film especially when you couple it with an erratic editing pattern which leads me into my next gripe. The film is very hard to keep track of. Much like the killers trying to find their victims in the film, our eyes are trying to find just what the hell is going on in the frame. Through the scenes of chaos and violence, we're left with incoherent editing choices along with lackluster camera work that borders on the edge of looking and feeling like a found footage horror film without the idiotic leads looking directly at us. It really made for a frustrating and headache inducing watch. The film also felt extremely watered down. I know that Rob Zombie has had his battles with the MPAA but this felt as though it was his most watered down venture yet. We see glimpses of knives piercing a stomach...no blood. We see a bat being bashed into someone's head in, minimal blood. We see a chainsaw death, blood spattering the floor and then close shots of the actors. This is a Rob Zombie film and, like I said above, I want some Rob Zombie gore and I simply didn't get it. He said it was going to be his most brutal film and this theatrical cut ended up being his most tame. While I will most certainly give 31's ""Unrated"" cut a watch to see what I was missing out on, I still hold this film in a bit of contempt over that. The performances here are lackluster as well. Sherri Moon Zombie gives a notable performance but nothing out of the realm of what she is already used to doing. It isn't bad but it isn't necessarily good. The horror icon Meg Foster also delivers a very good and surprisingly nuanced performance in the film as well. However, the main villain Doomhead is the real stand out. Actor Richard Brake is tremendous in this film. He is terrifying, funny and completely watchable as he delivers some of the best lines of Rob Zombie's career as a writer. He is full convincing as a psychopath in most films but this film, he truly looks and feels like he is a real, genuine psychopath and it makes for a great time watching him. The first scene of the film is Richard Brake, the camera and us for a long and thoroughly engrossing four minute monologue that feels of early Tarantino. It is a great opening scene and really gets you excited to see the film but leaves you even more disappointed when you discover that the film is nothing like the opening scene. Overall, I felt let down by 31. I wanted more gore, I wanted more coherency, I just wanted more and I feel like the film that I saw was half of the original vision that Rob Zombie had. Whether or not we will ever get to see a different cut is up in the air as of right now but it really does feel more like a missed opportunity than anything else. Despite these feelings, 31 does feature some great set designs, a great performance from Richard Brake and some truly wonderful lines of dialog from Rob Zombie. If you're a fan of Zombie's work, check out the film, you might like it. If not, skip it.",31
54,TheRedDeath30,I'm About to Give Up on Rob Zombie,5,23 December 2016,"I should have trusted the reviews, but then again, I wouldn't have mattered if it averaged a 1 score, I would have watched it for myself. I would have told you that I am a giant fan of Rob Zombie. I am not saying he can do no wrong. I think he, personally, is a d- bag. I hate his music. I think his HALLOWEEN remake is tolerable, at best, and the sequel is completely forgettable. On the other hand, I think that his two movies of the Firefly clan, HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES and DEVIL'S REJECTS are modern horror masterpieces and LORDS OF SALEM was good, as well, so I anticipated that despite bad reviews, I would still like this movie. How wrong I was.I'm honestly struggling to come up with much positive to say but boy do I have a list of negatives. Let's start with his wife. She is the worst thing about most of his movies. While she fit her character as Baby and was pretty enough to tolerate, she was a big reason the HALLOWEEN sequel sucks. She is the main reason that LORDS OF SALEM is not better than it could have been, because of her lack of acting skills, then we get to this. I could have predicted, within the first 15 minutes, that she was our ""final girl"" that was going to survive all of this. I could have predicated that she would be the one to become a bada** for no reasonable explanation, other than the director's obsession with his wife. The girl can't act. In fact, she borders on being annoying and her voice is like nails on a chalkboard at times. Hire another actress for crying out loud, Rob, who might be able to make the audience have a little empathy for the character.Now, let's get to the plot. The second that EG Daily shows up at the gas station, any idiot knows that she is the ""scout"" and things are about to go wrong. From there, Rob starts stealing material from every movie known to man and even stealing his own material repeatedly, starting with a scene in the middle of the road that is basically Otis on the cross stopping the tourists in HOUSE all over again. Our heroes wake up in a strange place to realize that they are now in THE RUNNING MAN, only King's story and the Arnold movie version are at least fun and let the audience have a some excitement with their violence. This movie just starts repeating itself over and over. Rob must really like greasepaint. The clown look fit Captain Spaulding well in his first movies, but now we have a cast full of evil clown villains because, hey, that's not about the most overdone cliché in horror now, is it? The characters are barely unique from each other. It's basically here's a clown. He's dead. Here's two clowns. They're dead, let's bring out two more. None of them develop anything memorable or frightening, in any way. That is, until we get to our final villain, but more on him later.The movie sets itself up to be a violent spectacle in gore. Zombie loves to spread the red stuff and I fully expected that here, but the movie is so short on real gore as to be disappointing. I'm not some sicko who wants blood and brains everywhere, but I do have some expectations. Basically, prepare yourself for stabbings, stabbings and more stabbings. That's about all you'll get here. It's a crazed maze full of psychotic villains who just want to stab people.The worst part may be the directing, itself. I am not one of the legion who hated Zombie's style in his early films. It was manic. It was very MTV. Those things worked so well in the context of those movies, though. I thought the inter-spliced scenes and vintage film styling added a lot to the movies. Here, though, it's almost as if Zombie gets exposed without the budget to play with in this movie. Once he can't go nuts with the effects and the movie relies on his actual skill as a film maker, it falls apart. Freeze frame, wipe shot with snapshot of heroes, freeze frame, back to action. Repeat that throughout the movie. At a certain point, I found myself wondering if I really enjoyed his earlier movies as much as I thought because this is so bad it can't be the same guy.The one positive is Doom Head. It's probably the same things most viewers would say. However, the fact is that there's nothing about his villain that is any different from thousands of other horror villains before him. He's a psycho. He's violent. He's got a chillingly cold apathy towards the destruction that he's inflicting on his victims. He's ""not a clown"" as the beginning is very clear to tell us. The fact is that people latch on to him because the rest of the movie is so bad that he becomes a breath of fresh air, but he's so far from the level of Otis or Captain Spaulding as far as great horror villains go. He's just the best thing in a bad movie.So, I guess my opinion of Zombie is 2 great movies, 2 bad movies and one in the middle. Let's hope his next one tips the scales in a good way instead of bad.",31
55,MonsterVision99,Exploitive raunchy and sleazy.,5,31 October 2016,"Rob Zombies 31, its a film that has divided people, some hate it some others love it, but this is my take on the film.31 its a throwback to the 70s or 80s exploitative sleaze fests, it has a really good cast, some good gore effects, some great acting and amazing performances, some good writing and atmospheric cinematography, this makes for a good time.The film flaws are mostly on its plot, which its cliché, but its not about what you do, its about how you do it, Rob Zombie managed to give us a mediocre plot but turned it into gold by using his unique style, so much so, that the cliché plot doesn't even matter by the end, because he has a great style and great performances.Only recommended for those who like the Rob Zombie style and who want to see a really sleazy and raunchy film.",31
56,shawnblackman,An Updated Running Man,5,1 October 2016,Rob Zombie's latest is set in the seventies with some carnies kidnapped by a sadistic rich group for their annual game of 31 which consists of the carnies having to remain alive for twelve hours while psychotic characters try to kill them.Meg Foster stars in this one who is looking really old but she still has it. Kudos to her. Washington from Welcome Back Kotter (Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs) plays a Rastafarian who hasn't aged at all. The man behind all of it is Malcolm McDowell who dons a 17th century judge wig making the odds for each kill. Sherri Moon Zombie steals the show in this one. To me it seemed like an updated version of The Running Man (1987) with vulgar language and sick jokes. There is some violence like falling on chainsaws and stabbings but not too extreme. The dialogue tries to be snappy and witty but most of the time it's just stupid.I thought it could have been a lot better. The ending was disappointing big time.,31
57,isantistao,Rob Zombies Worst Film,4,16 October 2020,"I love Rob Zombie films, but this one is his worst film. It is worth seeing if you love his films or just want something violent.

58,robawalker-77417,Classic Zombie,5,26 September 2021,This movie was such a cool concept with all the blood and gore you could ask for. It just once again lacks decent writing. Some of the lines for these characters were just ridiculous and didn't add to the story or movie at all.,31
59,Jester222,Not the best Rob Zombie film.......lacking in any real gore,6,21 December 2019,"I really enjoy Rob Zombies films.
1000 Corpses was kk. The Devils Rejects a bloody masterpiece.
3 From Hell is fun but lacking. Halloweens were loads of fun. Gory and better than all the remakes and sequels.
Lords of Salem bored me and then there is this.....31......a bit of a step backwards for RZ.
It's nothing that original. Sheri looks as edible as ever but the gore is sadly lacking.......its lazy shaky camera and strobe lighting. Blood splashes everywhere but you never really see anything. Which seemed a bit of a cop out considering what he said jn interviews about making a fun film for gore fans ........... it's not terrible but with more likeable characters and better FX this could have been another cult classic.",31
60,manuelasaez,The worst movie of the decade. I am not even joking.,1,21 September 2016,"Let me start off my review by saying that I do not care for the work of Rob Zombie. As a musician, I avoided his contributions, and as a film maker, I am apathetic, at best. I enjoyed Halloween, and the Devils' Rejects wasn't awful. That being said, I just have nothing positive to say about his latest endeavor. This movie, 31, has finally cemented Zombie as a hack with too much creative freedom and not enough creativity. Just like Uwe Boll, Tyler Perry and Eli Roth, all hacks in their own right, Zombie exceeds them by not having anything commercially or critically successful, as his movies are divisive at best and abhorrent at worst. The worst part of it all is that with some truly talented people, his films would actually turn out somewhat enjoyable. But this man just seems hellbent on being the worst director that horror has to offer, unleashing each subsequent soiled diaper onto the world without a care for adding anything of value to the genre. The premise is solid, and could have made for an original and enjoyable film, but with acting like Sherry Moon's, how can you take any of it seriously? Everyone was just awful in this film, down to the extra's, and this movie does not deserve to be seen by anyone. This is quite literally the worst film I have seen in the past decade. A complete and utter waste of time in every sense of the word. Utterly and completely insulting.",31
61,spencergrande6,"One Great Villain, One Okay Enough Premise",7,12 December 2016,"It's one of Zombie's lesser works probably, but there's still enough going on here to recommend.Richard Brake as ""Doom-head"". This should have been the movie. He gives a breathtaking, mesmerizing, screen-grabbing performance full of dread, anger, humor, and psychosis. He is the beating, blistering id of this film. More of him in anything and everything in the future please (this would go down as one of the great villain performances in horror history if the rest of the movie were up to snuff and had wider reach -- actually it still might).The simple premise of this film really seems to belie something else going on beneath the surface. Something about the rich destroying and using the poor, the way we feed on each other, the gratification we get from it and so on. The action scenes are so choppy and blurry and poorly edited that it seems to become the point. Why can't we enjoy this? Why aren't we allowed to see the carnage in the moment? Only the aftermath, the blood on the walls.I'm probably reading too much into it, but this film also offers a Mexican Nazi midget and an assortment of other villains that are pure off the wall Zombie so there's that too.""Look into the eyes of a true Champion!"" ""I ain't no f***ing clown."" These are both almost instant classic quotes, all courtesy of one Richard Brake.",31
62,utahman1971,What The Heck?,5,17 March 2017,"This is not even a half movie watch. I turned it off it is so bad. Not even 1 star movie. Should be a negative 100 rating. How did this even get a 5? Rob Zombie is drugged up again while directing. Sherri is terrible.Every single character or actor is the ugliest you would ever see in any movie at all. Boring, dull, slow, bad camera, acting, and everything you can think of is bad about this movie. I thought Troll 2 was the worst of all movies until I saw 30 minutes of this one.Black guy gets killed and he is stabbed like 30 times and takes him by in movie time 2 hours to die. LOL! WTH? They have 12 hours to play a game called 31. Stupid movie and they are not even clowns or even look like them in the movie.Nazi wannabe killers that make it like they are clowns but are nothing but ugly freaks that just like playing a never heard before game. Zombie has gone bonkers and has no clue how to be a normal person anymore.His wife is so bad at acting. He does massive close ups of her eyes and face for no reason at all. Shaky camera and not even found footage. Just in a half hour and I can so much of this movie is bad. I could go forever.Never going to recommend this to anyone, it is so bad. I love horror movies but this is not really horror, and not really comedy or could be comedy but so bad it is not funny. More annoying to watch than anything.Only reason I wanted to see this was because I heard or read online before release that it was being rated as NC-17 and Rob Zombie had to cut stuff out to get an R rating. Well, he should of cut it all and never released it.Not one of the actors was good in the movie. Feel sorry for them all that wanted to be in it. Oh well, and I also feel sorry for those who actually enjoyed it. Good luck weirdos that like it.",31
63,Condemned-Soul,Rob Zombie fails again to detach himself from misguided film-making principles,5,15 December 2019,"Gore > Style > Substance. A disappointingly backwards way of approaching directing, Rob Zombie frustrates because he shows flashes of talent, but leans too heavily on poor formula. He prides bloody violence over character development, relies on shoddy writing to fill in the gaps between bloodshed, and fails to distinguish his glimpses of quality from being another straight-to-DVD exercise in unoriginality.'31' is about a trio of social elitists who orchestrate kidnappings, throw their victims in an elaborate maze/trap, and then make bets on who'll survive the 12 hours against an array of cartoonishly named, freakishly dressed serial killers sporting all kinds of killing tools. The setup is nothing special, and the characters are all lame, spouting cliched lines and crude quips which can't mask how one-dimensional and expendable they all are.The most promising character 'Doom-Head' played by Richard Brake, who slips into his psychopathic role with enough gusto to prove threatening and at least slightly interesting - particularly his opening monologue sequence - which is nicely shot in black-and-white. Sadly, Rob Zombie does little to appeal to anyone but gorehounds throughout the 100 minutes, offering up moments of artistic horror, but then regressing back to wonky camerawork and over-the-top gore.In the hands of someone else, '31' could have been frightening and bloodthirsty in equal measure but, unfortunately, Rob Zombie's horror film strays into familiar territory and dishes out gratuitous violence with little skill.5/10",31
64,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,5,4 October 2016,"""Five carnival workers are kidnapped and held hostage in an abandoned, Hell-like compound where they are forced to participate in a violent game, the goal of which is to survive twelve hours against a gang of sadistic clowns."" Rob Zombie has made some good films such as House Of 1000 Corpses, Devils Rejects and the remake of Halloween, but sadly this one isn't as good. Don't get us wrong, it's not terrible...it's just not that good. The acting was too over the top, the script wasn't well written, the characters are all unlikable and annoying, and there is no character development what so ever. There is no explanation as to why they are playing the game of 31 or what the significance is behind the game of 31.The life saver in this film is Richard Brake who plays Doom-head. Doom-Head truly stole the show and was the best thing about the film. The very first 6 minutes of the intro of him talking into the camera and talking to the priest was truly memorable and one truly great scene. He doesn't come into the film until the finale 30 mins, but he stole every scene he was in. He'll go down as one of the best serial killers in Movie History for sure! He would play the Joker 100 times better than Jared Leto! All in all we give this movie 5/10. 2/5 stars. -The Autistic Reviewers",31
65,droog-56936,Rob Zombie's Weakest But Still Entertaining,5,29 September 2019,Rob Zombie's movies have always gone that extra mile to give you shock value via violence and gore. This however was the first of his films that felt rushed and unplanned. The use of elements of Eli Roth's Hostel feels desperate for material. Richard Brake as the demented Doom-Head is the only character that generates menace in this thing. Not a terrible movie but just blah,31
66,ben-mckimm,It's ok... Maybe,5,21 June 2021,"I don't know about this film. On one hand it's just a mindless slasher horror. It delivers on the violence and gore that Rob Zombie is known for. It's a pretty standard affair in terms of acting but no one expects Oscar worthy stuff from a movie like this. On the other hand, the story feels like it was written by a 16 year old, with almost zero story and what is there, is so ridiculous and absurd that it almost offends me that I'm expected to immersed in any part of it. The premise may have worked with someone else behind the writing but these empty villains are just crammed down your throat, one after another. ""Oooh, they're scary coz they're crazy"". I mean, how am I supposed to stay invested in a story where the killers have names like ""Sick Head"", ""Sex Head"", ""Psycho Head"" and ""Doom Head""? Even more so when they're all lead by a group of omnipotent aristocrats, who can see everything that happens, everywhere, despite having no cameras or view of the action. I know I'm probably reading too much in to this but it's all a bit too much. I can deal with a little bit of absurdity but this was almost too much. Take the last 20 mins of House Of 1000 Corpses and turn the ridiculousness up by about 10,000% and you might just get an idea of what this film is all about.",31
67,Carrigon,One Big Steaming Pile of Rancid Circus Peanuts,1,16 September 2016,"It was bad. This movie was the worst Rob Zombie film yet. No plot, no characterization, disappointing lackluster ending. And nothing we haven't seen before that's been done a thousand times better in other films.It felt like they went dumpster diving in the trash pile of most of Zombie's films and took whatever edited out bits were laying in the dumpster to string them together for this steaming turd.There is no character to root for, there is nothing but a bunch of aging actors trying to survive this film against other aging actors. In fact, the scariest part of the film is how badly certain actors have aged.While I agree that Richard Brake's performance of Doom Head was very well done, even he could not save this film.There's just nothing here. A bunch of aging stoners get kidnapped by some rich psychos who force them to spend the night trying to survive against a group of sadistic freaks wearing clown makeup. Everyone gets killed in various ways with lots of blood, but nothing really felt like payoff. Every kill was so meh because we've seen it all before and there was no motivation or characterization to care about. Money was the sole motive. We're shown that it's just a high paying job to Doom Head. And the game was just about a money bet for the rich.But the characters/victims were so badly fleshed out that there was no reason to care who died. And there was no joy in watching a badly wrinkled up Meg Foster get brutally murdered. There was no suspense or anything.The ending was a very disappointing pile of nothing. They could have added anything to make it more interesting. Instead, it just sits there rotting in the sun.It's not good like Devil's Rejects, House of 1000 Corpses or even Halloween. This was bad from start to finish. Some people will like it for the kills, but it's a waste of time.",31

This is just terrible and not like cult classic terrible, like sucky wucky terrible. Zombie strings together scenes with no sense of drama. He plays up moments that he thinks will sell the movie, which don't. The entire thing seems like a stupid ass costume party Rob threw for his friends and they made up the movie on the spot and decided to shoot it. It has no definitive ending and he takes the ending concept of Devil's Rejects and tacks it on. If nothing else he should have had someone clearly win. You get the idea since it's Zombie film it wasn't the good guy/girl. I think he a Sherrie are heading toward a divorce. I feel like an idiot for renting this.

69,kclipper,A Halloween celebration of death...some things never change.,6,20 September 2016,"It's been four years since horror fans have had their taste of the depravity and lunacy that Director, Rob Zombie has been able to effectively serve up beginning with his directorial debut ""House of 1000 Corpses"". Followed by its shocking but enjoyable sequel ""The Devils Rejects"", Zombie has helped to usher in a new strain of twisted and ultra-violent horror films catering to a post-millennial, desensitized audience. Remarkably, Zombie has combined elements of old school classic 1970s and 80s grindhouse/exploitation cinema with nail-biting gore and slasher genres into a delicious brew of unique camera work and disturbing imagery. Together with a blend of over-the-top dialogue and morally repugnant antics delivered by a talented team of veteran genre actors hand-picked by Zombie himself, these films are designed to offend and disgust the light-hearted but entice and entertain the truly bold and devoted horror film addict. Nevertheless, Zombie's ""31"" just in time for October 31 of course will either give fans more of a fresh dose of death or disappoint audiences that are looking for something new and refreshing. If you are the latter, you may be among the many to experience just more of the same Rob Zombie formula. It begins quite predictably with detestable characters, bloody brutality, and stark and dark set design all at the end of the road for foul-mouthed grimy hippie-like 1970s characters that end up at the wrong place at the wrong time. The standard deviation applies, as among the prey is Zombie's sexy wife, Sherri Moon Zombie, who basically reprises her scream queen hipster routine by flirtatiously strutting her stuff all the way to the dungeon. Now enters Malcolm McDowell donning renaissance era attire complete with powdered wig and make-up. He happens to be the father of a twisted family of murderous freaks that kidnap unfortunate travelers for the sole purpose of playing a sadistic cat & mouse game that ends in...you guessed it folks, torture and murder. Sound familiar. No surprises here as the ""story"" begins to resemble a demented version of ""The Running Man"" with the cast rambling on unintelligibly and veteran B-movie actress, Meg Foster looking like an extra from ""The Walking Dead"". She's probably the most terrifying thing about this flick, unless you think being stalked and taunted by an Adolf Hitler Nazi dwarf or attacked by chainsaw wielding psycho clowns is scary. It delivers the gore and is not short on bad humor and insanity (Richard Brake is hilarious), but the long awaited anticipation for a Rob Zombie feature with originality seems a bit of a let-down.",31
70,TerribleKatherine,And I used to like Rob Zombie..,3,20 January 2018,"This movie is pointless. That is the definite word to describe this.. I don't even know what to call this, ""movie from hell and NOT in a good way."" As long as I ca remember, I've been a massive Zombie fan. House of 1000 Corpses, the remake of Halloween, Salem's Lot.. along side his talented, amazing wife Sheri Moon he has done some awesome horror movies. This one however, apart from the monologue of Doom-Head in the beginning, felt like it was just a joke. The plot being from a generic horror movie and that DAMN SHAKY CAM defining every fight scene I felt like I'm going to give up. The killers were ridiculous and the ending just didn't make any sense to me. I don't know if poor Mr. Zombie has dementia or what but he needs to wise up and return to the good stuff. I gave a extra point for the movie being a Rob Zombie movie, and another for Sheri Moon, 'cos I freaking adore her, so that makes 3/10. Shame, shame, shame.",31

Doom-Head was a very good villain, his performance was very good and dark. His opening monologue was very good and creepy and sets the stage for his character and the rest of the movie. The acting in general was good and the main characters were likeable. The plot was somewhat simple, but it did not need to be anything special. And the movie gets into things pretty quickly, no unnecessary development. Once things get going, the movie was very, very, intense. Some very brutal and gory kills throughout.

73,Dandy_Desmond,Zombie can do better than this..,2,11 November 2016,"I'm fascinated by Rob Zombie's films and also frustrated. I do believe there is a good director there somewhere capable of making a classic film. He has come close a couple of times. Sadly 31 is a backwards step in his body of work so far. His films have their own style. Very rarely nowadays do horror films have a stamp of their director on them like Zombies films. He doesn't do teen horror. His films genuinely feel like 70s horrors. He loves trashy characters doing ugly things. He loves bizarre imagery. Following experimentation with the Halloween films, he made Lords of Salem which I believe along with Devils Rejects is his finest work. I enjoyed this change of tone and felt he was maturing as a director to make genuinely unsettling horror films. I was looking forward to 31 even though the premise was basic. And basic it turned out to be. The plot can be explained in one sentence. Some people get kidnapped, are put into a game where they are attacked by a variety of people in costumes with various weapons and have to survive. Thats it. It almost felt like a Rob Zombie fan attempting to make a Rob Zombie film. Filtered. I felt like I had seen it all before but slightly worse than his other films. I am sticking with his films as I think he has something to offer but this was a mis-step.",31
74,fairlesssam,A bit different for a Rob Zombie Movie,7,17 July 2017,"There are a lot of negative reviews for this film; it may be because it is quite different from Zombie's normal formula which he basically turns on it's head.A group of carnival workers are en route travelling in a van; they come across some strange scarecrows blocking their path and stop to tear them down. They get ambushed, violently attacked, kidnapped and dumped in a deserted factory. A peculiar group of posh old people tell the carni's that they are there to play a game - the game of 31 which occurs once a year. They have 12 hours to survive and win the game. Amongst them in the factory are numerous psycho killers that are there to viciously kill them all.I enjoyed this movie, it's very 70's stylised in the way it is filmed, the costumes and scenery. The characters are great, typical of Rob Zombies usual pattern. I was really pleased to see Sherri Moon Zombie and Meg Foster there. The baddies are fantastic, I love them, all vicious, crazy and quirky. The settings, colours, camera- work and imagery are very individual to Zombie's style. It is a festival for the eyes. There are a lot of close up shots in this movie that some people don't like but I found it new and something different.This film is extremely violent and gory, full on graphic blood and guts. There are a lot of cringe moments. The special effects are amazing.The actors in this film are superb, the whole cast are believable, likable and give their all. Richard Brake is outstanding and will no doubt have a cult following for his portrayal of Doom-head.I would personally recommend this movie, if you're an avid horror fan it's a must to add to your list.",31
75,NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954,Is This A New Horror Classic or Not?,9,14 October 2016,"Rob Zombie's New Halloween Film '31' is Filled With Clowns, Chainsaws, Psychopaths, Blood, and Terror!Is Rob Zombie's '31' A New Halloween Classic Or Is It Another Misfire For The Director?Five carnival workers are kidnapped the night before Halloween and held hostage in a large compound. At the mercy of their captors, they are forced to play a twisted game of life or death called 31. For the next 12 hours, they must fight for their lives against an endless parade of homicidal maniacs.Anyone who knows Rob Zombie (heavy metal band White Zombie, The House of 1000 Corpses) will know he truly is a fan boy for horror films. You can tell from his music career, music videos, writing, films, and wellhim overall. Some can argue that he may be more of an indie cult following filmmaker than a mainstream film director. Especially with his last film, The Lords of Salem. Now I do like Rob Zombie as a horror director. Notice I said like, not love. Even though he makes entertaining films, for me there has not really been that film that has blown my mind away. My personally favorite film of his would be The Devil's Rejects. When it comes to his films, I believe he does not get any better or any worse. He simply remains the same. That being said, Rob Zombie's new Halloween film 31, is now a Rob Zombie film I can say I love. I enjoyed this just as much as The Devil's Rejects if not more!Now 31 is not a perfect movie. Some of the writing could be a little better, and the editing just seems a little off in some scenes. The characters feel a little underwritten. Meaning, what do not really connect with any of the characters. Yeah, they do have interesting lines of dialogue. However, they feel paper-thin. However, if you are someone who enjoys horror films with homepages, blood, babes, and in all honesty silly scenes. I can see you enjoying this to the fullest. Those who liked his first narrative features, House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects, will most likely enjoy his latest, which feels like a mash-up of the two films. But, for others, this forced toughness will be too silly and self-conscious to feel edgy, and scary. Despite all the carnage and violated taboos.Now if I feel like I know anything about Rob Zombie it is that he loves himself some of that old school horror. This film is clearly a throwback to the 1970s Grindhouse era of filmmaking. I mentioned early how the editing seemed a little off. It felt like the editor(s) were going for that Grindhouse look. On the other hand, I still think the editing could have been a little better. I mean there are some scenes where it is hard to tell what is happening. Also, this film is a mixture of other films. If The Running Man, Saw, The Purge, The Hunger Games, and Mr. Zombie's other films all got together to make one disturbing child movie baby you would get 31.I Ain't No Clown!There is one character in this film that for me is the show stealer. It truly is his movie. I am talking about the character Doom Head, played by Richard Brake (Kingsman: The Secret Service, Spy). This character was frightening, his acting was spectacular, and it really is his movie. He owns the role, and I would love to see that character come back in a future film. Anyone who saw or read my Suicide Squad review knows that I actually did like Jared Leto (Panic Room, Dallas Buyers Club) as The Joker. But Doom Head is my vision for the perfect R Rated Joker in a R rated Batman film. As much as I like Jared Leto, I have to be honest. If he really does not want to come back as Mister J, DC I am begging you please, bring Richard Brake as The Joker! I never thought I would say this, but maybe Rob Zombie should help with the next Batman flick. I would not be surprised if Rob Zombie told Richard Brake ""So, um, yeah, this is the script for that new Batman movie."" (Eyes darting back and forth).So these are my final B*tchin' Buddha thoughts on 31. I enjoyed it, and I know it will be a film I watch every Halloween! Not everyone will enjoy it, but I believe most old school horror fans will be pleased. I believe this film earns a9 out of 10!This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you all for reading and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. :)",31
76,baehr_adam,A Carnival Ride through Hell.,10,1 September 2016,"I will start this review off by saying that I just finished watching this film for the one night early premiere for the Fathom Events showing. I also have seen all of Rob Zombies movies except ""The Lords of Salem"" which I intend to watch and I love all of his films. The story is very simple it is about five carnival workers who are kidnapped the night before Halloween in 1976 and they are then forced to survive 12 hours in ""Murderworld"" and that is the story. The acting was well cast. I didn't know the people who got kidnapped but they played their parts extremely well. The people who played the sociopath clowns were excellent. The costumes were on point and also made you chuckle which I believe was the desired effect. The star of this film though was Doom-Head who was played by Richard Brake. He honestly deserves an award for his performance which was immaculate. The action was dope. I mean the kills and the maiming were Incredible. I personally can't wait for the NC-17 version to release like Rob Zombie said it would because that will be even more Intense. The cinematography was impeccable in my opinion. The camera angels were all shot to induce a sense of dread and claustrophobia. I personally never got scared but that is because I'm a horror fiend. The location was a perfect choice even though it was shot in what appeared to be a warehouse but the team made it work. I will close with this and that is that this is a Must-Watch film. I plan to buy it Day One when it releases. The whole movie never felt rushed which is a major downfall especially in the horror/gore movies of today. The ending was realistic and not cheesy in my opinion. I personally feel anyone who loves a good manhunt movie will fall in love with this film as I did and thanks.",31
77,HorrorFanatic4Life,Not what I expected from Rob Zombie,1,8 March 2019,"By far the biggest disappointment from Rob Zombie. I didn't hear much about this movie before watching, but just it being a RZ film I was expecting it to be similar to other favorites like Devil's Rejects, House of 1000 Corpses and the Halloween movies of his. I even thought it would top those, but I was wrong. It is not even close! Sure there's the gore and all, but with the shaky camera effect (which was so overused) and expected outcomes it was just a huge disappointment. There was no real good storyline either, just a bunch of random people with no background being thrown into what was supposed to be a carnival type killer game that sort of just left them running around some building. The kills weren't scary and were almost expected and there was no real rhyme or reason to anything. Can't even recall being scared in any part, I honestly almost turned it off because I was so bored with it. The only decent part was not having to pay to watch this like everybody else did.Even though this movie was terrible, it doesn't effect me ever watching one of his movies again just because of how good his others have been. I'm just glad I didn't pay to watch this one or it would have been even more of a let down.",31
78,venusboys3,These Clowns Are All Talk And Not Enough Bite,5,19 September 2016,"I had no anticipation or information about this movie going in... except for it being a Rob Zombie movie and my enjoyment of all his other movies so far. None of them are perfect but none of them are boring, all of them bring something interesting to the table. Not so much with 31 though... One thing I've generally liked with Zombie's movies is that, unlike a lot of horror films such as Hostel - which promise all sorts of transgressive horrors only to bait and switch with some relatively tame eyeball gouging, Zombie's movies generally follow through on their threats. I never feel safe in his movies (except I'm pretty sure Mrs. Zombie's characters will survive to the final frame). Unfortunately, 31 let all the air out of that balloon dog for me. It didn't ever come close to crossing any lines of standardized horror. Oh sure, Its clown's show up and promise all sorts of vile entertainments... but they never materialize. Instead, we get some badly filmed fight scenes and routine kills that could be out of any war/crime/fantasy film. There's little or no suspense, barely any atmosphere outside of the clowns' initial entrances and Malcolm McDowall's nonsensical prattling. The movie takes its time building up 'Doomhead' but what is he but another loudmouthed guy in a clown suit? I assume he'd go down just as easily to a well-aimed blow to the head. There's really nothing special about him except for the amount of time he gets on screen. He even does the loathsome 'golf clap' routine that should be forever banished to Cliché-land. When the clowns do get their hands on someone they're not likely do do anything surprising at all... just stab them and move on. Unless something nastier was edited out of the version I saw... which I kinda doubt.The carnies themselves had the potential for being the sort of interesting protagonists I'd pull for... and I DID like that they weren't just a bunch of squealing teenagers (Meg Foster especially was fascinating to look at. Older women like her are so seldom allowed on screen in heroic roles). But they're mostly reduced to just goofing around and swearing at each other... maybe it was just bad improv because the writer couldn't think of what to do with them?This is BY FAR the least interesting thing I've seen come from Mr. Zombie. I'm still a fan of his previous films, I'll still watch whatever he makes next... but this one is the bottom dweller. Not that it's such a bad generic horror movie, as just that alone it's fairly average... but it's certainly a bad Rob Zombie horror movie. And being that, it's pretty disappointing.",31
79,drahulrajjsd,Not everyone on the planet has the same taste for everything!!!,10,15 July 2017,"A movie I've been waiting and wanting for ages, written and directed by a brave master of horror and cinema, My Hero Mr. Rob Zombie. It's up there with my other favorite films of his which are, ""House of 1000 Corpses"", ""The Devil's Rejects"", ""Halloween II"", and ""The Lords of Salem"". An old school 70's solid grind-house horror with a simple plot, which is made in the style of the master himself, with its vibes from ""House Of 1000 Corpses"" and more of ""The Devil's Rejects"", combined in one extremely epic way. It takes place back in year 1976 and it's about a group of carnival workers who get kidnapped on Halloween night. They're thrown into an abandoned warehouse, and forced to play a game called 31, defending themselves against a bunch of psychotic killers dressed up as clowns for 12 hours, and their only chance for survival is to kill or get killed. It's an insanely intense bloody carnival ride of a feature that will leave you with nonstop shocking scenes of murder, mayhem, madness, vulgarity, lots of dark humor, and it's all very well executed in a completely hectic and energetic mode which is bold, brilliant, and just a whole lot of fun. The makeup effects are fantastic and the fight scenes are really brutal, along with just about everything in this film. It's all very realistic, and if you actually pay attention, it feels like you're in the movie yourself. You've got a league of massive icons, major veterans, and newcomers bringing these amazing characters to life. The awesome score has it's vibes from classic 70s and 80s horror scores, and as always, from a Rob Zombie film, the soundtrack is filled with super golden oldies.As a horror fan, I'm always rooting for the villains, but in this feature, the good characters are bad-asses, too, and it's really a tough choice for me to root for sides. Sheri Moon Zombie's performance as Charley is extremely impressive. At first her character is weak and girlish, but as she fights from one level to another for survival with her team of carnies, she gains more resiliency and transforms into more of a warrior. The Iconic Meg Foster as Venus is the toughest and wisest of them all; believe it or not, you'll get to see her wielding a chainsaw against a maniac, and she really looks great for her age, too. I really loved Roscoe, played by Jeff Daniel Phillips, who's more of a bad-ass in the entire team of carnies; he's a fighter and he never quits. EG Daily's character as Sexhead is the hottest + craziest killer clown you will ever see, with her sweet voice and her jaw dropping looks will definitely thrill the audience. I would definitely love to see a movie mainly about E.G.'s character. Another interesting character who's movie I would love to see is... the sickest and scariest character of them all, who starts off the movie with his mind-blowing speech and later on steals the entire show. This man may look like a clown, with his grease painted makeup; but trust me, folks, this chaotic individual ain't no clown, and he definitely ain't no Joker clowning around from the Batman Universe; he ain't playing around when it comes to his job. A new face of horror which is truly iconic is finally here and he is known as Doomhead, played by Richard Brake, who's performance is extremely phenomenal. I believe Richard badly needs an Oscar for his role as Doomhead, the greatest performance I've ever seen in a long time.I've been wondering why there are bad reviews for a movie like this. Well, I guess the audience nowadays are mostly into horror films in the mainstream world which are being too friendly with PG13 ratings and CGI effects or whatever. I, on the other hand, will never waste my time doing negative reviews, because I know everything isn't easy to do in life and not everyone on the planet has the same taste for everything. Some of the audience were expecting it to be more gory, but they forget that it's because of the MPAA, why we never really get to see the NC17 version of ""31"". I really hope the uncut version will be available on home video someday, though I'm still happy that at least we got to see this Rated R version of ""31"". I've been a fan of Rob Zombie's movies since I was a kid and this man has never disappointed me in any of his works and till this very day, he's always passionate for the horror genre. He's not doing it for the fame or making number 1 movies at the box office; he's actually doing it for his fans, and I'm proud to say that I'm one of them. When I saw ""31"" for the very first time, I was just blown away from start to finish as it was so good, I had to watch it over and over again. It's kinda strange, too, because whenever I watch it, I feel there's a lot of positive and inspirational messages I get from this movie, and there's a really powerful message at the ending which is pretty similar to ""The Devil's Rejects"" and it's one of the best endings I've ever seen in a long time.",31
80,Kingkitsch,All tricks and no treats,3,25 September 2016,"Here we go again.Rob Zombie loves a number of things: Halloween. The 70s. His wife, the supremely untalented Sherri Moon. Forgotten actors. Obscure period music. These items made ""House of 1000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"" worth watching because they were fresh. Now, they're tired tropes that clutter Zombie's ""31"". Let's take a quick look at some of the director's obsessions, in listed order.Halloween: Many, many shots of Halloween decorations that used to hang on elementary school walls. One wonders if Zombie is paying the Beistle Company for using their iconic wares, or if they're paying him. ""31"" is the last day of October, Halloween. Scary characters in costumes. Etc.The 70s: Grindhouse slasher films.His wife: Sherri Moon Zombie, shrill and annoying. Cannot act, although her character in ""1000 Corpses"" used these traits effectively. That only worked once, Rob. Just thought you'd like to know. Forgotten actors: Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs? Judy Geeson? Karen Black in ""1000 Corpses""? Since Zombie goes to such lengths to resurrect these actors, why do he give them nothing to do except increase the body count? Etc. See also ""the 70s"". Obscure period music: Zombie, being a musician also, is good at this. ""Walk Away"" by the James Gang actually worked. Also Slim Whitman's ""I Remember You"" in ""1000 Corpses"" best marriage of sound and visuals.It would be interesting to see Zombie make a movie without these things to cover up a lack of a good story and some badly-needed character development. ""31"" uses all the tricks but has no treats to offer. If you enjoyed Zombie's first two movies,as I did, skip this. Disappointing, and worst of all, lazy movie making. The direct ripoff of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" in this film's final shot was pretty shoddy. Come on Rob, you can do better than this.",31
81,derekjager,A boring dud,2,19 March 2018,"I watched this when it came out and found it too long and actually, kinda dull. Then I recently re-watched it and felt the same way. Since Zombie never ""starts normal,"" all his characters are the most foul-mouthed, low-life people you'd ever meet. Then they meet others worse then them. The odd thing is the three characters dressed up in aristocratic clothes--they are never explained and their backstory would have been interesting to know. The killers are pretty dull--a Nazi little person, some chainsaw guys. I mean, nothing original and everyone pretty much leers at the camera. I think LORDS OF SALEM was his best felt--a great look to it, a somewhat original idea, but 31 is just a tired retread. Since his movies don't make any money at the box office, he crowdfunded this--and it didn't make any money, either. But he said that because he crowdfunded it, he could make the movie he wanted with no studio interference. Well, he did, and it's a dull mess.",31
82,Greenzombidog,Another Zombie turd.,3,14 October 2016,"When we were kids my cousin and I would play in the woods. One time we were out there and my cousin disappeared for a while. When he came back he said ""You've got to see this, I have just done the biggest turd you have ever seen"". So I went to take a look and it was true, it was massive from such a small child and it had this annoying fly buzzing all around it. Well watching a new Rob Zombie film is like going to see my cousins turd. I'm amazed that he's made this but as I expected it's just a pile of crap. Also I'll use the fly as a metaphor for Sheri Moon Zombie aimlessly buzzing around this steaming pile in the most annoying way.Unlike almost every other review on here that starts with "" I loved House of a thousand corpses and Devils rejects"" I didn't love those movies. I was bitterly disappointed with House and thought Devils rejects was just a gore stained collection of stolen ideas. I preferred his Lords of Salem and to a lesser degree Halloween 2. They at least seemed to show Zombie had some kind of voice as a director.31 is such a simple idea that I can't understand how it could go so wrong. There is little to no character development for our protagonists. The ""action"" is filmed in such a way it lacks any excitement and the movie is paced so badly it becomes a bore. The character of Doom head which many are saying is the saving grace was just loaded with the terrible direlogue Zombie is now infamous for. With no cohesive character or personality traits to make him believable I just didn't feel it, it didn't work for me. I did enjoy seeing Meg Foster again and thought she was great. I did also enjoy the fight scene with the chainsaw clowns but in a movie with a run time of 1h 42 mins this isn't hardly enough to recommend it.After everything the ending is also terrible Zombie tries to leach tension from a scene where there is none because he doesn't realise by this point nobody cares. He kills off the few likable characters and leaves us with one no one was rooting for.I don't know why I continue to watch his films but I will say one thing for Zombie. When it comes to dropping turds he beats my cousin hands down.",31
83,longcooljolie,Some fun moments but mostly a snoozefest,4,8 October 2019,"October is one of my favorite months to watch horror movies and Rob Zombie is usually bankable for good horror, especially with the House of 1000 Corpses and the Devil's Rejects. The Halloween reboots are also pretty good, but the most recent Zombie offering to date, 31 falls off the table a little bit.It's set up sort of well for the beginning shot before the opening credits, which is a Zombie trademark . Then the gang gets introduced with lots of hangers-on from his other movies including his wife, Sheri. They are carnival workers who ride around in an RV but then get stopped by props blocking the road on the outskirts of a small town. When they get out of the RV to move the props aside, yikes! A band of thugs overtakes them and kidnaps them.The next thing they know, they're bound and gagged and presented to a grease painted couple in Renaissance wear who gleefully inform them they will now take part in the game 31, in which they have 12 hours to survive a series of tests.It's an okay premise, but after that there's too much fumbling around in the dark with hand-held cameras. I fell asleep on the movie because it totally lacks the fun shtick from earlier Zombie movies like little solarized outtakes, funny character quirks and goofy theatrical moments. If I'd paid $10 to $12 in a theater to see this I would have asked for my money back, seriously.",31
84,yourfavoritecritic,Just Another Rob Zombie Movie,3,2 April 2020,"31 is written and directed by Rob Zombie, and was released back in 2016. The film follows five carnival workers who are kidnapped and forced to participate in a sick game where they come face-to-face with death.
Now at this point in his film career, you are either a fan of Rob Zombie or you're not, his movies tend to be divisive due to them being quite crude, graphic and raunchy. I fall somewhere in the middle between the two camps, I don't consider Zombie's films to be overly great (I haven't seen one that I'd consider ""good""), however I am always interested in seeing his new releases just due to their shock factor, and 31 does not do too much to change the formula.
Normally I like to touch on the positives of a film first, however here they remain slim. I enjoyed the opening to the film, it starts are out ominous and little creepy with Richard Brake delivering a decent enough monologue, however I just wish this sequence would have continued with the static shot, I felt like it would have made the entire opening more impactful. Now outside of that, there wasn't a whole lot that was great about this film, there are a handful of shots/sequences I did somewhat enjoy (such as the very ending), however much of this film left more to be desired. Every time there would any kind of action on screen the film would be shot in a handheld way, featuring way too many jump cuts to count and shots so zoomed in making it even harder to tell what's going on. Apart from that, the acting is mostly laughable, the story is alright, however more could have been done with the premise. Overall this wasn't a film I enjoyed but didn't outright hate. It's not the worst thing in the world, and if you haven't seen a Rob Zombie movie before but are interested, this one wouldn't be bad to check out, it's pretty standard of a film for him at this point. I think 31 would please the hardcore Zombie fans, but this isn't going to sway anyone that is not a fan.
In conclusion due to the polarizing nature of Rob Zombie movies, do take my review/rating with a grain of salt, it's just my opinion coming from somebody who still remains neutral about the director, despite him seeming like a cool guy, with a clear passion for horror. So with that in mind, Rob Zombie's 31 gets a 3.5/10",31
85,scrapmetal7,31: Rob has now gone fully in the wrong direction.,2,5 November 2016,"All I have to say about this movie is that in the middle of this movie, the people come upon a filthy circus tent. Inside is a woman who has been pinioned to a platform on the ground with barbed wire for some time, and has been raped repeatedly by two of the killers. She is in a terrible condition and has been tortured horribly (in the beginning of the movie we saw her husband get killed). They keep her draped under a deflated blow-up sex doll. One of the people try to free her while the other one yells at her because he thinks she is somehow in on the trap. The killers come in and one of them kills this woman with his chainsaw. The reactions I have to this scenario are sadness, anger, hate, and disgust, but not fear. This is not horror. I don't actually know what to even call it.A movie about a group of innocents trapped in a warehouse with killer clowns could be done a number of ways, but the only way that really works would be to be over the top, intense, and ridiculously fun. The scene I described above is certainly over the top, but in a very bad direction, and is definitely not in any way fun. None of this movie is fun to watch at all. The kind of boost that Rob Zombie got to his credibility for the rape scene way back in Devil's Rejects was not a blank check. If he wanted to be seen as a serious filmmaker of serious films, as seems to have been the case, throwing in a rape scene was only going to work once. He was more than welcome to keep pursuing serious material, but it had to be different kinds of serious material. Instead, all of his films have had rape or forced oral sex content. His films had to develop into better and more serious films, and they haven't.The usual complaints against RZ are his bad characters and bad dialogue. Those are valid complaints, but I was willing to overlook them, because he is an amazing talent and as a cinematographer, he is at the very top of the game. But the real problem that I think has finally solidified into a habit, is the rape filled nature of his movies, which I never signed on for, I think is NOT horror, and I am not interested in.Most of the reviewers have praised Richard Brake's performance. He's basically this movie's Bill Moseley. I'm happy for him, because this is his first turn as a lead as far as I know, and he does do a good job of playing an irredeemable villain. To be honest though, the movie itself is just not good. I miss Bill Moseley though.Also, most of the reviewers have yet again complained about Sheri Moon's acting. Those complaints have always been bull. She does fine, like always.The best performance in the movie is from Meg Foster, as beautiful and engaging as ever, and not afraid to show her true age. She is truly something special.31 could have been many things. A rape movie should not have been it.2 out of 10, only for Meg Foster and some good cinematography.",31
86,cornflakeboy20,"An ugly, cheap version of Suicide Squad",4,13 January 2017,"You'd have to imagine that Rob Zombie knew Suicide Squad was going to be big in 2016 when he decided to write about a warped tramp in Daisy Dukes with a baseball bat fighting with a meth addict clown with metal teeth. To avoid a lawsuit, he instead borrowed plot elements from The Purge and The Running Man to create a no rules game show where ugly hillbillies, gangbangers and sluts fight other similar people with bad circus makeup. All the characters communicate entirely in the f word, sometimes mixed up with similar words in untranslated Spanish and German. For a fight movie with a pro wrestling sensibility, it works. It's not dull. But that's it. The era and camera work evokes Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but in this version it's like the crazy cannibal family is fighting each other: no heroes, no themes, no messages, not much of interest.",31
87,davidlohr,"Stick To Music, Rob",2,29 July 2020,"I'm glad I caught this while it was streaming free. It's definitely not worth buying or renting. I don't know if this was intended to be a horror or a comedy. It wasn't scary in the least, and certainly wasn't funny. The only thing I found humorous is the likely assumption of the director that he'd created something unique and interesting. He didn't. It's basically a poor remake of Surviving The Game with a little Saw sprinkled on top. There is no character development and the film plays into the same overused stupidity of characters who make dumb decisions - not making sure someone is dead, failing to pick up weapons, etc. I think it's safe to say we're all quite tired of that. I like Rob's music, but master of horror he's not.",31
88,jpasols,Definitely one of my second favorites from Rob Zombie!,8,7 August 2018,"Rob Zombie's 31 is a throwback to his horror classics ""House Of 1000 Corpses"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"". ""31"" delivers the same kind of twisted plot with twisted characters and dialogue! It also delivers the same Gore and setting and atmosphere that Zombie's previous films have delivered. And of course there's a bunch of killer clowns...must be related to Captain Spaulding lol. If you're a huge Rob Zombie fan I would check this one out. If you're not a Rob Zombie fan...steer clear of this one.",31
89,dunnypop,The Running Man meets an uninspiring Manhunt,6,21 September 2016,"I'm quite amazed by the negative reviews as I'm not sure what people were expecting from Rob Zombie. Is this Rob Zombie's best work? No. Is it awful? No - it's better than your average generic horror tribute to the 70's style exploitation film. If you're going to judge 31 compared to Zombie's other films, I would classify it a bit on the lower side of his films. I will honestly say I'm always interested in watching a Rob Zombie film - no matter how disappointing the film turns out. With all of Rob Zombie's film especially Lords of Salem, 31 has a lot of potential but fails to get past the premise / first half of the film. Also with everything Rob Zombie, there are generic survivors (the heroes) and a more focused approach on the villains. The main villain Doom-head is very interesting and just psychotic. The other villains / killer clowns were OK but some what amusing. I guess the interesting aspect are why is Doom-head better than the rest of the clowns? Is he that much better than killing people? Is he stronger? Faster? Who knows.The plot is pretty much the Running Man (game show where hunters kill off contestants) meets the tone of Manhunt (a violent sadistic video game - but you could also say it's the tone of all R. Zombie films) with psychotic killer clowns. It's strange and surreal and the movie runs 30 mins too long with this very thin concept where nothing really develops in terms of characters or plot or reasoning on why they hold this annual event (even at least in Raze - a forced to the death woman on woman blood sport - they tried to explain why they hold these tournaments). List of Praises: - Casting some older actors and actresses. It's always good to see some people on the screen that you might know of who were stars in the 70's and 80's. - Cast of villains... some were cartoonish and others resembled comic book characters. - Visual style. Zombie's visual style in his movies get better and better... Lords of Salem was up there, but this was not too bad.List of Issues: - Sheri Moon... she is still pretty good to look at, but when it comes to intense acting there are issues with her. She can't cry or show distress, it's just a little too campy. - Lack of character dialogue. Didn't understand what the victims/survivors jobs were and where they were traveling to... actually thought they were in a band. - Loses steam. With all Zombie films, the first half is pretty good and then it just starts to lose steam towards the final act. Zombie also couldn't figure out an interesting way to finish the film.If you're a Rob Zombie fan, you're going to see it... if you liked Lords of Salem or 1000 Corpses, you should also see it... just expect to not have too much plot but interesting visuals.",31
90,chaosbaron,Cringeworthy,3,27 January 2017,"I will start with my groups biggest complaint: we couldn't understand any of the characters. Even after subtitles, most of the lines didn't make sense. It was basically nonsense with dick/vag jokes tossed in every other minute. The rest will be a brief list of negatives -Cameraman having seizures during action sings -Not killing enemy when he is down -Pointlessly dropping your weapon -Sherri Moon Zombie being.. well...

91,Kolobos51,"Zombie has a good time, fans will too!",7,10 September 2016,"I'm going to start by saying ""31"" is Rob Zombie's weakest live action theatrical film to date BUT that's not to say it's a bad movie. It's a small movie, too small, really, for it's own good. It was also a rushed movie, made largely out of Zombie's frustration from trying to make something bigger and more ambitious and failing to secure funding.Sooo, he made a movie about a crew of hick carnies trapped in an abandoned factory with a bunch of paid psychopaths dressed as clowns, hunting them down for the amusement of a trio of a rich British freaks, led by the the great Malcolm McDowell's Father Death. There's nothing more to the movie, and the carnies are not terribly well drawn characters but they are played by good actors.Sheri Moon Zombie is, of course, the lead, a flirty hooker with a tough attitude. As a character, she's pretty thin and not strong enough to carry a whole movie. Meg Foster, as the leader, and Jeffrey Daniel Phillips, both previously seen in Zombie's ""Lords of Salem"", have more personality and are a little easier to align with. The other characters are just waiting to die and we all know it.The killers are the real focal point, as is often the case with Rob Zombie's movies. The so-called Heads are all fantastic characters. Sick Head, a neo-nazi Spanish dwarf, Schizo and Psycho Head, a pair of perverted redneck brothers, Sex and Death Head, deranged murderous lovers, and Doom Head, the baddest of them all, are much better. Doom Head, played brilliantly by Richard Brake (Zombie's Halloween 2, Doom the movie), steals the flick as the most badass killer in recent film history.Zombie does a good job holding things together on a shoe string budget but I hope what he takes away from making this movie is that his real talent is creating killers, not heroes. ""The Devil's Rejects"" is pretty universally considered his best movie Because it has no pretense of being about the victims. It's all about the bad guys and that's just what Zombie should have done here.Had the movie come from the perspective of Father Murder, Doom Head, and the rest of the merry band of misfit murderers, this would have been absolute classic. But, it is still a fun, grimy, grindhouse madhouse filled with nasty, sadistic Zombie touches. His fans will all get a kick out of the movie and be clamoring for his unrated cut, which, I've got a feeling, is going to blow this obviously censored R-rated cut right out of the water.I say definitely give it a look, just don't expect anything too exceptional.",31
92,chimera3,"Another ""Phone-In"" Attempt",1,5 March 2017,"I have been a fan of Rob Zombie for many years. When I watched ""House of 1000 Corpses"" for the first time, I loved it. As soon as ""The Devil's Rejects"" came out, I thought that it was great and lived up to its predecessor. His renditions of ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween II"" were good, but that's when it the greatness disappears. ""The Lords of Salem"" was downright ridiculous. Now there's ""31."" What is there to say? All the while I was watching it, I was just shaking my head. As the title of my summary states, this was another ""phone-in"" attempt, almost as though Rob simply stopped trying. When it comes to writing certain things, I am never at a loss for words. In this case, I am. To put it mildly without giving too much away, there was no set solution. When it came to music, Rob was good up to a point. Same thing with his movies. After watching an abomination like this, I am still shaking my head about whether or not I still want to remain loyal to his work.",31
93,Bryan_Roderick,Rob Zombie is under-appreciated.,6,15 October 2016,"31It has becoming more and more clear to me that Rob Zombie is under-appreciated as a director. Sure he's still growing and will have some directorial flaws in there. Maybe it's his style that draws me in. I'm a big fan of characters who are fleshed out. John Carpenter is great, and I get why he doesn't like Rob Zombie, but their style of horror is completely different. Rob Zombie likes for the audience to know the villain's background, whereas John Carpenter doesn't.The film is about five carnies who are kidnapped and put in a saw like game of cat and mouse. The murderers are over the top and Rob- Zombified. One in-particular shouldn't be spoiled for you. Richard Brake plays the most sinister and evil character in the film. He's not gross or weird, he's just evil. He just wants to watch you die. He's both straight to the point and savoring in his hunt.Sheri Moon Zombie plays Charly who you can imagine what happens to her at the beginning of the game called 31. Jeff Daniel Philips is in the film and delves deep into his character and brings forth a great performance. I've only recently see him in Westworld. But he was also in Halloween II with Sheri Moon Zombie. Notice a trend here?Another reason I mention John Carpenter and Rob Zombie is that Meg Foster is in the film as an older carny. She was in They Live for Carpenter and in Lords of Salem for Zombie. She did a pretty good job considering she's had years of experience in TV and movies like Masters of the Universe.Verdict: The Metascore for this film is super low. It shouldn't be. I thought it was worth watching at most once. I would recommend this for people who know what to expect from a Grind-house style movie.",31
94,lev-nemkin,Did not enjoy this movie did have decent moments but that's it...,3,26 September 2016,Here is what I'll say about 31 this movie wasn't good I didn't enjoy it to me it was just too goofy in a way I mean some of the acting was good and it had some decent kills but that was about it. Another thing that annoyed me about this is that Sheri Moon Zombie was in this again...why does Rob Zombie always cast his wife? She is a good actress but come on mix it up a little. This movie was too simple for me too it didn't make you think unlike Lords of Salem I mean I didn't like that too much either but at least it made me think it was twisted in that sense. He put the least effort into this movie I'm not even going to bother going into any details. I liked Jeff Daniel Phillips and Meg Foster this was my first time seeing her in anything his first 3 movies were good then to me it started to feel like he lost his way a little and didn't know what the hell he was making and this really did prove it.,31
95,HorrorFreak1997,"boring and bland, with horrible direction.",2,27 September 2016,"31 (2016) directed by Rob Zombie is about a group of five carnival workers who are kidnapped and held hostage in an abandoned, hell-like compound where they are forced to participate in a violent game, the goal of which is to survive twelve hours against a gang of sadistic clowns.This being Zombie's sixth full length feature film, it feels like much of the same. same visual style, same vulgar dialogue, same vintage camera filters, and the same lead actress that we are all tired of seeing. it's a real shame that Mr. Zombie cant seem to change up his style and make something fresh, or at least entertaining.the camera work in 31 (16) is truthfully nothing special, at times though it is awful. it becomes nausea inducing and there are a lot of unnecessary close ups. this paired with some of the most annoying and disorienting editing I have ever seen makes this one a real chore to watch. the story drags on and on at a snails pace with no tension or suspense. this is not an exaggeration. there really is no suspense or tension. the setting had some potential, but due to Zombie's direction we never really get any sense of urgency or claustrophobia or anything like that. all the characters are annoying and unlikable and the acting is just alright, sometimes it really is terrible though. the shock factor isn't even there on this one. Zombie is known for delivering some truly brutal visuals but this film seems pretty tame for a Rob Zombie film.to conclude my review ill say that 31 (2016) is an awful, boring and dull film with no substance. there really isn't a singular good reason I can think of to watch this movie.the verdict: 2/10",31
96,megaruda,Interesting,8,23 April 2018,"Thoughtless red-neckish main characters, strangely written, it feels like a very random free movie, it feels like a script that would of never been approved due to a lack of proper structure and I enjoyed that a lot. I have heard so much hate for this movie so maybe my expectations were low, even then, I don't understand the hate for a film that isn't even trying to be more than one more slasher in the genre, it was kinda of gory but not too much to be grossed out, it was a very balanced meal. The concept was great but I expected 31 killers sent out at the same time so the fact that they go 1 by 1 and that they are only 6 was underwhelming, but then again, I think he saved it with style, the ending is a beauty, not as a huge beauty as The Devil Reject's Freebird, but, a pretty soft unpretentious, chill, great ending that made me feel the greatness of slashers and the beauty of the last character alive.

The premise, seen countless times before, involves people in the 1970s being in a van on the road going to somewhere and then...surprise surprise...they encounter an evil group of people who try to kill them. Hasn't that been done a million times already? The camera work is also very bad and very frenetic. None of the acting was very impressive either. And how Malcom McDowell got involved in this is beyond me,but even he couldn't get me to watch it all the way through. The only thing I can say for it is that the scenery (such as it is) is lit and shot very well. Don't waste your time, and definitely do not pay to see it.",31

If you like Rob Zombie movies, then you know what their failings are, and their strengths are enough to compensate. If you don't like Rob Zombie movies, there's no reason to expect that you would like this one.If you're unfamiliar with Rob Zombie movies, the defining characteristic of them is that there is no appreciable story, there are no appreciable characters, and everything is about the aesthetic, which is hugely inspired by the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. His movies revolve around making weird bad guys from the late '70s. There's some gore and there's transgression of norms (detailed rape threats, pointlessly aggressive sex, bloodthirsty, asshole protagonists), which outdoes that of Zombie's exploitation-flick sources, but which isn't enough to shock me today.If you're going to like 31-- or any of Rob Zombie's movies-- you will know inside of fifteen minutes, because that's enough time to realize the aesthetic, which doesn't change, and which is all there is. And if you're not going to like 31, you'll know inside fifteen minutes as well. So if this is a free ""rental,"" and you're not sure, you don't need to invest much to find out. If you're considering seeing this in a theater, with a group of friends, what's it matter what you're going to see? Go have fun with your friends.

I didn't like the killers in this, especially some of the acting from the killers was below par. The best performance comes from Richard brake as an absolute maniac he should be given an Oscar for this role. The setting and locations was not scary or visually interesting to me in any way. I just didn't like the storyline. I loved the ending , it was super ambiguous and you root for the final girl. That's the only positives that I can think off about this . I certainly don't hate it but I wouldn't watch it more than 2 times. Its my least likeable of Rob's films and I don't mean that in a bad way. I just think he should have done something more or went a different route with the killers.
Overall not unwatchable , but not his best.

It's nasty, gory, tongue in cheek retro fun and if you can get past the 'leading lady' I think (if those are something you enjoy in a film) you'll love it... On second watch I certainly have",31

The bad
1) written by a sexually depressed teenager who fills the film full of sex, perversion and utter dirt and by that I mean the film has a really sticky dirty quality to it. You just want to shower after watching it
2) gore is fine but if that's all you got, it ain't worth much
3) the acting is generally abysmal and the lead female is so bad you can't tell if she's laughing, crying or what
4) it's about thirty minutes too long
5) it's headache inducing cuts and camera trickery, a fight has to be filmed as if the cameraman is on speedAll in all. Grimy, grindhouse type nonsenseEnding is also complete and utter pantsNot worth your time unless you like Rob Zombie and his other movies",31

107,josephmpapp,Why does Zombie write the dialogue?,2,18 June 2017,"The good: The lighting, sets, music, costumes, makeup, and some actors. Honestly, I think that zombie does a great job when it comes to the setup and design of his movies. The worlds he creates in his films are strange and they feel normal in their own realm. Some movies can't capture a feel for their environment and it feels out of place. In this movie, the film's environment is believable. The actors interact with that environment in a reasonable way. The costumes, makeup, and lighting works for the movie. All in all, this is the best part about the film. The bad: Script, Dialogue, and acting.Rob Zombie has a fetish for extreme vulgarity in language. This would be fine if it were confined to one or two characters. He makes it a standard for all his characters which is the problem. When Sherri Moon zombie kills the midget (sorry, no PC here), she stops and says ""where the f* is my bat?"" That's reasonable because of the situation. When she starts to flirt with the gas station attendant, it's unreasonable and it doesn't make sense. She even grabs the guys crotch because... you know... Women do that all the time (sarc). This has always been Rob Zombie's weakness. He writes terrible dialogue which destroys the film. Richard Brake is awesome in general. You don't need him sticking a finger under meg foster's nose talking about the chick he just had sex with. On top of that, Why show him screw the chick only to comment in more vulgarity. Less is more Rob. I saw the movie for free. I don't think I'd watch it again.",31
108,jacobywarner,Dirty... Gory... Just Blatant White Trash Bumpkin Fun,8,27 November 2019,"As an adherent of the great director Rob Zombie, I am confident in saying that 31 is my favorite film in his portfolio. A story about a group of travelers who are abducted and tormented by an underground society of wealthy individuals who wager on the lives of their victims.This movie starts off with one of the most amazing monologues in horror film history, when Doom Head (Richard Brake) preaches to one of his victims who just so happens to be a Preacher Man. This scene sets the tone for the dirty gore-fest to follow.I decided to give this movie an 8/10 because of the rawness that Rob Zombie gives.

What I got, or in this case lost were more then 100 minutes of my life that would have been better served in any number of ways. When the tag-line for the movie is ""A Rob Zombie Movie"" I should have known better. Even the synopsis which has something to do with surviving a few hours with sadistic clowns had me expecting something awful (and no, I don't even mean that in a good way) After sitting through this I was thankful I didn't pay to see it. Rob Zombie simply can't write a screenplay. His idea of dialogue is stupid characters shouting expletives, with no real story to speak of. Unlikable characters most of which are bad actors or more likely as the great Malcolm McDowell is in this, Rob Zombie hasn't got the ability as a director to get a decent performance even from McDowell.A few gory scenes aside this is proof number six that Rob Zombie shouldn't be given anyone's cash to make a movie. I believe if he has the nerve to make another movie he should, or quite probably will have to finance it himself, if this is evidence enough for any financier. A waste of my time but thankfully not a waste of my money.",31

Everything is mannered in that very special Zombie way and it feels like he's just cramming all his favorite things, actors, and quirks into one film simply to keep the engine from getting rusty. You never get the sense that he's passionate or believes in this story or its characters. It's just a cash grab that panders to his most devoted fans.

This wasn't about character work or plot, this was about giving fans the brutal zombie film they wanted him to make. And it worked. Is it perfect? No. It isnt meant to be. This is a love letter to the fans. The only reason I have it a 7 is because the R version very clearly holds back, and I blame the MPAA for not having the guts to let the masses choose for themselves what they want to see. Hopefully the unrated version surfaces for us fans that just wanted to let go, let our brains turn to mush, and enjoy the mindless imagery and sheer violence on screen. I'm glad I finally saw 31, as it washed the awful taste of 3 from hell out of my mouth. I'm still with you Rob, keep em coming. And if you ever read this? Forget the fireflies now, give us more Doom Head.",31
113,bernygilbo,What the hell Rob?,4,9 May 2020,So this was awful. Not even for a B horror movie was this acceptable. I love Rob Zombie but sometimes he should stick to music. I'm getting tired of seeing his wife in every film he puts out too. She's beautiful but the woman can't act.,31
114,skylerisaac,Yikes,5,28 January 2017,"I admire Rob Zombie as both a musician and filmmaker.I liked what he did with both of his additions to the Halloween franchise, and his last film, The Lords of Salem was a psychological head trip.His latest film, 31, sounded like a lot of fun despite the semi-tired premise. Sadly, the results are only so-so.The opening scene, mostly comprising a deranged monologue by villain Doom-Head, played with a fearsome malevolence by Richard Brake, is well-shot and offers the audience a lot of promise. Unfortunately, we're then introduced to the protagonists of our story, a group of traveling carnival workers. This rag tag group consists entirely of unlikable assholes. Zombies refusal to provide us with interesting or likable characters makes it almost impossible to care what happens to them in the ensuing bloodbath, thus lessening the scares and intensity.Another quibble of mine is Zombies insistence on casting his wife in every one of his films. She's a good actress, but the nepotism at work distracts me and kind of takes me out of the film. Her performance is good though, so this is probably just a personal nitpick that won't bother anyone else.There are moments of brief and entrancing intensity, such as the chainsaw clowns, but mostly the film is predictable, characters dying one by one until only one remains.The writing isn't top-notch, which means that the fast-paced and frenetic action is really the only entertaining thing about the film.All in all, I found the film disappointing. Zombie has proved that he can do better than this, and I hope his future films are more well put together than this.5/10",31
115,MsGoreXale3723,I liked it,7,10 September 2017,"It was what I've come to expect from a Zombie film. I actually like the things that most people don't like about his movies. I like the old school actors. I like that he writes movies resembling 70's B movies and that they have that grind house feel to them. It's no secret that he loves horror movies and he incorporates that love of the genre, while pleasing his target audience who love them as well. Everyone seemed to like Doomhead and I did as well. However, Sickhead was my favorite. Understanding the language, I loved his dialogue and his taunting, basically being sort of a bad a** regardless of size (just to be clear, not his wardrobe, just dialogue). SMZ was not annoying and doing some good work without over doing it. If I had to chose, this would be some of her better work since Halloween (and not 2)! I would have preferred more blood and gore, which I've come to expect from RZ, and for that, I knocked down my score just a tad. I heard there were several cuts made for rating purposes and I would rather enjoy seeing the movie again without the cuts. Overall, I'm glad I didn't listen to the reviews and was able to see it for myself. I wasn't disappointed. It's not The Devils Rejects, but it was still a great movie.",31

You kind of assume that after a few years of doing anything, you would get better at it. Zombie has regressed. Or simply gotten lazy.

117,oaspag-71318,"Good, as a Mr.Zombie-style film.",7,5 February 2017,"Hi there ! This film is something : extreme depravity, intense gore, nazi and hillbilly chainsaw-totting clowns, psycho freaks, enraged midget nazi, sick game ball-costumed bourgeois, swearing, cussing (more f bombs than you can muster), racial tones (racism, blacks vs Hitler freaks), blood splashing by the gallons, a real uncomfortable nightmare come true, this is shocking Hardcore R-18 stuff. Not for the faint of heart or people who feel insulted easily.But I was not surprised at all and expected no less from Gorror Gourru the Undead Zombie himself, the very creatively talented director Mr.Zombie (Rob Zombie). The only other one like him is Quentin Tarantino, both are masters of hardgore films; the difference being that Mr.Tarantino deals with real life violence in a more serious way/subject matter is more real and not an over-the-top horror fantasy, even if Mr.Tarantino's characters seem overtly self-aware cartoons of real people (while Mr.Zombie's main protagonist characters (not the cartoon antagonists like in this film (clowns, bourgeois, nazi midgets)) seem more real no matter how screwed up they are).The intro is very disconcerting and awkward : a man stares straight in the camera for 15 minutes long while delivering a big speech (à la Mr.Tarantino) as if he's talking to us the audience, a bloodied face of a clown saying how he intends to make it quick. He says a pretty powerful line that will become a cult line... with a straight face and Coming from a face-painted clown (since clowns are suppose to make you make smile and laugh) :''....I didn't come to make you happy or make your day.......I came to END YOUR LITTLE MISERABLE F...LIFE.''That stuck in my head. As if that clown was talking to me. That was freaky scary.The rest of the film centers around 5 or so characters who are abducted by all costumed psycho clowns into a secret bourgeois' lair to fend off against an onslaught of clown freakazoids in a sort of torture-porn/gore-porn 70s exploitation snuff film trashy way. It's a brutal survival in extreme violence and carnage, it had a very southern hillbilly rednecks 70s 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' feel to it (Mr.Zombie emulates 70s look and the film itself is set in 1976's American Deep South).The protagonists do a good acting job and are natural, the nazi midget's acting is good too, very freaky. As for the British bourgeois they're good too. The other clowns are too, but the best one is definitely the last one with the 2 pocket knives that the protagonists face (it's the same man clown that delivered the 15-min monologue at the intro of the film). Mrs.Zombie does a decent job (Sherri Moon Zombie, Mr.Zombie's wife that partakes as a collaboration in his films as an actress).Sadly, the film is not up to par to Mr.Zombie other films. If you are easily insulted or offended, you are cautioned to not watch this or risk having nightmares. You already know what to expectStill, it's a good film, as a Mr.Zombie film. I give 7.5/10.",31
118,bwasman-30723,"Not ""good"", but lots of fun",8,19 July 2019,"Let's get two things straight right off the bat - 1) if you're watching this, you probably know who made this movie. You probably know what to expect. 2) this is not rob zombie's best. This is not close to his best. So that's been established, and now we have to look at this movie within the context of a not particularly good rob zombie movie. The result is, quite frankly, an incredibly entertaining mess. Rob's typical characteristics are present; ridiculous characters, terrible acting (especially from Sherri Moon, like usual), juvenile humor, unnecessary nudity, and lots of blood.
You've got your 5 generic, flat characters, the ""survivors"", who are dropped in a generic ""survive for 12 hours while people try to murder you"" situation. The fun here comes from the 6 ""heads"" who are sent to kill these guys - you've got a perverted Latino Nazi midget, two perverted psychotic clowns, a giant German guy with long hair, goggles, a spiked bat, and a tutu, a... Harley Quinn/that one Blade Runner replicant type lady, and then Richard Brake, who I'll get to later. These guys are so over the top and absurd that it's hilarious and it's a great time watching them be absolutely insane. Also, the set design is quite good, being basically a creepy dilapidated warehouse/factory/carnival/the bathroom from saw. We run into some problems when it comes to the camera work that looks like it was strapped to one of those WWE guys and the lighting that can give non-epileptics seizures - this makes it sometimes difficult to tell what the heck is even happening. Thankfully, there's a satisfying amount of blood and gore and brutality for a gorehound like myself, and if that's what you're looking for, you'll have a good time. The kills can be seriously brutal and it's fantastic.
There's also Malcolm McDowell and some other creepy old rich people playing the game/narrating/betting on the characters and some naked girls for the sake of there being naked girls. I love Malcolm McDowell but these parts aren't anything to write home about.
The big reason, aside from the gore, to watch this movie is Richard Brake as Doom-Head, the final killer with a perfect record that's good at his job. The movie starts out with a six minute monologue from him that's just amazing before he murders a priest (although I still don't know what his story is?) and then he isn't seen again till the last half hour. But this last half hour is brilliant. We see Doom-Head getting ready, killing some people, being ridiculously cool and quotable, etc. and then comes the final showdown. Interestingly, Rob Zombie waits till the very end to deliver what we (fans of work) know he can do - craft a genuinely excellent scene. The music (it's Aerosmith), Richard Brake's facial expression, the camera angles, the timing, the cliff hanger ending, it's all surprisingly perfect.
I watched this movie once when it came out and knew Brake was the star but I didn't remember until I rewatched it just how great of a character Doom-Head really is. He's the best Joker that never happened aside from Willem Dafoe. He's just, man, just watch the movie and get through the middle even if you don't care. Hell, you can doze off from the first kill to the last half hour knowing the basic premise and it's still amazing.
Yes, it's not a good movie. But what were you expecting? Go in expecting blood, absurdity, and all the things you like about Rob's movies, and you'll be entertained. Go in expecting a legitimate plot, good cinematography, rich character development, and, well, a good movie and you'll be disappointed. And for the love of god if you are not familiar with Rob Zombie do not watch this movie because you will hate it and you will not get that there's nothing to get and you will be disgusted and probably offended and you will leave a bad review.",31
119,recklesscow,A mashup of Zombie's greatest hits.,8,10 March 2017,"You've gotta hand it to Rob Zombie: no matter how many complaints he gets about his tropes, the man uncompromisingly refuses to alter his style and continues to churn out tonally similar films as a F.U. to those who bash anything with his name on it. The man has shown he has zero you-know-whats to give when it comes to his ""haters"" and, over a decade and 6 films into his career, you should know by now whether he's your cup of tea.""31"" continues to expand on the ""white trash horror"" trope we've all come to expect from Mr. Zombie, focusing almost as a showcase for his greatest hits, if you will. There's the repulsive characters with foul mouths who look like they haven't bathed in five years, the grimy sets, the over-the-top gore, a pulsing soundtrack evened out with some 70s rock hits, shaky cam, extreme close-ups, his wife, 8mm-style footage...name anything in more than one of his films and it's here.This time around we get: the sheer insanity and crazy kaleidoscopic colors of ""House of 1000 Corpses"", the grittiness and desert locations of ""The Devil's Rejects"", the violence of his ""Halloween"" films, and the lens flares and stylish shots from ""The Lords of Salem"", which Zombie has thankfully chosen to revisit here on a few occasions. Oh, and it all takes place on...Halloween! Like I said, this literally plays out like a ""Best Of"" showcase incorporating elements from all of his previous films. Given that, there's something that should be obvious by now: if you didn't care for any of his previous films, your mind still won't be swayed by this one. But that's the beauty of it for his fans: they know what to expect and Rob continues to deliver it.I would argue that this film is well-directed and I imagine that would elicit a few shocks, but so what? The truth of the matter is that Rob has visited these streets so often that it should be clear by now he knows exactly what he's doing. The man overwhelmingly makes a particular style of film--one many people fail to connect with--and I would argue he does it well. Over the years, he has managed to create a style all his own, to the point I'd argue anyone familiar with horror would be able to pick out a Rob Zombie film if it didn't have his name on it. That's the beauty of directors like Argento, Zombie, Bava, Tarantino, etc.: that even if you don't like their work, you can almost immediately identify it. Some may balk at me lumping him in with those greats, but tell me, how many modern horror directors have such a distinct style associated with them that you can actually pick them out from the herd of other horror directors all making endless cookie cutter mainstream fare? For every James Wan, there's directors making jump-scare films with no personality to them--faceless directors you wouldn't be able to distinguish between had the credits not told you. Zombie, love him or hate him, does not fall into that category.Is this a perfect film? No. As usual, Rob's dialogue remains his weakest link in the creative chain, but his visuals remain spot-on. Oh, it's all shaky cam, you say? Nonsense. He has developed a distinct use of color and utilizes his aspect ratio admiringly well on some shots, showing he CAN make a conventional ""beautiful"" horror film should he want to--and indeed ""The Lords of Salem"" is the closest he's ventured in that direction--but, for most of the running time, chooses to disorient the viewer with crazy angles, hellish images, and the always-present feeling of being dirty. I still can't watch a Rob Zombie film without wanting to shower afterwards.What did I enjoy about this one? I loved the pacing, I dug the 70s tracks and the thumping music during the suspenseful bits, I appreciated his willingness to revisit the beautiful lens flares and stylish shots from ""The Lords of Salem"", I admired the desert scenery and the homages to his past work (the abduction scene is immediately reminiscent of the one in ""House of 1000 Corpses"") and I thought his long takes of dialogue and close-ups really fleshed out his style on this one.For those that care, there's also a definite ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" vibe going on here that I dug.So non-fans, sorry: this isn't the one that will sway you and it's looking increasingly unlikely that film will ever come unless Rob completely alters his approach. For those that enjoyed his past work (even just one of them), there may be something for you here.Keep on rockin', Mr. Zombie. I can always count on you to put on a good show. In the theater, of course. I haven't listened to your music...",31
120,TheBigSnack,Draconian Pop Wars,10,30 December 2016,I've been to '31' but I've never been to me is my new 70's song lyric that coincides with Sheri Moon Zombie and her pantomime circus dance troupe on the road - in a van.Sheri Moon Zombie the perfect or perfectionist protagonist has double spooned her way to very humiliating company and become the butt side of an uncomfortable joke.The joke takes the form of a neoclassical rococo game of chances using layers of hostages as homicidal game pieces.These pawns must successfully eliminate the other to effectuate a winning bet.An air is maintained of high prestige combined with total absurdity during an elite function that entertains gory consequences.No feat is an underachievement and all superior graces are tempered with outright impetuous brutality.Any friends 'just hold on' to each other like they are going out of style inside of a soap opera blood-fest.I wish to give this candy corn extravaganza all due praise. I will not deny any credulity to it's sadistic ending.,31
121,LongLiveTheNewFlesh27,"Not Zombie's greatest film, but far from being his worse.",6,23 April 2017,"Rob Zombie's movies can be at best disturbing, brutal and deliciously entertaining, and at worst annoying, goofy and tedious. The films House of 1,000 Corpses and it's sequel The Devils Rejects perfectly show off the best and worst of Zombie's filmmaking. I found House of 1,000 Corpses to be shrill and irritating from beginning to end, with not enough gore or tension to make the watch bearable. The Devil's Rejects is the polar opposite. It's gritty, disgusting and thrilling, with characters that I previously couldn't be interested less in suddenly becoming fascinating. 31 has traits from both The Devil's Rejects and House of 1,000 Corpses, and what Zombie pulls together is a mixed, yet entertaining, watch. The story is very Zombie-esque, following a group of carnies who are kidnapped by rich people who bet on their lives as round after round of murderous clowns attack them. The premise itself is enough to show up in the theater, and the film definitely starts out promisingly with a creepy black and white monologue from the scariest killer of the bunch, Doom Head. The intensity of that scene doesn't exactly carry through for the rest of the film, and neither does the quality of cinematography. Zombie takes on a shaky, hand-held look that occasionally undermines some potentially great scenes of horror, but it's no where near the worst shaky cam I've ever seen, and it also sometimes works to the film's benefit. Where Zombie excels, and lords over some of his horror peers (Cough cough Eli Roth), is in the visceral horror department. He knows how to make your stomach drop to the floor. The Devil's Rejects is one long experiment in viscerally disgusting horror, and that's part of what makes it so great. There are definitely some great moments of visceral horror in this film that I won't spoil.My biggest problems with the film have to do with the way it resolved, and some of our main characters. It leaves you feeling a bit unsatisfied at the end, and wishing for a more epic-ly gory finish to such a continuously violent movie. Our main characters aren't exactly likable, especially Sheri Moon Zombie's, who hasn't been exactly great in a Zombie movie since The Devil's Rejects, where she had the right balance of shrill and psycho, and none of them are really fleshed out in any way. It makes me wish a little that Rob Zombie would try using characters who aren't carnies for once. All in all, I was entertained throughout the duration of this film. Is it great? Nu-uh, but it's still a fun, if flawed, addition to the Zombie canon. Keep it up Rob!",31

It's more of the same from his other movies but as the little tricks get old it is also very boring.I think this is the most boring bloody gore movie I have ever seen. Despite the terrifying environment, the classic cat & mouse situation and what else, Zombie manages to create characters nobody cares about. Not if they are victims, killers, getting murdered, escape, die a gory death or get killed off screen. You watch but it just doesn't matter. It is a complete waste of time.The movie drags, seems to go nowhere and then it is over and you realize it really didn't go anywhere at all.Whatever made Zombie movies interesting is now something from the past. In the music business you would call him a one day fly or a one hit wonder. But I don't see any future in Rob Zombie directions anymore.",31

Its nowhere near as good as Devils Rejects, Rob Zombies white trash dialog may have lost its freshness and the action is so poorly filmed its hard to follow. But there is a lot to enjoy for fans, from the crazy characters to gorgeous almost ""Hobo With A Shotgun"" style colors. Also there is Richard Brake as Doomhead.

130,solun-1,Sad to say this but it is disappointing,3,27 November 2016,"The story is normal for a horror movie and most of the actors are good but everything else just sucks.The camera work is shitty because when there is action, you cannot see anything as it moves like crazy so they cover up the fact that they did not have a better budget or people to orchestrate better killing scenes.Also the first half of the movie is really boring, fortunately the second half is kind of watchable.Even though the actors are good, some of them are extremely unlikeable for their characters and should have played either a different role in the film or not be in it at all. I think actors of some of the good side and bad side characters should have been switched.I expected a bit more from Rob Zombie as I loved his Devil's Rejects.This is not really a review or at least not a good one but I just wanted so summarize my thoughts after watching it to kind of warn others not to expect too much of a horror movie. You will not be afraid unless you are 10 years old and the gore in this film is really low level, I am really surprised it is rated R. Anyways, those are my thoughts and I recommend to try some other movie.",31
131,harmisjack,"Rob Zombie called this his ""most brutal film to date""",9,5 September 2016,"And boy is it ever so brutal!After the his previous film, ""The Lords of Salem"" was met with disappointment from a majority of Rob Zombie fans and horror fans alike for being ""different than a typical Rob Zombie film"". Rob organized a crowdfunding campaign that promised his fan-base and horror fans that his latest feature ""31"" would be a return to his brutal, grindhouse, blood soaked, gritty style he is known for. The premise is simple: On the night of Halloween eve, a group of carnival workers are brutally killed and 5 workers are kidnapped by a gang of goons and taken to a secluded industrial compound known as ""Murderworld"", where the victims are forced to participate in a violent hack and slash game known as '31' for 12 hours before they are set free should any of them survive the brutal mayhem to come. Once the game gets underway, the action never stops! Starting with the interesting group of characters there is; Roscoe Pepper (Jeff Phillips), a mechanical handyman who cares for his group and will do anything to defend them and keep them alive. Venus Virgo (Meg Foster), an occasionally strong competitor in the group. Charly (Sherri Moon Zombie), a dancer for the group who toughens up as the game progresses farther. Panda Thomas (Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs) a tough starting competitor, but softens up as the game progresses. And last there is Levon (Kevin Jackson) who is said to be Panda's brother, but other than that doesn't do or add much for the group. The characters are each engaging with their distinct personalities that give more than enough reason to sympathize and root for. Next we have the brutally obnoxious psychotic clowns known as 'The Heads' who are released at different times during the game, and are a blast to watch, especially Doom-Head (Richard Brake) who is the ultimate weapon of that group! This is where the blood soaked action starts and never stops, and is a blast to watch from start to finish until the game is over! That said, is it a groundbreaking masterpiece? Certainly not, nor is it meant to be. If you are a big fan of Rob Zombie's films, especially The Devil's Rejects, then this is one you definitely shouldn't miss! If you generally dislike Rob's films, but love horror, you probably won't like this movie either but should give it a watch at least once! 9/10 + Incredible inclusion of 70's hard rock and classical soundtrack + Colorful characters + Amazing atmosphere - Room for some character development",31

133,meredithkemble,"If you like Zombie's other films, this is more of the same",6,7 November 2016,"31 was really hyped up after being crowdfunded and Zombie's claims that it would be more grisly than any of this previous films. As a gore-hound, this claim absolutely interested me. Who doesn't want to see the next, grossest thing? Well, this film was definitely grisly, but I wouldn't put it above any of his other films.Zombie's films are generally hit or miss for me, and this film did not really impress me or disgust me. It has all the basics of a Rob Zombie film: gross sexuality, gore, silly lines and characters. My biggest complaint is that the film takes itself too seriously. If you're going to feature a knife-wielding Nazi midget, you need to embrace the camp factor in a way Zombie generally does not. I felt the whole film was too serious, particularly the ending.That being said, while 31 was not as good as The Devil's Rejects, I did enjoy it more than House of 1000 Corpses or Zombie's Halloween re-imagining. Basically, you already know if this film is for you or not. If you like sexualized and gratuitous gore, or other Zombie movies, then you'll like this just fine. If you're looking for something more tame, or easier to follow, then look elsewhere.",31
134,sean-rae,Disappointing from Zombie,3,18 September 2016,"to be expected from Rob Zombie, not the best dialogue in the world, unlikable protagonists you want to die, Sheri moon zombie trying and the feeling of wishing he would get to the point. i loved 'House of 1000 corpses' & 'Devil's rejects' is one of my favorite horror films of all time. The only other of Zombie's films that even touches on those films in my opinion is 'Halloween' with the plot of killer clowns playing a totally crazy game of cat and mouse i thought such a simple story arc would be fun and playful horror, But Zombie tries something that i felt just fell flat on it's face. Almost cringy to watch at times, Nazi Clown midgets, c'Mon man... Still a strong director but a terrible writer. This film should be used as evidence to Zombie that he cannot carry a film on his own, if he hired a couple of writers to spoon feed him decent characters for his 'plot' then you could potentially get some decent horror movies. or at least seem satisfying dialogue. or maybe he should just stick to making the antagonist the main point of view, that way the script makes sense. over all, was looking forward to a night of madness , in stead got a student film on crack shot in a sweatshop.",31

136,jamiedecourley,Here we go again..,6,19 September 2016,"Rob Zombie dips back into his same old over-stylized bag of tricks to bring us his newest production. While Rob has certainly honed his skill behind the camera, once again his amateur writing ability and failure to explore original ideas leave '31' tasting like a bottle of soda someone left the cap off of overnight. The plot is best described as 'Hostel'/'Saw' meets 'The Running Man' wrapped in Zombie's own special brand of disgustingly low brow levity. The dialogue is so much the same as Rob's usual fodder that you'll often forget Bill Moseley and Sid Haig sat this one out. Every underdeveloped character takes their turn at spouting out pathetic attempts at pretentious thought soaked in hillbilly mop water. It's supposed to remind of us the restroom in a 5 star restaurant ..but sadly, it often comes off more like a port-a-potty outside a Taco Bell. That being said, it's fun, shot well and probably better than 75% of everything else that horror can claim on it's 2016 charter. My predictions, Zombie fans will hail it as a new instant classic, old school horror hounds will trash it, and most of us will just accept it for what it is.. Another almost good film from an aging rock star director with a horrible actress for a wife. 6 out of 10 for me.",31

IFC makes better horror flicks than this. Sheri Moon is one of the worst actresses out there if she wasn't his wife do you think she would play in any movies ""NOPE"" not even an IFC movie lol.

139,marcwiechmann,Another Zombie Letdown,5,19 October 2016,"As so many others, I too was excited about ""31"" and could not wait to finally watch it. Maybe it was that high expectations, that was part of my disappointment, but I am not willed to explain everything that was wrong in the movie with that premise.I have to say, before I write about the movie itself, that I never shared the opinion of those, who see Rob Zombie basically as the horror messiah, who will reinvent the genre. He basically had 2 good movies (Devil's Rejects, Halloween), all other movies were pretty bad. House of 1000 Corpses was a ridiculously bad B-movie, Halloween 2 was bad even for a film school student, and those few parts that were good in Lords of Salem were copied from other movies. First Halloween reboot was only good, because he had a rich franchise with tons of information to build on.He gets the look every time, I'll give him that, and I won't even make fun about how a grown up man calls himself ""Zombie"", but the content of his movies is a major letdown every single time. I'd never thought to say this, but in terms of innovative horror movies, I prefer Eli Roth before Zombie every day.Rob is an awesome musician, and yes, maybe even a good director. But he is an horrible screenplay writer with no idea how to develop characters and dialogues. No wonder, all characters in ""31"" are superficial clichés with no debt, talking horrible stupid stuff, that is meant to sound smart. The ""Doomhead"" being so obviously being a Heath Ledger's Joker tribute just confirms that. Basically the most interesting character in the movie is a (bad) rip-off. And did he really need the slo-mo clap? That was so bad, I was close to turn off the TV.Also,he really should stop to cast his wife for every female lead. If not married to him, she would never have become an actress, at least not in a main role. I don't care if she is hot (I by the way don't think so, she is SO skinny and looks old for her age), I care about acting skills.Maybe, if Rob could direct a movie with a screenplay written by an experienced and talented writer...? But this way, letting him do whatever he wants, we get movies like ""31"".So, the protagonists get abducted and sent into an Arena, to fight to death with some clowns with freaky names (Doomhead, Deathhead, Bashhead, and so on...). That's pretty much all, no more exposition or plot details. Why? No idea, and the movie does not care about explaining anything - being sick is basically it's only excuse and motivation. ""Why do they do this?"" ""Because they have sick minds"". ""Aha. And why does Doomhead what he does? Does he get paid BIG time?"" ""Ah, he is sich minded"". ""What is special about Doomhead at all? To me does not look any more dangerous than the rest of the freaks?"" ""Ah, he is even sicker as them"". And so on. A few freaky characters get shown, some people die, mainly by blade weapons, until an, in my opinion, pretty stupid ending. Okay, there is some gore in the movie, which I appreciated. I did like the characters, even if superficial - but this made the movie even worse, because you are interested - but don't get any answers or backgrounds.I also liked the Soundtrack a lot, I love all this 60s and 70s music, and it blended in nicely. But the overall execution was just bad - ridiculous fighting choreographies, that gave me the impression, everything in this movie was filmed by first take (maybe they wanted to proudly say that they shot the movie in 31 days or something like this), especially the text passages of Sheri Moon Zombies. Man, stop letting her talk - no expression, no motivation, no acting. At all.So, what can I say? I give 4/10, 4 points for having interesting characters (who never get developed in any way), a good soundtrack, some gore and a good colour correction).But can I recommend this? Gosh, no, I cannot. I have still hope for Rob Zombie, and I will see his next movie. But if this will be bad again, I am out of the Zombie business, because by then he will have delivered 3 bad movies in a row - in my world more than enough to lose my respect permanently.Sorry, Zombie fans - I know you have another opinion and will probably flame me, but this is my personal view. In my eyes, ""31"" is a disappointing letdown. There could have been so much more, this could have been such a good movie. But for that another director or at least screenplay writer would have been necessary.Maybe next time.",31

But 31 is my favorite horror trope (deadliest game!!) so I decided to force my way through.Doom Head's speech is what starts the film off and boy, I gotta admit I was PUMPED. Scary, interesting, gory with depth -- it promised so much. He ain't clown! He's not here to brighten your dismal day. He's not here to elicit an amused response. But he's going to tell you a story so the CRUNCH of your body isn't the last sound you hear before he sends you to the pearly gates with a first class ticket.It's terrifying. It's funny. It's grim and it's brutal. If he's our villain, I'm fully on board and writing Rob Zombie an apology letter for every horrible thing I ever said about him.What did I get instead?A little person dressed as Hitler who likes to rape people.

142,carloenrico-salvadori,Rob shows Hardcore Henry how it's done,9,21 January 2017,"I should preface this review by confessing I am a little biased, Rob Zombie being my favourite contemporary American horror director. Having said that, this is probably not his best work, but I still consider it high quality stuff. From the initial monologue of killer guru Doom-Head, to the role reverse of Devil's Rejects, where the 2005 slayers fall preys of Mc Dowell and his acolytes mischievous crew. It seems to me that Rob here wanted to strike back at the unwarranted invasion of video games in the horror genre, exemplified by Hardcore Henry in particular, by creating a product with the pace and the villains of a video game and at the same time the cinematic art and the vintage setting of the seventies which you can find in almost all his other movies. The video game part is therefore dependent upon the rules of cinema and not vice versa as in the aforementioned title. The slayers are absolutely great, the nazi Mexican midget being the cherry on top. IMHO I'd give it seven/ eight stars but I added another one desperately trying to boost the rating.",31

Nope, this is just a damn fine stroke book.

145,darkwave2000,Better than I expected.,7,1 January 2017,"After Lords Of Salem, the bar was set pretty low, so, I didn't think this was too bad.The good: The big theater was cool and lit really nice. The three captor characters in the powdered wigs was a nice, creepy touch. Rob Zombie really likes using full frontal nudity a lot now, so, there were young, nude women walking around which is always good.I thought the little person, Nazi guy was gonna be lame, but, when he spoke Spanish, I liked it. It added another layer to the disorientation of his scenes.The music was really good, reminded me of music from The Exorcist and John Carpenter's The Thing.Other reviews said the blood effect looked fake. I thought they were damn good. A lot of the wounds kept bleeding in subsequent shots. I don't know if it was done practical or cgi, but, you don't see that a lot in these movies.The bad: I didn't realize these people worked for a carnival. The dialogue was supposed to explain this, but, it would've been nice to see some shots of a carnival being broke down to go to the next town, or something, and then show the RV with the 31 characters driving away.Sherri is like the same character in any of Rob's movies. I was waiting for her to say, ""Tootie f*ckin' fruitie."" any minute.The sets were lit cool and the the dripping water and filthy floors worked, but, the walls and ceilings looked too clean, except for the bathroom set. Maybe less lighting of the upper areas in the factories would've helped.When they're eating and Charly discovers, I guess, they're eating parts of their dead friend, but, there's no obvious parts of his body missing that would account for the big buffet of food on the table. His legs weren't shown, so, maybe that's where all of the meat came from. LOL The ending was bad. I expected Capt. Spaulding to roll up, ala House Of 1000 Corpses and then Joker Jr. rolls up with some re-recording of Dream On playing. I guess Stephen Tyler did a solo version or something. Anyway, Charly looks like she's about to collapse and suddenly she's ready for a royal rumble with Doomhead? Not buying it.All in all not bad for a low budget flick, but, I hope Zombie does something on par with Devil's Rejects or a really cool remake, like, Soylent Green or Logan's Run.",31

Even the people that don't have a seizure don't like it. I don't know why but it really ticked me off they did that. It's cheap and dangerous and just made the movie way worse than it already is.Do not waste your time with this movie it's horrible Just had to share my thoughts.,31
150,danielbeaman,Don't Waste Your Time,1,20 June 2019,"I generally enjoy Rob Zombie flicks, but ""31"" was a chore to get through.
The villains are supposed to be scary (I think) but they just come across as boring and idiotic.
There's absolutely nothing interesting about the ""heros"", for lack of a better word.
Basically what we have here is what seems to be another Rob Zombie movie for his wife to ""act"" in (and yes, it's in quotations because Sheri Moon Zomboe is a terrible actress), a bunch of his regular actors and friends to maybe make a little money, and an excuse to make a bloody, gory, horror fest (but it just doesn't deliver).",31
151,Darktragedy,I liked it...just some good fun with Doom Head!,9,4 April 2018,"I've seen this twice, and I do like Rob Zombie movies, so I'm a little biased. I love the characters. Doom Head is creepy, calculating and just messed up enough to enjoy. The other characters that come into the game are there long enough to just get a taste of what they are like, and that's long enough to leave you wanting more of them.The gore is there, the action, the wonky characters. I thought the movie had a great pace to it. I would watch it again, just because there are so many bad movies out right now, I know this would entertain me again. If you liked Devil's Rejects or House of 1,000 Corpses, this is for you. If you haven't seen those, this might be a little too much, go back and start with House of 1, 000 Corpses. Overall, thumbs up, can't wait for 3 From Hell!",31
152,duncancorbin,Could've Been A Video Game,1,26 April 2020,"I remember feeling excited as the film started, this was claimed to be Rob Zombies masterpiece! However, after the killing begins, I felt nothing short of disappointment. 31 would've been more entertaining if it was a video game than a film with the action being nothing more than one-on-one fights. The violence felt bland, the acting felt over dramatic, the editing and cinematography were NOTHING like Devils Rejects (my favorite Zombie film), and I felt disappointed in the end. All of this hype was for nothing.",31
153,eternitycomplex,May be the single most stupid movie I've ever seen...,1,11 October 2016,"and I love trashy, weird cinema.This movie just reiterates what those of us unfortunate enough to have seen Rob Zombie's Halloween learned in 2007: Rob Zombie is an uninspired, painfully derivative one-trick pony.One of the reasons I decided to watch 31 is because I just saw a very insightful 30-minute YouTube documentary called ""How Rob Zombie Killed the Halloween Franchise"". It's really well made and paints Rob Zombie in a very negative light by showcasing several conflicting interviews he's given over the years and eventually condemning him as someone who butchered ""Halloween"" for little more than a paycheck.I thought I might give him one more chance to prove to me that he could do something other than his standard ""trashy people get murdered by trashier psychopaths"" genre. Wow. Nothing could have prepared me for how stupid 31 would be.Rob Zombie thinks that if he makes his characters sleazy and they have a reckless attitude toward the threat of death the resulting movie will be ""cool"" and ""badass"". Unfortunately that's just not the case. It just comes off as STUPID. Combine that with a nonsensical, pretty much non-existent plot and now you're talking MEGA STUPID. Combine that with his wife's acting and you've got...THE SINGLE MOST STUPID MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN.",31

155,BatesMT,It's Nothing New.,5,14 October 2016,"Let me just say I like RZ. House of 1k Corpses is great, and The Devil's Rejects is one of my all time favorite films, hands down.What we have in ""31"" is an attempt to mash together aspects of TDR and his Halloween remake and the result is a confusing, lackluster ride you've already been on.The problem is you don't feel for any of the characters. There is not one likable character, sans Doom-Head, who is nearly the only bright spot in this movie. Sherry, was better in this film than in past RZ movies, but that isn't saying much.Another issue I had was how this was hyped up as maniacs dressed up as clowns, which is great, clowns are creepy right? The concept art for the characters especially Sick-Head and Death-Head were amazing. What we got on screen were absolute jokes compared to what we should have gotten. The all but did away with the clown gimmick especially if you look at the concept art.The opening scene is by far the best in the movie, and honestly one of the best scenes RZ has ever directed. But don't let it fool you, the rest of the movie goes downhill from there.As you can expect from a RZ movie, it's got that dirty 70's feel, every other line of dialogue is profanity, more so than usual actually, the setting is run of the mill for RZ, and while I could go on, if you have seen a RZ film, than you have already seen a better version of this film.The score and soundtrack however are delightful in an otherwise grim movie. RZ needs to get back to basics and let someone help him write his scripts. He's got talent and a good eye, but his dialogue is way too over the top and downright cliché at this point. It takes you out of the movie.",31

159,tootyfnfruity,Rob Zombie doing his thing,7,24 May 2020,"This film gets a lot of negative feedback, but I have to disagree. Zombie makes horror films - not family friendly scary films or date night blockbusters. With Zombie you always get his movie. He doesn't conform to Hollywood standards to please the critics. He makes what his fans love, and that is hardcore, brutal, insane horror.31 is a horrific tale full of violence and depravity. It's beautifully shot and at times reminded of 1000 Corpses in the way the cinematography helped tell the story. We've all seen films where a group is kidnapped and forced into some kind of game to the death orchestrated by a madman. Well Zombie puts his stamp on this. He makes it his own and you know it's his. The dialogue written is great as usual for his films - it's funny and it's realistic. The gore is extreme. The characters are original and their costumes are great. Some true art went in to creating these characters and costumes. It was very cool. The violence is uncomfortable. Zombie does a great job as always at invoking that sense of dread and uncomfortableness. It's Zombie at his most brutal and hardcore.",31
160,davidpodmore,Terrible in so many ways,1,8 October 2016,"I think it's obvious now that Devil's Rejects is going to be the only decent film this guy does. Everything else has been terrible. Why he continues to keep putting his wife as the main role when she cannot act is beyond me. Her attempt at acting scared and acting, just in general, is laughable. She can only pass anything resembling acting when she was being evil in his 2 first films. he seems to think she is beautiful by he way he portrays her in his films but maybe 10 years ago yeah, not now. The dialogue is so contrived and fake and it worked in his first 2 films but not anymore. It's like he is trying to be like Tarantino but the actors and dialogue just fall flat. Oh and again the tired old pyramid with the one eye showing up. What you trying to do Rob? DO NOT WATCH THIS GUY'S FILMS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",31

162,tanveer4899,Nothing Could be Awful than this one,1,27 September 2016,"there was lot of talking and bragging about this film but its a huge disappointment. we saw lot of movies with the same plot like Texas chainsaw massacre etc and those were awesome and this could be lot better if Rob zombie could choose actors wisely.. when you decided to make a movie about psychopaths then you should saw The shining...The Devide... etc but the basic thing about a movie is acting and Rob zombie chose very poorly, that means you have no sense and vision about making a film. its not necessary to cast your wife in every movie you make, when you did not cast Sid haig you could easily skip your wife and other poor performers. overall this film was worse than most B grade movies",31
163,dmiller-10701,All in all I was entertained,6,29 September 2016,"I think I went into this movie with the right attitude of knowing it wasn't going to be anything near great, because it sure was not great. I do think it was somewhat good. Not really. It was somewhat entertaining enough for me to not regret it. I did like this movie for what it was. It'll just go into the category of interesting horror movies I have watched but wouldn't say oh hey I gotta watch it again.This movie could have been much better if it had a larger budget, better actors/actresses, and a longer run time to allow character development.I didn't like how the killers didn't really accomplish much killing. Maybe having less killers or more kidnapped carnies would of been better. All the killers seemed interesting but we never got enough time with them to really enjoy a performance. The squad just powered right through the next 4 after Sickhead. I also didn't like the lack of gore. I thought this movie would be disgusting(in a good way) and over the top with its kills, but it wasn't at all. I also didn't like all the hype about this movie, which is why I came in saying this won't be great. The word had seemed to spread around about it being delayed because it was too disgusting and it wasn't at all. And the word of someone copied the heath ledger joker made me not want to see this. It was just one of those movies that you can tell by the rumors that it won't be great.What I did like though was the characters. Despite not having any development and a reason to care, I found all the killers visually entertaining. A Spanish Nazi killer clown midget is just crazy, but still kind of fun. The rest of the characters all seemed to have more to them but we were just never able to experience it. I also really enjoyed Doom Head. As stated before the idea that he was heath ledger's joker just made me angry, and everyone that told me that was dead wrong. While still crazy in a way, he was a very different character. I thought his character was pretty good for the most part. Having his scenes come in was like a breath of not so stale air. It kind of picked up the pace and the interest of the movie. I don't think any actor/actress's character was great but I think he was on the better side.",31
164,unsleepinghorror,"Movie Review: 31 (2016), directed by Rob Zombie",3,29 May 2017,"Rob Zombie knows no restraint. His directing style was ill-suited for a remake of Carpenter's methodical Halloween; a better fit for his own properties. Even then, I wonder if he hasn't spent his effectiveness.31 will ultimately be compared to movies like The Running Man and Battle Royale. It won't last in anyone's memory as long, however. The overly familiar premise is an excuse for gore and vile antics, but Zombie tries so desperately to shock that it's aggravating to watch. ""Sex and death are on their way,"" says Malcolm McDowell, in character. That sums up the entire movie. To be fair, Zombie isn't attempting high art, but when you begin a movie with a Kafka quote it only accentuates the lack of depth found thereafter.The opening scene drones with the duration of a Tarantino monologue, and none of the wit or tension. At least it is a showpiece for actor Richard Brake, giving his all as the villainous Doom-Head; wasted on tedious dialogue. We proceed to meet the main cast, a circus troupe crowded into a van in search of a place to set up their act. The characterization is thin and the humor embarrassingly overt. Yeah, yeah – everyone's genitals are sopping wet or ready to burst. Someone failed to realize that the quiet moment where one of these characters sits eating popcorn while wearing a gorilla mask is more amusing than a ceaseless stream of dick jokes.Before long, this lot is waylaid by men in clown masks and taken as prisoners. Some of them are immediately killed because they're even less interesting than those who are inducted into a sadistic game of life and death by a group of aristocrats in powdered wigs, played charmingly by their English actors (which includes Malcolm McDowell, whom I already mentioned). What ensues is predictable, one-note sadism sprawled out via Nazi imagery, numerous mentions of rape, and unrestrained violence. I don't condemn the use of any of these atrocities in a film, I question why the execution feels so disingenuous in this particular film.I guess my expectations are too high, considering such enriching dialogue as, ""we're gonna f*** all your holes."" And the fact that a couple minutes later I was treated to a reiterative list of each hole to be f***ed. I know it's asking a lot, but was no one available to proofread the script? ""You're falling for her,"" does not mean you're falling for her lies, it implies love. ""I certainly hope we'll see a better showing from the remaining remnants."" Excuse me, but a remnant is already, by definition, a thing that remains.I don't want to talk about the characters. Rather, I can't. There aren't any. Just an indistinct, soulless mass, sticky with blood and semen, dragged to its lousy death by a lazy puppeteer.You might find pleasure in fetishized violence; admittedly, the special effects are above average. Maybe you also fancy shameless perversion and wish you'd painted the entrance of your home to look like a vagina and crowned it with a neon sign that reads: ""wet kitty.""Horror need not be subtle but it absolutely must fulfill what it aims to achieve. Horrific? Savage? Only half-heartedly. Rob Zombie has no apparent interest in new tricks, regardless of how transparent his technique has become. 31 is a miserable film, never as ""cool"" as it pretends to be. Built exclusively on cheap thrills. Too bad I wasn't thrilled.Verdict: Not For Me, Maybe For YouFor more horror review check out http://unsleepinghorror.com/",31
165,pattorrus,Awesome film,10,14 March 2018,The movie was very good and entertaining I love the whole murder world plot. Rob zombie once again has done something brilliant to entertain his fan base. As always on this dreadful site a lot of dreadful people crying that the movie was very horrible just proves to you that the population is garbage seriously though why do stupid people still watch something if they hate it it just a bunch of lousy no good turds that all.

167,Marshal_Law,Yet another abysmal movie from Rob Zombie,1,16 September 2016,"As juvenile as calling a grown man ""Zombie"" this is yet another awkward embarrassing adolescent amateurish annoying movie from this clueless guy. His wife at the center of it, yet again making ""deranged"" expressions trying to be as sleazy as possible but with the zero talent of a non-actress,doesn't help it either. Nope, this man can't get it right even by mere chance. He's still all pose. Like a tribute band of 70's/80's horror movies who get the look (kind of) but can't play worth a crap. By the time a terrible little man actor dressed as a Nazi/clown listens to real Hitler speech records was time to turn this garbage of. You see even the vague feeling that this drivel was in this way connected to such a terrible event in history was so sad and stupid i had to quit. Because this exactly what a Rob Zombie movie is , a dwarf actor dresses as a Nazi made up as a clown to be shocking and bizarre just for the sake of shocking and bizarre, and the results are of course pathetic. Oh boy, somewhere there's talented people who can't find money to produce their movie and this hack has already made 7 or something like that. Pisses me off.",31
168,zen_blend,Pathetic.,1,6 December 2016,"I rarely ever write reviews, and this isn't a review so much as it is a warning, this movie... I hate to even call it that, as it feels like an insult to every movie ever made, but yeah, this film is awful, not because it is gory, gruesome or unsettling... it's just shitty, poorly conceived and executed even worse.This movie is not good enough to be worthy of being called terrible. It lacks ... EVERYTHING that makes a good movie good, or even makes a movie a movie, seriously. I wish I could get my 90 minutes back.I loved Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween, I thought it was a great film, I kept checking out his later works in hopes he would make something similar, but most of his other films I've found to be immature, pompous and devoid of creativity or imagination.I am not squeamish about the brutality or violence portrayed in his films, I am just annoyed by the utter lack of anything else. His films almost always leave me with the feeling that I wasted another hour and a half hoping that Rob Zombie would mature as a film maker and create something powerful, thought provoking, scary or at least halfway decent. Unfortunately the only thing I find scary about his films is the thought that he actually makes money for this stupidity.This latest film, 31, is by far the worst of his ""creations"" yet, it saddens me to think that it won't be the last.. It offers the viewer absolutely nothing but scenes of torture and violence, strung together with... nothing? The attempts at plot, direction, pace and/or artistic expression fall flat on their face and are so flimsy, disjointed and classless that I am embarrassed that I actually watched this putrid pile of steaming dung until the end.Almost any film student given half the budget could have produced something 10x better then this insult to entertainment.I guess if people get off watching clowns torture and kill with chainsaws... then there is something here for them, that imagery is the entire substance of this film, it would have been better released as a book of still images. The ""plot"" is only half eluded too for some pointless reason, I guess because it was irrelevant, as was.. what I am guessing is supposed to be the twist at the end was just more signature Rob Zombie stupidity... dull, dull, dull and laughably stupid.I honestly laughed out loud as the film ended, the long and short of it, in a nutshell, is that this film is dumb, on every single level. I couldn't find one single redeeming element, scene, line, shot.... nothing, it's 100% pure dogshit.Definitely the last film of Rob Zombie's that I will waste another minute of my time on. His films have had mild success based solely on the name Rob Zombie, which I have finally come to equate with being the antithesis of creativity or artistic talent.Nothing but scenes of stabbing and chainsaw mutilation with ho-hum special effects and disposable, plastic, boring one dimensional characters, you know the ones, he uses them in almost every single film... It's like he had to TRY to make a film so empty and devoid of artistic merit, of any sort... like his goal was to make the most pointless, stupid string of chainsaw death scenes that he could and see if someone would still say it was good.0 out of 10, writing this warning was more entertaining then watching this steamer.Avoid it like the plague.",31

170,surrealsanguine,Unimaginative,2,31 July 2018,"I've always enjoyed Rob Zombie films for the unique perspective he brings to the screen. He's not good at plot but he usually does good character development and can evoke a lot of emotion in the viewer. This film was a serious disappointment. There are plot holes you can drive a truck through. It didn't make any sense at all once you start to dig into it. Thearacters are fairly uninteresting and it really felt like Zombie was just phoning it in. The dialogue and horror relied strongly on over used tropes, there was little imagination. The most interesting characters were barely developed. The whole film was a serious disappointment compared to his other works. Zombie said he was going to release a directors cut with extra scenes.... Still waiting for that to see if its any better.",31
171,bwhelveston,Do not pay to see this,2,16 September 2016,"I'll start by saying this, I know there are some that will claim ""He wasn't going for a traditional scary movie. People that don't like it just don't understand his perspective."" I'm sure that in all of the conversations they had with Mr. Zombie these points were covered and clearly they have a much better understanding than anyone else. This review is for those that have been excited about seeing this because Rob Zombie's pieces in the past have had that intense shock factor and were delivered very well. Unfortunately, this one does not. It is kind of sadistic and if you put yourself in the position of one of these actors you can imagine it would probably be terrifying. Then again, you wouldn't use poorly scripted cheesy lines and engage in badly choreographed fights. Personally, I have been looking forward to this film since I first heard about it last year and have kept myself up on the release date so as soon as it was available I could treat myself to it. I couldn't have been more disappointed. I thoroughly enjoyed his other films and would watch another if he made it. I realize fanatic Zombie lovers will disagree with me when I say this but for every one that like it there will be several that don't. I can't decide which was worse: the ending or the overall acting. I must give credit where credit is due, the intro is entertaining and you will probably enjoy Doom Head (the guy in the opening scene). Again unfortunately, he is in the movie all of about 10 minutes non-consecutively. Had the movie centered around him and a twisted hunting obsession perhaps I would be writing a very different review. The acting is over-the-top and awful. Not in the same way that some movies are so bad they're good (like Zombeavers or Axe Giant) but more like super low budget projects filmed on an iPhone. For a movie that has reasonably good quality in most scenes I was so let down to see the acting was so unrefined. It probably could have been worse, I'm just not sure how.",31
172,asawa-20086,expected a lot more!!!,3,22 October 2016,"I am a die-hard movie fan and this is my first review. I was and still am a huge fan of White Zombie. I even heard a song the other day and had to stop to take it in. I saw a copy of House of 1000 Corpses several times before I actually purchased it. I think the title turned me away, I am a huge horror movie fan but seldom does anything truly original come along. House of 1000 Corpses, Devil's Rejects, and the remake of Halloween were all awesome Rob Zombie entries. The first reboot of Halloween I had read that they limited him a bit to keep to the original story. He expanded on it brilliantly giving us more insight on Michael Myers childhood and then letting which was a great update. I think one the things that set his previous films apart is that he established the story around the individuals that you are not supposed to root for and that was refreshing. Getting to know Michael Myers' as a child and seeing a bit of what makes him tick and the story in his early films following the ""crazy"" people instead of the victim have been awesome, you actually start to root for the baddies for awhile. In to this film though! I am sorry to say that Rob Zombie tried to use part of his formula that worked so well for him in earlier films, and I really did want to like it, but I did not. It had that early 70's gritty horror film look in the beginning. So on to this film, it was not great, it was not even good. It did not establish anything new. It did not take on the view of the killers, the formula that made his films really good. It had a few moments of the gritty 70's feel in the beginning but quickly turned into a run of the mill crap-fest. Mr. Zombie please return to the thought process that made your films cutting edge and made us want to watch them...the guy stomping around ""This is hell, this is Hell!"" or this ""Who's your daddy!"" not this crap.",31
173,kb-01809,missed opportunity,5,8 December 2016,"So, a few weeks ago a friend of mine posted this poster on my wall and said we gotta go see this. I looked it up and watched the trailer and what I saw was essentially The Running Man written and directed by Rob Zombie. Needless to say I was sold. It was a Fathom Event at our local theater. One showtime on one specific day. September 1, 2016 at 7:00. We met up an hour early, had a couple drinks and caught up because we really haven't seen each other in like a year and then we wandered into the theater to watch people die. I still laugh every time I say that. Now, I never really watch horror movies. I go in phases. And every once in a while, usually around the fall or Halloween time, I get in the mood. I have a couple quintessential films I have to watch like The Descent and Sleepy Hollow (sorry, guilty pleasure). But sometimes I just like to watch people die. Bring in movies like Final Destination 2, Hostel, Saw and Saw 2, and I'm good. I'm all about the creativity that comes with killing people in interesting ways. I figure this is Rob Zombie. He made House of 1000 Corpse, The Devils Rejects which by all standards is a horror classic. Don't crucify me for it but The Devils Rejects is awesome not to mention it holds a stellar classic rock soundtrack. But what is this movie. 31. It stars a few familiar faces such as Zombies wife Sherry Moon Zombie, Richard Drake, and Alex himself Malcolm McDowell. I'm talking Alex from A Clockwork Orange if you are young and lost. It also featured EG Dailey who to this day even though she has the tendency to show up in random horror movies, I will never be able to take her seriously because aside from being one of the prostitutes who robs Ed O'Neil and Ethan Embry in Dutch, she is also the voice of Babe the Pig and Tommy Pickles. The setup is there. The promise of a brutally violent Running Man is more than enough to suck you in and the film is beautiful to look at. I mean it looks really good. But there is a problem for me. Despite looking good. Despite having a great premise and promising actors, I have to say. And it's weird saying it. Rob Zombie didn't get that creative with killing people. It's all knives and a chainsaw. I was really disappointed with creativity of the death scenes. I wanted and expected so much more. All in all, I did like it. They could easily make a franchise out of it like Hostel tried to do, but they need to think outside the box. We have all seen people get stabbed over and over again. They really screwed the pooch with the death scenes. I think this could be the next Purge in the respect that it could easily get better with future installments. Final Thoughts. I'm probably gonna go home and watch The Devils Rejects. It's definitely worth a watch but if it gets a wide release you could probably save it for home viewing. The best part of the movie was the company. Have a good night everyone.",31
174,thouncemusic,You'll know if this is for you in the first 5 min.,6,27 October 2018,"To be fair, I'll warn you. I'm a big Rob Zombie fan. I love his music, I've seen him live. I also really enjoy his movies. But, I understand how his movies aren't for everybody.This is a pretty straightforward slasher flick. I found the Kafka quote and monologue from Doom-head in the beginning to give a great idea of what this movie was going to be.While my initial impression of Sick-head was to laugh, within a few minutes the lighting and atmosphere and his confidence contrasted against the fear of the victims made him scary.This is what made Psycho-head and Schizo-head not particularly scary. At this point the victims had gained their resilience and the villains seemed more on an even playing field.For me, Richard Brake was the star in this. I wish there was more of him. Doom-head's control and obedience to the rules made him the most terrifying of them all.Rob Zombie does a good job of catching the moments in movies when you scream at characters for not having done something and fixing it. He also spends more time on his villains than his victims. Can't blame him though, who lives till the credits?It wasn't big on story but it did a great job of making an terrible circumstance a true possibility.",31

178,stormcrow225,"My quick and dirty review of Rob Zombie's ""31""",7,17 September 2016,"I'm a fan of most of Rob Zombie's movies so I went into this with proper expectations. It was a solid, typical Rob Zombie movie and, overall I liked it a lot... didn't't love it (like I love ""House of 1,000 Corpses"" or ""The Devil's Rejects"") but for me it was definitely worthwhile. Some very interest elements (particularly visually), some interesting characters in it (though not very well developed), lots of gore and some nudity (which is always a plus)... took it easy on the jump-scares (which is a major plus in my book... jump-scares are LAME and irritating)... The story was a bit weak though and (like the characters) not very well developed... You really don't get much back story and it ends up being rather surface level... Most of the acting was good (except for Sheri Moon Zombie... this might be her worst performance IMO)... In the end, I'll definitely buy it when it comesout on disc in a month and watch it more than once...",31
179,jcallen-6,Different!,7,4 February 2017,"""31"" seems to be getting the love/hate treatment quite literally. I personally found the film to be entertaining and even refreshing. Zombie's new film is not supernatural or what I would call a ""slasher""...it's unique and frightening in it's own right. ""31"" could really happen to anyone, anywhere, and at any time. The brutal, psychotic clowns and colonial cult members decide Murder World's rules and your fate. If you give ""31"" a view it's best not to compare to other horror films or even Zombie's other work. Also, to note: Richard Brake gives a terrific performance in this film as ""Doom-Head"" and seeing Malcolm McDowell is always a pleasure.",31
180,vegaxterror,"Not the Best, bet definitely better than any modern studio horror trash",8,20 October 2016,"First watch: On demandSecond Watch: In the theaterOK,So there seems to be a lot of confusion, and or hate about this film. As a Rob Zombie film fan, I can see where SOME of the criticism is coming from. Although that doesn't make every internet troll with an IMDb account Roger Ebert. I approached this how I approached the new Star Wars film, and many other films now a days. With minimum expectations. If you do that, I think you will be pleasantly surprised. I describe it to my friends as ""Surviving the Game"" meets ""the Purge"". I'm a huge running man fanboy, but I wouldn't say there is much parallel there. Zombie himself has said it is a simple premise, and it's horror so I see nothing wrong there. Is it his best film? no. Are the actors the best? No. (What horror film has good acting?) That being said I was very well entertained. If Zombie's goal was to create over the top violence, and minimum plot than he succeeded. I think this is his most brutal, gory, and bloody film yet which we were all told to expect. The character development could have been better, and is not what you should expect from House or Rejects. That being said, it was more the story and intensity which I think was the target. Any actress could have played Charly, and I do think Sheri Moon is best in her baby firefly roll. I was pleased to see Malcolm McDowell in something that wasn't a sci-fi channel film. We also need to all take in account, this was a crowd funded film shot in 20 days. We should not hold it to the height of House or Rejects for that reason alone. Rob basically made this on a whim ""in between"" trying to get his Broad Street Bullies film off the ground. All of that taken in to account I was pleasantly surprised. People are getting over analytical about the editing, kill yourself. I highly doubt anyone on a forum, can shoot, direct, or edit better than Rob Zombie and his team (even if they think they can). When I read these ""Another Zombie turd"" comments, I wonder. If you did not like any of his films then why do you keep watching them? The funny thing about people like that is, I bet they will all love Broad Street Bullies when it comes it since it's not horror, and will be studio backed. I think the gritty griminess mostly on the set by the art direction department was captured very well. The use of mostly one set gives it that reservoir dogs / hateful eight feel. I don't see how a fan of old school horror or grind house could not like this movie. In terms of the Zombie films i'd rank it 3rd best after House & Rejects. (Not including remakes) It's to nitpick and say the dialogue could have been better etc. At this point I basically consider Horror a dead genre. I'm personally not a fan of the PG13 CGI films being mass produced by Hollywood. I'm pretty much just down to watching Zombie's horror films. That's not because I think he's the best director, it's because he is not scaling back on violence or content. I will say my second watch of the film really seemed more intense with the big screen, and theater sound system. I also found the Q&A with Rob interesting, as well as the documentary sneak peak. If you are in to ""The Making ofs"" I would check that out. If you like horror, especially classic 80s & 90s I'd say watch it, pretend you don't know Rob Zombie made it and i'm sure it will be at least watchable!This is my first major film I crowd funded, I have several more shorts & features which I will be reviewing as well.",31
181,tvern23,Not his best but not his worst,5,17 September 2016,"this is definitely not my favorite zombie movie. It's not his best effort, but thankfully better than that awful Salem movie. It's not as good as house of 1000 corpses, devils rejects, or Halloween but still pretty good. If you like some straight up horror violence gore then you should find this entertaining enough, just don't expect too much in the way or story plot or character development - which not all horror movies need to good. although I was surprised to hear he called it his most brutal film yet. I disagree with that although maybe the directors cut is different or before it was cut down to an R rating. I thought Richard Brake was good in it. I did find the ending a bit underwhelming. Overall I'd give it a 6.5/10",31
182,ishmaelmontiel,A Rob Zombie fan no more,2,1 September 2016,"To start off, I have loved previous Zombie films. House of 1000 Corpses and Devils Rejects were at one point two of my favorite films. With that said, this film is just bad. I just came from the Fathom Events and was so disappointed by this movie I opened this account just to write this review. There are numerous things this movie lacks and going into this film I did not expect a masterpiece, but instead good ol bloody fun. Sadly, the blood could not save this film.We find ourselves with a simple plot revolving 5 individuals forced to play a game called ""31"". They must fight to survive the night and win the game. The killers have a clown based appearance making for what appears to be a fun ride.After the premise is revealed the film immediately goes down hill. To start off no character development is really made with both the survivors or villains of the movie. When the killings begin we feel indifferent to who lives or dies. When the deaths do occur, they are disappointing especially in comparison to Zombie's past. By this I mean, most of the kills are done by stabbings, which either cut to black, or show minimal damage. I'm not saying the lack of gore is what makes this movie bad, but I figured it would be Zombie's scape goat if anything. Unfortunately the movie progresses with no real development of plot and ends with what appears to be a copy of a scene found within other Zombie films. Which normally would be a cool throwback, but in this case seemed lazy.From here I could go on about the issues with this movie, but ill just bullet point them.The editing seemed as if a fan of Zombie's film had made this. Overuse of ""vintage"" effects just became detrimental. The killers lacked any real character. It's as if he thought ""Killer clowns are scary, enough said"". So with that said the killers are just that, new clowns in different ""Weird attire"".The killers lack any power. As the film nears its remaining 30 minutes, we see the heroes plow through ""killers"" like nothing.It's as if everyone was on the same playing field and this was just a brawl.With such a simple premise of ""Killer clowns"" most would immediately assume the setting is going to be a carnival or something related. Instead we are introduced to the characters in a great looking carnival Esq setting in the very beginning, then the film immediately places all the characters in the most clichéd looking ""pipe room"" that is completely gray and dark. I assume this was due to budget constraints, but then why the lavish room to simply introduce the characters? This poor use of setting is later seen in a room that is shown which looks like a typical mini circus tent but is actually a cage. This room was only used for a few minutes on screen and completely abandoned after. Returning all characters to the pipe room.The acting was poor. Like just scare actor at your local Halloween attraction bad. That goes for both heroes and villains. The only one who had evident talent Meg Foster. Her performance was brilliant with the material she had.FINAL THING. After the movie there was a ""Q&A From Rob Zombie"". The first question was ""What inspired you to make this film?"" His answer was ""Well , I was working on a movie that got stuck in production hell so I called up my team and told them ' I can pitch you the dumbest simple idea that will make money right now in 30 seconds"" ""Its Halloween... uh people get kidnapped....uh clowns kill them. boom that'll make money."" This was the moment I was not only disappointed in the movie but Rob Zombie himself. This man practically had the audience sit through a poor excuse of a movie THEN had the nerve to basically include a feature that tells them they were dumb for falling for it. All said and done, if you like Rob's past movies just avoid this one. Trust me, it will shine a light on the idea that maybe Rob never had any talent, but instead used the same tricks until they got old.",31
183,jtmichaelson,I Tried. I really Did.,2,9 November 2018,"Yeah, I did try hard because I know what to expect from Zombie. I was impressed with 1,000 Corpses, loved Devil's Rejects, enjoyed the Halloween reboots. Love his music, even. But I was taken aback by this one. I was watching his movies rehashed but not improved upon.However, I added one extra start to a one-star movie because I got to see Alexander DeLarge/Burgess and Freddy ""Boom Boom"" Washington on screen again. Sheri Moon kind of took away most of that pleasure but that's the balance of things.Sheri Moon-Zombie is just one horrible actress. This girl cannot deliver a line if it was looped by Meryl Streep.But Malcolm McDowell was in it. I'm a fan so I stuck it out. But I wished I hadn't.",31
184,richardturvey,Excellent,10,5 October 2019,Rob zombie is definitely in the top 10 directors making films,31
185,bueller55,Rob Zombie is back and brutal as ever!,10,4 February 2016,"I really enjoyed this movie, despite the awesome atmosphere of the crowd which included most of the cast and the director himself, it was the film itself that had me on the edge of my seat. The opening monologue by the most evil, dangerous and deadliest clown of them all Doom-Head himself (but don't call him a clown) sets an extremely exciting pace to the film. James Gang's Walkaway was the opening credit's song that immediately told us that we were back in the 70's just like Rob Zombie prefers to set most of his films in and he made the right choice again. Setting the film in 1976 made our main characters that bit more interesting but it was the cast itself that made these characters really enjoyable to watch, so we meet our quirky carnies and learn a bit about their own little world. But before long the carnies are on their way to their next gig, driving through the desert on Halloween eventually being kidnapped in a way that's quite different from what you'd expect from a Zombie movie and find themselves in Murderworld. An enormous underground compound run by three old psychos in powder wigs who explain the rules of the game known as 31 where five people each year are set free in Murderworld each given a numbered bracelet, a weapon and must try to survive for 12 hours which once over are set free but so far there has never been a winner. The five carnies are untied as they enter the labyrinth with a weapon waiting for the first of the six clowns known as the heads to attack. Then what commences is none stop attacks, fights to the death, torture, bloody mayhem and the true hell that is Murderworld! I found this film quite thrilling you really don't know what's going to happen next like when we see who the toughest of the carnies really is and how all the heads are all very unique. Yes the brutality is extreme even for Rob Zombie but what really makes this film stand out is the originality of the story and how characters defy every expectation not one character slows down this film in fact it's the characters that drive this film and surprise an impress you constantly because they keep changing yet still keep their character true. The soundtrack worked very well to set the tone and setting for the film just like Zombie's masterpiece The Devil's Rejects. The ending couldn't have been better and all the actors brought their A game. The actors that really stole the show were Richard Blake who was indescribable as Doom-Head, Sheri Moon Zombie as Charly surprised everyone as being a full on action hero when she had to be, Meg Foster who was so deeply fascinating as Venus occasionally being a bad-ass and Jeff Daniel Phillips as the macho mechanic that cares about his group and will defend them with a crowbar! All in all Zombie has made this fan very happy when it hits theaters will make all his fans happy but I don't think critics will like it then again most of the greatest horror movies of all time were hated by critics initially so don't let that stop you from watching this flick!",31
186,krb138,I actually did want to like this but...,3,19 September 2016,"I enjoyed Zombie's first two movies. That's about the extent that I can say I am a fan of his in any respect. With that being said, some of the imagery that I had seen leading up to this film had me hoping it would exceed the awful messes that were the Halloween remakes and Lords of Salem. It didn't.Carnies, the 70's, killer ""clowns"", and a game that is an amalgamation of better movies (The Running Man, etc). It's not an overly complicated plot, but somehow Rob Zombie was able to make it seem confusing.Bad acting (particularly from Sheri Moon Zombie, as always), terrible dialogue, and lots of characters with basically no character development. I've read lots of other people say that this is a pointless movie and they are absolutely right. It's watchable, but it's not something I would watch again.My general thinking at this time is that Rob Zombie is far better suited to be a production artist/set designer than a writer/director.",31
187,shelbyburks,"In Hell, Everybody Loves Popcorn",7,14 March 2017,"""In hell, everybody loves popcorn.""This film released digitally six months ago, and since then, I've seen it five times. Is it because it's Rob Zombie's best film? No. It's not. But is it a fun time? Absolutely.As for the story, it's pretty simple. Five friends get trapped in a game of 31 and have to fight their way out to survival. It's not complex at all, but who said it has to be? I enjoyed the story a lot, because I like survival horror.The characters are not all like-able. I'll give it that at least. The three that stand out to me are Charly (played by Sheri Moon Zombie herself), Venus (Meg Foster), and Doomhead (Richard Brake). Charly and Venus are just a couple of bada** babes, and I completely root for them the entire film! (Yay for girl power.) As for Doomhead, he is one scary guy that I wouldn't want to make mad. The opening scene with him was unquestionably fantastic.Was the film memorable? Some parts of it. Like I mentioned above, Richard Brake's opening scene was fantastic.How was the dialogue? It's not good. Even as a Zombie fan girl, I am willing to admit that he went too heavy on the ""wh*re"" and ""sh*t"" jokes. I know that he is perfectly capable of writing better films than this one. It was a little bit of a let down, but not enough to ruin the film for me.Overall, I liked 31. It's not my favorite from Zombie, but it's also not my least favorite. I hope you enjoyed my review and thanks for reading!",31
188,timdry,Splatter matter mishmash.,3,19 February 2017,"Last night I watched Rob Zombie's new movie '31' so you don't have to. I'm a caring kind of guy and I don't like people being hurt! It's one of the most badly acted, jarringly edited and poorly scripted pieces of work I've seen for quite a while. None of the characters deserve any shred of compassion or care from the viewer, there is a laughable paucity of back story, good dialogue and tension. It's just a masturbatory mishmash of slice and dice mayhem, chicks in peril, butch guys trying to be heroes whilst bleeding out that we've all seen so many times before. The trailer for the movie is infinitely more satisfying than the film itself because of its brevity. There is only one sequence that gives off any unsettling power and that is the opening black and white monologue mainly to camera by an actor named Richard Brake( Batman Begins, Kingsman:The Secret Service, Hannibal Rising etc.) playing a character called Doom- Head (!) It's seriously disturbing! After that it's downhill all the way. Chainsaws, blood (lots of it), giggling psychotic clowns, dripping pipes in dark and dank corridors straight out of Cliché City, you know the stuff. Oh and now Malcolm McDowell and his two lady consorts suddenly appear as be-wigged, powdered overseers dressed as characters from a bizarre Restoration comedy piece, who are controlling the 'Game'. WTF?No explanation is given as to why and just when you think things can't get any worse in comes a murderous, knife-wielding small person dressed as Hitler and speaking Spanish! His character is named Sick-Head! Looking back on it now (shudder)I can see that with just a little morsel of humorous imagination from Mr Zombie it could have been a seriously amusing black comedy but it isn't. Shame really, as I liked 'Lords Of Salem'. To be honest, I'm not a fan of most modern so-called Horror Movies, especially ones that star a masked and indestructible sociopath carving up squealing teenies, torture porn or shuffling hordes of the hungry undead eating their way through the population. Don't get me wrong - It's not all doom and gloom for me in the world of cinematic horror, there's good and original work out there like The Autopsy Of Jane Doe, American Mary, Under The Skin, The Descent, The Mist, The Ring, Wolf Creek, 1408, 30 Days Of Night, The Babadook, The first two Hellraiser movies, Sinister, Eden Lake etc. This is just my opinion of course and I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me (fair enough) and enjoy '31'. So, adios lieblings!",31

Instead, I found one of the most disgusting films I've ever seen, one that I couldn't even stomach finishing. I don't tend to be bothered by gore or vulgarity, but this film took everything to another level. The characters were uninteresting and poorly developed, even by horror standards. Combined with poor acting and even worse dialogue, the film was a complete mess. and unbearable to watch. There were whole scenes in this movie that could have been taken out, being placed in to have no other purpose but shock value.I wasn't expecting the best of the best here, but I was so bothered by this film that I actually needed to write a review to tell others just how awful it was. I couldn't imagine what Rob Zombie was thinking when making this and quite frankly I don't know what I was thinking when I picked this film to watch.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS!!!",31

194,papajoejoemama,Better than most of the reviews give it credit for!,6,22 December 2016,"I will make this sweet short and to the point! I had no anticipation toward this film and had also heard little about it! Overall the acting is poor, but since Rob insist on casting Sheri Moon Zombie in all his films, this should come as no surprise! The story line leaves little to the imagination and the plot is pretty much worn out! With that said, the sadistic, twisted flow of this film is brilliant. Character development in my opinion is what makes a movie,and in this offering 2 characters standout quite well. Remember this name DOOM-HEAD! Played by actor Richard Brake. If they do not make a spin off based on this guy they are seriously missing out!!!They other character goes by Sick-Head! I will leave it at that. Like it, love it, hate it, that is up to you. If you are a fan of Rob or any slasher era flicks give this one a try.. You may just love it!",31

Im glad I didn't listen. The movie was not thick in layers of plot however the action and gore were perfect for a horror flick, reminds me of when I was a kid when horror movies were actually interesting. All actors were superb with the exception of Sheri Moon-Zombie she was kinda lame in this (She usually does decent) other than that Doom-Head is amazing, could kinda see him playing Joker better than Leto. I think this is a step up from House of 1000 Corpses seemed to flow better. Don't pass on this if you want to see a gore flick, don't go into this expecting an Oscar performance and you will be pleased.",31

198,kieranjcooper,I loved this film. Here's why...,7,8 November 2018,"First off, this film is a joy to watch, just, beautifully shot. Far more thought out and well executed (no pun intended) than Zombie's previous works. A few stellar performances (Richard Brake as Doomhead is not the only mention worthy, but he is fantastic) help create a hellish atmosphere that repulses and attracts you at the same time.A thin story, a kind of Hostel meets Running Man meets The Purge, comes up as a reason why many reviewers didnt like the film. However...I watched Hereditary this week, and having loved so much about the film all the way through to the end, only to have that crushed at the last minute (literally, the last minute or two of the film) because of a cramming in of loose-end tying garbage that felt like a screen writers last minute chance to explain everything that REALLY didn't NEED to be explained.I didn't get this with 31. I had room to ponder, come up with my own ideas for why what I was seeing might have been occurring. Zombie isn't fussed about injecting character driven relatability into his films if it's going to feel like someone smashed a puzzle piece in until it was forced where it didn't fit. He wins at atmosphere... sinister, weird, uncomfortable, inexplicable. He wears his Influences on his sleeve, and doesn't try to be insincerely 'clever'.31 is good. Really good. Beautiful to watch, the sound design is excellent. There are some super performances. I loved it and will be surely watching it again soon.",31
199,bethany_ford70,My Favorite Rob Zombie Movie To-Date,10,6 August 2017,"I loved this movie! The characters were regular people that anyone one of us would know, work with and be friends with. The 70's retro touches were great and exactly what I remembered the 70's looking like. Sheri Moon Zombie has really upped her acting game from when I first saw her in House of 1000 Corpses. She did a great job in Halloween, and was even better in The Lord's of Salem and now in this role really shows off her abilities. She makes the transition of her character from the opening to the end result natural and believable. I like that these friends and co-workers don't turn on each other as they do in so many other movies where people are put into these situations. They always turn on each other and it's every man for themselves. They worked together, they fought together. I love that Rob Zombie uses the same actors in his films. Seeing them play different parts is always really interesting. To be honest I loved the fact the women were kick butt in this film. They weren't super heroes, they were just regular women put in a terrible situation that rose to the occasion. The men weren't assholes or macho jerks. They looked out for the women where they could, because that's what good men do, but they weren't getting in the way of each other either. They played to their strengths. Tanks up front, light fighters coming up behind. It made sense. I think that's what really strikes me about this movie the most. I wasn't yelling at the screen because the characters were doing something stupid. Their actions made sense to me, were things I could see myself doing. (Not that I want to ever find myself in that situation.) Richard Brake's performance was amazing. I found him both interesting and terrifying at the same time. Really, all of the actors did an amazing job. There's not a single performance that I thought was sub-par. I recommend watching this movie, especially if you're a Rob Zombie fan, but even if you're not, it's a good movie and definitely worth taking the time for.",31
200,rezanasseri,Something different and entertaining!!!,10,1 November 2016,"OK. This is my first review here, and I'm writing this review because I am so sick of seeing great movies such as this receive low scores while other cinematic turds get great reviews.I saw this movie a few nights ago, so some of the details aren't so fresh, but anyways here we go.""31"" is a fun, fairly unique cinematic experience that fans of other Rob Zombie movies should once again enjoy. Its like the ""Running Man"" meets ""House of 1000 Corpses"", where Zombie tips his hat to the classic horror of yesteryear mixed with the uncensored shock value of today's media.Obviously making the shift from music to film will leave technical holes in Zombie's movies, but if you you turn a blind eye to small details and stop pretending to be an actual film critic just because you have an original copy of ""Eraserhead"" on VHS, technical flaws aside you can't argue what you are watching is not fun.If you want to know more about the plot, read the other reviews. I will focus on other details. The acting is also great, Richard Brake is unreal as Doom-head, almost as good as his role in Halloween (2009). Sheri-Moon Zombie, is Sheri-Moon Zombie, again another love/ hate actor (I think she's great and can really act as well). Jeff Daniel Phillips is great as always and the welcome addition of Pancho Moler as ""Sick-Head"", the Neo-Nazi, Hitler lookalike midget clown was awesome (perhaps some influence from Iron Sky?). If you're a fan of his other works, you'll love this movie. If not, it might not be your cup of tea.Personally I hope Zombie continues to move away from the commercial market, because when he does release something for the masses once again, most people just ""don't get it"". ""31"" is just another one of the 5 bazillion movies that will be made this year, but at least it sticks out as being something unique and special which is why it deserves a much higher rating!",31

And I mean no knock to him, I love his movies and actors... That said, if you like Zombie, you'll like this movie, if you don't, you won't (at least if you're like me). I liked all of his stuff... It's around there with Halloween 2. That said, it's not his best. But, that's not necessarily saying anything negative, since all of his movies are at the very least interesting. It's true, it needs more though! Not because it's a horrendous movie, but because Zombie is so gifted that you could really expect a lot from him. This one was solid, Halloween-time fun (I expected a slasher or avant-garde movie, not an Oscar film). Kind of nasty, though, the jokes... My favorite movie was ""The Lords of Salem."" I did end up buying 31, the standard definition version... I don't know if you'd rather wait for a price reduction or an uncut version, or if you'd prefer to see it sooner in October 2016.

204,broadsword42,Not as bad as everyone else seems to think,8,6 August 2017,"I really don't understand all the negative reviews for this movie. I suppose I should start with full disclosure - I am a Rob Zombie fan. I don't love everything he does - I hated ""The Lords of Salem"" - but I've enjoyed everything else the man has done. When I first read about this movie, I was apprehensive, after i found Rob's previous film was not to my liking at all. Add in some of the things that I read on IMDb after ""31"" was released, and I had already made up my mind that I was going to be disappointed. Then, I sat down to watch ""31"". To say that I was pleasantly surprised is a serious understatement. I had read that the characters were unlikable, but on the contrary I found myself cheering for them unreservedly. I had read that the film was misogynistic, but I thought that the females were portrayed as competent, strong heroines. I had read that the dialogue was bad, but I found that the words coming out of the characters mouths were believable and, when appropriate, either hilarious or riveting. Granted, this movie probably isn't for everyone - if the female form bothers you, or if you find violence distasteful, then you should steer clear. On the other hand, if you like bloodshed or you enjoy cheering on some regular people who are placed in terrible circumstances, or even if you're just a fan of tense thrillers, then this movie is for you. Rob Zombie has written and directed perhaps his finest movie with ""31"", and I hope that more people will give this underrated gem a chance.",31

206,littleache,Not just because I love Rob Zombie....,10,7 October 2016,"I find it funny, almost unbearably funny that so many claim to watch this cuz Rob Zombie made it...do you even have a clue about what he does and what he loves...it is throwback to old school B movie horror films. Read up him and then maybe you will see why this is actually one of his best. HO10K Corpses...oh yeah...amazing. The Devils Rejects...so amazing that amazing is a poor descriptor. That art house crap fest of Lords of Salem well, i could have tweezed all of my nasal hair out and found that more enjoyable. This one, 31, beautifully done. It is disgusting in the most complimentary sense. His best movies are those where the bad guys are who you root for like Otis. I am on my 3rd watch of this and even if I am alone in my praise I don't mind that at all. I love this film...thanks to Doom Head because in hell everyone loves popcorn. I want mine with LOTS of blo...um, butter.",31
207,roode937,Send In The Clowns,3,1 October 2016,"I dig Rob Zombie films. Devils Rejects, the Halloween reboots, Lords of Salemall personal favorites. So much so that I contributed $150 to the crowd funding of 31. It was promised to be the movie RZ wanted to make as well as the movie he thought his fans wanted to see - an unapologetic and uncompromising slaughter-fest. Well, I finally watched 31 last night and unfortunately it does compromise and it isn't even much of a slaughter-fest. It's simply another ""we-kidnapped-some-innocent-people-for-the-purpose-of-torturing-them"" retread. And not a very good one at that. I'm bummed.There are certainly moments that make 31 worth watching. But those moments just aren't enough to make it a good movie. Much of the criticism of 31 has been directed at the lack of character development. My comment to that is ""who cares?"". This is a movie where I wanted to sink into my seat and cover my eyes due to the extreme and unrelenting gore. I wanted to feel like I did when I first saw Dawn of The Dead in theaters in 1980 - unable to look, but unable to look awayutterly horrified by images I'd never seen beforewalking out exhilarated, out of breath, and laughing at myself for being so freaked out by a movie. If anyone could do it, Rob could. Alas, most of 31 is just another quick-cut, shaky-cam exercise that does manage to force the viewer to look away - just not out of disgust, but to keep from getting a headache from the excessively annoying hand-held shots and machine-gun editing. More often than not, you can't even tell what's going on in the action scenes. There are lots of half second images of blood- soaked faces, and blood-soaked clothing, and blood-soaked weaponsbut we can't tell who's getting chopped up and who's doing the chopping. 31 opens with a monologue from villainous clown Doom Head. It's a great scene that draws you in. The idea that he was, of course, going to show up again by the end of the film was the only thing that kept me from walking out. He does show up in the final 15 minutes, but it's too little, too late. It was already to the point where I couldn't care less what happened to these people and I knew however the inevitable deaths were played out wasn't going to be anything interesting or inventive. I was right. In between the opening and closing Doom Head bookends there is absolutely nothing of interest. A little unsuccessful character developmentsilly villains that are far too easy for our heroes to killpompous ringmasters that add nothing and could have been cut out completelyit all made me want my $150 back.I assume there will be an unrated version somewhere down the line that I'll watch and re- evaluate, but I can't imagine it saving this waste of fake blood and Malcolm McDowells talent. If you want to see an interesting, scary clown movie try 2014's Clown (he eats children!) if you want gut-wrenching gore watch the Evil Dead remake again. The only reason to see 31 is it's an RZ flick and to be properly schooled in modern horror you need to see all RZ offerings - at least for now. A few more throwaways like this and Rob will just be another straight to Netflix hack director.",31
208,lrivers-88900,"A Fun, Imperfect but Still Violent Ride",8,1 September 2016,"I went and saw the sneak screening for Fathom Events as well as other people did. It started with two music videos, one song I liked more than the other. Then the movie started. 31 is simple: carnies get attacked, kidnapped and placed in this warehouse where they are supposed to fight homicidal maniacs known as The Heads, in order to survive. Nobody has ever survived. So the mayhem begins. Rob Zombie is really good with visuals when it comes to color and closeups on deranged activities but the camera can get shaky at times. It didn't really bother me but it could bother some. I really liked the music that went along with the film..it was very intense. The characters were unlikeable to say the least but there was one I felt sympathetic for out of the allies and the main antagonist was absolutely outstanding..he was sadistic yet had a kind of charm about him. So as the characters fight to survive you're just going along with them, watching them get picked off one by one along with the villains. I didn't really root for anyone, as none of the characters really had backstory or depth. I was a little surprised this was called RZ's most brutal film as although it had some bloody scenes, it felt a little reserved. Maybe thats because im desensitized or maybe its because the film had to be trimmed for the MPAA. Im looking forward to the uncut version to be released on DVD- im sure that will have all the gory glory we want. I really did enjoy it though.",31
209,davidpro-08028,Imperfectly Perfect,10,5 September 2016,"OK so every fan of House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects begged for another film like those. We begged and we begged, we said do a prequel, do an origin story, just give us more of this type of movie. And RZ delayed it, he gave us Halloween reboots, he took a risk and gave us the witch horror version of a Clockwork Orange in Lords of Salem, he even gave us an adult Scooby-do with El SuperBeasto, he took to TV and direct an episode of CSI, literally he gave us a look at other works, but we kept begging for another 1000. And understandably so, those 2 films can be argued that they changed horror films, the villains were glorified and loved. Sheri Moon's acting of Baby was so awesome, 9 out of 10 men would still pick Baby up knowing she was taking them to the house of 1000, the one that wouldn't, well he doesn't like women, Otis was off the chain, totally insane and Capt Spaulding will forever be an icon and should be listed as one of the greatest horror villain in history.So when I see people complaining that 31 doesn't give us anything new, I'm kind of frustrated, we asked, no begged for this film. I agree it is nothing ground breaking, but RZ already broke the ground originally here. I look at this film more as a favor to the fans. RZ continues to want to direct and write new, different films, but we keep begging for more. So much in fact we helped fund raise for this film, expecting exactly what it was.Is the film perfect, hell no, it's completely imperfect. It is pure evil, as was House and Devil's.This is exactly what fans of those movies wanted. A fact paced, blood hammering, film that give us new villains to love.It is perfectly imperfect.Now, consider my taste for the past movies filled, as I personally am ready to move on and see the next chapter of creativity from RZ.",31
210,zaibihashmi,best movie,9,11 September 2016,"During Halloween 1976 a group of carnival workers are traveling through the country in an RV, on their way to their next venue. Along the way they're stopped and attacked, with only a handful of them left alive - Charly (Sheri Moon Zombie), Venus (Meg Foster), Panda (Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs), Levon (Kevin Jackson), and Roscoe (Jeff Daniel Phillips). They're taken to a strange, large building, where three strange people wearing aristocratic wigs and powder force them to play ""31"". For the next 12 hours they must wander through a maze-like set of rooms where they must survive attempts by several people intent on torturing and murdering them. If they survive the full 12 hours they will be set free, although their captors freely express their disbelief that the captives will survive that long. i think this is the best horror movie, i like it very much. the acting was superb and background music was lovable, i saw this movie in tokyo japan in cineplex cinema and i enjoyed the movie. it was a great experience. after watching this i an become fan of horror movies. http://shutapp.club/",31
211,stylinurhair,yuck!!!!!!,2,17 September 2016,"What!? What!? and What!? How does this even happen? Going from House of 1000 Corpses to the Devils Rejects and Halloween to THIS!?? I can't even begin to wrap my head around what the thought process of this movie was. Where is the semi story line, how do all this misfit bunch of people know each other, granted it was in the 70's but really? How does the main girls shirt not get bloody after all the carnage and how in the hell do you work up an appetite to eat anything after a Nazi Spanish speaking little person kills your ""friend""? And not to mention the breakaways of the death scenes, when did we have to start using our imaginations for the bloody parts in Rob Zombie movies? The only high point for me was seeing Dottie from Pee Wee working again. Disappointment all around!!!!!",31
212,bobvans,One of the worst films I've ever had the displeasure to view,1,21 September 2016,"I'm a fan of Zombie's other work and music, but this movie is terrible. like not even B quality, more like D. I can't imagine there is an actual living person out there that liked this movie. It's not even ""Good because it's so bad."" There will be no cult status ever attributed to this film, it sucks, and he needs to stop using his wife in everyone of his films. The idea/plot could have been fine if someone else directed it and there were entirely new actors cast. The ""bad guys"" weren't scary, they were pathetic unimaginative cliché ripoffs of things past. I have never bothered to comment on any bad movie I've seen, I just thought to myself ""well, that was terrible."" This movie was so bad I made an account to inform others what a colossal waste of time watching it is.",31
213,jlbullard-44862,Stick to making your bad music Rob.....,1,22 September 2016,"Well, Rob.....you owe me! I watched this filth flick and wasted some of my life doing it. Wasn't scary....Rob!!!! Wasn't original Rob!!!! What it was.....a bad version of ""running man"".....???? This same plot scenario that you seem to be stuck on, you know, travelers happen upon an unholy place, that is tired....Rob! Watch The Shining, the original Omega Man, The Devil's Backbone. There! See how it's done? I know you think you are freaking everyone out with your....killer clowns, and oops, I'm eating a dead body here, but none of that is original bro. Your Rob Zombie!!!! You are supposed to be better at this! You are not. You may need to stick to making bad music, cause even it is better than your.....uh, ""film"" making. Next time you feel like making another movie.....don't. Thank you in advance. And FYI, there's already a ""Killer Clowns"" movie.....and it's better than this. Those Clowns were scary!",31
214,evansamber-64078,31 Amazing,10,7 October 2016,"Rob Zombie has done it again! I have been waiting to see this film and it was worth it. The gore was the best part, the acting was great, for all of those who think the movie was bad just go watch a horror film that is a total cliché and has young actors who look like babies wearing skinny jeans and dress t-shirts, with dumb slang that they can't even spell. Besides this movie is for actual adults who appreciate good acting, gore, and beautiful people. Sheri Moon Zombie did amazing in this movie and looked beautiful, her character started off as a fun loving woman, who became a fighter. Doom-Head was just crazy and I like him the best out of the killers. I was upset about Panda though, but hey the show must go on If you are a Zombie fan watch this, it is the best horror/thriller of the year!",31
215,iancampbell-76348,Extremely Disappointing,2,17 October 2016,"I had high hopes for this movie after seeing the trailer several months ago, but this was a huge letdown. Almost couldn't believe it was from the same guy who brought us Devils Rejects, as that is one of my all time favorites movies, and RZ's best in my opinion. Plot just isn't there, the acting is terrible, the story line barely follows anything. Definitely glad I did not pay to see this in theaters. I remember reading a while back before this was made that RZ was looking to have this crowdfunded, but this just goes to show that you can only do so much with a $1.5M budget. I was especially excited after I saw that this came back as NC-17 twice before finally getting an R rating, but that didn't help this film either. Nothing can help this film. This was REALLY bad.",31
216,mselizabeth-06647,"Deranged, psychotic slasher flick fun.",5,20 October 2016,"Did some of the acting suck? Yes. Were the characters or plot line well developed? No. Was it full of horror movies clichés? Yes. However, this movie was fairly entertaining. The characters were super whacked out and in some cases very shocking. This movie was exactly as it was supposed to be a brutally violent slasher flick without much substance. The lack of character development really allowed you to not give a rats ass as each character died. Sort of like Father Murder and his lady friends watching and betting for fun. This movie may not have been extremely well developed or structured but it was very inventive and shocking. Sometimes horror movies are simply meant to entertain the audience, shock them, gross them out, and not really make too much sense or allow you have an emotional connection with the characters. This film delivered exactly what I expected it would. If you don't go into it expecting a very intellectual plot line or method acting, you wont be disappointed. I do think the ending could have been better. I was half expecting the victim and Doomhead to hook up at the end. That would've spiced it up a little but maybe they're setting us up for a sequel. Doomhead'a performance was killer, literally and figuratively. Like a cross between the joker and a deranged Billy Bob Thornton, I thought he was a great villain. Don't take this one home to mom, but worth watching once if you're just looking for a good time.",31
217,matyasinszky,My dog would make the same movie if I tied a camera on its back,1,30 October 2016,"I have been a fan of Rob Zombie's music for two decades. I love several albums he made back in the White Zombie days and he's done cool stuff also as a solo artist. He can absolutely entertain an audience at a rock show, I've seen that for myself. He's even proved to be an accomplished graphic artist. Just go see his drawings in the CD booklet of the White Zombie album Astro Creep 2000!However, Rob Zombie just cannot make a movie!By the time The Lords Of Salem was released, I was so disappointed by all of his previous films (especially by his disastrous Halloween remakes) that I have never hurried myself to see that piece of effort - and after suffering through a good chunk of 31, I surely never will. His latest work makes me wonder how could I sit through any of the RZ catalog. I had to stop watching 31 after 40-45 minutes for the simple reason that it is tinkered of nothing but totally incomprehensible frames and scenes. My dog would make the exact same movie if I zoomed a camera to a close- up angle, tied it on the dog's back and put the animal in a very little cage to fight another dog. Lucky for Mr. Zombie, I'm an animal lover and I don't even own a dog. Seriously, no matter how bad the actors are, how terrible the writing and directing is, all should be given an Oscar, compared to the quality of camera work and editing!",31
218,incarnadine-45143,Zombie's worst yet...,4,13 December 2016,"I had really hoped for more from this movie. I had high expectations because I've been a fan of Rob and his work since the early-ish days of White Zombie. You'll get some decent effects here, which is why I gave it a 4 instead of a 3, but don't expect any decent dialogue or likable characters that have any depth whatsoever. With that said, I do understand this type of movie and what it's supposed to be. I wasn't expecting any Oscar-worthy performances or writing here, but it still felt incredibly lacking. Shortly after the characters were introduced I just wanted it to be over.",31
219,darksmithnowhere,Dear Rob: PLEASE stop trying to make horror films...,1,27 December 2016,"Going into this film, I already knew I'd be disappointed, coming off the backs of such previous Zombie tripe like Lords of Salem and H2.However, I had no idea it would be *this* bad. All the classic hallmarks of a Zombie horror film are on display here: a bunch of 50+ year olds from every other Zombie film mawkishly overacting, a buffoonish nonsensical plot, horrid dialogue and lots of blood to distract from the non-horror film limping its way to its 100-minute length.The clown maniacs aren't scary, the protagonists are one-dimensional and not worth caring about, and the shock tactics Rob so desperately employs with each film land with a thud every time here. It astounded me when news broke that Zombie -- a multi-millionaire shock rock star -- was requesting people to crowdfund his next film. It's even more astounding that people actually put up their cash for this garbage. H2 and LOS proved that Zombie is virtually clueless when it comes to making horror films and this latest film only reinforces that notion ten-fold. There's horror movies that are bad in a self-aware kind of fashion and are thus entertaining to watch. And then there are films like this, which are so poorly written and directed that it's a crime to the genre entirely. For the love of god, Zombie...PLEASE stop giving the horror genre a bad name with your poor excuses for films. Stick to music, if you must.",31
220,twerkonmaxx,I love 31!,10,27 February 2017,"I'm a huge fan of Rob Zombie's music and his films. It's true that he isn't everyone's cup of tea. I would definitely say that this film is a must-see for his fans and for fans of the horror genre. I encourage everyone to give it a chance, rather than trusting in reviews from all of the haters. As a Rob fan, I was ecstatic from the moment the film was announced. Even with my expectations very high, I wasn't even slightly disappointed. I love grindhouse films, and 31 is an excellent example of grindhouse cinema. It's true, the characters aren't as memorable as some in his past films, but they were all characters that I found myself rooting for. The killers were all very well portrayed and disturbing, and I'm personally not even afraid of clowns. The setting was perfection and it helped create the dark, creepy atmosphere throughout the entire film. The only thing I wish the film had more of was the aristocrats. I doubt there will be a sequel, but if there is, I hope we see a little more of them and a little more of what they experience during the game (bets, favorite killers, reasons for participating in 31, etc). Rob stayed true to himself, and created a film that is twisted, disturbing, and 100% entertaining from beginning to end. I love this film! I own it on Blu-ray and I've already watched it a multitude of times. Don't listen to the bad reviews! Give 31 a chance! A majority of recent horror films are disappointing and try way too hard to be edgy, gritty, and everything else that this film effortlessly is.",31
