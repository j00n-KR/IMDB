However her life is totally controlled by her husband and his family. When she is pregnant, she is stressed and eats the weirdest objects. Soon Richie's family hires a male nurse and a psychologist to take care of Hunter. When they decide to send her to a psychiatric hospital, Hunter learns that she needs to control of her life.""Swallow"" is an interesting film about a pregnant wife with Pica disorder.

1,kosmasp,All things (considered),8,20 March 2021,"Like another reviewer I imagined this was going to be about Pill addiction - a glimpse at the poster, the only thing I allowed myself or rather couldn't avoid seeing - other than that I did not read anything about the movie. So that looked like a pill thing ... and it turned out this is a different beast.Now I imagine that most people who want to watch it (and of course those who already have) read up on the plot and are not like me avoiding any information at all costs. So you don't need me to tell you anything about that. What I will tell you, is that the movie is quite the tough and harrowing watch. And all the focus lies on the main female character. Everyone else is quite flat from a character standpoint. A bodyguard sort of type may have the most personality of them all.But that did not make the movie any less intriguing. And while it seems impossible to have any sort of final resolution here ... you may agree with how the movie decides to end ... even if most likely you may not be able to really get a grip on everything she goes through, we do feel for her ...",Swallow
2,ferguson-6,time to clear your throat,6,5 March 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. Have you ever picked up a marble and wanted to ingest it? How about a push-pin? A battery? Any other items normally considered inedible? If not, you likely don't suffer from the psychological disorder known as pica - an eating disorder at the center of the feature film debut from Carlo Mirabella-Davis. While pica may be new and confounding to most of us, the real story is what drives someone to swallow items that could be harmful and cause severe pain?Haley Bennett (THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN) stars as Hunter Conrad, a newly married trophy wife to spoiled and handsome Richie Conrad (Austin Stowell). Richie is so entitled that his even more entitled dad (David Rasche) makes a big deal out of promoting his son to partner by proclaiming at a dinner party that ""he earned it."" Oh and this is after the parents bought the newlyweds a stunning home with a view. It's obvious Hunter 'married up' from a socioeconomic perspective, but her GQ husband pays more attention to his cell phone than he does to his wife or the picture perfect dinners she prepares. Hunter's Mother-in-Law (Elizabeth Marvel) offers up awkward support and passive-aggressive compliments ... such as a self-help book entitled ""A Talent for Joy.""The book is a gift to Hunter immediately after Richie tells his parents ""We're pregnant!"" A passage in the book mentions to 'push yourself to experience new things'. It's at this point where Hunter sees herself become even more of an accessory within the family. One morning she spots a decorative marble and pops it in her mouth. She seems to take pleasure in this, and ... um ... after it passes, displays it as some type of trophy. Soon other items join the marble on display, until finally, Hunter is in so much pain, she's rushed to the hospital for surgery.Pica is a disorder that's difficult to understand. Haley seems to be complacent, having no real persona other than her pretty face and pristine wardrobe. Swallowing the items evidently delivers the feeling lacking in her life - a life where her job seems to be becoming the perfect wife, mother, and daughter-in-law. Worried about the safety of the unborn baby, the family hires Luay (Laith Nakli), a Syrian live-in nurse, to keep an eye on Hunter. Oddly enough, the war-toughened Luay shows more compassion to Hunter than anyone in the family.The film shifts gears a bit when we start learning more of Hunter's backstory during her trips to the psychiatrist (Zabryna Guevara). This backstory is of course tragic and explains a great deal about Hunter's strange compulsion. It also leads to a sequence with Denis O'Hare, who is a welcome presence in most any movie. The two share a scene that allows Hunter to fill in the gaps of her life.Director Mirabella-Davis doesn't treat the rich as caricatures, but rather symbolic of the self-centeredness that seems to go with wealth. We see good in places we don't expect it. We lack the trust in places we should be able to depend on. Additionally, we question whether finding one's true self through genetics makes any real sense when compared with just making up one's mind about the kind of person they want to be. This is a disturbing, trippy, darker-than-expected film with an interesting score from composer Nathan Halpern. When it veers from the skirts of horror and suspense towards political and social topics, the film loses steam and tries to cram in a bit too much. Still, it's an unusual and creative film with a terrific performance from Ms. Bennett, and leaves us looking forward to the next Mirabella-Davis project.",Swallow
3,deloudelouvain,Good movie about pica disorder.,7,14 June 2020,"First of all I wouldn't categorize this movie as a thriller but more as a drama about a woman suffering of pica disorder, a psychological disorder characterized by an appetite for substances that are largely non-nutritive. To me people with this disorder belong in a mental institute as there is clearly something wrong with them. That said Swallow is an entertaining movie that will get you into conversations about the subject, it surely did for me. The cinematography was on top, quality imaging, everything well shot, and as the story unfolds you never have a dull moment even if it's slow paced. Good acting from the cast as well, Haley Bennett the main character gave a good convincing performance. Overall Swallow is a movie that won't get much negative reviews unless you expect something thrilling or horror like because it's just not that kind of movie. In it's genre it is interesting and worth a watch.",Swallow
4,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - Swallow (2019) 6.9/10,7,14 March 2021,"""If the plot is piled up with unmitigated clichés (cruel, senseless rich people, good-hearted immigrants, a fable of perfect family of origin, the psychological manipulation of negging and nonpology, the list goes on and on...) and Mirabella-Davis might be a lousy fabulist, what gives vitality to SWALLOW, besides Katelin Arizmendi's stylish cinematography, is Bennett's metamorphic performance. A frail flower distressed by her parentage (the cat will be let out of the bag later) and conjugal negligence, Bennett, who looks like a poor girl's Jennifer Lawrence, grandly inhabits Hunter's compulsion, disorientation and exasperation with such astonishing finesses, one cannot take eyes off her. Even when we cannot relate to Hunter's weird condition, we are compulsively intrigued by Bennett's nuanced delivery and delicate mannerism, hoping some deus ex machina can materialize to save her.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",Swallow

11,jtindahouse,Not the film I was expecting at all,7,7 March 2020,"I really wish IMDb didn't have horror and thriller tags for this movie. It is neither of those things and that is going to encourage the wrong type of people to see this film. I went in expecting a horror vibe, and ended up enjoying the actual product a lot more than I suspect I would've the alternative.This is a character study, and a really good one at that. Haley Bennett is terrific in the lead role. I love that it showcases the point that even if you have everything a lot of people aspire to get - wealth, marriage, not having to work etc. - that it far from guarantees happiness. It's the old adage of ""Be careful what you wish for"". The ""Swallow"" aspect of this movie is really only there for a point of difference. I understand why they have to name the movie that, but I genuinely believe it would be better off if they'd gone with something different.The ending of this film was the highlight for me. It was handled in such a classy and thought-provoking way. Not everyone may feel satisfied with it and would prefer more of a justice angle to have been taken, but I really liked it. This wasn't the kind of film for the justice angle. I hope people don't go into this film expecting one thing, getting another, and being upset with the film for that. I liked this film and lot and would recommend giving it a look.",Swallow

14,jimbo-53-186511,"It's not uninteresting, but at the same time it's not as good as it could have been",5,30 January 2021,"To many, Hunter is living the idyllic life she is married to a wealthy CEO and is surrounded by her husband's wealthy family and Hunter effectively 'wants for nothing.' However, shortly after becoming pregnant Hunter develops a disturbing obsession to eat inedible objects which causes distress and much puzzlement to her husband, their friends and his family...The premise drew me into this film (although eating inedible objects is rare I cannot deny that there is a high likelihood that it does happen in the real world - allegedly it's known as 'pica'). Therefore I was intrigued and sold by it and wanted to know more and the big question is did the film tickle my fancy by the end? Well yes and no...The problem I had with this film is that it has a subject matter that is interesting, but said interesting subject matter does not translate into a thrilling film. Had the film been marketed purely as a drama I may have cut it a bit more slack, but the write up defintely suggests you're in for something thrilling which is mostly not the case here.That being said Swallow is not entirely without merit; Haley Bennett (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Jennifer Lawrence) is superb in this film - her delicate voice and subservient nature perfectly encapsulate the fragility of her character. Once you pass the hour mark, the film makes some interesting revelations and although Hunter being born as a result of a rape is quite a horrific concept this does prove relevant in tieing things together later.From an early stage we can clearly see that Hunter is heavily-controlled by her husband and his family and that she is constantly reminded how 'lucky she is' by her husband's parents. Hunter's husband and parents portray the atypical 'rich people' who effectively deal with Hunter's problems by 'throwing money at them' rather than providing her with the emotional support that she needs.Things come to a head when Hunter meets her biological father (the rapist) and following this conversation she forces a miscarriage. I interepreted this in several ways; if she doesn't give birth to Richie's child she has no ties to him thus eliminating his element of control, if she doesn't give a birth to a child whose biological father doesn't love her she is not making the same mistake as her mother and if she eliminates both of these complications she can simply start a fresh. Well that was my take on things anyway.Swallow gave me a lot to think about which is why I'm not totally hating on it, but my issue is that if I'm lead to believe that a film is a thriller then it should have some thrilling elements, but this film doesn't. The eating 'inedible objects' seems to stem from psychological trauma for Hunter both past and present which is what really makes this film interesting however I wish there would have been more thrills and spills thrown into the mix which, for me, would have nudged the film from average to very good or brilliant.",Swallow
15,drownnnsoda,"A woman, stifled",9,18 April 2020,"""Swallow"" follows Hunter, a young woman who has married into a wealthy family. Despite her privileged new life, she is emotionally stifled in both her marriage and her domestic life, and the realization of this is compounded when she discovers she is pregnant. She soon develops an unusual coping mechanism: She begins to ingest inedible objects, leading to potentially disastrous consequences.Though marketed as a horror film of sorts, ""Swallow"" is truly more of a psychological drama. Visually, it makes nods to a number of horror films, namely ""Rosemary's Baby"" and the works of David Cronenberg--but the narrative arc, though distressing and at times suspenseful, is not exactly horror, despite having its fingers on the pulse of it. No less, this directorial debut from Carlo Mirabella-Davis is a powerful odyssey through one woman's extremely dangerous psychological disorder.On a purely cinematographic level, ""Swallow"" is stunning--it is bathed in colorful contrasts and sleek locations. The interior of the home in which it takes place evokes a repressive 1950s feel in terms of its decor, which falls in line with the ""Stepford Wives"" tone it evokes. The visuals, however, are only mere supplements to the screenplay, which is a truly original piece of work, and one that travels into places rarely, if ever, are brought to screen. Haley Bennett's performance here is quietly measured and wholly effective; as much as the character plays up the role of subservient wife/coquette for her husband's sake, Bennett manages to generate a constant, quiet undercurrent of anxiety, insecurity, and impulse to sabotage that leaves the whole film feeling as though it is teetering on the brink of chaos.By the end of it all, the film resolved itself in a place I had not necessarily expected, but it is a no less fitting conclusion to this very unique story. Definitely worthwhile viewing for fans of psychological dramas or deep-dives into the nature of mental illness. The journey here is haunting, nail-biting, and poignant by turns. 9/10.",Swallow
16,andrewchristianjr,ENDING FELT INCOMPLETE.,8,5 June 2021,"Swallow starts simple, delighting our eyes thanks to the outstanding camera work. The story then gets problematic, causing good suspense.

And, well, it certainly was, although it kinda felt incomplete.",Swallow
17,masonfisk,CHEW ON THIS ONE...!,7,26 January 2021,"From last year comes a horror film of the suburban kind starring Haley Bennett (who produced here as well). Bennett (who I remember as the spacey singer in that Hugh Grant/Drew Barrymore comedy Music & Lyrics) is a recently married housewife whose husband is man of means (family means that is since the parents, played by David Rasche & Elizabeth Marvel, have bought their expansive & expensive abode) & all is well on the surface w/Bennett looking like a 50's housewife (w/her close cropped coif of blonde bob) out of a House & Gardens magazine spread where she spends her days keeping house (& playing the occasional game of Candy Crush on her iphone) & waiting for her hubby to arrive w/an intricately prepared meal waiting for him. Something is off however (it would have to be since this is a horror tale!) when we see Bennett suffers from a Pica disorder (she eats traditionally considered non-edible objects; marbles, dirt & in some extreme cases w/her sharp objects) so when she becomes pregnant & is rushed to the hospital due to stomach pain, the gruesome contents she's swallowed are discovered sending the family into a tailspin since for them the baby which is about to be born is paramount (so much so at one point an ultimatum is put to her; either get well or give up the baby & divorce the son). Further hampered by having an ex-pat from Syria as her constant on site male nurse, things seems to be getting better but when a mental hospital stay is mandated she makes her getaway. Being a Sundance Institute property (which can be work-shopped from script to screen sometimes to death but sometimes to a better state of being), I feel the weakest aspect of the film feels more like a traditional Hollywood resolution (a dark figure from her past, played by indie stalwart Denis O'Hare, is confronted while her 'malady' seems to cure itself once she's extricated herself from the harsh microscopic confines she'd been subjected to) rather than the organic nature of the disease (which I would assume most people have never heard about) & how alien it can be to outsiders. Bennett is however the best thing about the film (she's been cultivating a strong roster of roles as of late) taking advantage of the showcase she's been thrust in. Also starring Lauren Velez (NY Undercover anybody?) as O'Hare's love interest & Nicole Kang (currently on Batwoman) as a wife of one of Bennett's husband's co-workers.",Swallow
18,questl-18592,Gasp,9,17 October 2020,"I was weirdly taken with this movie. Reading the description, I was pretty hesitant about actually watching it but I'm so glad I did.Swallow is a slow, ponderous, captivating and cringe-inducing story of a woman who's life is slowly unraveling when she finds that lap of luxury she's lovingly married into turns out to actually be a stifling gilded cage.The psychological turmoil that Bennett portrays was really subtle and moving. We don't get a string of explanatory diatribes, we get her performance and it absolutely works.This is hard to watch at times though. Our lead character does love up to the title. She swallows things. Things that shouldn't be swallowed and it's hard to watch but I found it incredibly effective.Swallow is wonderful example of slowly building psychological distress and simultaneously a display of Bennett's skill. This is going to be a really unpleasant experience for a lot of people but if you can appreciate the exploration of the psyche then you may just enjoy the journey this takes you on.",Swallow
19,valleyjohn,A different form of mental ilness,8,25 July 2020,"I've never heard of the condition called Pica . Why anyone would want to eat sharp or dangerous objects is beyond my reasoning but when you watch this film you soon realise that this can be triggered by many stressful incidents that may have occurred or are occurring in your life .This is the story of young housewife in a seemingly perfect marriage who develops pica, the irresistible urge to ingest inedible objects and materialYou might be excused for thinking that this is a horror film . It's not .
It's a study of a woman who has no life to speak of . Sure she has money ( or her husband has ) and a beautiful house but what goes with that are materialistic , self obsessed in-laws and a partner who barely notices her . They are horrible people . The worst of it is , an incident the past is eating her up .The lead ( Hunter ) is played brilliantly by Haley Bennet . Although she's doing something that is totally ridiculous her performance makes you completely sympathetic.I really liked this film . I hated everyone I was meant to and was on the side of Hunter .
A very good debut feature from director Carlo Mirabella-Davis.",Swallow
20,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting Character Study of a Woman with No Control,8,2 November 2019,"This was a film that kicked off the Nightmares Film Festival that I had the pleasure of attending. I really didn't know a lot about this one, aside from that it had an interesting title. I did learn that this was the first screening that was outside of New York City, which is cool. The synopsis is Hunter (Haley Bennett), a newly pregnant housewife, finds herself increasingly compelled to consume dangerous objects. As her husband and his family tighten their control over her life, she must confront the dark secret behind her new obsession.As the synopsis states, we get to meet our main character Hunter through some interesting interactions. Her husband is Richie (Austin Stowell) and he's the youngest director at the firm that his father is in charge of. His father is Michael (David Rasche) and his mother being Katherine (Elizabeth Marvel). Hunter is not from the same class as them, so she feels out of place. There's even an interesting interaction at a fancy dinner where she is meekly telling a story where Michael cuts her off. She is trying to impress Richie and his family as she doesn't fit in.She then starts to eat things. It starts with a marble and then progresses to things that are much more dangerous like thumbtacks and batteries. When her and husband go to an ultrasound, they notice the foreign items inside. She's taken to emergency surgery to have them removed. This infuriates Richie, as Hunter doesn't know why she's doing this and he's embarrassed. Hunter is upset with him when he shares what is happening with those he works with. She is then taken to therapy as well as having Luay (Laith Nakli), a nurse, to take care of her.Through multiple sessions, some interesting information from her past is revealed. They also don't realize that she is continuing to eat these items. She wants to keep Richie happy, but the more she tries, the more she descends into this madness that has taken her over.Now I wanted to go a little bit vague on the recap here and just kind of outline the general idea. Part of this is being a festival film and also, I really want you to see this and experience the reveals. Something that I picked up on and I don't really think it is a spoiler as it gets revealed pretty early on as well as through the interactions Hunter is having. She doesn't feel that she in control of her life. Since she's trying so hard to impress everyone, she doesn't think of what makes her happy and she probably doesn't even know. On top of that, Richie and his family are rich so they have a high standard there and they're very judgmental.I will warn you though, this film really will be decisive. What happens at the end is actually a hot button issue and many people are definitely against this. I actually liked where this went and is definitely empowering her as a woman. There's also a sad reveal during an interaction with Erwin (Denis O'Hare) that made me tear up. This film does an excellent job at making you feel bad for Hunter, but also feeling hope for the future for her.That will take me to the pacing of this, which I will admit is a bit slow. A lot of that is the type of film. We don't really have a lot going on, but we do in the form of learning about this character and her troubles. This is really a character study of Hunter so we get introduced to her and her situation. It doesn't really waste any time seeing her start eating objects and the effect it has on her. Once her family finds out, it really becomes her becoming a prisoner in her own life. As I said, I really like the character growth there and how this plays out in the end for sure.This then will move us to the acting, which I would say the best performance by far is our star. Bennett is such a pretty woman and it looks like she has it all. It doesn't take long to see that she is quite timid and seems like she's put up with a lot in her life. I like to see her start to take back control to grow into what she becomes in the end. Stowell seems like the perfect husband, but we get glimpses that she's really a jerk. That grows with the film. I thought Marvel and Rasche do well as the overbearing parents of Richie as well. They really portray that feel of being snobby. I thought we had some really good cameos from O'Hare as well as Luna Lauren Velez. I'm a big fan of O'Hare from his stint on American Horror Story. The rest of the cast is fine and round out the movie for what was needed.Next would be the effects that are used in the film. To be honest, this isn't a film like that and it doesn't have a lot. We actually see Hunter put the items in her mouth, but things are then hidden. I think this is definitely a strategic move that works. We see that she actually collects the items from the toilet as well. I do have to give credit to make up as there's a scene of her eating and seeing her as she is broken down. Plus the little bit of blood we get looked real as well. The film though is definitely shot very well and I have to say we get some interesting angles and use of color.Now with that said, I actually really enjoyed this film and kicking off this festival with it really intrigued me for what is to come next. I think this is definitely an interesting character study of this woman that seems like she's happy, but never dealt with past traumas until now. It is paced in a way where it kept things moving, but not a lot necessarily happens. I like how it ends and I think there's some really good acting here. There weren't a lot in the way of effects, but what we get was good. The soundtrack didn't necessarily stand out. It doesn't hurt the film though either. I found this to be a good movie for sure. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but I think if you like types of films like this than you can definitely find some interesting things here.",Swallow
21,arungeorge13,A compelling psychological thriller that occasionally falls short! [+59%],6,20 May 2020,"Carlo Mirabella-Davis makes a strong case for body autonomy in the form of 'Swallow', set against the backdrop of pica - an eating disorder. It's told almost entirely from the perspective of Hunter Conrad, a supposedly fine homemaker who is living with her husband (the wealthy CEO of his father's corporation) at their wonderful lakeside home. Hunter is initially shown to be happy playing the at-home-wife's role and considers herself lucky to be where she is - we're told she hails from a lower strata of the society. She enjoys deciding the drapes of the house, planting flowerbeds near the pool, and cooking meals for her husband.The signs of her obsession to consume inanimate items is spectacularly showcased in a family dinner scene. Hunter is coerced into telling something embarrassing by her husband, but her father-in-law deems it trivial and cuts her off midway to discuss ""more significant office matters"". Hunter then gazes at ice melting in a glass and noticeably crunches a few cubes in her mouth. This is shrugged off as a thing that happened.Before we know it, things escalate. Hunter begins to feel a sense of momentary liberation with each object she consumes and defecates. The horror here is intricate but not always palpable, and that's the beauty of it. That she ingests reasonably sharp objects while being pregnant, will make your stomach churn to a fair extent. Haley's performance is incredible - the mystifying smile she puts up after gulping stuff down is a knockout! The supporting cast, featuring the likes of Austin Stowell, Denis O'Hare, Laith Nakli, David Rasche, and Elizabeth Marvel, is quite solid.The film then moves to a subplot concerning Hunter's past. In the meantime, a domestic help is hired by the Conrads. The caretaker relates to Hunter's turmoil - he's from war-torn Syria. There's an amusing scene where she hides under a bed (after trying not to eat soil) and he just lays by her side, comforting her. What follows felt like a déjà vu of the opening scene from Leigh Whannell's The Invisible Man (my bad that I watched Swallow weeks after The Invisible Man, maybe!).The closure to the aforementioned subplot is, while not too convincing, completes Hunter's character arc in its own peculiar way. I'd have liked some more exchanges between Hunter and her mother, or even some of her acquaintances, instead of just the Conrads. I get it that the writer-director wants to focus on how the husband and the in-laws begin exerting more of their authoritative influences on her body (now carrying the family's scion). But, for the film to have had greater impact, it should have shed a little extra light on how she ended up with Richard, how the Conrads do not have a clue of her background, and more on those lines.Nathan Halpern's twitchy music and Davis' unusual choice of visuals (and color palette) compounds the severity of many a scene. While it's not recommended for everyone's viewing, it's a film that I'll keep in mind for those who seek unsettling, psychological horror.",Swallow
22,omendata,A Bit Hard To Swallow,4,10 April 2020,"Interesting idea, good music, acting was good but every one of the characters in this are totally one dimensional and totally unlikeable which did not help from the start or was this by design? If so then not a good idea! The main thread of Pica was not really explored enough either although if you google it you will get more of an idea how it relates to pregnancy and OCD.It does once again have a liberal agenda with the not so subtle Syrian refugee interjecting to highlight the difference in lifestyles between rich and poor and how you can be rich but have an empty life bereft of joy and meaning and then pokes a finger at the controversial topic of abortion in the USA, all very heavy and depressive stuff so if you are not feeling in a particularly good frame of mind this might have you reaching for the razor blades.The acting is good but rings hollow and not sure why this is classified as horror when it is actually just a slow burn drama but if you are into sad, depressing explorations of mental illness and obsession then this might be up your street but for me it leaves me cold and not what I call a Friday night entertainment movie!",Swallow

She ate an ice cube at the restaurant and she's swallowing unusual stuff like a single colorful marble. The guy is such a pr1ck. She's so grateful to her husband and his family because she was poor and she's become rich when she got married to her. She swallowed a screw with a needle and cried. She's crying and being weird home alone while her husband's at work. She bled after defeating it while his husband was having fun with his drunk friends by the pool. The gynecologist noticed the objects she swallowed and she had to undergo an operation. Her husband got mad at her. She started to see a therapist and Richie hired a Syrian immigrant to keep an eye on her all the time. She told the therapist that her mother got raped and her father did jail time and she's the product of that crime. When she overheard that her therapist was sharing this with her husband, she had panic attack and took refuge under the bed and she and the Syrian guy fell asleep there. She woke up before him and swallowed a giant nail and they rushed her to the hospital to have an operation. She was about to stay at a psychiatric hospital until the baby's born but with the help of the guy, she escaped the house and stayed at a motel where she ate dirt like it was popcorn while watching a movie. Her mother didn't want her to Come over and she showed up at the birthday party of the daughter of her father. It was really hard to watch their conversation. She went to a doctor to have an abortion. She took the pills and bled into a toilet bowl in a shopping mall bathroom. I expected to watch a horror film and I watched a nice drama.

37,TwistedContent,"The Psychological Weight of ""Swallow""",7,7 March 2020,"Writer and director Carlo Mirabella-Davis delivers her feature debut ""Swallow"", a character study, a film built on psychology of abuse, isolation, alienation, depression and obsession. In its center, Haley Bennett puts on a great performance as a newly-wed, newly pregnant housewife who's psyche is slowly crumbling and who can't find any stable ground or control over her life. ""Swallow"" is a rarely rich movie, but not with plot, characters or action.""Swallow"" is a carefully and patiently composed psychological study, clothed up in pastel-like colors and sure-handed, competent and clean-feeling cinematography. The viewer follows Hunter (Haley Bennett) as she struggles to find an emotional ground in her new life in which she has rushed in unprepared. Even though Hunter has it all - wealth, money, free time - ""Swallow"" makes a good point in saying that materialistic means do not guarantee happiness. Hunter's husband and his family are a controlling, untrustworthy and egoistical bunch, making her suffer even more. Trying to escape the painful routine, Hunter develop a compulsive, obsessive habit to swallow various small things, rocks, needles, marbles, even batteries. On the journey we also learn about the weight of past traumas on her shoulders - on the journey to the eventual resurrection of the mind and free will. Haley Bennett shines all throughout this journey, in a brave and intimate portrayal of a troubled woman. ""Swallow"" isn't a plot-based movie, but that should already be apparent... It also doesn't exactly fit in the horror genre & long story short, the way its marketed could be misleading to a lot of people who'll like it less for those reasons. There's a level of absurdity and surrealism, but well self-acknowledged and tailored together truly tightly, making ""Swallow"" feel like a borderless yet solidified piece of mood and contemplation cinema. An art-house with such a psychological weight that it makes up in substance where plot and some other usual, conventional elements do not.Despite ""Swallow"" being a successful and impressive oddball future cult drama presenting (always) relevant issues in women and, truthfully, the entire society, it also has flaws, like a pacing that is consistent to a fault (never really picks up), lack of story and the fact that it won't satisfy the more mainstream audiences. Not that I care much, I recommend this to those who get intrigued by what can be described as ""odd"" or ""weird"" as much as myself. My rating: 7/10.",Swallow
38,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,A disciplined slow-burner that's relatively...easy to swallow,8,30 September 2020,"A very impressive debut feature film from director Carlo Mirabella-Davis. This movie is full of beautiful coloring, cinematography, environments, and music. It's tastefully directed, edited, and acted, and the intriguing concept even has a wrap-around meaning that is...somewhat easy to swallow, in the end. When I finished the movie last night, I felt a bit like the ending felt lackluster and rather disconnected from the rest of the film, but, upon thinking about it as I awoke this morning, I saw the direct parallel between everything, which really gave the whole experience true cohesion.It's pretty clear though, that the strongest suit of the entire film, is the colossal performance by lead actress Haley Bennett, who is a new face to me, but one that I will not be forgetting. She sells her spellbound character with flying colors. By the end of the film, she may very well have struck you with her emotive capability.The only thing that stops the film from being a harder recommend is that it is a true slow-burner, all the way through, making this movie more likely to fare better with the patient, and those who are fans of film as artistry. Due to this, I also don't see it as having much replay value, but overall this is a decadent offering and still one of the best movies I have seen come out in 2020.

But, though the movie just used the disorder as the vehicle, I felt that the story was driven really well, with very satisfactory pacing, performances, cinematography and direction.Haley Bennet was good in her role, and she also had a certain level of warmth about her that made her pleasant to watch, while I also liked how Richie's role was written and portrayed by Austin Stowell, as the movie walked a tightrope quite well between depicting Richie's charm and underlying narcissism.Though Swallow wasn't a magnificent watch, it was however a great watch, with good performances and up to scratch technical executions. 7/10.",Swallow

When someone has low self-estees is despised, she would feel like she is said that she's a worthless person. So, she tried enduring by something like self-harm.As a human being, it's completely off the rails to stay the situation which you can't take care even yourself. ""Nobody takes care you when you're true to yourself"". What a hell life that is if you have to stay there while you feel so.

Yeah, let's call it that.At its core, it's about how we deal with the things thrust upon us, that we have had to swallow and hold inside: Hunter in her fish-out-of-water marriage; her feelings of inadequacy around her husband, his parents and their societal trappings; the compartmentalized manner of her own conception.After being given a self-help pregnancy book by her mother-in-law, she fixates on a passage telling her to ""try new things"". So she goes on what may seem like an odd adventure of eating inedible items. But pregnancy-induced cravings (for foods as well as non-foods, i.e. pica) are a legitimate and frequent topic of concern and study in the field of obstetrics.As Hunter's cravings lead to complications with her pregnancy, her over-bearing in-laws tighten their grip on Hunter's everyday life to protect their son's heir. And during one of her mandated therapy sessions, Hunter's true secret comes out. She is the product of a non-consensual attack perpetuated on her mother.From there the movie reveals its major question. Were Hunter's repressed feelings on her own creation subconsciously causing her to eat harmful things in order to end the pregnancy that tethers her to a superficial, unhappy, unfulfilling and oppressed existence?After confronting the source of her pain, Hunter ultimately takes control with a variation on the movie's main theme.

Haley Bennett is in almost every scene and she competently carries this movie with her quite remarkable acting range. Not knowing much about Pica, I dismissed that the compulsion to eat soil or nails or whatever was just ridiculous, but the scene in which she couldn't help but look at the thumbtack on the kitchen counter, with all the tortured expressions on her face, single-handedly educated me on this form of mental illness. It was as if the object was summoning her, giving her an opportunity to possess something she could be in control of. This movie was definitely a worthy rental, and could have been an intriguing blockbuster in the theaters if the pandemic hadn't shut everything down! My one complaint is about the ending which seemed a bit rushed and abrupt.

Externally, she looks like an ice-cold pretty blonde, but there's something vulnerable about her. Her eyes hide some dark, ugly and sad secret. Her in a movie about a strange subject matter I know little about was exciting. I anticipated a psychological thriller about what compels a woman to swallow inedible and harmful objects. More of her backstory pre-marriage would've been nice. Where's the character development? Instead I got a visual lecture about lambs being slaughtered to bring lamb chops to our plates. Am I supposed to feel guilty about eating meat? Is this a vegan psa? A psychiatrist actually asked her patient why her Mom didn't abort her because she was a product of rape. The patient responds her family is ""right-wing religious nuts"". My Jamaican, lifelong Democrats parents, don't believe in abortion. Why is this movie pushing an agenda and generalizing people? Then, there's the total disregard for life, as if it can literally be flushed away like waste. The acting was good. Agenda pushing aside, it wasn't a bad movie.

53,RMurray847,Interesting movie that fails to truly impact the viewer,5,11 January 2021,"As the title and cover image suggest, this film is about a young woman with the unusual psychological condition of pica, which compels her to swallow non-food items, including some pretty dangerous stuff. That makes the movie immediately interesting, but unfortunately, the pica feels more like a hook to make us watch a more conventional movie about a ""young housewife"" whose domestic situation is dreadful and how she reacts to it.Hunter (played very well by Hayley Atwell...best thing about the film) is recently married and lives in a BEAUTIFUL house along the Hudson River. Her handsome husband works in the city, and it busy and successful and only pays sporadic attention to her. He's affectionate at times, distant at others times and in yet other times, he is alarmingly nasty to his bride. (I have no idea how these two could ever have met. I can't envision what circles she moved in that overlapped with his...unless he specifically went looking for a ""nice, slightly dim girl"" to take care of his house and give him children without complaint.) And to make her even more miserable, she has very condescending, opinionated in-laws. (And her own family may not have been great either.) All-in-all, her existence is unhappy.So she copes by giving in to her compulsion. So it's a domestic drama colliding with a movie about pica. And it doesn't really work. If it's a domestic drama, the characters in her circle are too one-dimensional and unlikeable to really be believable. Hunter is sympathetic (to a degree...she is sometimes SO lackluster as to be borderline boring as a character) and everyone around her is a cardboard villain. If it's a move about pica, we really never learn much about it. She has a terrible therapist and clearly doesn't get the help she needs. The film nicely shows us how her need to swallow dangerous objects is a deep compulsion and how awfully it impacts her physically (a couple of moments are certainly cringe-worthy) but we get no true insights into this disease.I guess, in the end, I would say SWALLOW strained credulity just a little too much. Not because of the course of her disease...I assume it does cause self-destructive behavior like we're shown, but because of the poorly developed secondary characters. They don't behave like fully flesh-out people, but rather like caricatures. And these caricatures don't always behave in convincing ways. Certainly, we root for Hunter to ""win"" against the forces aligned against her...but I wouldn't say I was invested in the outcome. It's an interesting movie, but one I only recommend to viewers looking for something different and ambitious (and don't mind seeing that ambition come up short).",Swallow
54,ccamp89,Strong 2.5 // Heavy-Handed,5,1 May 2020,"Swallow has the building blocks of a great film: an enticing premise, striking visuals, and an earnest attempt at psychological depth. For a debut feature, there is a fair amount to admire as Carlo Mirabella-Davis comes through with a few compelling images and unsettling moments. Unfortunately, though, they're just that: images and moments, fleeting and disconnected, adrift in a film that feels amorphous and undercooked.Davis sets the stage for a deep dive into the psychology of masochism, self-harm, and shame only to frustratingly skim the surface. Crucial character revelations are doled out via clunky expositional therapy scenes. Complex psychopathology is boiled down to the point of contrivance. Heavy-handed and banal moments abound - a narcissistic husband comically absorbed in his phone over dinner, a hush ripples through a party as a character experiences embarrassment, a sex offender psychoanalyzes himself on command. Save for a few scattered moments, it's consistently trite and settles for cheap theatrics.Its biggest saving grace is Haley Bennett, who gives a convincing performance despite the lackluster material. She has an alluring quality and impresses a number of times with both restrained and emotionally intense moments. It's a shame, though, that her character feels increasingly inconsistent as the film progresses, amassing an unlikely blend of conflicting traits that warp to suit the disjointed narrative: naive and aloof at times, domineering and unhinged at others.I do admire the film on some level for its attempt at tackling this challenging subject matter and there are some sparks that fly here and there. But it isn't enough to conceal the serious foundational flaws, and the film ultimately rings hollow.Strong 2.5/5",Swallow

63,lucifer_over_tinseltown,Deeper Throat,5,21 April 2020,"A Pica disorder would surely spell suicide for me, as I have trouble even swallowing the smallest pill. So fear has a way of piquing the curiosity; figured I'd give this one a go. Haley Bennett is, as always, a beautiful eyeful. The girl you wished lived next door with that classic, zaftig, reverse S-shape figure. Instead you get some Frances McDormand look-a-like always asking if you have a spare beer. In the past, Bennett has been kneecapped by lousy directors and insipid scripts. Those films were so dull and repetitive with plain landscapes best viewed through kaleidoscopes. Not this one. The cinematography is lush, vibrant and, at times, stunning. As are the settings along the Hudson Valley. And how about that house! Sadly, she squanders it in this. Her performance teeters on near Xanax overdose. Maybe she was going for this, considering she plays a woman not only with Pica but also PTSD. Still, there is a sleepwalking through the role thing happening here. Her movements are glacial, much like the film's pacing. At least her character develops. Near the end, her ice melts, and we see some of the old Haley we know and love. Signs of life. The rest do not. They are more like bad ideas about characters, skeletal and under-imagined, rather than actual, fleshed out characters. This makes the entire storyline hard to, well, swallow...like a battery or a jack.Since I'm at the end of the review, I'd like to address one more thing. Something that gave me tsuris and caused me to take umbrage. I nearly gave the movie a 1 out of 10 because of this. The gratuitous, heartless depiction of animal cruelty in the beginning of the film has no place here or anywhere for that matter. I see what the ham-handed director was trying to do with this. Symbolism. Metaphor. Whatever. It's a cold, cruel, clumsy attempt at film poetry. Go and study the films of Herzog or Roeg. Watch how the masters do it without shock, just substance. It's what they don't show. What they leave to the imagination. This is what makes the lasting impression.",Swallow

67,nikxatz,"Well, the ticket had a fine taste!",6,22 December 2019,"Swallow was the 3rd film I got to check at the 60th Thessaloniki iflm Festival and I really wanted to watch this just because its concept is so interesting and creative. I was looking forward to seeing a great stylisitc horror film weith some disturbing images and bits of political critique. All of these stuff are there, but in wrong portions.
The first half feels that is really building to a crap story. By the time the character statrs this brand new mania of swallowing sharp objects i was really interested to see where that could go. But the film does not really fully embrace this idea. Instead, we are seeing the main actress under surveilance and it nver explodes to a horrendous masacre that could have easily come out of such an over-the-top mania.As the film goes on though, it becomes obvious that this is not a gorry horror film but instead a kind of a disturbing take on the meanipulative relationship between this couple. The man is the paradigm of a dump rich, so much that it feels really cliche and courtounsih and kind of annoying that she really thinks he really loves her. She just cares for his images and shirts and house. The main actress is more of a housewife that has to do the hosue chores and she is badly treated by her husband. So, to me swallowing htings works more as a metaphor for the fact that she has to swallow al this mean behavior because societry says htat women ido the work in the house and men are the ones in charge. I reallyl liked that idea, it's clever and really makes the film more mature, but the chancee for a maginficent horror with over-the-top humour and disturbing context is nver really there.
The entire 3rd act is about her journey to find her family and get away from her husband and his family who are pretending to love her and treat her right. And then we have the geniously done scene were she just opens the tv and is watching sth while eating soil, a metaphor to pop-corn of course. This scene brought me so mutch laughter and joy because it played with this idea in a hillarious way. If only the film had more of such scenes that portray how too-much the whole scenario feels like, it would be a far more enteraining and memorable ride. Insead, from a point and on the film becomes a drama about women trying to find a place in a world that mistreats them. And yes, the message is great and the connection to her mania is quite clever. It shows how harshly women have been and our trreated by weathy, dump people and families and how inprisoned and lonely their life feels like. But, I wanted so much more form such a bold idea. It's like the film had a chance to blend splatter horror, disturbing images, clever comedy and political and social critique about how the society shapes women's lives and puts us in tiny boxes. Yes, it sounds like a difficult feat to do, but if it just tried to be less safer and do more creative stuff in the end... damn... it would be a dream! It's becomes your usual faminine drama, which is fine, but c'mon i wanted more.After all, besides my desires, the fiolm did not dissappoint. It had a bunch of disturbing moments, the social and political messages work fine for the story and the direction and presentation are great and feel really atmospheric and well-thought. The performances are great and Haley Bennett was amazing in this one. The soundtrack is great too, gives quite an energy to the film.Swallow has a great texture, but, by the time I've swallowed it, I wanted it to be a little more pointy, a little more on the edge.",Swallow
68,canadude,A movie about struggling to get free,8,8 March 2020,"As several users point out, ""Swallow"" is about a woman struggling for control and autonomy in a situation in which she increasingly has less and less of it - or, to put it more accurately, a situation in which she is subject to others' control more and more. So, at the same time, this is a movie about the social control over women, exerted by society.The control exercised over the main character manifests in different ways. It manifests in the the main character Hunter's husband dismissing her every time she tries to share a thought or idea. It manifests in the husband's parents' constant reminders that they are the source of the lavish lifestyle she enjoys now that she's married their son. It manifests in the oppressive upper class atmosphere, in which she's expected to be perfect, to say little, and to entertain his husband's friends and relatives. It manifests in her husbands outbursts when she makes a mistake and, let's face it, in the way she becomes secondary to the child she has in her belly. Then, increasingly, once they learn of Hunter's swallowing of various objects, it begins to manifest more directly, as Hunter and his parents attempt to control and surveil her behavior inside the house. Finally, control manifests in the trauma that drives her increasingly self-destructive behavior, stemming from an event in the past that also concerns power men have over women.Not only men try to control Hunter - her husband's mother is particularly terrifying here, communicating how little worth Hunter has without her husband under the guise of being her ally. But that is the point - patriarchy is a system of belief so ingrained that everyone is susceptible here. At the same time, she finds a real ally in a male nurse paid by the family to watch over her, from a war torn country who understands oppression.But to see ""Swallow"" as simply a movie about control is to miss its focus, which is on the lengths people will go to for a measure of independence and autonomy. From swallowing various objects to a decision Hunter makes near the end of the film, particularly juxtaposed against her dark back story, ""Swallow"" is about reclaiming choice. And all of this works, especially as it becomes increasingly twisted, because of Haley Bennett's performance and the austere cinematography.",Swallow

It has the opportunity to go deep into this character who suffers from PICA. So, for the most part of the movie you see this affliction from the perspective of a woman that suffers this condition. But the third act is a political stand about positive abortion. Yeap, they throw that in your face without dealing with the actual storyline that from most part of the movie is going in a different direction.

I didn't start eating small objects. While they touched on serious issues that people do face, their portrayal is bizarre and the script is dry beyond dry. For the past 16-17 years, most movies are a financial loss and the production studios have relied on a few big movies each year to make their money. However in the past 4-5 years, even the big movies are barely breaking even, and they've had to drastically reduce the budgets of movies across the board. This means unpolished scripts, minimal substance, lack of supporting actors, lack of filming locations, general lack of motivation for all involved, etc. Instead they rely on being bizarre rather than creative.

The Assistant
Invisible Man
Shirley""Swallow"" is a 2019 film about Hunter - a young, pregnant housewife who has a seemingly perfect life. Coming from a bad background, she managed to get a good husband who provides her with anything she needs, and her in-laws are nice and understanding.But then Hunter discovers something peculiar about herself. She stars to feel an insatiable urge to swallow different objects, that should not be swallowed. A glass ball here, a chess piece there.. And although she doesn't realize this, this new diet is the only thing that she could ever decide for herself, the only thing that she has power over; because her life has long turned into a nightmare controlled by somebody else, without her noticing it.
One of the worst things you could do to a person is to stop them from expressing themselves. To silence their voice in such a way, that they think you're actually doing them a favor. And then they got to ask themselves: ""am I a pretender or am I an individual?""Swallow is a very tough and a very serious film. Like ""Bombshell"", it uses cinema to express things that are incredibly hard to express with words. There has been a trend on ""domestic"" horror, which take place in the real world, where everyday things turn into something horrifying, and where all the monsters are the people around us (""Hereditary"", ""The Assistant"", ""Never, Rarely, Sometimes, Always"").

All of these things lead to the mental illness that makes her take back control in the way of swallowing random objects just to feel like she has an eminent of choice in her life.

It's never quite horrific enough for horror fans, there's not a lot of suspense, and it's probably too disturbing for more traditional drama fans, but it packs a major, unexpected punch thanks to an astounding performance by Haley Bennett.Swallow revolves around a recently pregnant housewife named Hunter (Bennett) who spends her days cleaning, eating, and watching TV. Her husband (Austin Stowell) and his parents are somewhat dismissive of her and have a habit of cutting her off before she can speak. In a cry for help, Hunter begins eating strange items such as marbles, paper clips, and batteries.Her new hobby goes unnoticed for only so long before she's outed and her new family tries to get to the bottom of her behavior and we learn that it could be tied to a less than ideal childhood.Bennett's holds Swallow together with her sad, haunting performance. Never have a series of forced smiles at a dinner party been so painful to watch. She's in just about every shot of the film and her performance is what you come out of the film remembering.The film takes a turn midway through where you might get nervous that the filmmakers aren't sure where they're going, but it ends in a satisfying and very pro-woman way which I appreciated.Swallow is one of those kinds of films they just don't make very often.

-
Swallow (2019) I was pleasantly surprised that I was not completely grossed out by her eating objects you're not supposed to eat, like batteries, thumbtacks, statues, and much more. It didn't linger on the chewing or swallowing, making the noises really grotesque, but highlighted how she felt during and after. They also planted ideas that kept coming back, the dude asking for a hug, the mother trying to further control her and her appearance, the photo of the father/rapist who gets a part in the final act. The fear she had after they pumped her stomach for the first time!!! I was scared too like damn shorty, that's a lot of stuff just sitting in your body. I enjoyed her convo with the therapist and her escape at the end with the help of Luay, and how casual the abortion in the end was, she just flushed the toilet and went to start her life. Good for her✨
-
Cons: I did want to see some kind of moment where she got money from the husband and the father/rapist but she seemed to float out of that bathroom in the end with hope and endless possibilities, in control looking free. If she had some kind of money to be able to start out her new life I would have felt a little more relief and not worried at the ending credits.-
I give it a 9, only thing to make it better would probably be small tweaks that made it more of a horror film, Killing the father/rapist or the controlling family she married into, that would have satisfied me but this one was a quiet rebellion and more body horror. And she stayed soft spoken and sweet but when she got control was just a tad more bold, it wasn't like a 180 where she's using language she hadn't before and completely shed her shy persona.

So much more could have been done to explore the real issue here which is what to do with oneself in a situation like this. Choosing a supposedly politically correct answer did a huge disservice to the issues the characters was going through.

The behavior becomes a form of self-harm to control and provoke a solution for an underlying neurosis, as well as for not being truly seen by her husband. Her compulsion worsens until she gets detected, which becomes a blow for the husband's ego for not being able to predict his wife, resulting in him trying to medicate and control her.Although trying to help her, his career sentiments seem to get in the way of actually recognizing his spouse for who she is apart from a housewife. Since she is lacking in self-worth, she is compliant and blames herself. The family hires a psychologist and a body guard to watch her, which exacerbates the problem. As it turns out, her condition stems from a suppressed childhood trauma, as often is the case. She lets her psychologist know her mother was raped which resulted in her own birth. This explains why the trauma suddenly came about during pregnancy, where swallowing sharp objects became a control mechanism to compensate for the fact that she was conceived in an involuntary manner. Luckily, she is able to escape her husband's efforts to hospitalize her and manages to find and confront her father, which ends up resolving her trauma.A story of a woman who needed to be seen and understood but almost ends up in a mental institution. The movie illustrates how modern formal psychology often fails to address the underlying soul, how superficial relationships prevent real communication, and how important piety, acknowledgement and family is for human well-being. It also shows the complexity and emotional depth of a woman, which is often neglected or feared by the male counterpart for not being able to understand it.",Swallow

He didn't want to watch it at first because he said the ""her eating things"" would give him bad shivers all throughout... but we finally decided to watch it. We came across this movie after watching ""The Girl on the Train"".I don't think the trailer for this movie does it justice. But it does lay the story right out on the table.What I found most captivating about this movie was how much of a sweet soul Hunter is. The main character. She's so soft spoken and liked having a purpose. She'd get upset like anyone else, but she's way more pure than anyone else as well. You really feel for her.I don't want to spoil the plot twist (if you can even call it a twist.. rather a plot ""add-in"") but it was powerful and in my opinion had a message. A message that dealing with problems head on, looking at fear right in the face can be just that, powerful. And helpful at that. And if you watch the movie you'll see why.What I ended up liking most about the movie was it's ending. Simple with a strong message. In simple and few words, I'd sum up the message to, ""You Never Know What Someone Else Is Going Through"". What I took from the ending was to be kind to our neighbors, our sisters and most importantly, strangers. You could simply walk past a person on the street not knowing how awful their day has been. Everyone is going through something. And everyone puts on a brave face to the world.I really really liked this movie!! Very simple but relatable. We all do things and react certain ways when we're older from experiences or traumas we faced when younger. And it *IS* possible to change our ways. And to become whole again. Every experience and trauma is sure, different than the next. But progress is possible. And life can be beautiful and simple at the same time.I'm someone that, if I like something? I'll watch it again in a year or something.. movies & tv shows. I like to end my reviews with mentioning if this is something I'd re-watch or not. It's not captivating enough to re-watch.

She has a nice house, a baby on the way, and a husband. But she isn't happy. She knows she should be and she is in love with the ideas of those things but not them themselves. This is mostly because she isn't in control of make a single decision regarding them. The only thing we see she controls is decorating the nursery because her husband allows her to. She eventually develops pica. When her husband and his family find out they try to control her life more. From hiring a babysitter to watch her 24/7 to what she eats. She isn't even in control of who hears about what she is going through. Shown in two scenes. One is at her husband's birthday party she finds out everyone there knows about her illness, and the other she over hears her therapist telling her husband something she told her in a session.

Or really?Passivity has burdened Hunter without her conscious knowing and she copes by controlling her diet - this way she is finally gets to control a certain part of her life. In the film, the audience will be able to pick up on the intention that they wanted to portray how Hunter's choices became her's but the portrayal of this intention blurs the line of patronization.While feminism is also tackled given the gained assertiveness of Hunter to make her own choices, it is picked up from the consequent-ignorant angle that puts this film under the irresponsible category. It was very reckless of the filmmakers to portray the story with the danger of putting importance on ""choice"" regardless of consequences. My primary reasons being that there was no portrayal for the closure with the husband, no scene whatsoever to explain that the essence of gaining independence and control should not be to the detriment of self and others, products of rape children, and pica.

150,chocolatepopcorn,Wow!!,9,28 November 2020,"This movie was a wild ride from beginning to finish, I've never seen anything like it in my whole life and I highly doubt I will again. The tags for this movie threw me off a little bit, but I think that's understandable considering this movie pulled from elements of drama and coming of age sentiments and when consider the content of the film. This is definitely a hard watch and very gross throughout the majority of the film, that aside, all of those moments are drowned out by the context of what's going on in the film. There's abuse, manipulation, selfishness and so many heavy things going on surrounding what is presented to us in the trailer. With that being said, though, it makes for some really incredible and moving moments that left me speechless. This is one of those films that at times could be predictable if you think about it, but a lot of the time what happens is very unpredictable at the same time. It's one of those movies that leaves you thinking and reflecting, despite some flaws. Of course, it's not the ideal or perfect movie and I'm not sure if and when I'll watch it again, but I can't say I don't have the urge to do so. The acting here by Haley Bennett is absolutely superb, I feel that without her presence in the film this wouldn't have been nearly as good. She's one of those actresses that I'm going have to go watch more movies featuring her considering I haven't seen many of her movies except for some from years ago that I barely remember haha. Overall though, if you're looking for horror or to be scared by this film, I don't think this is particularly scary and only set in that genre solely(as I've mentioned above). How the movie is made almost makes it seem like it doesn't a genre because of how different it is, it's definitely a work of art. Had this movie come out not during the pandemic it probably would have done better in numbers than it has. But I think at the end of the day the art of a film will always matter more than trying to make money or cater to the masses, this film is a very good representation of that. I recommend taking the movie with a grain of salt though, it's purely fictitious and meant to promote a deeper meaning. Don't hesitate to see this one while you have the chance.",Swallow

This movie is about a social issue of the mind that compels us to ask ourselves how far are we willing to understand and be there for people who have an uncommon behavioural, probably mental disorder. Haley Bennet is truly a versatile actress, she made sure of that with her performance in this one, there is no question to that.

160,marcusday-77993,Intriguing but ultimately disappointing,6,3 November 2020,"An interesting take on a weird condition, Swallow is well-crafted, very captivating film. Yet it feels like it lacks depth, like it lacks a real vision of the world and the characters at its core beyond its aesthetic qualities.
A film worth watching but in my opinion it is a bit vacuous.",Swallow
161,ashcane,Not a horror but worth the watch!,9,22 February 2021,"Not a horror but I believe it's a psychological thriller. Beautiful cinematography and colour palette coupled with the soundtrack helping the visuals juxtapose with the tough and dark theme. I think the casting really worked bring the film to life. I truly cannot fault it.
I think it is a new favourite of mine! Definitely a must see for any psychological horror fans.",Swallow
162,tastemycandy,Had potential,6,21 May 2021,"This movie kind of frustrated me. I get that the main character suffers from mental illness but why did they have to make her seem like such a bimbo? Her character in general was disappointing. There's this stigma attached to mental illness, pica especially, that the sufferer is dumb. The character really fed into that. I bet when people envision someone with pica they picture someone just like Hunter(the main character). Why not attempt to change the stereotype? Then again, the movie is for entertainment so I guess that worked out. A seemingly dumb girl with pica going around swallowing things and grinning about it. Real entertaining. The storyline was perfectly fine but the main character's personality killed it for me.",Swallow

165,agzv72,Some political propaganda,2,16 May 2020,"When the movie somehow throws trash at a ""Right-wing nut person"", I was kind of celebrating, but then, the final message of Swallow is pro-abortion. ...How can some liberals criticize conservatives for ""not caring about the Covid-19 - deaths just to save the economy"" when they don't care about killing babies just to obtain a personal benefit?",Swallow

167,Herzeleiduk,Little Gem,8,21 April 2020,"Unexpected little gem of a movie. I can't see where the poor reviews are coming from, apart they were expecting a horror. It's a Drama about control and mental illness and how Hunter succumbs to Pica as it's the only thing she has control of in her life and it's superbly done. Haley Bennett carried the movie and was excellent throughout, backed by solid support. Could easily have been a poor horror movie, instead an excellent drama.",Swallow

But this film touch close to home, I've struggle with eating disorders for a long time, and this movie just felt so close, a good representation, also the fear of your partner... It's a fair representation of the kind of personality hunter has an a eating disorder, it feel respectfull and thought trough.
I recomend it to everyone. Plus the acting it's very good.",Swallow

172,allleksandra,Great portrait of a person/woman who wants to get control over her life,9,14 December 2019,"Just saw it on Belgrade Independent American Movies short festival.Very emotional topic.

173,SnowObsessed,This story broke my heart and stung my eyes!,8,15 October 2020,"Tv was on and I happened to walk in the room after the film had just started. I adore the lead actress (she always kills it in her roles, girl on a train is a perfect example) and I found myself sitting down and watching it the whole way through because I couldn't believe what I was watching. Like others have said before, I found myself wanting this poor girl to get some real help, not what she was getting. My eyes would water up and I was even talking to the tv at her, trying to offer my own compassion for her. The ending wasn't all tied up in a happy little bow in some fairytale fashion. It was right for the story- in my opinion anyways. Gave me tremendous empathy for anyone suffering from what she was and why she most likely was. I was sad watching her story but I'm not sorry I watched it at all.",Swallow

You want it to end good for this girl so bad, cant say i have the same struggles as her but i GET it and in a way I cheered her on even though its all so horrible. Cried my eyes out at the ending because its was all right for the first time in her life and we got to see the light burst out of her beautiful eyes. Exceptional acting by Haley Bennett, the visuals are to die for. Will be one of my all time favorites.",Swallow
175,sbchurchill,It's Not About Pica,9,4 January 2021,"If you expect a studio version of My Strange Addiction, don't watch this movie. It's well done, acted, messaged and complicated, like life. Pro life individuals might disagree with the message, but the film is watch worthy. I liked it and was moved by it, the last few minutes and credits are powerful.",Swallow
176,kship202,Unexpectedly Amazing!,10,13 May 2020,"I really didn't know what to expect, but it's such a great story.

180,josslizh,Cinematography was good but...,4,3 May 2021,Too much time to explain the mental disorder. Also i couldnt get why the end had to be so uncomfortable and discouraging with her real problems. But art and photography departament was on fire.,Swallow
181,lwilcox-07389,Amazing psychological drama,10,30 March 2020,"This is not a thriller or a horror movie. This is a somewhat horrifyingly accurate representation of someone trying to fake it til they make it til they break, along with people who initially care but absolutely don't get it. This is almost spot on. I work with people with trauma with mental illnesses like these and the similarities in tone, facial expression, concerns, dress, attempts to garnish approval of lifestyle to feel complete are all scarily accurate. It's also very satisfying.First review ever. Just go into it knowing what you're getting and you'll be impressed. I agree with the reviewers who said ""character study.""",Swallow

183,alferfun,i think should get higher rating,7,21 September 2020,"The film is good, the story is simple but is not boring, but i think the ending could be better. I was expecting her to be able to get better from this pica thing, and maybe could have someone that really supports her, that someone she could rely on, maybe she at last could settle in with his dad maybe or her caregiver maybe, and then eventually Richie found out where she at maybe. but yea its a good movie, definitely worth watching",Swallow

186,Artrus-82,I swallowed,5,31 July 2021,Really interesting story.How a claustrophobic family make flourish physiological issues from the past of the protagonist. Really well portrait into the screen with a really smart treatment of the colours.Wonderful performance from Haley Bennett.Similar to the attraction of the main character to swallow things you get captivated by the film. I guess you could say the scrip is kind of flat as it leaves a feeling that the end has been pushed to be shortened. Still enjoyable.,Swallow

They could have focused on the depth of the characters, it was pretty shallow.The movie is trying to hard to have an European style, in the set design and some of the caracteres styling, but it can't help being as American as it is. That was annoying and kind of embarrassing to watch.",Swallow

194,darkly1977,A serious look into a caged young woman,10,23 May 2021,"Beautifully shot with outstanding sound design, Swallow guides us to a deeper empathy for the weight of forced subservience and the isolation that inherently surrounds it.Haley Bennett is impeccably absorbing, capturing the giddy highs and heart-breaking lows of the human spirit. It's an emotional feast where almost everything happens between the lines.On metaphorical level, Swallow also explores the things we *all* do to deal with past and present trauma, and the forces that make those actions so compulsory.",Swallow
195,gabriellatoth,I love this movie.,9,13 November 2020,"I am writing this while still watching this movie...this whole movie has so much to say. The male female dynamic, the struggle of expressing ones emotions then turning to something self damaging, a husband thinking of the wife as an object, a woman not knowing how to fit in but not realizing she is not where she should be in life, all the while she just doesn't have the strength to change her live. I feel for her and I hate her husband and his family. I don't even know how to put it into words, there is so much to say and so many layers....just watch it. It is a very unique film.",Swallow

Was really excited to see Haley Bennetts review after reading so many positive comments, but found it mediocre and flat.I enjoyed this whole topic of pica, because it brought light to a topic that many people suffer with. However, this movie fails to resolve the issue and really only shows the worst sides of it without anything changing. Watching this movie makes you feel like you're waiting for seething that never arrives.I gave this a 5 because although it's not terrible, it's not worth everyone's time.",Swallow

Cool she swallows random f$@king objects, I expected there to be a twist or something but nope that's it!! Don't waste your time and watch this movie.

Brilliant!,9,6 March 2020,"A user here quoted the movie as ""Dumb girl, scores rich dude, gets pregnant realizes she hates being a housewife so she endangers child by swallowing more and more extreme bits around the house. Yep, about par for the course for the modern liberal woman.""Did you understand the movie at all????? This film is about the profound consequences of trauma and how it affects mental illness. When she is swallowing things, it has nothing to do with wanting to endanger the child. The issue wasn't that she hates being a housewife; the issue is that she doesn't know who she is related to her past.Thank you for the very shallow review though.",Swallow
