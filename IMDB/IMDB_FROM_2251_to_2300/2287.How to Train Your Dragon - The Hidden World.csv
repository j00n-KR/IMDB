0,TheLittleSongbird,Concluding on a high-flying note,9,13 March 2019,"Absolutely adore 'How to Train Your Dragon' and consider it not just Dreamworks' second best after 'The Prince of Egypt' but also one of my favourite animated films. The second film was a great sequel, replacing 'Kung Fu Panda 2' as the best Dreamworks sequel, that was very nearly as good, despite finding Drago a bit one-dimensional as a villain, with all of what made the first so great evident.Expectations were high for the third and final instalment 'How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World'. Luckily it was a fine example of high expectations met and actually exceeded. Was a little worried that it would be one of those ""third time's not the charm"" or ""sequel too far"" sequels, but it was neither. It culminates the series beautifully, it's very affectionate and has lost none of the fun, charm or poignancy that made the previous two films as great as they were. It felt much more than a sequel, was in no way an insult to the previous two instalments (actually put it and the second on the same very close level of being nearly as good as the original), was a more than worthy ending and was a fabulous film in its own way.As to be expected, the animation is amazing, like in the previous two films. The character designs have become more expressive with each sequel, there is incredible attention to detail in the backgrounds and little touches and the colours are vibrant and wonderfully rich in detail. At its best, the music score induces goose-bumps and tears, this aspect was a particular strong point in both the previous films and it's the same here in 'How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World'. It adds a lot, enhances the action and drama when necessary and really gives the sense of fantasy and adventure and does so rousingly and beautifully.'How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World' is again smartly scripted, with the right dose of humour and pathos and mixed adeptly. The humour is smart, quirky and hilarious at its best and there are plenty of emotional moments that are poignant and sweet without being sickly or sentimentality-overload. The conflict is suspenseful enough, and personally didn't find it too scary (some may disagree though). The action sequences are gorgeously animated, are fast paced and full of thrills and imagination.The story still has depth and while a good deal happens it doesn't feel like there is too much going on, maybe at times it could have actually been a touch simpler because the first film's simplicity managed to be to its advantage. The dragon courtship rituals subplot boasts quite a fair bit of fun and the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless is heartfelt and endearing. The characters on the most part are strongly characterised, especially the ever adorable and impossible to dislike Toothless. The voice acting from Jay Baruchel, Cate Blanchett and Gerard Butler is excellent.Flaws were almost none, but for me, despite F. Murray Abraham's strong voice work, the villain was a bit underwritten and one-dimensional.Other than that, a great sequel and film and finishes the series on a very high-flying note. 9/10",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
1,SnoopyStyle,continues to be good,8,20 March 2019,"Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) leads his friends on a rescue mission against dragon slavers. He is the leader of Berk which has become a safe haven for dragons, albeit an overcrowded one. They face encroaching dragon hunting warlords and the greatest dragon hunter of all, Grimmel the Grisly. Hiccup decides to lead his people and his dragons to the lost legendary Hidden World, the place of origin for the dragons.The franchise retains its charms and its adventurous spirit. These continue to be great characters facing great challenges and great odds. It has heart and it has fun. This should be the end of a good trilogy and it's a nice way to go.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
2,Horst_In_Translation,"The epitome of a rushed movie, could have been so much better",4,12 March 2019,"""How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World"" is the third and most recent film from the HtTYD franchise. The director is once again Dean DeBlois and he also adapted the original works by Cressida Cowell. The movie runs for 105 minutes almost and is a 2019 release, so a very new and fresh film. But only in terms of how old it is unfortunately. It seems that quality-wise the franchise has jumped the shark. I liked the first film and really loved the second, which had some bold decisions overall and may have been my favorite animated film from its year and probably also top10 of all films, maybe even higher. But this one here disappointed me. It starts with the villain: This time they did not go for a gritty physically impressive bearded badass viking, but with a lanky schemer you could say who is a hunter and who has killed all Night Shadows. If that is so, then why is there no mention of him in any of the first two films? There isn't, right? He must be very well-known. Yeah well his motives stay a riddle to me. He does not seem to care about Hiccup or his tribe one bit. Or about the dragons living there really. All he wants is to kill this one dragon. He has the chance to when he meets Hiccup the first time and sedates the dragon only. Same scenario later on when he gets him again and flies away with him. I understand he wants a bit of attention and maybe perform the killing act in a ceremony, but that really isn't explanation enough. Toothless is the Moby Dick to his Ahab. I cannot believe he missed out on these occasions, and, like I said, even more than once. In general, I found him to be a very uninspired villain to be honest sadly. And a film frequently stands and falls for me wih the main antagonist and the one we got here is not a revelation.Okay, let's move away from him and move on to the dragon protagonist. Night Shadow gets his Day Shadow, a dragon romance story line we have here. I think it is okay the way they did it, but it also could have been much better. The emotional component they were going for felt pretty flat to me. I must say though that I think they had a huge challenge to combine this idea of him being the King of Dragons really and then acting like a stupid clumsy fool when in love with the white dragon. A challenge that may have been too extreme for them and I don't think it worked out that nicely. As a parallel to that, Hickup and Astrid also get their own love story line. They are a couple when the film begins and the big challenge for Hiccup is to see that he is not on his own, that he is a great person with a lot of talent and power, even when without his ""pet"". And that Astrid belongs to him and is always there to help him. His road to understanding all that is a crucial plot line in the movie. Well, I must say I can see people liking the idea, but I did not find it too inspiring honestly. And for how much it was in the center of the film, it was also not too interestingly elaborated on. Again, the emotional aspect felt flat. And that includes the rushed-in marriage ceremony at the end. Or the jump in time when they finally have kids. That reminded me almost a bit of a poor man's Harry Potter conclusion.It feels very likely that the HtTYD franchise ends with this third film. Or they make a fourth film about humans getting the dragons back. Yep, they split up eventually. This also felt rushed and out of nowhere I must admit and I did not like it. The entire franchise was about humans living in peace and harmony with dragons and that it is possible. Now Hiccup all of a sudden realizes that sadly the people outside his village are not that progressive, so it would be best to have the dragons lead their own life only among their own and create a huge geographical distance. But even if this was true and depicted convincingly, then there's no way I would have thought that Hiccup would not visit his Toothless occasionally, but the epilogue implies that he didn't, which also puts a question mark behind the relationship between these two that has been depicted for 2.5 movies as a bond that cannot be severed by anybody. And besides that, the mother was right when she said something along the lines that greed will always prevail and (in)humans will find a way to find dragons if they intend to. She is right I think, which also makes me question the final developments here. And the cuteness factor in terms of the young kids and evenmoreso young dragons does absolutely not make up for that. Nice try though. Speaking of Hiccup's mother, this was another disappointment. Sure she would not get a story line as big as the one in film 2, but I really expected more and better than what she has here basically being nothing but a hopeless comedic love interest to a viking boy. Embarrassing stuff really how this great character was wasted here. Even the two dumb twins have far more screen time and better material, especially the girl.Finally a few words on the visual side: The looks of the new female dragon are really nice I must say. Otherwise, there is also nothing really wrong with the animation and it may be the best aspect of the entire film. However, also there I am not satisfied. There are some moments that could have been much more beautiful for example when we have the dragon couple fly together for the first time. Or when Hiccup and his gang find the hidden place near the end. These and a few other moments/sequences offered the opportunity for something mind-blowing visually that also could have lit great sparkle in the story centered around these moments, but it felt all so rushed all the time. They truly messed it up. Also another logical question for me speaking about Hiccup's gang: They were always there to fight with him, also early on for example when they free a few dragons, but also in the crucial fight against the bad guy. But I really kept wondering one thing: Hiccup is the chief (is that the right word?) of a really big powerful tribe, but where are all these vikings? They are only there to drink at home and talk and so on, but during the important fight sequences, not a single one of them is present before they miraculously appear at times when the fight is over. And also how are we supposed to believe that these kids (well, young adults) really master these challenges all by themselves without getting injured. In the second film there was death to a key character, there were serious injuries, and here they are like invulnerable superheroes despite their permanent clumsiness (except Astrid). I cannot believe it. So yeah, overall there is unfortunately really a lot very wrong with this third film and I have to give it a thumbs-down overall. I would also not say that I had huge expectations that got disappointed. Not the case here. It is simply a gigantic drop in quality from the previous installment. Don't watch.Final note: Let me point out a (to me) crucial flaw in the dubbing about Grimmel, the main antagonist voiced by Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham: I think in the original he is called Grimmel the Grisly on one occasion. In the German dub, they did not turn him into ""Grimmel der Grausame"", but into ""Grimmel der Grizzly"". I think that was very much incorrect as this man has nothing to do with a grizzly physically, but acts in the most grisly manner you could imagine on more than a few occasions. This really should not happen to a big studio movie like this one. Shame on the translation company!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
3,nogodnomasters,Who let the dragons out?,6,11 February 2019,"The series has run its course. Hiccup leads a group of vigilante Vikings and dragons on raids on other Viking cities to forcefully free their dragons. Now I would have first tried a teach-in demonstrating the advantages to an integrated, dragon diverse community serving grog and beef-jerky. Well, for some reason, the raided communities are upset and hire a Night Fury hunter to enact revenge and restore the balance of Viking lords and dragon servants.There is a legendary land to the west...and this is also a coming of age story for both Hiccup and Fury.The first film was cute and clever, now it is like watching ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes."" You have to do it if you saw the rest. Should finish the series unless they launch a ""Next Generation.""",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
4,kosmasp,"More Dragons, more problems (?)",8,5 November 2020,"If you are into animated movies and have seen the other Dragons training instructions (wait, are they?), then you will love this too. Well made and fun to watch for the whole family. Interesting story too, which is not always the case with sequels, so there is that.Great animation and all the characters you came to love and then some new ones too. With a quite the focus on our main dragon here, but all the dragons. Maybe even a lesson for the kids when it comes to pets? Or animals in general? It would be nice if they got anything from this movie, except entertainiment ... mainly a social message. Also love overcomes almost everything, right? Yes",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
5,jboothmillard,How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,6,15 March 2021,"The first film was very good, and the follow-up was also good fun, the reviews were positive for the third and apparently final entry in the computer-animated franchise, so I looked forward to watching it, directed by Dean DeBlois (Lilo & Stitch). Basically, a year has passed since Hiccup (This Is the End's Jay Baruchel) became chief, his dragon friend Toothless and their fellow dragon-riders continue to rescue captured dragons to bring them to Berk. The village is bustling dragon and human utopia, but the island has become overpopulated with dragons. In response, Hiccup desires to find the ""Hidden World"", a dragon safe haven spoken of by his late father Stoick (300's Gerard Butler). Meanwhile, a white female Fury dragon, held captive by warlords, is used as bait by infamous dragon hunter Grimmel the Grisly (F. Murray Abraham) to capture Toothless and use him as an alpha. Toothless discovers the white Fury, a new species which Astrid (Ugly Bettu's America Ferrera) dubs a ""Light Fury"" in the woods, and the two become enchanted with each other. Hiccup and Tuffnut (Justin Rupple) later discover Grimmel's dragon traps in the area. Grimmel visits Hiccup that night demanding he hand over Toothless, but Hiccup ambushes him; Grimmel escapes, with his Deathgripper dragons burning down Hiccup's house and most of Berk in the process. Hiccup rallies citizens and dragons to leave Berk on a quest to find the Hidden World and safety from dragon hunters. On the journey, the villagers discover an island on which they initially use to rest, but they begin to settle, dubbing it ""New Berk"". Hiccup notices Toothless losing his ability to fly during his growing relationship with the Light Fury, so he rebuilds an automatic tail for him. Toothless uses this new fitted tail to fly off with the Light Fury on his own and flying with her to an unknown land. Patrol scout Valka (Cate Blanchett voice) notices Grimmel's approaching army and reports back to Hiccup. But Hiccup and the dragon riders fall into his trap and barely escape. Ruffnut (Kristen Wiig) is captured but irritates Grimmel until he lets her go. Hiccup, Astrid and her dragon Stormfly, searching for Toothless, find the Hidden World and see Toothless and the Light Fury leading the dragons as a happy couple. When the two humans are discovered, Toothless rescues them and returns them to the Berkians, and Hiccup realises his people would be intruders and unsafe in the Hidden World. Ruffnut returns, but Grimmel secretly follows her to New Berk. Grimmel appears and captures Toothless and the Light Fury who had followed them. Toothless' alpha status allows Grimmel to capture the rest of Berk's dragons by holding the Light Fury hostage. Astrid encourages Hiccup to set out with the dragon riders to stop Grimmel and his army. Gliding on wingsuits, they catch Grimmel's army off-guard, igniting a battle, and freeing the dragons. With help from Stormfly, Hiccup frees Toothless, while Grimmel drugs the Light Fury into obeying him. Hiccup and Toothless chase them and defeat Grimmel's Deathgrippers, but Grimmel tranquilises Toothless mid-air causing him to fall helplessly. Hiccup cannot rescue Toothless alone, so he frees the Light Fury and implores her to save his friend. Hiccup is prepared to sacrifice himself to save Toothless as both he and Grimmel plummet toward the sea, but the Light Fury returns to save Hiccup, while Grimmel falls to his death. Back on the island, Toothless and Hiccup fully realise that dragons will never be safe in the human world. Hiccup bids an emotional farewell to Toothless as all the villagers tearfully set their dragons free to live in the Hidden World, with the Light Fury leading the way and Toothless following them. Sometime later, Hiccup and Astrid finally marry and become the chieftains of New Berk. Years later, Toothless and the Light Fury have mated and given birth to three hybrid dragon fledglings called Night Lights. Hiccup, Astrid, and their two children are sailing across the sea to visit them at the edge of the Hidden World. After introducing his son and daughter to his old friend, Hiccup and Astrid take their children flying on Toothless and Stormfly, accompanied by the Light Fury and their offspring. Hiccup vows that perhaps one day humans and dragons will coexist, but until then, the dragons will stay hidden and the Berkians will guard their secret. Also starring Craig Ferguson as Gobber, Jonah Hill as Snotlout, Christopher Mintz-Plasse as Fishlegs, Kit Harington as Eret, Ashley Jensen as Phlegma, and David Tennant as Spitelout / Ivar the Witless. The cast are all suited to their characters who are all still likeable, friendly dragon Toothless finding love is cute, the story is pleasant and reasonably easy to follow, and the special effects that make exciting and terrific action scenes and landscapes make for great viewing, a most watchable family animated comedy adventure.

6,tavm,How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World was a fine way to end the series if indeed this is the final one...,9,28 February 2019,"I had previously watched the first two movies in the series and remember enjoying them, which is reflected in the reviews on this site I had written when they were released though I've yet to look back at them. Anyway, this third one seems just as enjoyable as those first two. Certainly, seeing this in a Dolby theatre probably made it even more enjoyable as it was quite thrilling feeling the seats shake when certain events were coming.

8,cherold,Beautifully animated but not as funny as previous entries,7,1 June 2019,"I loved the original How to Train Your Dragon, rating it 9 stars. Also really enjoyed the sequel, which I gave 8. Here we are with the third trip to the well, and this time around I feel like I just watched a cute, nice animated kids movie.While the previous movies had a lot of comedy, this one has less comedy, or perhaps just less successful comedy. The movie seems far more focused on romance (human and dragon) and spectacle.The romance doesn't do much for me. It was kind of cute but reminded me of how I felt about romance in cartoons when I was a kid (ick!).The spectacle, on the other hand, is quite impressive. The movie is visually striking, most notably in a scene in the Hidden World of the title, and the final big battle is pretty rousing.The script, though, feels like it's just going through the motions, and at times the story drags.It's not a bad little movie, but I think the filmmakers are right to - as it appears is happening at the end - closing out the franchise. The alternative is apparently a movie I'll rate a 6.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
9,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Doesn't match the thematic integrity of the first but has a stronger narrative through-line than the second.,6,28 February 2019,"'How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World (2019)' finally gets it right, visually. It looks a lot better than even the series' second outing, mainly because the characters' eyes, which were practically soulless before, now shine with emotion. From a narrative perspective, however, it simply sits somewhere between the prior two entries. It's not as clear and concise as the first flick, nor is it as occasionally stagnant or generally lax as the second. It has a stronger thematic through-line than its immediate predecessor, and it does come full-circle (in terms of both itself and the series) in a way, but it doesn't manage to match the total thematic integrity of the initial piece. Still, there's enough to like, especially in-the-moment. It manages to circumvent the strange, weightless self-censorship of the second by having the characters themselves choose the non-lethal route, which feels more natural as the fight-scenes can play out uninterrupted with blunt-force trauma in lieu of slashes - though, it does make you wonder what the point of a sword is if the bladed bit is never used. Sometimes, Toothless comes close to being a 'minion'-type character: 'cute' and 'random' for the sake of it. However, he doesn't quite get to this level as these sequences are meant to develop his character - and, by extension, our protagonist - and they're often quite charming in a strange way. Some of the other humour doesn't work so well, though. In general, the picture is enjoyable, if a little predictable. It sometimes even tugs at the heart-strings ever-so-slightly. With its improved look and refined story-telling, it manages to be a decent adventure with enough heart to carry you through to the end. 6/10",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
10,ThomasDrufke,The Friendship of a Lifetime Gets Its Emotional Conclusion,10,6 February 2019,"In an incredibly packed year of highly anticipated sequels and franchise films, the ending to the How to Train Your Dragon Trilogy holds a special place in my heart. Albeit slightly on the older side, I have aged with the character of Hiccup in these films, and thus each film resonating with me at a specific time in my life. Cheesy sure, but this third film brought me to emotional places that I did not expect to get to. Knowing how this story ultimately ended before seeing it in theaters I thought may prepare me, but I was caught off guard with just how moving the third act was. What Dean DeBlois has done in capping off this trilogy that is satisfying on all levels will likely be something not given enough credit.This is essentially a story about a boy and his dog, his dog just happens to be a dragon. Having a dog myself, I'm sure you can imagine how certain moments may affect dog people more than they would for non dog-lovers. Where the first film was about fatherhood, the second about motherhood, this one finally gives center stage to Hiccup & Toothless. And there very well may never be a friendship like it again. Aside from the villain being relatively similar to the second film's villain, this film is full of beauty, both visually and emotionally. The animation is some of the best I have ever seen on screen. And unless Toy Story 4 or Frozen 2 are somehow light years above Hiccup and friends, I don't see anything touching this for best animated film at next year's Oscars. This is one for the books.10/10",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

Second movie while wasn't as good as the first was... good. ow comes the third and arguably the last in the series and it was OK. Nothing great, nothing bad, but weakest in the series. I mean it wasn't bad or anything, but the story wasn't really involving. It also lacked humor. But the ending was good. Animation was beautiful.Overall, kids will definitely enjoy this movie, but i'm afraid not as much as before with previous movies.

14,The-Sarkologist,Dragon's in Love,5,5 January 2019,"This film sort of snuck up on me somewhat, though when I looked at the other films in the series I noticed that they have appeared at four year intervals. I guess that isn't necessarily a problem with animated films, since you don't have to worry about the actors aging ridiculous amounts, especially since as actors they are basically only voice actors as opposed to being on screen.
I guess the thing is that after having seen the previous two movies, I felt that by the third one the concept was starting to get a bit dry. Sure, the films are based on a series of novels, and by the time I got to the end of the film, I could sort of see why a third film was partly necessary, however I still thought that it did drag on a bit. Then again, maybe it has something to do with me getting a little bored of such films, though it may also have something to do with me not being as young as I used to be.
Then again, this film does tie up a few lose ends, such as what becomes of Hiccup and Astrid, and also whether there are any Night Fury dragons left. The story begins with them raiding ships that are attempting to capture dragons, and bringing them back to the village. The problem is that there is only so much room here for so many dragons, and also the raiders seem to be getting ever closer. Oh, and the raiders have also recruited an expert dragon hunter to deal with the dragon riders.
I suspect that pretty much says everything about the movie, particularly if you are familiar with the other films. Yeah, honestly, there wasn't really all that much here that could be considered new, or outstanding, and in parts it did felt like it was dragging somewhat. However, I guess that was in part because it is generally considered a children's movie, though of course there are going to be adults that would appreciate it as well. In a way, it is an okay way to kill a couple of hours, especially if you have watched the previous two, but not really something that I would go out of my way to see again.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

16,paulclaassen,Not nearly as interesting or entertaining as 'How to train your Dragon 2'.,5,22 April 2019,"While there's much to love about this film, it wasn't as good as its predecessor, How to train your dragon 2, which I still think was the best in the series. Too much time is spent on Toothless' infatuation with the Light Fury, instead of on action and adventure the series became known for. This is pretty much an 'all about the girl' film - in this instance Toothless and the Light Fury. Toothless is acting silly and not as cute and adorable as the previous films. He was also way too understanding of human behavior - like a child and not a dragon, which was a huge letdown (for me, at least). The film will appeal to a much younger demographic, whereas 'Dragon 2' dealt with much more mature issues.I also didn't find the film realistic enough. Yes, I understand nothing about the franchise is realistic, but I mean realistic within the context of the film. The supporting characters are clearly becoming burnout, dispensable characters, who doesn't add anything new or interesting to the story. The discovery of the Hidden World scene was spectacular - the only scene in the film that really wowed me. As much as I tried, I just couldn't get into this installment.

18,tomgillespie2002,Plays it frustratingly safe,6,15 April 2019,"Loosely based on the series of books by Cressida Cowell, the How to Train Your Dragon series has grown to become the jewel in the somewhat small and dusty crown of Dreamworks Animation. With Pixar killing it near enough year in, year out, the adventures of reluctant Viking leader Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and his trusted Night Fury pal are the closest thing that Dreamworks have ever come to the quality and visual splendour of its most fearsome rivals. If you've kept up with the series since its debut in 2010, you'll have watched Hiccup grow out of his father's shadow into a battle-scarred warrior and forward-thinking frontiersman, who brought a close to his tribe's never-ending war with the dragons to discover the fire-breathing beasts actually make for useful and loving friends. The second instalment veered into incredibly dark territory, signalling a maturing tone that matched the protagonist's transformation from nervous kid to an innovator destined to change the lives of his people forever.The third and presumably final entry into the series, The Hidden World, doesn't darken the tone further - it is still a kids' film after all - but you get the sense from very early on that we are heading inevitably towards an emotional parting of ways. Hiccup and his friends continue their quest to rescue captive dragons and bring them back to the village of Berk to live in harmony with humans. The problem is that they've become so good at their search-and-rescue missions that their home is now overcrowded with the lumbering beasts. Hiccup believes their only hope lies in 'the hidden world, a mysterious and possibly make-believe haven at the edge of the world spoken of by his late father Stoick (Gerard Butler). But cracks start to appear in the young chieftan's plans when his dragon and best friend Toothless happens across a Light Fury, the female of his species. Wild and distrusting of humans, the female bolts from Toothless' advances any time Hiccup shows his face to help, and it becomes clear that if he is ever to see his best bud happy, he must also let his dragon run free.As ever, there's a dragon-hating antagonist to jeopardise Hiccup's plans in the form of renowned hunter Grimmel the Grisly (F. Murray Abraham), whose own mind-controlled dragons have the ability to vomit acid and melt pretty much anything in their wake. He certainly looks and sounds cool, but Grimmel shares much of the same motivation as the bad guys that come before him, and the character really symbolises the film's overall reluctance to dig that little bit deeper. For me, How to Train Your Dragon 2 really stepped up the game for this franchise, but it feels like returning director Dean DeBlois is happy to ease off the accelerator and ride this trilogy-closer out. If this were practically any other series, The Hidden World would be a delightful surprise, offering up great moments like the opening night-time raid and the sight of Toothless clumsily attempting win over his potential mate, the latter proving to be one of the most charming and heart-warming scenes of the entire trilogy. But with the knowledge of how great this could have been, The Hidden World is a disappointment, fizzling out with an ending that undoubtedly satisfies, but when compared to the emotional wallop of, say, Toy Story 3, plays it rather safe.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
19,cruise01,"Beautiful, emotional conclusion, and a lot of fun.",9,1 March 2019,"How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World (4.5 out of 5 stars).How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World delivers as an emotional strong final chapter for the trilogy of films. This is one of the franchises that does so well. The first movie was really good and had a strong story. And the sequels followed right along with it. The sequels did not ruin the series or were weak by any chance. It lives up to the original. The Hidden World does have a strong emotional story, the animation is yet again beautiful and stunning, and the fun characters are back. I did feel like this film did have a cliché weak forgettable villain just like the second movie did. It does not distract from enjoying the film for what it is.The film's plot follows Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) trying to lead his people in Berk. His community tribe has been open to accepting and rescuing plenty of more dragons. So much more that there tribe can barely contain all the dragons. When Grimmel the dragon hunter is after them to hunt and claim those dragons. Hiccup and his tribe will have to relocate to find a new home for those dragons.The film does have some strong theme with Hiccup being told that he needs to settle down and tie the knot with Astrid. She can help manage their tribe too. When Toothless finds another light fury dragon. He falls in love with her. Which also causes some emotional conflict with Hiccup that he may have trouble letting go. The story is strong and great. It does a great job concluding the trilogy. Especially, with a tear jerker ending.The animation is beautiful and stunning. When Hiccup and Astrid discover the hidden world. Where the dragons are living in which is colorful and lively. (Almost looking like Pandora from Avatar movie).The film does have some great action sequences to keep everyone entertained. The villain is a bit weak as a character. His motives on hunting dragons is a bit redundant like Drago was in the second movie. At least Drago had an Alpha menacing scary looking dragon to make up for the villain role. The climax is a bit easily handled when Hiccup is trying to rescue Toothless and the light fury from Grimmel which seems like an easy villain to encounter.Overall, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a really good family film that adults and children will enjoy. The characters are fun with plenty of humor. The plot is strong with an emotional theme. The action and animation is beautiful and stunning.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

21,leonblackwood,A Decent Watch For The Whole Family! 7/10,7,5 January 2020,"Review:
After deciding to give movies a break for a while, mainly because I was so disappointed with the releases in 2019, I finally made up my mind to watch the films that I missed towards the end of last year. This was the first film that I chose, out of the many movies that I haven't seen in my collection, and I didn't have high hopes for the outcome. I must be getting over-emotional in my old age because I actually enjoyed this film, especially the love story between Toothless and the White Fury. I wasn't a big fan of the 2nd movie in this franchise, but I found this film quite touching throughout, and the various characters brought different elements to the epic adventure. The animation isn't Pixar standard, but the attention to detail looked great on the big screen, and there were enough elements in the storyline to keep it interesting throughout. The movie kicks off one year after the events of the previous film, where Hiccup, Toothless and their fellow dragon-riders continue to rescue captured dragons in order to bring them to Berk and the bustling dragon and human utopia. Hiccup decides to move the dragons to the ""Hidden World"" because Berk is becoming overcrowded, so he follows his father journal to try and find the magical kingdom. Meanwhile, a white female Fury dragon, held captive by warlords, is given to infamous dragon hunter Grimmel the Grisly as bait for him to capture Toothless for the warlords use as an alpha. When Toothless discovers the Light Fury in the woods, the two become enchanted with each other but when she senses Hiccups presence, she flees. After Grimmel burns down Hiccup's house and most of Berk with six of his Deathgripper dragons, Hiccup rallies the citizens and dragons to leave Berk on a quest to find the Hidden World and safety from the dragon hunters. Mid-journey, the Berkians discover an island on which they initially plan to rest for a short while, but soon begin to settle there. While Toothless is flying around with the Light Fury, Valka decides to go on a scouting patrol and notices Grimmel and his fast-approaching army, so she quickly reports back to Hiccup, who gathers his riders to capture Grimmel. They end up falling into a trap, and barely escapes. With Toothless missing, Hiccup and Astrid manage to find the ""Hidden World"" and they see Toothless and the Light Fury leading the dragons there as a happily mated couple. They soon realise that humans are seen as intruders in the Hidden World, so Toothless takes them to safety before the dragons are able to attack them. Suddenly Grimmel appears and captures Toothless and the Light Fury. With Astrid's encouragement, Hiccup sets out with the dragon riders to stop Grimmel and his army, igniting a battle. Grimmel drugs the Light Fury into obeying him, so Hiccup and Toothless give chase, with Toothless using his newly acquired ability to draw in lightning to kill the remaining Deathgrippers. Hiccup manages to jump onto the Light Fury, but Grimmel tranquillises Toothless midair causing the dragon to fall helplessly. Hiccup realises that he cannot rescue Toothless alone, so he frees the Light Fury and implores her to save Toothless. Hiccup us fully prepared to sacrifice himself in order to save Toothless as both he and Grimmel plummet toward the sea. The Light Fury returns to save Hiccup as well while Grimmel impacts the water and drowns. Back on the island, Hiccup realises that dragons will never be safe in the human world, so they bid an emotional farewell, as all of the Berkians set their dragons free to live in the ""Hidden World"". Three months later, Hiccup and Astrid finally marry on New Berk. I personally do think that it is a bit much for the young ones to understand, but the vibrate colours and comedic scenes will keep them entertained. F. Murray Abraham voiced the villain, Grimmel, extremely well, and Jay Baruchel's unique voice was a great choice for Hiccup, but on the downside, it didn't have the same impact than the first movie. Don't get me wrong, it is worth a watch, but I can't see myself rushing to watch the movie twice. Enjoyable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Dean DeBlois, who also brought you Lilo & Stitch and the first 2 How to Train Your Dragon movies. He also directed a movie called Go Quiet in 2010, which was unheard of, so he's really known for the How To Train Your Dragon franchise. In this day and age, movie franchises have different directors, which usually spoils the flow from one movie to another, but the fact the whole cast and the director returned for all 3 movies, which spanned over 10 years, made this a successful project. Judging by the ending, it would be silly to make a 4th movie, even though the characters are loved by many moviegoers. It was definitely a good way to end the Adventures of Hiccup and Toothless story, and when you see the grown Hiccup with his family towards the end, you can't help feeling emotional about his amazing journey throughout the years.Budget: $129million

22,TheMovieDiorama,The Hidden World reveals the hardship of parting ways through fantastical animation.,8,8 February 2019,"Its predecessors are among the best of the best when it comes to family adventure flicks. Packing emotional heft, boasting colourful characters whilst also delivering large scaled winged battles. My one and only hope this year, would be that the final entry to this wonderful trilogy concludes the story of Hiccup and Toothless satisfyingly. Well, whilst this is the weakest of the three, I'm glad to report back that this conclusion was stunning and cements this fire-breathing trilogy as one of the most accessible for everyone. Hiccup, now rescuing dragons after turning Berk into a dragon and human utopia, comes face-to-face with the infamous dragon hunter Grimmel who wishes to capture Toothless. To do this, they use a ""Light Fury"" as bait to lure Toothless in whilst he helplessly falls in love with her.I cannot state enough just how perfect these characters are and how fleshed out their development is, Hiccup in particular. We see him grow up from a timid boy to a leading chief, with this film exploring the themes of maturity and love. The beauty of the friendship between Hiccup and Toothless, is that they mimic each other's personalities and growth. Toothless encounters the ""Light Fury"" and realises where his place in life is, and simultaneously enables Hiccup to come to the same realisation. They are both experiencing love, an overwhelming feeling that can change one's motive instantly. Throughout all of the dangers and menacing antagonists that life throws at these two, they each have a place and become conscious to the fact that they are unable to coexist in the same world. It makes for an absurdly powerful ending that (I shan't lie) did make me shed a tear or two.The story itself, whilst essentially a rehash of the second chapter, enables the Berkians and the dragons to be at the forefront, further establishing their friendships as a giant family. Grimmel fortunately had more backstory and memorability in comparison to Drago, enhancing his menacing demeanour. The voice acting remained consistent as usual, with Abraham and Wiig being the stand outs. However, yet again, the animation reigns champion. Absolutely gorgeous. From the various character models to the bustling environments, it is clear that this is DreamWorks' best. When Hiccup and Astrid enter the ""Hidden World"" for the first time, it gave me goosebumps. The vivid colours and pure imagination that went into making that majestic fantastical world was awe-inspiring. DeBlois' sweeping directing style further emphasises the magic of this world, with looming shots as the pair graciously fly through illuminated caverns. Just, watch it on the biggest screen possible, it will overwhelm you.As with most third chapters in a series, the freshness does wear off quickly and starts to become stale. Unfortunately there are times when this entry does hover with its story rather than flying high, particularly during the second act. And, as much as I hate comparing, it is no where near as emotional impactful as the previous two films despite me shedding a tear (God damn that second film broke me). Also felt that Valka was side-lined and almost fully neglected, given her beautiful development in the previous film. A few criticisms here and there, but that's only because this is such a stupendous trilogy. Heart, thrills and genuine moments of laughter. This adventure has it all, and I couldn't think of a better ending. T'was perfect.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
23,matthewssilverhammer,"a fitting, if rote, ending for the world of Berk",7,1 March 2019,"When Dragon was released a decade ago, I don't think any of us expected it to spawn a Star-Wars-esque trilogy, full of detailed lore, complex emotions and soaring visuals. With the series ultimate Hidden World, the comparisons between the two trilogies are all-the-more apparent: we're given a fantastic origin in the first, a darker and better exploration of the world in the second, and a third that, while serviceable and necessary, shows a perfunctory drop in resonance. The story is convenient, the characters lack strong motivation, and the focal human romance drags. However, like Return of the Jedi, Hidden World still displays enough heartfelt pleasures to create a fine (enough) finale.
When Hiccup discovers a ""Hidden World"" of dragons, he works to protect his flying friends' way of life before a new evil dragonhunter gets them first. It's the trope of the franchise: Hiccup and co. try to stop the dragons from being slaughtered. Still, Hiccup and Toothless are still an endearing character team, and the franchise boasts a rare cinematic feat: a kid's movie with lovingly detailed world-building (the titular Hidden World is a sight to behold). The new addition of a female Nightfury for Toothless to flirt with is surprisingly excellent. This provides some beautiful visual sequences and hilarious meet-cute rom-com moments that work to make this three-quel feel like its own.
For much of the runtime, the film kind of coasts by on nostalgia and cliches, until it's bittersweet and tear-jerking ending, one that will have fans, young and old, reaching for their loved ones. It's a cacophony of subtle symbolism and giant emotions that serves as a fitting, if rote, ending for the world of Berk.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
24,Vartiainen,Hit-n-miss finale to a great trilogy,6,3 March 2019,"The third, and most probably last, How to Train Your Dragon film once again jumps some years into the future. Hiccup and his friends are now in their twenties and Berk is positively overflowing with dragons. But then a notorious dragon hunter named Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham) sets his sights on this little corner of the world. His quarry? Toothless, one of the last night furies.This film does a lot of things right. The animation is still astonishingly stunning. Seeing this in IMAX was a real treat. You could practically count the hairs on their faces. The patterns and textures on the dragons were grand and yet subtle. The movement was fluid, the camera angles pleasing and all in all it was just a really great-looking film. One of the finest I've seen.I also really liked Hiccup and Astrid, especially together. Jay Baruchel convinces as a once-timid boy, who has now left that part of his life behind and fully embraced leadership. And it pleases me beyond belief that for once the main couple in a movie series is allowed to be just that. No unnecessary arguments or fights just for the sake of drama. Some might call that boring, but children need positive role models as well. It's good that they learn that you can still care about someone even if you fight, but they also need to learn that two people can love each other without arguing.Toothless and his new lady friend were also adorable and had most of the best scenes. I think I could have watched a film solely dedicated to them.Unfortunately the film has some downsides as well. Like the rest of the teenagers. Heavens, but these kids were annoying. Their particular brand of comedy was pretty aggravating in the previous films as well, but they've actually gotten even worse and it's even more jarring when you keep in mind that they're supposed to be adults now. Yet they're more boneheaded than ever before. Not a fan. Did not laugh even once.The plot line is pretty all over the place, some of the characters from previous film were completely sidelined and the villain was pretty weak, once again. Grimmel is not the worst villain in the series, but he suffered severely from the fact that this film did not really need a villain. I get that it would have been a really bold movie to have a Dreamworks film without one, but it has been done before, and there was enough content in this film aside from Grimmel that they could have made it work.Still, there were more good things than bad in this movie, and some of the good things were the best I've yet seen from these movies. Definitely check this one out if you've liked the other two.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
25,lisafordeay,Great way to end the franchise. Spoilers ahead,9,2 February 2019,"May include heavy spoilers near the end of the review. I suggest you watch the film and then come and read my review.Here is my review of How to train your Dragon 3.
How To Train Your Dragon 3: The Hidden World is a 2019 animated adventure and prequel to the 2014 Movie and 2010 original of the same name and tells the tale of Hiccup voiced by Jay Bacheul and his trustworthy companion Toothless who stumble across the hidden world where Toothless falls for a female night fury(white). But an evil Dragon hunter named Grimmel voiced by F Murray Abraham wants to take Toothless for himself and it's up to Hiccup to defeat him and may also have to part ways with Toothless. But will Toothless choose the new night fury over Hiccup?Like the first 2 this one is packed with great animation,great story and it's just such a gorgeous looking film. The voice acting is great and the ending was satisfying yet as a 27 year old woman I cried and lost it at the finale when Hiccup told Toothless to go on without him to be with the white night fury. We also see Hiccup marrying Astrid and having a son and a daughter and Toothless and his mate had 3 Dragon babies.It was a great way to end a breathtaking movie franchise from Dreamworks Animation.

26,stevendbeard,Satisfying End of the Trilogy,8,24 February 2019,"I saw ""How to Train Your Dragon:The Hidden World"", starring the voices of Jay Baruchel-Robocop_2014, Tropic Thunder; America Ferrera-End of Watch, Lords of Dogtown; F. Murray Abraham-Robin Hood_2018, Star Trek:Insurrection and Gerard Butler-Den of Thieves, Tomorrow Never Dies.
This is the 3rd in the trilogy-the first was in 2010, the second in 2014 & not counting the tv series and videos-that tells the story of Hiccup & his pet dragon, Toothless. Jay voices Hiccup. America is his girlfriend, Astrid, who helps shape his future. Gerard returns in flashbacks to give sage advice to his son, Jay. The hidden world is a secret hidden land where dragons live in peace, undisturbed by mankind-Gerard tells Jay all this in the flashbacks. F. Murray shows up as a dragon hunter and wants to fulfill his passion of killing all dragons, including Toothless the last of the Night Furies and his new girlfriend, a white Light Fury. During the end credits, there are clips from the previous 2 films that show the relationship of Jay & Toothless as it develops over the years. Overall, it's a satisfying end of the trilogy.
It's rated ""PG"" for adventure action and some mild rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 44 minutes.

29,CubsandCulture,Fitting conclusion but largely redundant,8,9 March 2019,"Outside the the Toothless ""love"" story there really isn't much new to this installment. I liked the lightfury plot and how it is reflected in the Hiccup story. But the new villain, and the repeated conflict from the second film, are both dull and rote. I wish the entire conflict was shifted to Toothless needing to be let go.Nonetheless, the story and especially the final scene are emotionally satisfying. We have spent a great amount of time with these characters and the bittersweet ending they are given is earned.Like the first two installments, the flying scenes are the best part of the film.

The film starts out rather formulaic, and struggles often with pacing, as well as a decent script. The dialogue can seem obvious, but at times it can also be rather insightful and funny. The villain varies from being menacing and entertaining, to being plain dumb and lifeless. However, even with the first half of the film being more difficult than it should be, The Hidden World manages to harness all that it has given us and give us the emotional life force the franchise knows it has, and knows we need.

35,davidmvining,A very good capper to a very good trilogy,8,21 November 2019,"What a wonderful series of movies.I missed the first movie in theaters and took forever to get around to seeing it. By that point, the movie had largely fallen off the cultural roadmap and I could watch it without any sense of hype. I absolutely loved it. I watched the second one as soon as I could, and loved it even more. What made those two films stand out more than most other films aimed at children was their sense of loss in their endings. At the end of the first, the main character lost his leg. He was permanently maimed by his experiences. At the end of the second, his father dies. He gains his mother, but the man who loved him since birth passed. The third one does something similar.The story follows a natural narrative path from the first two. Hiccup has collected dragons to his coastal village of Burk to the point of breaking. He's become obsessive with freeing and collecting more and more from trappers trying to use dragons for their own ends. He, along with his dragon, Toothless, have become chiefs and kings to their own people, but internal and external pressures are making the continued existence of their little utopia untenable.Introduce the new threat, a man ideologically driven to kill dragons, in particular, the species of Toothless. What follows is a solid game of cat and mouse and Hiccup moves all of Burk further West to a new, remote island, where safety seems possible. As the town re-establishes itself, Hiccup takes Toothless further West in search of an old legend of the titular Hidden World, which they, of course find. It is there that Toothless ends up being the true alpha, the king in a world of dragons. It's his place, and it's obvious from that moment that that's where he belongs.Rousing spectacle and fights follow which lead to the antagonist plunging to his death and Hiccup saving both Toothless and the dragon's new mate from captivity. Afterwards, though, it becomes obvious to everyone that dragons and humans can't live together anymore. The threats are too big. And, on a more personal note, Toothless no longer needs Hiccup as much as he used to. With his new mate (and a fully useful tail), Toothless can go on his own to the Hidden World and be his own dragon. Hiccup has to let him go, relying on his new bride Astrid instead.It's an extension of the thematic ending from the first two. Hiccup has to give up something significant, and in this third and (supposedly) final film, he has to give up his best friend. It's quite affecting.Now, however, I do think that this is a step down for the series. The series has collected a large number of side-characters, and they tend to dominate the first and second thirds of the film more than they should. Their antics become distractions with little to no payoff. So they're entertaining in the moment, but don't add to the story overall, which, since there's so much of it, becomes a diversions instead of anything to propel the narrative.Still, overall, a mighty fine adventure that also mostly entertained my 4-year old son.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

Emotional Infusion
BalancedSummary:
The movie has been all about characters, which in turn has relied on voice acting to bring them to life. Jay, America and the gang have filled the shoes again, adding the emotional depth to the characters who we have grown up with the last decade or so. The movie has taken the foundations and built upon it taking the characters to new levels and helping push them to new frontiers that the series requires. Expanding on the story like it did, this sequel accomplishes the goal of standing on its own, and yet helping the characters evolve into new beings and new stages. It's all gorgeously done in the animation we have come to love, and this installment has shown that Dreamworks can continue to push the details of their work to new depths and heights to help bring the mythical beasts to life without going too dark.
Yet, this is a movie meant for kids and you might want to know does it still have the effects that made the first two installments special. The answer is yes on many levels. The comedy is still there a good blend of one-liners, banter, slapstick, and adorable, charming presentation that works so well to bring the youthful energy. Not too overdone, but yet not too adult, the comedy does well to support the other components of the story. Emotion runs heavy in this film cascading through the emotional roller coaster depending on the scene. Want the thrill of flying? It's in there. Need the touching bond between friends? Again it's in there! Need some other touches? You've got that too. The third installment continues to find the ability to infuse the emotions and bring you fully into the scene, especially when one adds the musical score to support the visuals. It works very well, because the writers have found balance of many aspects and it works beautifully to bring all the ages and fans together for the latest ride to the film.DISLIKES:Short
More Action/Thrills
New Dragon Designs
The Villain
The Trailer SyndromeSummary:
For once I actually wanted a movie longer, more so because of some of the other areas I wanted to see improved in this film. One of these is to get more of that action and thrill that the first two had, the sense of flying into the heart of danger, or through the skies in the daring mission. Hidden World has these components, but some of the moments didn't quite have the impact the first two installments did for me. In addition, I had hoped for a few new dragons that held the designs of those in the journals, getting glimpses of designs that break the molds from those seen before. It did this somewhat, but I'd have liked to see a few more changes to the mold. All of these are minder areas for me the majors are next.
The Villain is not the worst and I didn't hate it, after all the look and malic ooze from him in terms of design and acting. Yet, the part that failed is I don't think he had quite the same texture and depth that the previous villains held. This guy has build up and some impressive skill sets, but I felt that they didn't quite deliver the terrifying components that they wanted, sort of diluting the villain for the film. Again, good for the most part, but no quite having the same punch I had expected it. Yet the biggest thing I held, was that the trailers have given you most of the endings, so if you have the trailer memorized you have much of the film's ending laid out for you. So, while it is a good prep for those who are trying to get their kids ready for it, guys like me don't like having everything laid out for you.The VERDICT:Truth is, the third movie didn't meet the first one for me in terms of all the wonders I had, but it certainly accomplishes much and as a movie sequel is very, very good. I hands down love this sequel and found it having the balance the series is famous for, but yet expanding up on it. With fantastic storytelling, animation that brings it to life, and all the emotions for both adults and kids to love, this series ends on a mighty roar that will take many to new heights and leave you feeling many things by the end of the film. It did not deliver to the same extent on some things, but the movie hands down took all the made it special and capitalized it. I loved much of this movie and encourage many to come enjoy the experience in theaters.My scores are:Animation/Action/Adventure: 9.0

40,justin-fencsak,An emotional end to a classic trilogy,10,3 March 2019,"Released during the early 3d boom following the success of Avatar, the first movie How to Train Your Dragon became a surprise hit for Dreamworks Animation and appealed to all audiences globally. A sequel, as well as a spinoff tv series focusing on the dragons, soon followed. When the third and final film came out last weekend, it was the first movie to be released by Dreamworks Animation with a new logo and under Comcast ownership along with Universal pictures distributing the film and handling the marketing of the film, which has done well overseas even before it hit our shores a month before. I highly recommend seeing it in 2d!!!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
41,fntstcplnt,How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World (2019),7,8 April 2020,"Directed by Dean DeBlois. Starring Jay Baruchel, America Ferrara, Craig Ferguson, F. Murray Abraham, Jonah Hill, Justin Rupple, Kristen Wiig, Cate Blanchett, Kit Harrington, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Gerard Butler. (PG)When a dangerous dragon hunter (Abraham) rears his head, young Viking chief Hiccup (Baruchel) decides to move his people--and the large number of dragons they watch over--away from their homeland toward a mythic place at the edge of the world where they can establish a new home. Third chapter in the ""How to Train Your Dragon"" series doesn't offer much that's new (its central themes and messages are old hat by now), and carries the same major issue as the last two episodes: lack of a defined or compelling antagonist. Although lighter and jokier in tone than expected, when it comes to the chief selling point (the dragons), only Hiccup's best bud, the Night Fury called Toothless, and his potential mate, a white version referred to as a ""Light Fury,"" are given much attention away from the swarms. Adequate entertainment, but let's hope this lays the franchise to rest; it does end with a closure-fulfilling epilogue, but Hollywood isn't known for letting sleeping dogs lie when cash is in the offering...just ask the ""Toy Story"" series.68/100",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

44,Troy_Campbell,A fulfilling conclusion.,7,25 January 2019,"Bringing this high-flying trilogy to an end, The Hidden World sees Viking leader Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) search for the titular Dragon-land as his best friend Toothless, the Night Fury leader of all other dragons, is hunted by the evil Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham). Five years since its predecessor, DreamWorks has taken their time in creating a thoughtful trilogy-closer with dazzling visuals, a heartfelt story and satisfying conclusions for the beloved characters - human or otherwise. Hiccup and his ragtag bunch of mates are still fun to spend time with, especially Kristen Wiig's Ruffnut, but the undisputed star is still the lovable, child-like Toothless. His awkward attempts to flirt with the 'Light' Fury provide the biggest laughs, whilst his big kitty-esque eyes still garner instant feels. Some of the side characters are given short shrift - particularly America Ferrera's warrior Astrid and Kit Harrington's hulking Eret - however they all fare better than Abraham's uninspired menace who is too one-note to make an impact. The soaring action has been a trademark for this franchise and nothing changes here; when they take to the skies and have the audience glide, plummet, zigzag, whoosh, and swoop with Toothless and co, it is exhilarating. And whilst it's extremely fun to be up close and personal with the flying dragons, there are also some remarkable long shots that emphasise the beauty of what these visual artists are doing in the realm of cinematic animation. The villainy side of the house is substandard and the love-story between Hiccup and Astrid is disappointingly swept aside, but those gripes notwithstanding, this series-ender is a largely fulfilling adventure that will please the whole family.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

47,rockman182,How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World (2019),7,25 February 2019,"For whatever reason I cannot remember the first two films very well. Had to have a friend kind of refresh my memory. Not the hugest fan of animated films but you know, nothing else was out this week so here I was catching the finale in this animated trilogy. There's a slow build up but I think overall the third film in this trilogy hits the right notes and serves as a pretty good conclusion to this series (from what I can recall from the first two anyways).In this film, Hiccup and Toothless continue to bond and free dragons until Toothless meets another female Night Fury (dubbed the Light Fury). Toothless falls in love, meanwhile a a dragon hunter named Grimmel is trying to capture Toothless and kill him. This leads to an all out battle between the two forces, and Hiccup must lead his team of dragons and Vikings to subdue the evil Grimmel.I do recall chuckling at moments throughout the film. A lot of the younger folks in the theater were really into the action and the characters. I thought the animation and sound were great. I appreciate the effort that goes into making an animated feature, it cannot be easy. I thought the film did a good job of mixing humor, drama, and action. It'll be an emotional journey for fans of the series because it is touching at the end.I like that the film series is bowing out when the time is right, take a note Toy Story 4. The film was overall a decent time at the cinema which was all I can hope for. It even makes me want to revisit the first two and refresh my memory on the films. Not all animated films work for me but this was good and judging by the looks of whats to come in that department, this may be one of the better ones.7/10",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
48,jon.h.ochiai,"If You Love, Set Them Free",9,4 March 2019,"One of my All-Time favorite singer-songwriters is Sting. He sings, ""If you love somebody, set them free."" In Dream Works and Director Dean DeBlois's spectacular state-of-the art animated ""How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World"", vulnerable kind Jay Baruchel voices brave young Viking Chief Hiccup. Hiccup looks deeply into the golden gentle eyes of his dear Dragon Toothless. They bow touching their heads together and hug. It's time to set Toothless free. Because Hiccup loves him.In Dean's movie narrative based on the series of books by Author Cressida Cowell, Hiccup's girlfriend Astrid, voiced by the beautiful wise America Ferrera, discerns that Hiccup believes that his greatness solely relies upon the Dragon. Hiccup is greater than he knows. Astrid tells him, ""I am who I am today, because of you.""Amidst the clutter of colorful superfluous Viking characters and cherub-like Dragons, we experience wondrous scenes of Hiccup riding Toothless as they soar above the clouds of the night sky. That's love.In Hiccup's dream from the past, Gerard Butler returns as his stalwart hulking late Father Stoick. Stoick confesses to his son about the great love of his life, Hiccup's Mother. She was the One, and he chose never to remarry. At the time both believed that she had passed away. Stoick says, ""With love comes loss, son; it's part of the deal."" In life there is both love and loss.Dean's ""How to Train Your Dragon 3"" is about the sadness in loss. Yet, there's the kind of sadness that heals loss, and about love everlasting. Perhaps, there's no loss without love. Life is in the balance. That's the deal. Ultimately, that makes ""How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World"" something special.In ""How to Train Your Dragon 3"", Hiccup is now Viking Chief, and his people coexist with dragons in their sea village Berk. Maybe, Hiccup marries pretty independent spirit Astrid? Astrid is like: ""Oh, no."" Yet, we can tell they are in love. It's the movies after all.Hiccup recalls the dragon mythology from Stoick: About the ""Hidden World"" where all Dragons came from, at the Edge or the World. After all the World was 'flat' according to the Vikings. Hiccup also confronts evil Dragon Hunter Grimmel, voiced by sublime F. Murray Abraham, in his quest to free the dragons of the world. Grayed and gaunt Grimmel sets his sights on capturing Night Fury dragon - Toothless.Back in Berk, beautiful white dragon - Light Fury enchants Toothless's heart. Here the amazing CGI visual effects and animation endear their story. Although Toothless and Light Fury do not speak a word, in their playful glances and miraculous aerial displays, we get that they are falling madly in love. Much like Hiccup and Astrid, but without the comic verbal barbs.My buddy Marc told me that I should check out ""How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World"", because it's really about family. Marc is absolutely right. ""How to Train Your Dragon 3"" is about the families we inherent, and the families we create: Whether Human or Dragon.In family there is both loss and love. At times Director Dean's story over indulges in the astounding visual excess without context. Yet, what keeps you watching is the love stories of Hiccup and Toothless.They are both evolving and growing, becoming greater than they know. It's about the possibility of family. It's about creating the legacy that honors those you love, those who came before you. In that ""How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World"" becomes that hidden treasure.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
49,Benjamin-M-Weilert,"A sufficient end to a series that could have used some more ""meat"" in its plot.",6,17 May 2019,"I haven't always been a fan of DreamWorks movies, but the How to Train Your Dragon series is, in my opinion, perhaps the best they've ever created. Of course, I'm probably a little biased because each entry in the series came at a time in my life where I was reaching a milestone. How to Train Your Dragon (2010) came out as I was settling into my life as an independent adult. How to Train Your Dragon 2 (2014) followed me from dating into marriage. Now, the final chapter in the series, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World (2019) is on the cusp of my transition into parenthood.Consequently, I had high expectations for the end of this trilogy. I wanted it to go out with a grand finale like Toy Story 3 (2010) did (before they even decided to make Toy Story 4 (2019), that is). Unfortunately, I did not find this to be the case. While the first movie set the stage with dragons being the enemies, the second movie evolved the conflict into a difference between slavery and collaboration. The Hidden World didn't add anything that hadn't already been explored in the first two films. Sure, it tied up a few loose ends, but they probably only needed a 30-minute extended cut of the second film to be resolved.I found the main antagonist of The Hidden World (and his motivations) to be too similar to the villain in the second movie, and perhaps even more cartoonish in design than I was willing to accept. This is even to the point where this whole society of dragon hunters just seemed to pop up out of nowhere. Like, who were those other generals who interacted with the villain? Were they important? I have a feeling some of these things might have been explained in the TV show spinoffs, but I shouldn't have to watch those to be able to understand the main series of movies.A sufficient end to a series that could have used some more ""meat"" in its plot, I give How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World 3.0 stars out of 5.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
50,RforFilm,How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World gives us a great reason to fly with the dragons one last time,8,27 February 2019,"One of the major reasons world peace hasn't been achieved is that there is someone that's always going to disagree with the status quo and establish his own agenda. That doesn't make the world a bad place, but that's the nature of free will: that ability to debate and generate new ideas. Some will use it to help everyone and some will use it for their own power trip. This is also why when something amazing is introduced to everyone, there is going to be a natural resistance by some. People have done this. Politics have done this. Technology has done this. Nothing is out the window.The beautiful thing about the How to Train Your Dragon series is that it's about the ideology of changing an established society and mainframe. What was once a simple Viking village of plunderers now has dragons to fly on. The first movie showed that beginning transition from a boys point of view. The second movie built on that evolution, and how there are bad people that will use them to their advantage. With the final movie of the series How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World, we see what happens when we realize that people may never embrace something.Set a year after the last movie, chief of Berk, Hiccup (played by Jay Baruchel) and his group of friends have been keeping up their mission to free captured dragons and give them a new home to be free. The problem now is that Berg is becoming so full of dragons that it's becoming too overpopulated. Hiccup decides that they need to find the legendary ""Hidden World"" that his late father Stoick (played by Gerald Butler) where dragons can be free. Hiccup is also facing pressure to marry his girlfriend Astrid (played by America Ferrera).Things change when a white night furry they call a ""Light fury"" suddengly comes. This is good news for Hiccup's dragon ""Toothless"" who always thought he was the last one. But they also discover a series of dragon sized traps. The one responsible for those visits Hiccup, a dragon hunter Grimmel (played by F. Murray Abraham), who is looking to kill Toothless. Though he escapes, Hiccup understands he'll keep coming back. He makes the decision for the population of Berk to leave to search for the hidden world. As he deals with all of this, Toothless continues to try and woo the other Light Furry as a mate.The first two are amazing movies that push the storytelling and animation as DreamWorks' best. How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World marks for a very nice, very good conclusion to the trilogy. Is it as good as the first two? Not as masterful, but I still highly recommend this. To start with, the animation is still spectacular. The people still look good, the dragons are still, if not more, lovable, and the use of light and environment really gives this an artistic bump and the second movie started to build on.The story is also effective. This may be a ""boy and his dog"" plot, but this has always been about Hiccup and his growth into a young man. Though high voice is still a bit on the annoying side, Jay Baruchel does manage to make me used to it, thanks to his commitment to playing his part as serious as possible. You really understand his dilemma of trying to please both the Vikings of Berk and the dragons he's so fond of. It makes it more painful for what happens for him and most of the dragons in the end, but I wont spoil that.I'll admit the movie starts to dive in one area, and it's with the villain. F. Murray Abraham does well as a dragon hunter, but aside from that, there wasn't really more to him other then what you see from a lot of other hunter characters. I found the villain from the last movie much more intimidating and interesting as he was at least on a power trip and was smart enough to understand the dragons more then the main character. I wished he would have returned for revenge.I'll give this eight Light Furry dragons out of ten. Though this has been a nice journey, I'd rather that they end it here then try to keep going. If DreamWorks is smart, they'll continue to establish the character as one that evolved over time and can pride a positive role model for those that feel let down when peace isn't easy to acquire. Go see it and fly with the dragons one last time.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
51,petra_ste,There were dragons when I was a boy,7,9 February 2019,"Major SPOILERS will follow. Suggestion: if you want to remain spoiler-free, don't watch the official trailer either. It's neat but spoils every single plot development.A bit of background: I love the first movie and the animated series Riders of Berk and Race to the Edge - check them out. I was lukewarm about the second film, which wasn't by all means bad and boasted impressive visuals but lacked the charm of its predecessor for me.This third movie is the conclusion of the adventures of Hiccup and Toothless; I would rate it lower than the first but higher than the second.Positives first. The film looks amazing, the most beautiful How to Train Your Dragon entry. Visuals, animation and set-pieces are top-notch.John Powell provides another lovely score, although I doubt he will ever create something as astounding as his soundtrack for the first film, which ranks among the best of recent movie history for me.Character-wise, the rest of the gang has a bit more to do than in the second film, although Hic, Astrid, Toothless and the new Light Fury get most of the screentime. The new villain Grimmel, with his malicious playfulness, is an improvement over Drago Bludvist, who was something of a blunt instrument. The design of the new ""evil"" dragons (the Deathgrippers) is effective.Here is my major issue with The Hidden World. The bittersweet ending was an excellent idea on paper but the execution, while competent, could have been better. The separation between the young hero and his dragon feels contrived, since the protagonists have just relocated to a larger island and dealt a devastating defeat to their enemies.I find this kind of bittersweet conclusion works better if there is a sort of inevitability to it - like in Toy Story 3, which pulled it off perfectly, or even The Jungle Book fifty years ago, where Mowgli *really* had to choose between staying with his animal friends or living with other humans. This one, for all its emotional background, feels forced.Even worse, it doesn't work thematically with the beautiful moral of the first How to Train Your Dragon (and the series), which was about understanding, integration and mutual enrichment. So humans and dragons CAN'T really live together, after all - each species for itself: the cool flying reptiles are shipped off by the screenwriters to their bioluminescent realm and Vikings return to their ancient costumes.In fact, the over-crowded, chaotic Berk seen in the first act looks like something straight out of the predictions of Mildew, the dragon-hating bigot from Riders of Berk. So the petty minor villain was right all along?And yes, it is sad when the dragons leave, but you're just cashing in on an already established relationship. I did like the epilogue with a mature Hic meeting Toothless again, both of them with their respective families.Another thing, this time not a major flaw, just something I noticed. The movie, like the second one, completely ignores the excellent TV series. For example, there are hordes of dragons onscreen and I don't think I saw *one* of the dozens invented by the show. It feels like the film went out of its way to deliberately avoid any possible reference, even minor. Weird.Overall, The Hidden World is a compelling adventure, both amusing and touching. A solid conclusion, although I can't help but feel underwhelmed. Maybe the gem that was the first movie was just too much to live up to.7/10",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
52,juliankennedy23,Fire cannot kill a dragon.,6,4 September 2019,"How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World (2019): 6 out of 10: How to Train Your dragon ends its trilogy after a surprising long nine-year journey (the first one was released in 2010 for those who are math adverse). The Hidden World provides a satisfactory conclusion to the overall story with a nice journey and a conclusive ending.The Good: First of all this is a gorgeous film. Beautifully animated with incredible use of color The Hidden World really knocks it out the park. The titular Hidden World itself is a standout with great use of both lighting and color. The character designs from the dragons to the humans are also well done with plenty of creativity to differentiate among the group.In addition, we finally have a trilogy with a real ending. A true conclusion. No coming back from this one. No story hooks or to be continued wink at the audience nonsense. Honestly, this is too rare by half in film these days. You know for all the flack that The Matrix Revolutions gets, including from yours truly, it ended in such a way that we can be certain there are not going to be any more Matrix films. Hold on a second I just got a memo. What? The Matrix 4 in 2022 with Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss? But Neo turned into starlight or space dust or computer code at the end of that movie and Trinity had like five pieces of rebar sticking through her body... Ow, my head hurts...Anyway back to How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World where were we. Oh yes, good things about the movie. Well for starters there is Toothless the main alpha cute dragon and star of the show. From his cute bird of paradise dance to attract a mate to a hearty Godzilla roar to assert dominance, he is easily the best-acted person or creature in the film. The fact he doesn't speak outside of Godzilla noises goes a long way towards his winning personality. (In fact not just does he have the Godzilla roar down pat he also does that thing where electricity shoots down the spines on his back, and of course he has that atomic breath, and then in that scene where he attacks the Tokyo Tower... Hold on a minute.)Other standout voice acting include America Ferrera as Astrid the main love interest and common-law wife at this point of the trilogy. F. Murray Abraham as the big bad dragon hunter (He does a great job even though the character itself is a bit of a weak sauce). Gerard Butler does a quick flashback scene to remind people what Vikings actually sound like and poor Cate Blanchett who puts in some great voice work for a character that is saddled with one of the most awkward side plots in the film. (There is an obnoxious teenager who has a crush on her and it is even cringier than that brief description implies.)The Bad: Speaking of obnoxious characters and cringy subplots The Hidden World is simply chock full of these. We have the twins where the boy goes on endlessly about his fake beard and offers unsolicited and unneeded love advice to our main character (Jay Baruchel's Hiccup not Toothless) and his ugly sister who is so obnoxious that the movie hangs a lampshade on it so that when she is kidnapped the big bad lets her go so as not to have to listen to her anymore. Unfortunately, the audience has no such out. Add in the teenage Viking with a crush on Hiccup's mother and a half a dozen other ""comedy"" relief characters and it becomes overwhelming. They just take so much screen time.The big bads lifetime goal is to kill the last night flyer (Toothless natch.) He is an idiot. How often does he shoot Toothless with a tranquilizer gun at least twice if I recall? He is like a freakin Bond villain. I am half surprised he doesn't go full Goldeneye and tell Toothless his entire plan and then put Toothless and his love interest in a jet cockpit and go off for a cup of tea because there is no way a dragon could get out of that.Luckily for the big bad our hero Hiccup is even a bigger idiot. There is an excellent scene at the beginning of the film where Hiccup and his friends rescue a bunch of dragons from slavers. It is very well realized with dragon armor and flaming swords and an attempt at stealth. Yet when the big bad is headed their way with four dragons of his own and a hundred ships they go for the exact same strategy.Hiccup you have hundreds of dragons under your control. All the big bad has is four dragons and a hundred ships filled with his entire army, wooden ships, very flammable wooden ships. I mean you don't have to be Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains to figure out what to do next.The Ugly: I have given all three otherwise excellent How to Train Your Dragon films a better than average but still lukewarm reception. The problem I have (your mileage will definitely vary) is voice actor Jay Baruchel. He was a little off for the part as a rebellious teenager who doesn't want to be a Viking king but at least Baruchel was in the ballpark for that particular role. As an actual Viking king and leader of men, he hasn't grown, voice wise, an inch.I have a hard time believing that there wasn't a voice coach off to the side saying ""Could you try not sounding like you are complaining that the NYU cafeteria is out of the organic feta?"". He simply doesn't sound like a Viking. Any Viking. Ever. It is the conundrum of fitting the actor to the part. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a good actor but you wouldn't hire him to play FDR. Dustin Hoffman is an excellent actor but he isn't going out for the lead in The Larry Bird Story. Baruchel has been simply unable to grow into the part if he was even right for the part, to begin with. It is a shadow over the whole enterprise.In Conclusion: As third sequels to animated films go this is a good one. They put money on the screen and delivered a beautiful product with a satisfying conclusion. Well worth a watch for fans of the series.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

This shows that the franchise is not afraid to take chances and the third feature makes it clear that director Dean DeBlois' plan was to create a finite work - that is, at the end of this film, you will see the end of Hiccup's journey.Much of the merit is due to the charisma of the central duo. Clumsy and insecure, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is an imperfect hero, whose virtues are subject to failure (his persistence, for example, is sometimes confused with stubbornness), which makes him quite identifiable. Toothless has been captivating since the first seconds on the screen. The mixture of canine and feline traits that characterizes his personality and his movements reinforces the idea that his friendship with the human reflects that of a child with a pet - a concept apparently dear to the director and screenwriter Dean DeBlois, who had already explored him on his big screen debut, Lilo & Stitch (2002). This relationship is put to the test in the new film. In the plot, Berk's knights go on a collision course with a group of hunters led by the relentless Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham), who aims to exterminate the Night Furies. The only way to save all dragons is to go looking for the Hidden World, the mythical home of winged creatures.In a way, the whole trilogy went somehow in unexpected ways, even with the obligation to sustain the simplistic adventurous sense for children's eyes, which worked more by leveraging the characters' dramatic arcs, and the issues with them at stake, than that properly just the fun of the adventure itself. In this structural sense, it is repetitive, and it was even expected that it would be so at this point in the championship, especially looking at the aspect of division of acts as the trilogy behaves, this being only an outcome of what was presented in the others. Because of this, on individually comparative levels and on subversive storytelling issues, this is below, since the conflicts are the same, the clash with the threat and the excuses for it to exist would come from colonialist motivations, as well as the internal conflict of I sob to be a good leader.The last chapter of the trilogy is correct when returning to previously established themes. As in the second feature (2014), the burden of responsibility weighs heavily on Hiccup, who is now forced to make the most controversial decision since he became leader of his people. And like what happens in the first one (2010), he needs to embrace his own identity - which, this time, includes recognizing his value as an individual, regardless of his best friend. Toothless also has an arc of self-knowledge, a consequence of the encounter with a female of her species. By the way, the interaction between the two dragons yields some of the most adorable moments in the franchise. In particular, the court on the beach, which makes a fun reference to the 2010 film. The supporting cast, on the other hand, has its ups and downs. Astrid (America Ferrera) obviously stands out - the subplot of the marriage suggests an interesting parallel between her relationship with Hiccup and his with Toothless, since, in both cases, the couples seek to balance involvement and autonomy; unfortunately, the idea is poorly developed and wasted.Exploring new worlds is one of the reasons for the franchise and its success. Throughout the trilogy, fans followed the evolution of the imagined design, the different environments created and the different species of dragons, led by the ultra-charismatic and the one you want to take home, Toothless. If Hiccup's achievements are no longer exciting enough, the animation puts us above the clouds, flying over this universe on the back of dragons in chilling sequences, enhanced by the big screens and the striking soundtrack. The electrifying musical theme evokes the sensations of all the films and punctuates the breathtaking climax that sums up the feelings of watching ""How to Train Your Dragon 3"". Dean DeBlois's direction is incredible and self-referring all the time. He uses established plans in the previous films and brings some beautiful new ones. One of the most beautiful scenes in the trilogy is in this film. His affection for the characters is clear and a work that treats his pieces with such love and care deserves to be praised.The action sequences, the feature may even have a less grand scale than its predecessors, but when it invests, we run out of breath. The proof of this is a sequel plan that starts right at the beginning of the film, when the heroes are gathered to free dragons trapped in a boat. It is easily one of the most exciting moments in the film. Photography, which once again had the supervision of Roger Deakins (Blade Runner), is one of the great highlights of the production. The composition of light has always been in evidence in the trilogy and, in this film, scenes like that of the Secret World and even the opening in Berk - which in the first film was a gray city and now seems much larger and colorful - have a natural light difficult to find in animations.Perhaps, the main ""problem"" of the film lies in its plot construction. As the original title suggests, part of the story concerns the ""Hidden World"", which is a dragon sanctuary located near the end of the world. To escape from Grimmel, Hiccup decides to find that place and transfer his dragons there. However, there is little of the Secret World at stake. Anyone who expected to see a beautiful world full of dragons like the sanctuary of Valka in the second film, will be disappointed - but not for the absence of that world, but for the very brief appearance of it. Despite being in the original title of the feature, the Secret World is nowhere near the focus of the plot.On the other hand, the fun is precisely in building Toothless's passion. The period in which he conquers the Fury of Light may even have been well explored in the trailers, but it is precisely the comic sense here that makes the film lighter than the first two, for example. And that makes Hiccup's plot and Grimmel's threat more digestible. However, there is a lack of balance between these plots - and this is clear when we realize that some characters are left out for a while at the expense of another plot. There is a relatively long segment where Toothless himself, one of the stars of the film, simply does not appear, as he is not part of the ""highlighted"" plot. In addition, the film has a regressive grandeur and sense of climax in relation to the previous ones. As much as Grimmel is a very interesting villain, visually tricky and clearly threatening, the character still does not compare with Drago, the main villain of the second feature. The climax itself is a regression in relation to the first ones. Some emotional element is missing that makes the journey a path of loss and gain, and in the end, the experience that everything went well is good and comforting, but we miss the feeling that, in war, something needs to be lost - as a leg or even a parent.How to Train Your Dragon 3 concludes the journey of how a clumsy boy became a great leader and shows how to close a trilogy. The film has a very strong connection with the animation that started the franchise and, therefore, has several mirrored moments that only more attentive fans will notice, ending this story in a touching way, managing to draw some tears, reminding us that not everything they are losses - but even so, goodbyes are necessary (something that even has a metaphorical content about the franchise itself). Dean DeBlois manages to finish an arc in an extremely satisfactory way, closing all ends of the universe and, mainly, maturing his whole idea in detachment. A detachment from the traditional that started from a dream that also had to be left. The dragon cannot be trained, but it is possible to train with him to learn how to make a fairer world possible. And so, we have one of the greatest trilogies in the history of animation.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
55,Animany94,"Underwhelming, but has its moments.",7,21 June 2019,"Admittedly, I'm not a fan of the HTTYD franchise aside from the second movie, but every movie did really good jobs at certain points.I saw this finale in theaters with a friend and felt the same way about as I did with the first movie. The animation is still breathtaking and Toothless is still adorable and gets a nice and entertaining romance here which made me laugh many times.But once more I felt the same about the characters. Aside from Hiccup and Astrid all of his friends still seem like they haven't changed a bit still being one-trope characters. The villain was pretty weak with motives that weren't very original or heavy on threat.The ending was the best thing, because if there's something we all can agree on, it's the fact that the friendship between Hiccup and Toothless is so strong that you can't help but care for them every step of the way. A perfect ending no doubt.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

57,MihaiSorinToma,A big disappointment,6,16 February 2019,"Realizing that their home isn't going to fit all the dragons that are rescued, Hiccup starts searching for a new home. Remembering an unlikely tale of a dragon world, he starts to look for it while having to defend in the meantime from a new enemy who seems to be able to control dragons into doing evil deeds.The third installment finds Hiccup and his friends in search for a new place which can accommodate all the dragons who follow their Alfa. His new adventures will put his character to the test, especially as his relation with Astrid seems to have become everyone's problem. The plot presented here seems interesting at first especially with the new elements it introduces but the implementation leaves a lot to be desired as far as I'm concerned. It manages to be so boring that I ended up not paying attention to some scenes which simple were too prolonged without any justification. It's mostly predictable while losing interest and attention pretty often, which is a big disappointment. The characters are mostly the same, well developed and put into play, being mostly good, especially if you've seen the previous movies of the franchise.In terms of visuals, it looks very good, but this has become a bit normal. It doesn't do anything extraordinary regarding this department but it's still way up there. The sound is also good and the voice acting does its job well.Whether I want it or not, I have to compare it with its predecessors and this is where it gets even worse for this movie. The story doesn't come any close to the complexity and depth of the other two, especially when speaking of the first one. It's mediocre at best, not managing to keep you glued to the screen as the others were able to. At least it has a good and unpredictable finale which raises up the bar a bit but it's too late to do anything to the overall impression. Furthermore, it isn't able to send emotion, create drama or laughter as the previous movies have done with style.It feels like a sequel which had to be done. If the previous two were very good and the franchise is still alive, they decided to do another one just because they could. It had a couple of good ideas, but the implementation is far from good. I love this franchise, especially its beginning, but judging by the way this one ended up, I can't feel anything but disappointment.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
58,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"A beautiful heartfelt conclusion to the trilogy, The Hidden World is another third movie from DreamWorks that works",10,26 March 2020,"Now that it's been ten years since the first How To Train Your Dragon came out, I'm gonna review this third and final installment of the trilogy.The film takes place a year after the second film where Hiccup and Toothless along with the other dragon riders encounter a new villain also known as a Night Fury killer named Grimmel. Upon figuring out a plan to find a new place where the Vikings and Dragons can be safe, Toothless meets a Light Fury and the two form a romance while Hiccup tries to learn whether or not he should let the Night Fury go.This movie is perfect. It maintains the qualities that made the first two films work. The writing is superb as it brought a lot of pathos to the characters while continuing to expand the world of Berk. Also it retains the heart humor and emotion while wrapping up the trilogy in pure fashion. Now I know other people criticized this film for disregarding the friendship theme that the first two films had and I understand why, but that doesn't ruin the film for me in any way.As usual the characters are still likeable as is the friendship bond between Hiccup and Toothless. Not to mention Grimmel makes for a really effective villain voiced wonderfully by F. Murray Abraham. Voice acting wise, everyone does stellar job. Jay Baruchel America Ferrara Cate Blanchett Gerard Butler Jonah Hill Kristen Wiig Justin Rupple (who replaced T.J. Miller due to the actor's allegations and the bomb incident) and Kit Harriton (Jon Snow from Game of Thrones) continue to bring life into their main protagonists sharing certain scenes (which I won't spoil to those who haven't seen this film yet).Everything else is also great. The animation continues to be beautiful with expressive movements from the characters and stunningly detailed visuals including the Hidden World. The action sequences, much like the first two, are neat and so are the flying sequences. And last but not least the music score.John Powell maintains the themes from the previous films while adding some new fresh material including the romance theme between Toothless and the Light Fury and Jonsi, the singer of the band Sigur Ros who did the songs for the first two, contributed to the theme for the Hidden World.Overall How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World not only succeeds as a conclusion but its an example of why DreamWorks can create a really good third installment that maintains what made the previous movies perfect and not insult its audience (I'm looking at you, Shrek the Third). My recommendation, check this one out and make sure to bring some tissues.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

I kind of don't like the love and romance scenes of toothless and his new girlfriend. I feel it's kind of disgusting. Maybe I'm not that kind of into love, drama and romance films, so, I feel like it.All in all, it's kind of enjoyable if you're into romance films. Too bad that Hiccup grew up.

60,kjproulx,A Fantastic Conclusion to a Fantastic Trilogy,10,23 February 2019,"The How to Train Your Dragon films have been some of the best-animated features each year that they have been released. After the first film, I never once could have guessed that a sequel would be anywhere near as good. To my surprise, the second instalment built off the original story and was just as good of a film. I'm also happy to report that this is how one of the best-animated trilogies ever made, in my opinion. It has been quite some time since a trilogy of films has been consistently great from start to finish. If you are a fan of this series in any way, I highly recommend seeking this one out. I doubt you will be disappointed.Picking up years after the events of the second film, Hiccup is how the chief of Berk, where people have now created a Dragon utopia, where they save and build homes for them. Seeming like the world is at ease, a new threat now looms on the horizon in Grimmel. Threating the lives of every dragon, they must band together and search for the long lost Hidden World of dragons. This story has been told many times throughout the years and the villain himself is quite bland, but that is simply not the point here. The villains have been fairly generic from the very beginning, but I believe that is due to the fact that viewers are supposed to care more about the core characters over anything else.Once again, the animation is out of this world and I found myself captivated by every frame. Whether it was two characters interacting with a gorgeous backdrop or dragons soaring through the skies with an emotional score to support the visuals, I was blown away by this movie on a technical level. Dreamworks animation is now at the point where they can compete with Disney/Pixar and possibly be even better. We are in fantastic times for animation and I can't see it getting much better than this.The promotional material has been promoting this film as the final instalment of this trilogy and it definitely feels like that throughout the final moments of this film. Not only does this movie have the best ending out of all three of these movies, but it's honestly one of the best and most satisfying conclusions to a film I have seen in a long time. Having loved the previous two films, this conclusion felt earned and emotional for those who have been invested from the beginning.In the end, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is on par with the first two films in terms of how well the story is told. These movies care about their characters and this movie brings the series full circle in the best possible way. If you have been invested like me, it will be very hard to not walk out of this film with a big smile on your face. I loved every minute of my experience watching this movie and I feel it will be a long time before we see another animated series come along that gives the How to Train Your Dragon films a run for their money. This is a fantastic film and a fantastic trilogy overall.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
61,Neptune165,It wasn't great,5,21 October 2019,"The villain isn't interesting, The second movie was a lot better than the third one (in my opinion) the third one just wasn't as good to me. what I felt with this trilogy, is exactly the same I felt about The Dark Knight Trilogy, it started with a good and enjoyable movie (ending with a bang and expectations for the adventures to come). Then it blew me away with the second one, with an epic villain, and with the death of an important character, that hits you in the gut, and an ending so tense and exciting... And finally, the last one, the one that should be the most epic of the trilogy, the one that should close the circle and fulfill all of our expectations and leave us in awe and with our expectations fulfilled, ends up with a dull villain, a plot filled with dumb decisions, resulting in a movie that fell short compared with the previous ones, and failed to surpass (or even reach) the epicness of the second movie, and with an ending that is totally forgettable and felt empty, so dissapointed",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

64,MrDHWong,A wholesome and appropriate conclusion to the popular film series,9,10 January 2019,"How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is the third and final film in DreamWorks Animation's How to Train Your Dragon trilogy. Based on the set of books of the same name by Cressida Cowell, it is a wholesome and appropriate conclusion to the popular film series.One year after the events of the second film, the young Viking Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) has become chief of the village of Berk and has successfully helped humans and dragons live in harmony with each other. In his time as chief, Hiccup has been leading missions to rescue dragons from dragon hunters and on one particular mission, he discovers that Toothless is not the last Night Fury when he encounters a white female Night Fury (dubbed ""Light Fury"" by his girlfriend Astrid) being held captive. A short time later, Berk is attacked by an evil dragon hunter named Grimmel (voiced by F. Murray Abraham) and Hiccup decides to move the entire village to ""The Hidden World"", a mysterious place his father told him about as a child where all dragons call home.Touching and sweet, How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is just the right way to end this series of films - on a high note. There's so much to enjoy in seeing not only the continuing friendship between Hiccup and Toothless, but also in Toothless and his love interest Light Fury. Each tender moment between the two of them was so adorable to watch and one cannot help but cheer Toothless on as he attempts to court one of the last of his kind. On the technical side, the animation has improved significantly over the past 9 years, with its gorgeous visuals shown off within the titular Hidden World. In addition to this, the voice cast is still solid, with the likeable Jay Baruchel once again reprising his role as Hiccup. Despite no longer being the scrawny weakling he was in the original film, Hiccup is still relatable to the audience as he still has realistic problems to face. As a concluding chapter, this film ties up just about every loose end so I am hopeful that there are not any future cash-grab sequels made that will compromise the overall enjoyment of these three fantastic animated features.I rate it 8.5/10",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

Hiccup and Astrid are both far more complete and interesting characters here than in the previous one, and their relationship was pleasant. The themes they get into here are interesting, though a specific choice at the end isn't fully satisfying to me. The parallels in Hiccup worrying about Toothless like a parent was clear, and the general struggle to let go of people and allow them their own joy, whether as a friend or parent, resonated. I also liked the villain, and most of the side characters were fine, if mostly stupid (the monologue by Roughnut to the villain, beginning with ""Why the long face?"" was golden though). The score and visuals are as delightful as ever. My only source of discontentment was in the message of the ending. It absolutely makes sense on the basic literal level that the dragons leave and go to their own land. However, the implication is that humans are too greedy for them to ever be truly safe and live in peace, and also implies that the separation and segregation of the two societies ends up being best, which is a bit troubling. The world was set up such that there's no clear solution, but it does feel like a strange and sad message. Still, at the character level it was totally reasonable for Toothless, Hiccup, and Astrid. The trilogy never had me fully captivated, but the characters were the most engaging in this one, and the humor didn't hurt, either.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

When Hiccup discovers Toothless isn't the only Night Fury, he searches out to find ""The Hidden World"", a utopia where dragons live in harmony, before a hired tyrant, Grimmel, finds him first. So I really like this franchise so I was excited. At first I wasn't as excited though because the first trailer didn't make it look that good. I did like this one though. The story was interesting and kept me wanting it to continue. It was a little more predictable than the others which I was a little disappointed with. It was also a little more aimed for children than the others were. After the first act of the movie it got better with that. The story had heart to it and that's what I love about these movies. It's a simple idea that's so complex as it continues. Hands down my favorite scene was with Toothless and him trying to impress the Light Fury. It was creative, cute, and fun. Toothless was very fun and a great character as he usually is. The characters were amazing once again. Jay Baruchel as Hiccup was perfect. This was my favorite Hiccup in all of the movies. We had all the development in the past two yet they still added some more to him. Since he's a leader now he had to make a lot of decisions that effect everything. These conflicts built his character even more. America Ferrera as Astrid was good once again too. The same goes for Astrid too. She's involved with basically everything Hiccup is involved with so her character builds too. Also there relationship was cute in this one. The biggest disappointment of the movie was Grimmel. He was a very weak antagonist and I didn't like the scenes with him. They were just kind of there. His motives weren't strong enough where I could feel for him. It was more that he didn't like the lifestyle of Berk. Needless to say it wasn't a great conflict. The animation was stellar. It reminded me of Disney Pixar's Coco with all the little things added and how colorful it was. John Powell's iconic score was great once again. Overall this was another good movie and a good conclusion (hopefully they don't make more). It was my least favorite out of the franchise (favorite to least favorite: 1, 2, and 3) but still good. I would recommend seeing it. If you're a fan of the others you'll probably like it.My Grade: B+",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

I strongly recommend that you stop watching after the first.The second really showed that the writers did not intend for this to be a full series by not having a solid script prepared (or not enough time to write one), leaving them to play off the wonder of the first and upscale the epic scenery and battles. This made a weaker but still decent script with good visuals.Despite having much more production time, the third film falls noticeably short of even the second. The visuals were good as expected, although the fights were much smaller scale, noticeably reducing the epicness. The story was as bland as the second, but it now introduced some poor cliches, the worst of which being an extremely over-monologuing villain.

79,Magow-Intermean,How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World Review,9,24 March 2019,"Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), now chief of Berk, has turned the island into a thriving dragon haven. When hunter Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham) threatens to disrupt the peace, Hiccup sets out to discover the legendary Hidden World and establish a dragon and Viking utopia.
For all its mythical fire-breathing reptiles, the How To Train Your Dragon series is a coming-of-age story at heart. Hiccup (Jay Baruchel), originally a kid on the cusp of adolescence, and Toothless, his adorable Night Fury, have grown up incrementally with each instalment - a boy-and-his-cat-dragon duo who rank among DreamWorks Animation's most emotionally engaging partnerships.
The Hidden World takes Hiccup into young adulthood, wielding his flame-sword confidently as chief of the Isle of Berk - but he and Toothless face diverging futures. Marriage could be on the cards for Hiccup if he can stop dithering and finally propose to Astrid (America Ferrera), while Toothless now has a romantic foil of his own. Stumbling across a Light Fury, the yin to his yang, the dragon is instantly smitten. His doe-eyed lovestruck antics, including the sort of flamboyant flirting usually reserved for a David Attenborough doc, are The Hidden World's utterly charming highlight.
The big goodbye doesn't quite sucker-punch the tear ducts like it should.
But the Light Fury also heralds the emergence of hunter Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham) - a menacing villain with his own set of dragons that spew bright-green, Xenomorph-blood acid. Despite his peroxide-blonde hair, Grimmel is no Targaryen - his attitude to dragons is far from friendly, forcing Hiccup to seek new horizons for Berk and its people.
Despite the dramatic urgency Grimmel brings, the film struggles to streamline its plot threads and character pay-offs. It takes a little long to really get going, while irritating supporting characters like Tuffnut and Ruffnut (Justin Rupple, Kristen Wiig) clutter the screen - if the franchise's initial audience has since grown up, the dialogue here skews frustratingly young. There are highlights - the opening misty dragon raid by Hiccup and pals, the DayGlo arrival to the titular Hidden World - though the original's exhilarating flying sequences remain unmatched.
Crucially, with so much going on and a reluctance to bench its minor players, The Hidden World barely leaves room for the contemplative character moments an ending chapter deserves. When that big goodbye finally arrives, it doesn't quite sucker-punch the tear ducts in the way it should. Compared to the elegiac climax of Toy Story 3 - and Dragon is as close as DreamWorks comes to Pixar-level sentiment - this farewell to Hiccup and Toothless' childhood friendship could burn a little brighter.
DreamWorks Animation's most heartfelt series bows out with a beautifully designed finale, but the long-awaited emotional goodbyes for its beloved central duo don't quite soar.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
80,W011y4m5,Bittersweet,8,17 July 2019,"""How To Train Your Horny Dragon"" would've been a more befitting title for the final installment in this trilogy - a story which draws to a satisfying, if not, bitter-sweet conclusion after 3 impressively consistent films.
The ending felt unavoidable & right yet still hurt all the same & it's incredible to look back at where it all started & realise how far these characters have come & how they've progressed since the first... It's a franchise which has grown with its audience & followed Hiccup since childhood & carried him into adulthood, watching him transcend from a boy & into a man.
My only regret is how little time Toothless & Hiccup spend together in this last film - I would've loved to have seen just a little more of their adorable bond on screen, considering this was the final tale & their relationship is what makes it special - having them be apart for most of it was admittedly unfortunate.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
81,jamiedarlow-37510,A beautiful ending to the trilogy!,8,15 March 2020,"Highly recommended for cinema viewing and an astounding animation achievement, the third part of the How To Train Your Dragon trilogy is a bittersweet and beautiful ending. This time, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and Toothless discover that there is another Night Fury in the world; an elusive and magical being they name there Light Fury. Toothless is love struck immediately and Hiccup must help him to find the mystical Hidden World where all dragons coexist in a perfect utopia before a new threat finds it first. This trilogy is absolutely Dreamworks best accomplishment to date and writer/director Dean DeBlois (Lilo & Stitch) crafts a world so full of emotion, genuine warmth and incredible characters guaranteed to engage and entertain. Just as Stitch was an amazing cinematic creation, as is Toothless who is a key component of the warmth in the series, particularly in his relationship with Hiccup who is also a beautifully written and realised character. The whole film team are clearly so passionate about this world and the detail in each frame is extraordinary. The pathos in each instalment feels real and adds a real depth that distinguises them quite a bit from other mainstream animation nowadays. As for this chapter, it never fails to delight, amuse (Toothless' mating dance is one of the greatest things ever to be seen!) and keep you on the edge of your seat. Wonderfully animated, breathtakingly cinematic, great voice acting from a very talented cast, action packed and heart warming, this is a series to remember!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

84,gavinp9,"Delightful and uplifting fun, excellent conclusion.",8,5 January 2019,"'How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World' is the third & final film in one of the best trilogies of recent memory - it lives up to the benchmark set by the first two films and has solid character development and a fantastic ending, rather than just rehashing the same motifs. There's so much great CGI to watch - oceans, clouds, forests, caves, waterfalls, and obviously, hundreds of dragons! It's all really colourful, fun and enjoyableThe plot is that now most of the dragons are living in their Norse village, pirates keep stealing them, so Hiccup, Astrid, Eret (Harington), Snotlout (Hill), Fishlegs (Mintz-Plasse), Gobber (Ferguson), Ruffnut (Wiig) and Tuffnut (Miller) have to keep rescuing them. Since this is unsustainable, they try to find the hidden realm beyond the edge of the world where dragons originated from. In the meantime, Toothless is being hunted by the evil Grimmel (Abraham) who wants to destroy all Night Furies.Even though it's all fantasy and about dragons, there's two great love stories in the film - Hiccup (Baruchel) & Astrid (Ferrera) and Toothless and the Light Fury. Along with love comes loss, and the film does a great job of portraying to kids that change is inevitable and is handled really well. There's a few funny moments, lots of great action scenes and plenty of sweet moments. Almost had a tear in my eye at the end!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Green Book. I thought it was a strange title for a film then I realised as the film progressed that the Green Book was a thing, and as I sat captivated throughout this entire film I found that it never ceases to amaze and sadden me how humans treat fellow humans based on colour alone. This is a story inspired by the true friendship that developed between Tony Lip, a working-class American Italian from New York and Dr Don Shirley, a black pianist who employs Tony to be his driver for a tour of the Deep South where racial prejudice is right at the forefront of their whole existence. This film was exquisite, a tale of two men who are as far apart as can possibly be, one street smart, rough and ready, the other a highly educated and cultured person. They began as boss and employee and slowly formed a true and lasting friendship. Viggo Mortensen played Tony Lip and delivered a quite amazing performance. He combined the brash Italian character, with someone who had strong family values and a deep sense of good about him, even though he took the job just for the money he developed as a character as the film went along. Mahershala Ali, who played Dr Shirley was elegant and dignified throughout. This is a film I would happily watch again and again.11 February 2019

This time around, Hiccup and Toothless find out that there is in fact another Night Fury, a female; which prompts a search for a hidden world of dragons, with a malicious tyrant looking to spread damage in their direction, as he wants to hunt dragons, especially Night Furies.A visually stunning motion picture, the hidden world is portrayed as a marvel, a delightful place to admire in awe, because of its bright colorful patterns and shapes, and the enormous and varied amount of dragon species living down there. It's not only a daring ride but also an emotional rollercoaster that concludes in the most satisfying way one can hope for. The story and dialogues were wonderfully written, respecting the story, the larger story that has been building since the first film, without resorting to cheap shots just to shock viewers for the sake of it.A much pleasurable journey, dignified with a sublime ending.

94,FairlyAnonymous,"A visual masterpiece, but I can't really recommend it",6,6 April 2019,"How to Train Your Dragon has been a pretty good series all things considered. It had an unexpectedly terrific first film, a great sequel, and an actual conclusion to the main story with the third film. Not a lot of films in modern times will actually put a conclusion to a story, but this series does!Now that being said, is this movie good?Not... exactly.HTTYD3 suffers from similar issues that Into the Spider-verse suffered from where it has too many themes and plot points to juggle and it ends up dropping all of them when instead it should've kept things more focused. This movie does have moments of brilliance and clever writing, but as a whole it doesn't know what it is about.The movie has several different ideas going on: Teamwork among friends, getting married, letting people go, learning to love those you lose, accepting responsibility, learning to be independent, being a leader, and many other concepts. However, very few of them are actually the focus of the story and very few of the characters in the film have evolved to carry these kind of themes.Character Problems:1. Hiccup's friends are the actual worst set of on-screen friends I have seen in an animated film. While they are all supposed to be adults at this point, instead they are still acting like how they did in the first movie when they were antagonists to Hiccup. As an audience, we are told to believe that these are people Hiccup would hang out with, talk to, trust, and call his allies, but in almost EVERY SCENE his friends are acting selfishly, spoiled, or are intentionally insulting Hiccup to make him feel bad so that they can gain more social power. His friends were more mature in HTTYD2 than they are in this and yet their relationship is SUPPOSED TO BE STRONGER!!! His friends just really bring the movie down and not one of their jokes lands properly (some are actually downright creepy/uncomfortable).2. Hiccup's mom does nothing in this film. Wasted potential.3. Astrid has evolved very little in this film and while it's great to see her get some moments she still doesn't have the screen-time she needs. It's unfortunate that at this point she has been reduced down to a role where once per movie Astrid and Hiccup stand on a cliff and Hiccup will say something like ""I don't know what to do. Can I trust myself?"" then Astrid says, ""I trust you. Do your crazy plan."" and then Hiccup says, ""Thanks. I'm going to do the crazy plan."". As a character, she has not evolved past this point. It's almost comical that a lot of her dialogue is almost line per line (or beat per beat) the same as it was in the last two films. The reason why she was likable in the first movie was because she had a character change and was able to be her own individual character with an arc while also able to recognize greatness in Hiccup. At this point she is just Hiccup's motivator when he is feeling down or confused.
Characters aside, the movie also has some serious tonal inconsistencies where there will be life-threatening circumstances that are treated as throw-away jokes or characters who might be on the edge of death and someone will say, ""Eh, I don't really care.""All in all, HTTYD3 has all of the potential to be a great film but as of now it feels like two or more movies crammed into a 90 minute experience. It needed to either be a longer film (which isn't going to happen based on the budget) or it needed to cut out unnecessary elements and focus on the most important themes and elements. To me, the best and most interesting part of the story is the concept of Toothless becoming a chief of his own world while Hiccup is the chief of his world and how do the two of them emotionally adapt to their relationships/callings. This is a great concept where best friends have to acknowledge that maybe what is best for the world is them not being together anymore... but sadly it is not given the time or development that it needs to convey that theme with the depth and nuance that it needs.That being said, it is still one of the most visually impressive animated films I've seen in terms of lighting, texture, and environment design. Well done!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

I knew this was going to be the final movie of the trilogy so reasonably I thought yeah it's going to be entertaining at least. I came out a little underwhelmed. My biggest issue with the movie is that it rehashes similar themes and scenes of the first two that it didn't impress me nearly as much. Yeah, the animation is fantastic and I love
the score by John Powell, but it just feels like a very standard sequel. How to Train Your Dragon 2 took risks and got surprisingly dark in places. This one, it focuses mostly on a pretty forgettable villain and Toothless' love interest, who is bland and nowhere near as memorable. The humour didn't work as well for me and seemed more kiddy-ish compared to the previous two. Everything felt safer and generic.Despite all this, I never found the movie boring and still enjoyed it. I appreciate that the writers and animators have been growing up the characters as time goes by, and Hiccup and the others having to decide what to do with their Dragons and not always relying on them was a nice theme of the movie. Hiccup and Toothless interacting with each other is always a highlight, and the action sequences are well shot and colourful as expected. The last 10 minutes were great, as I really liked all the characters having a big final send-off and concluding the entire trilogy nicely. It almost got to me, honestly. I just wished the main plot was a bit more engaging and not stuff we're already seen before. On the upside, it wasn't bad at least.6.5/10",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

The film also goes many places where the trilogy hasn't gone before with Hiccup learning even more about Toothless' behaviour and special abilities. Toothless finally finds a dragon girlfriend which is played just they way you thought it would, the scenes are very funny and should get a few good laughs.The beauty of the animation has once again improved even more over the last film, with all the locations looking borderline photorealistic with it's own style. The dragons fly with such majestic beauty and grace that it isn't hard to tell that the animators worked their butts of to making the movie looking as visually stellar and awe inspiring as it could be. The dragons are beautifully animates as well as the human characters looking more detailed than they ever did before, with all of their recognisable features.The characters are also just as charming as they always were with Hiccup now finally entering manhood and the growth of character that comes along with it. The villain is also very entertaining and pretty funny and is good with the way they handle him. The whole senquence where they enter the hidden world is very well done and very beautiful, the movie is full of imagination and humor and captivates the audience just like the first one did back in 2010. If you are a fan of HTTYD then this movie will not disappoint your expectations, it will exceed them and leave you emotionally satisfied with how the trilogy concluded.

97,pinkarray,Disappointing finale but the clunky story becomes solid about halfway through.,7,14 March 2019,"I have to give this film a mediocre 6 or 7. Why? Because of the messy plot and all of the new characters being uninteresting.The beginning was boring due to it taking like 20 minutes too long to get to the main plot. A lot of it is just characters doing silly stuff. But once they get to the main plot, it's still bogged down by sappy romance between Toothless and a bland dragon who I will get to and a tiresome villain. Instead of focusing on dragon romance, why not focus more on Hiccup's character development since he's trying to adjust to being a leader? Or more focus on them trying to find the hidden world and they run into more obstacles that bring about action? Action and adventure is what I expect from a How to Train Your Dragon film. Or better yet, both, of course.The light fury didn't have much personality. Compared to Toothless, this is really disappointing how much he stands out in personality compared to whoever this light fury is. Because of that, the romantic subplot between them was boring. And why didn't anybody name her?The reason why Hiccup and Astrid's relationship work is because both of them are well-written characters. They both have distinct personalities and there is more to them than just being young people developing a budding romance.The villain is a boring character with no motivation or personality other than he's a bad guy who likes to kill dragons. He also tends to bog the film down by explaining details like the lore too much and this all makes him a forgettable character.The returning characters are all still good, though. Nothing's changed about them. Hiccup gets decent character development and Valka's really cool and smart.It isn't until like an hour into the film where they really start focusing more on the plot and the film becomes solid. So, yes, it's a clunky story but it gets better. Some of the jokes are corny and they're not laugh-out-loud moments but some of them were a little funny.Overall, the film did not go out with a bang but it wasn't that bad of a finale.

99,RhapsodyReviews,Another Great Addition.,9,3 February 2020,"Review:
'How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World' is an action-fantasy film directed by Dean DeBlois. It is the third installment in the 'How to Train Your Dragon' series and is loosely based on the book series of the same name by Cressida Cowell.
This movie, in my opinion, is one of the best animated movies, ever; not just because of the success the series had, but I was very impressed with the development of the characters.
The film's plot follows Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) seeking a dragon utopia called ""The Hidden World"" while coming to terms with Toothless' new bond with a female Light Fury.
Much like the first two film before it, everybody plays their characters well. They are gown up and while their voices haven't changed, the way they talk have and it's very well done. F. Murray Abraham was added to the main cast as this story's villain and he was a great addition. He wasn't as big or seemed like as big of a threat as Drago Bludvist (Djimon Hounsou) from the second film but was smart and menacing.
The animation is the best in the trilogy. The hidden world is so colorful and vibrant it really makes your eyes glued to the screen. The plot is great and works perfectly as a third chapter for this trilogy. The characters have some of the most outstanding growths. Getting to watch these characters grow from children to adults has been one of the most realistic experiences I've ever seen put to film.
Overall, this was a great conclusion to a beautiful and visually stunning triology.

100,hunter-friesen,"""Hidden World"" beautifully caps off trilogy",6,28 February 2019,"Without many people noticing, the ""How to Train Your Dragon"" series has become one of the most highly regarded modern trilogies. The first two films struck a chord between audiences and critics by telling the beautiful story of a friendship between a boy and his dragon. The third and final film in the franchise, ""How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World"" meets the bar set by its predecessors and caps off a series a decade in the making.Now the leader of Berk, Hiccup has transformed the island into a dragon sanctuary. Due to their vulnerability and approaching enemies, Hiccup decides to search for an underground dragon paradise known as the Hidden World. At the same time, a new Night Fury mysteriously appears, catching the eye of Toothless. With both their physical and emotional fortitude being tested by new outside forces, both Hiccup, and Toothless will have to re-examine their bond and decide what truly matters to them.First and foremost, this is an absolutely gorgeous movie with several stunning shots. In association with the great Roger Deakins, cinematographer Gal Zimmerman has crafted a beautiful breathing world filled with vivid colors. Director Dean DeBlois uses the outstanding cinematography to its fullest potential as a large part of the film takes place in the foreground of majestic vistas. He also uses stages many of his scenes with single camera movements that make for more believable action.DeBlois proves to work best without dialogue as he creates great emotional depth through movement and expression. The dragons benefit the most from this as they are developed into full characters, with most being more fleshed out than the humans.As always, composer John Powell delivers another amazing score. The mix of epic and tenderness makes Powell's score quite possibly the best part of the film as it combines with the sweeping imagery.Serving as the sole writer, DeBlois isn't as good on paper as he is behind the camera.The script for this entry follows beat for beat with the previous two installments. The main theme of dragons and humans learning how to coexist is heavily touched on, but this time to the point of boredom. I realize it's the essential crutch of the trilogy, it's just tiring to tread the same points for the third film in a row. There's only so much that can be said until it becomes monotonous.The film also feels quite overstuffed as too many supporting characters fight for a small number of good jokes. Most of them turn out to be quite irritating as they only get one trait that wears thin incredibly quickly.The thread of single trait characters can also be extended to the main villain, Grimmel, who's one defining characteristic is that he's evil. Instead of developing him and creating justifications for his actions, DeBlois back up everything Grimmel does with the explanation that he's a bad guy that does bad things.Even with all his faults, DeBlois does do a great job with the final act. He effortlessly ends the series on a high note through sequences of heartfelt character interaction that will bring tears to audiences of all ages.Compared to most other animated films, the voice acting is not as high of quality as one would expect.Jay Baruchel as Hiccup is still pretty good. His voice perfectly captures the character both physically and emotionally.America Ferrera does equally decent work as Astrid. Her best scenes are the more intimate ones she shares with Baruchel.F. Murray Abraham does a respectable job as Grimmel. Unfortunately, his perfectly menacing voice kind of goes wasted on a paper-thin character.Weighing the rest of the cast down is the comedy sidekick trio of Jonah Hill, Kristen Wiig, and Justin Rupple. They each sound like their on autopilot mode and end up becoming progressively more annoying throughout the length of the film.For lovers of the first two films, ""How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World"" is another instant classic. While it isn't perfect, this finale to a solid trilogy will leave dazzled by its imagery and touched by its story.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

102,Come-and-Review,The best conclusion to a trilogy to date,10,20 February 2019,"It's been a while since I've last seen such a satisfying trilogy of films so consistently good in each of their installments.
The Hidden World managed to keep the same emotionality that the first two entries also had. I found the conclusion to live up to my expectations. I personally was 13 when the first film was released, and felt very invested with it at the time: I could relate to Hiccup a lot. Now that I'm 20 I've similarly felt close to Hiccup, obviously not in his difficulties of leadership but in how he related to Astrid and Toothless.
The antagonist of this film is somehow a doppelgänger/opposite of Hiccup, an aspect I really appreciated and I can't explain further in order to avoid spoilers.
The visuals of this film, as were the visuals of the previous installments, are stunning, almost live-action worthy (Roger Deakins's credit as Visual Consultant payed off definitely).
The CGI visibly improved throughout the years. A scene on a beach featured completely realistic cg sand, for instance.
Plot-wise, some viewers might detect some simplicities, but I think the positive aspects surclass them copiously.
The Hidden World's ending is very well conceived: not only it gives a touching and incredibly emotional outcome but also proves that the whole trilogy was not designed to be a cash-grab but rather a structured concept, a work of art itself. Seldom we nowadays see such examples of trilogies that actually excel quality-wise in all of their phases, and even more rarely this happens in animations. The How To Train Your Dragon trilogy is more than a mere cartoon, it is enjoyable at all ages without feeling cheesy, and has a cinematic, almost live-action quality that makes it exciting and involving.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
103,n-kefala,The end of a trilogy,7,14 April 2019,"This is clearly the end of the franchise, one that gave great pleasure. For some, it will be a moving conclusion to an epic series. For others, it'll be one less kids' franchise to worry about. It is a sweet movie with stunning visuals that delivers the message of self-belief and love but this one doesn't quite possess the excitement and the beauty of the first ones.Even though it is a touching and fitting end to one of the very best animated franchises in film history. The truth is that there aren't too many animated trilogies, as good as this one. Dreamworks animation has done it and made a fitting final chapter of good quality. The ""Hidden World"" is a perfectly suitable conclusion to a saga that stayed true to itself and is leaving on its own terms. nikisreviews.gr",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

105,gcsman,"A really nice movie, though the animation is SO strong that it overshadows the storyline.",6,2 March 2019,"As a zillion other viewers have already said, the animation work here is amazing -- the quality of rendition of the dragons themselves, the clouds, the sea and waterfall, luminous caves, villages, ships, every kind of scenery -- has all reached new levels. And the 3D is good too. You can spend your whole time during this movie just marvelling at what you're seeing on the screen.And that is where the whole problem lies! I went out of the theater having had fun, but also wondering where the actual story went. In the first HTTYD (2010 -- surprisingly, almost a decade ago), we were treated to a refreshingly original story setup with thoroughly engaging characters we were meeting for the first time (including Toothless, the Night Fury of course), whip-smart dialog, spot-on comic timing, and a masterfully paced storyline that kept me involved from beginning to end. The animation there was very good too, but the point is that it was *exactly* as good as it needed to be, always serving the story.In HTTYD3 The Hidden World, the emphasis has flipped: animation first, story second. To me, this is wrong. People are storytellers by nature, and that's ultimately what we read, get together, and go to the theater to do -- tell stories, listen to stories, let our curiosity and sense of wonder have free rein. In this second sequel, the characters are all the same and we're happy to see them back, but they all play out the roles we've seen before with the same foibles and flaws; the dialog and the plot are now pretty simple; the humor often falls a little flat; and the ""new"" villain seems to have nothing fundamentally new to offer, no motivation, and no backstory. Don't get me wrong: it all works fine, but I put HTTYD (#1) up with the best animated films EVER made. This, the second sequel, doesn't quite rise to that level.
Bottom line? See it and enjoy. But then, go back and watch the first one again. That's where the real magic is.** Spoiler here: see the movie before reading on.**Oddly, my favorite section of this movie came at the very, very end: the utterly engaging little coda where Hiccup, Astrid, and their two new little children (who are absolute charmers!) seek out their former dragon friends (along with *their* new kids/dragonlings) for a brief re-encounter. That was magic. If only the rest of the film could have carried that through.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

I tried to watch the first one in theaters when I was younger and I ran out in the first 20 minutes of the film. After that I only watched the TV show occasionally. I saw this one I thought it was a good movie. It was nothing too special but it was nothing bad either. I thought I started off really strong. The beginning might have been one of my favorite parts of the whole movie, The voice acting was pretty solid. The end I thought was just a bunch of wise cracks. The other love story part was fine.

107,bastille-852-731547,Fine but Underwhelming Trilogy Finale,6,14 February 2019,"I really like the first film in this series, but am mixed on the second one. Having seen the third film at an advance screening, I can say that its quality is unfortunately closer to the second film than the original. This time around, a new villain (Grimmel) has taken power of the Viking world in which the film's characters live. Hiccup and Astrid must work to stop him as they also try to uncover the ""Hidden World,"" a secret land for dragons that Hiccup's father told him about from an early age. The film's CGI animation is generally quite strong and realistic, as we have come to expect from this franchise. Yet after two previous films filled with such strong animation, cutting-edge visuals by themselves unfortunately don't cut it anymore. While there are other positive elements, such as a strong score (just like the previous two films) and aesthetic value, not everything manages to hold together. The film has somewhat of a creative drought in the story and originality departments.The story is one of the most clichéd and predictable plot lines I have come across in recent memory, which is a shame for a franchise generally rooted in its authenticity by animated movie standards. Grimmel feels like an undercooked villain, with no real character or strong motivation. The film's use of characterization is otherwise fine, as Hiccup and Astrid are both delightful, as we would expect. The film attempts to give Hiccup a bit more of a backstory by trying to develop his relationship with his father from a young age through flashback scenes, which is interesting in theory. However, these moments never really add up to anything in terms of any narrative or subtextual substance. The film is paced fine, but for a franchise capable of so much more than this in terms of quality, one would have expected more memorable moments throughout the story. This isn't a bad sequel by any means, but it's not a great one either. 6/10",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

110,Paynebyname,Wraps up the trilogy with a perfect bow,8,22 February 2019,"Ending a trilogy in a satisfying way can be pretty tough.You want to show organic growth for the main characters but how do you find new things for them to do? This wonderful film hit that spot. I've loved the previous two films and the marriage of great story, characters, beautiful animation and wonderful music created a rich environment for these stories.Indeed, the first two films were so good that I feared how they would be able to bring them to a decent and fitting close. I shouldn't have doubted the director and team responsible for this - they do a great job.I'll concede that the film didn't have the same energetic drive as the first two films as the actual subject of growing up, becoming more responsible etc is a more of a slow burn matter but the film kept me entertained and enthralled. The scenes when Hiccup discovered the Hidden World genuinely made me gasp in wonder at their staggering beauty.For me what really sold the ending was how the director/writer remembered the importance of Hiccup holding out his hand for Toothless to push onto. It sounds like a silly thing to say but that for me is such an iconic moment in the first film when the music swells and Hiccup holds out his hand whilst closing his eyes that I was delighted (and felt a lump in my throat) that the film makers made a notable nod back to it right at the end.A really lovely end to the trilogy that makes the whole series of films now feel like a beautiful contained bundle of perfection.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

115,domtaylor,"It's decently entertaining, but badly paced and too similar to the second one.",6,15 March 2019,"It opens with a fun action scene that re-introduces all of the characters, but then things take a while to really get going and this lax pacing makes the overall narrative suffer. It's also very segmented, the villain is too similar to the one from the previous film, and the supporting characters become little more than singular traits. It feels as though they are unnecessary to the story, but they need to be given something to do since they have been established as the core supporters in the previous films. Thankfully, Hiccup, Astrid and Toothless are given good developments and, as they are the leads, this allows for some investment in the story. The animation is better than ever, too, especially in the visually stunning 'Hidden World'. There are some well-crafted sequences without any dialogue, which focus on Toothless and his new found friend. Although its heart is in the right place, the 'emotional' conclusion doesn't really work for me as it feels quite unearned in the presented story. It's clear what they are going for, and the themes it tackles are good, but it just fails to connect on the emotional level that it clearly intends to, in my opinion. As an ending to the franchise, however, it does leave things in a satisfying place and it's good that the filmmakers know when to tie things off - something that's becoming less frequent in today's age. Overall, it's a fairly entertaining watch with some good sequences, but the pacing, general sense of familiarity, and underused characters stop it from soaring as high as it could have. 6/10",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

$129M budget; $522M box officeJust watched the 2nd movie and then this one immediately back to back.There were a couple of problems with this movie:
1) The villain was, well, forgettable. He did not stand out at all and he just was not developed properly. This movie needed a villain we could never forget.2) The main premise for the plot was, well, weak. Maybe it sounded good on paper when it was pitched, but the execution of it was poor. It just was not a good execution.3) There seems to be too much emphasis on action, and barely, if any, emphasis on the emotional connection between the characters. There is an indescribable kind of love and friendship between the protagonist and his dragon and this emotional connection was never truly fully explored and shoved in our faces in this movie. I did like the flashbacks the protagonist has about his father - maybe they could have explored how much he missed him and how much he was loved. That father-son connection could have been explored, at a viscerally emotional level through flashbacks, but it was not. Emotionless memories about his d___ father does not sound right. A good example of emotional connection is the 2013 God of War Ascension trailer.I hope that the next movie does not have these three problems I outlined above.However, the finale was excellent.Dean Deblois - if there is one thing he always gets right, is the ending. The ending for all three films are excellent and somehow the ending of the next film is somehow better than the previous one. This ending is the best one and my favorite so far.Conclusion: Despite the shortcomings of this film, because the ending was so perfectly written, I bumped up my review from a probably 7.5 to a 9.9/10",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
119,brianjohnson-20043,Dreamworld should be proud,9,6 March 2019,"The HTTYD movies have certainly been the best animated work for Dreamworks if you ask me. I'm thrilled they decided to end this story of Hiccup, Toothless and the others because the timing felt right. They gave us a great opening film to introduce the dynamic of dragons vs humans becoming dragons plus humans. The 2nd film is about Hiccup and Toothless becoming responsible leaders of Berk. And the 3rd film is about Hiccup protecting Berk and the dragons now that they have a target on their back.In each one the film's the protagonists accomplish their goal and following this storyline it would be a bummer to see them try to create another movie involving another chapter for these characters.The animation is great. The jokes are starting to get less fresh by this 3rd film which is another good sign that the 3rd one should be the conclusion. But the jokes and story are still entertaining overall. And the story is never overly childish or goofy. The last film has the mom as the big new good character. In this one it's the light-furry dragon as it's called. Sadly the new dragons isn't a surprise like how the mom was a surprise in the first one. (Come on marketing)The reason I didn't give it 10 stars is because the villain is rather similar to the last villain. Apart from him having a different type of dragon at his control in a different way and hating some dragons as opposed to all of them, they are about the same. I'd say they could have done a better job making the villain more sympathetic, believable and different. It seems they didn't have time for that because they needed extra time to conclude the entire trilogy. I say too bad. Make the movie a bit longer. Don't sacrifice the intrigue of the villain for the sake of having the film end at a regular time for a kids movie.I also felt that it would have been better is Hiccup knew of the island he took his people to beforehand. I know more coincidences are to be allowed in kids movies than other movies. But I really didn't feel it was right for Hiccup as a leader to succeed so much by luck.Instead some scouts should have found and reported on the island. Or maybe his mom or the Kit Harrington character knew about it. Rather than having all of Berk luckily stumble across it while trying to get somewhere else. I thought that could have been better constructed with the story.Another small complaint:Toothless suddenly learns how to draw now!?!? That's like one step away from him writing or talking. Pick another way for him to flirt and fix the other 2 problems and I'd give 10 stars enthusiastically.Luckily the conclusion of the movie is really good and probably the most important thing for them to not screw up.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
120,TheGreatMarkukini,When movie becomes a character,6,8 February 2019,"Considering that How to Train Your Dragon for me is one of the best animations ever made, the assessment and sniffing of the 3rd installation is really scrupulous.It is no surprise that this one has a major love line going through a plot, but the highlight of each part always was the forbidden friendship and the immediate danger to main characters. 9 years after the first introduction we understand that something has to change, however, we still have motley myriads of dragons and dumb team of Hiccup. Moreover we are presented with a threat but it really falls back behind and seems truly redundant. The real menace is a possibility that this beautiful story is going to end...or isn't it?The impressive part as always was the visuals, which frankly made you doubt that it is a cartoon, especially with those gorgeous panoramic views. The bitter taste while savoring this dish was a lack of that incredible music that we had in the previous chapters. This was unfair and didn't open the full potential of the observed flick.All in all, the last (for now?) part of the saga transformed into a real Toothless: stunning, kinda goofy and missing some parts, however, bringing joy and is pleasant to watch.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
121,CriticalOfEverything,A Perfect Conclusion,10,5 February 2019,"I have loved these movies ever since the first one in 2010. The How To Train Your Dragon trilogy remains as one of my favourite animated movie trilogies, hell, one of my FAVOURITE trilogies, even after 9 years going. And this movie right here was the perfect way to end it off. Every character is just as believable and likeable as before, the humour is still surprisingly good, the animation is absolutely spectacular and it's still just as dark as the previous movies. Not to mention, the villain this time around is the best so far. He actually manages to succeed in a lot of areas that Drago from the second movie couldn't and is far more intimidating than any villain so far. The movie is also incredibly emotional for me, and I'm not alone on this one. There were multiple moments throughout the film that had me tearing up a bit and I won't spoil the ending, but it was a great way for the trilogy to finish. I will just say that the pacing at the beginning is a little too fast, but once we get past the second act it's nothing but smooth sailing. Overall, How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is an entertaining, emotionally resonant and straight up perfect conclusion that should act as a tutorial on how to end a franchise properly.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

123,margulanabutrlov,How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World Review,10,18 January 2019,"How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a fantastic finale for the film franchise and a poignant farewell to this beautiful realm of humans and dragons. Seeing these characters evolve over the past two films to where they are in The Hidden World feels not only believable but deeply emotional and weighty as well.The Hidden World takes place one year after the second film, which means there aren't as many massive changes like the five-year jump between How to Train Your Dragon 1 and 2. While the main characters are still massive goofs, they also feel more like burgeoning adults now. Everyone's been riding, fighting, and living alongside their dragons for at least six years so they're a more capable bunch now (well, most of the time). Meanwhile, their home, Berk, has grown into a ridiculously overcrowded viking/dragon utopia.Hiccup's (Jay Baruchel) dragon-based tech has also continued to evolve and ties nicely back into the previous films. Seeing things like the wingsuit he was working on in the second movie be perfected in this third film gives the world a real physical sense of tangible continuity. Not all the film's callbacks work though. While the recurring jokes from the earlier movies -- such as how the twins hate each other, or Toothless playing fetch with Hiccup's foot -- were fun, they also felt forced and less genuine than before.
Now the village chief, Hiccup, more than any other character, has truly come into his own even though, in many ways, he's still that boy full of self-doubt and compassion for his people and their dragons. He still looks to his friends, and especially his partner Astrid (America Ferrara), for help and inspiration when times are tough or his confidence wavers. Astrid remains one of the most capable among the supporting characters, having taken on an almost second- in-command role in the village.A dangerous new threat to Berk comes in the form of the fearsome dragon tracker Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham). Grimmel is a truly fitting villain for this emotional final installment. Not only does Grimmel make things personal by having a special vendetta against Toothless, he's also strategic and calculating, always a step ahead of the heroes. He forces the citizens of Berk, particularly Hiccup and Toothless, to make some of their hardest sacrifices yet. Grimmel doesn't simply want power; he wants to totally eradicate dragons and make a larger, painful point while doing so. To this end, he uses the white female Night Fury dragon -- the Light Fury -- as bait to try to take out Toothless. Fortunately, the introduction of the Light Fury is simply adorable. The way the dragons move and behave like living, lovable creatures has always been essential to this franchise and this entry wisely doubled down on that hard.Hiccup's support for his friend during this time shows how far they've come together as a team. Usually, it's been Hiccup developing a new relationship (like discovering Toothless in the first film or meeting his mother in the second). This time it's Toothless's turn to forge a new relationship. The pivotal choice facing Hiccup here is one that the Hiccup from even one film ago wouldn't have had the strength to make. Indeed, none of the characters we met in the first movie would have been capable of what's required of them here. It took the total arc of three films to get them all here to such a believable and selfless conclusion.Visually, every installment in this trilogy has depicted a new dragon home, each one more magnificent than the last. The titular Hidden World is a haven for thousands of different kinds of dragons. These awe-inspiring scenes have so much happening on screen at once and wonderfully showcase just how far these films have evolved and improved visually since the 2010 original. Everything from scenes of destruction to dragon fire and dragon scales to the softness of human characters' hair all looked truly impressive. Factor in the rousing score and you have a movie that's a feast for the senses.The Verdict
How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a fantastic, visually stunning and poignant way to end this beloved trilogy. While the young characters remain joyously funny, this finale also adds mature notes to their story of friendship. The franchise has, like its audience, grown up, and to that end this film grapples with more complex themes than before, making for a truly satisfying yet bittersweet conclusion.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
124,El-Ak,Quite an epic and emotional end for one of the best trilogies ever been made!,7,29 March 2019,"I have been anticipating this movie since the second sequel and I was really pissed off every time the movie was pushed back and back until it was again pushed back to 2019 and that made me more convinced that they are taking they time in making it to make a great ending, but I have to say among the three movies this one is with great sadness the weakest of 'em. The plot and the story can be shortened in a short movie or something, The antagonist of the film that was absent most if it and the weakest though claimed in the film as the strongest and baddest among the series, the alpha controlling thing and Hiccup's mom being only secondary role like others, the idea of the whole Vikings being lead and have meetings with the smaller ones like Hiccup and his friends isn't convincing a little bit too as well as other points that felt like
""well, it's made that way and you gonna be okay with it cause you love the franchise"". The wonderful designs and emotional and epic music score of the film doesn't only make a movie a good one, not because we adore toothless we have to go through much of his story with the light fury in just funny scenes that lasted very long and felt like the movie was stretching the story as possible as it could the same thing that was done at Ralph Breaks the Internet which was a funny film but not as good as the first and indeed this movie is better than it however, the movie neglected ""the hidden world"" matter and didn't give it it's much presence that an idea and what we saw in the trailer. At the end of the film, the ending was so fast with expected plots though I adooore the after of the ending battle sooo much and it's quite a wonderful, heart whelming and epic conclusion that made me felt old and that it's really the ending. I am trying to be harsh on the film but really I can't as I feel they meant it to be a simple conclusion with no complexities as the previous two so, I would give it a simple 7/10 with great sadness not for the rating but that I will miss it indeed. Don't miss that epic trilogy it's been an honor watching and living with it and it's memories.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

I've seen all three movies in the theatre and I really enjoy the characters, universe, and animation! It's not very often when you get a semi-serious and dramatic animated fantasy film series, and I really appreciate the series for that. As for my thoughts on the third film, I really enjoyed it! I did think the story was a little too similar to the second movie, but aside from that this was a really great movie and the perfect ending for the series. This movie puts a lot more focus on Toothless the dragon than the other films did. There are several long scenes with no dialogue, which was really cool. The animation was stunning as always and the character and creature design is as strong as ever! Overall, this is a must-see for How To Train Your Dragon fans, but if you haven't seen the others I'd say wait until you have before you watch this one.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
126,Benslie,A great wrap up for the series,10,24 February 2019,"First of all, this is just something I wanted to talk about and that's Toothless and how he's just so cute and innocent. Every scene that he's in he just steals it. If they made a solo Toothless film, which please don't, I would see it. Since the very first film that came out in 2010 the animation in this film series has just constantly been getting better and better from each entry and in my opinion this one probably had the best animation. Whenever you saw water it looked like real water, all the buildings had the look and texture of real ones. Even the people looked somewhat like real people. All the colour in this film is vibrant and bright that it helps bring you into this world. Also, the lighting in this film helped with what you should feel in that scene. If it was more bright and colourful you knew that it was a happy scene compared to a dark and grim look that would represent a sad moment in it. The characters in this film felt real because they had flaws and made mistakes. Since the first movie to now you see all of these characters grow up over these films and it's great to see them all mature into these grown adults by the end of this film. All of the action scenes in this film were just breathtaking and were probably better than some of the live action fight scenes you see. The camera angles that showed the action no matter and knew where to focus at what point and time was just amazing. Of course, the music in this film, which was done by John Powell, was intense and easy listening to. I can easily see myself listening to it. The message in this film is great and everybody should follow it. I was going to complain about the subplot between Toothless and the Light Fury but then I realized that it had to happen to help with the main plot and so it really wasn't a subplot. The humour in this film is subtle and doesn't over power the film. When there is humour it's placed in an appropriate place. This isn't a spoiler because it's in the trailer but one of the funniest scenes is when Toothless is trying to flirt with the Light Fury. I think really my only problem with this film is the villain Grimmel. He just wasn't a fully developed villain and this could be because they wanted to keep him a mystery but after the last movies great, one they needed to step it up in this film. I highly recommend seeing this film in 3D due to the breathtaking visual effects. In the end, this film was great and is a great wrap up on one of the best trilogies to date.

130,blackwidowis7cool,Excellent conclusion,10,23 June 2019,"I won't spoil what happens in this movie, but I will say that it is an emotionally strong and satisfying conclusion to this great trilogy. Has great tension, great plot, and has its tear-jerking moments. I now hate those twins. They just get on my nerves in this movie.
Why is there complaints about it being bumpy and dull conclusion? It's amazing! The pacing is just right - not too fast, not too slow. The animation leaves you in awe of this fictitious world. Love the epilogue at the end - had me trying not to cry. And the villain is great - not dull, but very smart. Every move is calculated. On par with the villain from the second movie.
Subtly thought-prompting.
Give this a shot - it's well worth it.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
131,DaegT,More like a documentary film,7,6 February 2019,"Honestly, it's a story about hunters and dragons. In the whole movie I do not see anyone evil. How bad is the antagonist? He is just dragon hunter. Unless you consider dragon hunting evil, I don't see actually how bad/evil he is. So the story line is a bit weak here.I do, however, appreciate the new graphic concept of The End of the World. Gigantic waterfall in the Far West!! Yes many people have heard of this legend but this is the first time I see it shown in a movie. Besides, the sub-terrestrial world is also beautifully designed. Fabulous!This is a stunning action film. But the plot is weak, probably bacause of the consideration of kids and young audiences. As a conclusion I would consider it a good compromise.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
132,eparazak,The Hidden World brings Dreamworks' Dragons to a satisfying end.,9,8 March 2019,"How to Train your Dragon: The Hidden World had a lot to live up to in terms of quality. While I have never seen the tv show, I absolutely adored the first and second one. Fortunately, the same can be said with this movie too.There is a lot to love about this movie. One of the most obvious factors is how the animation continues too be some of the highest quality that Dreamworks has ever put out. I really enjoyed how the stakes kept rising as it progressed. Hiccup goes through a character arc where he needs to learn to appeal to the wants of even his closest friends. (In this case, Toothless.) Frankly, I think it was handled with integrity, emotion and honesty. Grimmel as the villain admittedly doesn't seem interesting initially, but when we learn a little bit about him, he appears to give off the idea that Hiccup could've been him instead, which gave him a reason for me to be intrigued with him, despite being slightly generic. If anything, that and my only other complaint with the film is that I found the final confrontation with Grimmel rushed and anticlimactic. The battle didn't have that epic feeling as the final ones from the first two did..Regardless, How to Train your Dragon: The Hidden World brings us a satisfying sendoff to one of Dreamworks' most beloved franchises.9/10",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

By this point, we've grown with the characters and the movi series has delivered two excellent films. The film has the usual eye popping visuals, combined with the exhilarating music. The story between the main characters is coming to a conclusion and I'm glad the series is not fizzling to an end. The only shortcoming was that the antagonist was not as strong as he could have been. However, I think that was the weak point of the series in general. Regardless, it was an extremely enjoyable film that had me pumping my arm in excitement",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

While it does have its highs and lows, it's still a great movie with great and memorable moments and also delivers a emotional ending to the trilogy that everyone have enjoyed from the very beginning back in 2010 and the children who grew up with it and are now adults and they have the chance to experience the finale to the beloved story of Hiccup and Toothless' journey.

135,Kirollos-Noah,I need more of these amazing movies!,8,9 February 2019,"I have a great feeling about this year!How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is the last installment of DreamWorks' Dragons and it's directed and written Dean DeBlois, the same from the previous two. Starring Jay Baruchel, America Ferrera and F. Murray Abraham.The story is about Hiccup who's now chief and ruler of Berk alongside Astrid, Hiccup has created a gloriously chaotic dragon utopia. When the sudden appearance of female Light Fury coincides with the darkest threat their village has ever faced, Hiccup and Toothless must leave the only home they've known and journey to a hidden world thought only to exist in myth. As their true destines are revealed, dragon and rider will fight together-to the very ends of the Earth-to protect everything they've grown to treasure.How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is one of my top 10 most anticipating movies of 2019, and fortunately it didn't disappoint me! As we all know, most of the third movies in trilogies sucks, but How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is one of the rare third installment that really works, emotionally and visually.. almost everything is working with this movie!Let's talk deeply about this movie.. and let's ask ourselves a very important question ""Is it perfect?"" Well, the answer is variable, for some hardcore fans this movies is perfect, also for audiences it might sucks or they gonna love it! For me as a film critic -and most of the film critics as well- we'll notice some stuff that makes this movie imperfect, let's talk about them in this spoiler-free, and BTW I'm gonna make a spoiler review about this movie because I have lots of things to say about it but I don't want to ruin it for you, guys, let's just get into it...The things I didn't like about his movie are few, but they still annoying, and the thing I hated the most about this movie is the editing, I'm not saying the the entire editing was bad or something but most of the scenes ended in a very fast and uncompleted way, and sometimes the editing was like the TV show, and that annoyed me so much, because How to Train Your Dragon 2 had a very good cinematography and editing, this one has a good cinematography, especially the ending which I will talk about deeply in the spoiler review because it was so emotional and it has an amazing caption, the cinematography of this movie is pretty good, but the editing was.. nah!The second thing that I didn't like is the villain.. we don't get that much of him, he's not scary and threatening as Drago was, though they tried too hard to make him even more scarier, but eventually he wasn't, the voice acting is amazing still, but I expected more of him, and also I wanted a back story that has at least a simple connection with the main characters, but we don't get it either!The third thing is that they didn't care that much of Valka, now Valka was very good in HTTYD 2 but in this one we don't get that much of her, that happened also with Eret.The last thing I didn't like about this movie and it happened also with the second one, is the recap scene, it's like ""Here're some info for you in case you forgot!"" I didn't like it in the second one, and also in this one!Now these are the things I hated or disliked about this movie, let's move to the things I loved, which I won't talk about them deeply not to spoil anything for you...
Anyway, the graphics of this movie is the best of the whole trilogy, the details of everything is perfect, it reminds me of how Incredibles 2 was visually stunning, still didn't reach that level, but it's still stunning!!The voice acting still fitting, and even better, with more emotions, like you can feel them all, the pain, the hate, the love and the passion.. everything is even better in this one!The cinematography as I said is amazing, I will get deeply to this point in the spoiler review because the direction was pretty good!And now the story, I can't talk about it know because I will spoil if I talked, but all what I got to say is that this movie doesn't have any epic scene like HTTYD 2, still have some action, but not like the previous one, but the story of this one is giving every fan a great conclusion and emotionally satisfying as well, yeah they might didn't develop any character, but it's just because they already have in the previous two, so yeah the story of this one is effective and very good as a trilogy conclusion!Guys, this movie made me cry, not because of death or something, but because Dean DeBlois knew how to make a heart-touching scenes with simple stuff! How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is even better than I expected it to be, and I'm gonna give it an A-!Alright, guys, and thanks for reading my review, and if you liked it, you can click on my name up above to see all of my reviews.

Let's do it!Okay okay okay, if you read my spoiler-free review so you already know that I was going to make a spoiler review to this movies, because I didn't want to spoil anything to you guys, but if you already watched it or you like to get the movie spoiled to you, so welcome.. if you don't like to, you can click on my name up above and you can read my spoiler-free review. Also if you gonna read this, I'd prefer to read the first one if I were you, because I'm not gonna say again the things I liked and hated, I'm just gonna say the spoils that I couldn't do in the spoiler-free review, so let's do it!If you read the spoiler-free review so you already know what I liked and what I hated about this movie, but still I didn't talk to you about everything... Let's talk about the editing, the ending of the scenes especially... It all started with a scene when Grimmel was leaving the room, the first time we see him, and then we just see Hiccup as a kid and his father talking to him, as we saw in the trailer.. that was really bad editing, but when we see the grown up Hiccup at the same place standing right there.. that was pretty cool. But how the first scene ended and how the other one started, it wasn't good at all!
We get so much of that kind of ending during the film, especially in a scene when Valka was going to check if Grimmel was stucking at them, and then she saw the ships, then we see Grimmel shushing some people and then it's done.. that scene bothered me a lot!!!!
Another thing, not about the editing, the opening scene, it felt so much like the TV show when they go and save some dragons at the beginning of the episode, and then we get the episode going.. it was really epic to see Hiccup and Toothless walking through the fire, but still it wasn't that good to start the last chapter of that amazing trilogy!Also the ending was a little bit rushed, when Hiccup said to leave the dragons to take care of them selves no one argued with him, everyone was like ""yeah yeah, I agree!"" Even the dragons didn't do anything, only Toothless wanted to stay at the beginning... That scene was so emotional, I cried a lot, there's a great cinematography in that scene, when Hiccup was petting Toothless for the last time, the camera captured it just like it did in the first HTTYD movie, and in that scene I was amazed of how great job they've done with this movie - cinematographyical- and how emotional that scene really was! Also the ending was pretty cool, to see all of your favorite characters getting married, having two kids, and then riding their dragons again, that was a perfect ending for a great trilogy. Even the credit scene was emotional, all of my favorite scenes of all the three movies combined together.. that was touching!!!Last thing I wanted to talk about is my second favorite scene, and it's the first meeting of Grimmel and Hiccup, it was epic and beautifully captured!!!As you know, guys I gave it an A-, I think it's a great movie, and it has the perfect ending for this amazing fantasy trilogy!These are the spoilers that I wanted to talk about, guys.. and thank you as always for reading and supporting my work, and if you liked it, you can click on my name up above to see all of my reviews, and the upcoming ones!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
137,ElliesWonder,Most touching animation series,9,4 March 2019,"It's been a long days ever since from the first movie I watched when I was a teenage. I was so entertaining in the beginning when toothless find his light fury. The courtship part was hilarious. The hidden world is beautiful. In the moment when all the dragons made obeisance to their alpha - our toothless, it took away my breath; It's like looking at my son growing up and graduated from college. (Although I don't even have a son yet.)The joy I have in the first half make me so sad to watch the end when hiccup and toothless separated to protect their species, and created their own families without company. The reunion happy ending just made me sadder and realized the untold long period separation has been gone so long, that hiccup even doubted if toothless could remember him or not.What the saddest thing is I don't even know will it possible to write the fourth movie script! This 3rd movie blocks all the potential plots, hiccup is a full beard grownup man now, I am terrified to see an old man hiccup in the future.In conclusion, How To Train Your Dragon movie is the best animation series I watched as long as I can recalled when it compares to the Ice Age, Kungfu Panda or Toys story. The script is so deeply moving, the series tells the story of each character's growing, sacrifice and courage. Poor hipccup lost his leg in 1st movie, lost his dad in 2nd, and lost his dragon in 3rd; made it more realistic compared to many ""dog can't die"" stories.Last question is: imax vs. 3D, which one experience better?Theater review 3/3/2019 IMAX visit.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

This was just disappointing and seems like it was written only for children.It's descended into kid-level logic in the story, with overly silly gags and nonsensical occurrences (accidentally capturing bad guys, young girls knocking out full grown men with one hit, one dimensional characters repeating the same dumb jokes).The end was cute, but didn't make up for the rest of the movie.

144,Clank_Zoka,Oh DreamWorks How I Missed You..,10,3 February 2019,"The How to Train Your Dragon series is one of them rare non-Pixar franchises that actually has amazing quality to it, great looking animation, Toothless is so adorable, it takes risks, it's funny, emotional along with a wonderful score, it's definitely a great DreamWorks franchise that is beloved by many along with Kung Fu Panda and sort of with Shrek, the first movie isn't perfect but I appreciate the effort of taking a old cliched story and doing something a little new with it, it still has great heart and amazing flying scenes, even if it started it off a little cliched, it does start to pick it after that and it ends up being a great enjoyable ride, the second movie is even better then the first one, the animation has greatly improved, it has a surprisingly emotional twist that I did not see coming, it has more action and comedy and of course I love Toothless, so when I heard the third is coming out and it is considered the last one, you bet I was excited as heck to see it, I want to see how this franchise ends because I actually saw the last two when they came out in cinemas, so I was lucky enough to see this movie that got a UK release (sorry America..), saw it yesterday and........ wow...I mean wow, I.. LOVED IT!, so let's talk about it.Few years after the events of How to Train Your Dragon 2, Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and Toothless and the citizens of Berk need to prepare for battle as a new villain is coming to get their dragons, especially Toothless, you see this villain is a Night Fury Hunter named Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham) who is trying to complete Drago's goal of taking over the world, However at the same time, Toothless finds a Night Fury, however it is a Light Fury and Toothless has a crush on her, Hiccup has to try and get through things without Toothless and Toothless has to manage without Hiccup, Hiccup and Astrid (America Ferrea) also think about if they should get married or not, while at the same finding this new Hidden World where the people of Berk can't be seen, so that's basically it and DreamWorks did the best they can with all of these plots, taking down Grimmel, Toothless meeting the Light Fury, finding this Hidden World and Hiccup thinking about marrying Astrid, it takes it's time to bring more chemistry with these characters and bring the humanity side to them, since they have evolved and aged, every scene with Toothless and the Light Fury is amazing, funny, cute, emotional and beautiful, the action is really strong and exciting, the humour for the most part is quite funny and when it comes to the ending-NOW HOLD ON!, I won't give anything away, but it's one of the most teary eyed and emotional endings I have ever seen, seriously it's worth seeing it then me explaining it, but it ended in a beautiful way, only nitpick is it felt a bit rushed with it's pacing and not a lot of character development and one subplot goes nowhere really, also it can somewhat be predicable, but they didn't bother me really, the writers knew that they had to make the best they could with this franchise and what they did here will leave you with a emotional punch.The animation is at it's best, I know the last two films has great animation too but this animation is gorgeous, beautiful and looks almost real, the character animation and designs are very smooth and easily identifiable, all the dragons look beautiful and creative in their designs, the actions scenes are very shot and well choreographed, the Hidden World it's self looks amazing and so colourful, it takes you on a rollercoaster of a journey, the use of smoke and fire it also great, I love the attention to detail on all of these characters like the fur texture on the dragons and freckles on Hiccup's face, Pixar may be masters at their animation but DreamWorks can master great animation on the same level as Pixar, but this takes it to a whole new level.The characters have evolved and changed throughout the years and in here they are still the fun, likeable and relatable characters who know them to be, Hiccup has a more important role as chief of Berk, now he has to learn the importance of being independent, managing without Toothless and focusing on Grimmel and maybe marrying Astrid, i still find Hiccup endearing as he was before and he is also a very believable character that will do anything to protect his people, Astrid is still the supporting heroine of Hiccup, still helping him and being the really fun and likeable character she is, Toothless is the best character in this movie, he's cute, funny, amazing and just awesome, he still has great heart and humour and his relationship with Hiccup is still strong, as for the other characters like Valka (Cate Blanchett), Snotlout (Jonah Hill), Eret (Kit Harrington), Ruffnut (Kristen Wiig), Tuffnut, Fishlegs (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and Gobber (Craig Ferguson) don't really do a lot besides comedy and just help out with the main characters, sure they are likeable and funny, but they don't do much, as for the new characters which there isn't many, mainly Light Fury and Grimmel, Light Fury is a lot of fun and really cute, her relationship with Toothless is soooo beautiful and a great edition to the movie, Grimmel is a really threatening villain and he's quite dastardly and will do anything to achieve his goal, granted Drago is better then him but he is certainly interesting, also the voice acting is still going strong, the original cast is back (well mostly), they still do a good job with their roles, I quite enjoy Craig Ferguson, Cate Blandchett and Jay Baruchel the most, everyone else is also a lot of fun, F. Murray Abraham is a lot of fun too and sounds like he's having fun with his role, great voice acting is one thing, but characters who have humanity, heart, humour, strong emotions, relatable and entertainment, these characters have changed the world of Berk and in some way they represent us.Wow..... what a journey that was, How to Train Your Dragon: the Hidden World is not only a great film to end this franchise with a touching and amazing ending, it's also the best in the franchise and the best DreamWorks film so far, with a engaging story that delivers lots of heart, humour, emotion and lots of great themes and a powerful message, breathtaking animation that can stand out from the rest, characters who represent who we are, Toothless and Light Fury are the best characters in the film and I love every scene that they are both in, along with a wonderful score by John Powell once again and great voice-acting, if you love this franchise, go check it, if you haven't seen this movie or the franchise it's self, I recommend watching the first movies, not sure if the shows count but eh..., if you want to see a great family film, see it, this movie and it's franchise proves that Pixar is not the only Animation Studio that can do a lot with it's material and end it off beautifully, I think they should leave it at Hidden World, don't think another sequel will be needed, this is why Pixar should of stop at three with Toy Story, it ended there perfectly, but we'll get to Toy Story 4 when we cross that bridge, but for now DreamWorks..... thank you for bringing us a fantastic franchise, with amazing animation, heart, humour and characters, if it wasn't for this franchise, then I didn't think you would be as great as Pixar, but you have more then proved yourselves, you have mastered what you are great at.... telling a timeless story, R.I.P How to Train Your Dragon franchise...... you will be missed..... now speaking of sequels, I need to see a certain sequel that has LEGOS....This movie most certainly gets a 10/10!.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

I DID NOT SEE THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AND END In this way. I would have liked to see it end differently.,How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
150,BiiivAL,Thank.,8,9 March 2019,"'How to train the dragon 3' - the film completes the huge history of Icking, Bezzubik and the whole island 'Alkh "". Each of the parts of the trilogy is focused on a specific topic. The first film was about the main character's growing up, the second one was about true friendship, and the third one touches on the theme of love, both between Icking and Astrid, and between Bezzubik and the new character - Day Fury.
A new danger is looming on the swindle. Professional dragon hunter that has sworn to destroy all the Furies. Hiccup has the toughest fight to do and has to make the toughest decision in its life.The film is almost not different from the previous parts. He stands out against their background, perhaps, with an incredibly touching ending, which the viewer is able to unravel after twenty minutes of the film, but even despite its predictability, you are still touched and let a tear like a child say goodbye to your favorite characters.
Awesome humor. The most serious spectator will somehow laugh from one or another joke whether she is from Smorkly, Bully or Zadarak. Warm, sincere atmosphere of the world of the most different dragons - good and bad. The only thing that can be taken as a minus is the main villain. It is in the background and is needed only as a threat and the beinning of a new part.
I admit, I love each part a lot and it is difficult for me to say goodbye, as it will be difficult for all other fans, but the last thing I would like to do is admit that I can safely name the trilogy 'How to Train Your Dragon' one of the best trilogy modern cinema. Each movie is interesting, each character falls in love with himself, and the end makes him say: 'Thank you'. And is this not a good movie?",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

152,rustonreviews,A visually stunning conclusion.,7,5 February 2019,"Anticipation was high for the third and final instalment of the How to Train Your Dragon series. 2014's How to Train Your Dragon 2 is, in my opinion, the best animated sequel ever made (which I understand is quite the statement when films like Toy Story 2 exist), so my expectations for The Hidden World were through the roof. One year has passed since the events of the second film, and Hiccup (Baruchel), with his small team of raiders, have been rescuing captured dragons and returning them to Berk in order to create the worlds first dragon utopia. When Toothless, Hiccup's loyal Night Fury and best friend, discovers another one of his kind (Night Fury's are believed to be long extinct), everything changes, resulting in Hiccup realising that their paths cannot remain aligned forever. A new threat also draws ever closer to the peaceful land of Berk. Dragon slayer Grimmel (Abraham) is on the hunt for Toothless, determined to slay the lovestruck Night Fury in order to complete what he started many years ago.Visually, The Hidden World is just as impressive as its predecessors. It's a truly beautiful film to look at, with several sequences displaying a stunningly photo realistic nature. This world has never looked better, and it's difficult not to marvel at the level of world building achieved in the gorgeous aesthetics. A particular highlight is a sequence in which Toothless and the Light Fury soar together beneath northern lights. It's a mesmerising scene, and DeBlois crafts plenty more, particularly the discovery of the dreamlike Hidden World itself. John Powell also returns to compose another great score. What's most satisfying about these films (they're easily the best DreamWorks pictures, by a country mile) is the personal growth of the characters and their relationships, and this final chapter makes sure to provide a satisfying conclusion to the long journey we have taken with them.Although I thoroughly enjoyed the film, I couldn't help but feel just a little underwhelmed. In regards to the overall plot, several beats felt like retreads from the second film, and I noticed that The Hidden World didn't quite take as many risks as its superior predecessor. Whereas How to Train Your Dragon 2 wasn't afraid to go a little darker, The Hidden World almost plays things just a little too safe. Drago was a fantastic villain in the previous film; he was threatening and proved himself to be a dangerous force to be reckoned with. Grimmel (Abraham), however, doesn't quite reach the same level of menace. His introduction sets the stage well for him being the best antagonist of the trilogy, but midway through stumbles into pantomime territory and doesn't quite display the same level of brutality that Drago possessed. Grimmel is serviceable enough, but hardly a memorable foe. As for the action sequences, they're certainly fun but the stakes don't feel as high this time, and the final confrontation doesn't really measure up to the awe of the masterful battles during the latter half of the second film.When the time comes for the long awaited emotional send off, DeBlois decides not to make it too sentimental. It's sweet, if not a little too quick, but ultimately it's a fitting send off. The Hidden World doesn't quite reach the heights of the first two films, but it's still an enjoyable ride and successfully brings the whole story full circle, resulting in one of the stronger trilogies of recent memory.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
153,HollisWoods,A Fitting End,8,14 January 2021,"Out of the three films of the trilogy, this was the funniest. Snoutlout had some one liners that made me laugh out loud and the twins had more moments for their comedic relief. I know Hiccup's friends get much more spotlight in the show, but it was nice to see them get some spotlight in this movie. And Toothless and his mating dance will never not be funny.I don't know how, but this final installment managed to get better in terms of animation. Just something about the lighting and textures seems miles ahead of the first two. It was most obvious within the beautiful sceneries, like in the Hidden World and the wilderness surrounding ""new Burk.""Hiccup did indeed find the hidden world, but when he saw how dragons reacted to him, he knew humans were not meant to be there, and those dragons were not meant to be tamed. Between that experience and Hiccup's experience with the film's villain, Hiccup learns that dragons are meant to be in that hidden world, far away from any human.To me, this whole film was a huge message about protecting wildlife against poaching. Wild animals are not meant to be tamed and kept as pets, they're meant to be free in the wild. But because of poachers, there is a huge need of wildlife sanctuaries so different species can thrive and not go extinct. That's basically the plot of the movie and I greatly appreciate it.The Hidden World marked the final chapter for Hiccup and Toothless. Their story of friendship is definitely one of the ages. Their goodbye drew parallels from the iconic scene from the first film when Hiccup reaches out his arm to Toothless, and that was such a heartwarming detail. As hard as it was to say goodbye, the future looked bright for the both of them as they went their separate ways to different lives.After that emotional farewell, there was a beautiful epilogue that saw our favorite friends reunite. Despite the bittersweet goodbye, it really was a happy ending, as human and dragon reunited once again, flying in the clouds with their families, free and happy, as they were meant to be.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
154,Lost_In_Translation_,Great set up + boring villain + middling middle + powerful ending = The weakest Dragon yet.,6,3 March 2019,"The first Dragon movie is definitely the strongest of them all, it's Dreamwork's only movie where I feel like the storytelling is on Pixar levels. The second was fun, but nowhere near as powerful as the first. Now that the third one's here, I can't help but feel a bit underwhelmed from it's first viewing.The story continues a year after the 2nd where Hiccup and Berk have integrated dragons into their society and turned Berk into a haven of sorts for dragons. It's clear that their home is getting a bit crowded due to them saving so many dragons and that they are open to attack. So Hiccup decides that they must leave their home and try and find the Hidden World his father told him about where dragons can live safely away from those who enslave them.That set-up was fantastic and seemed like a good start to a movie, but like the 2nd one this movie feels the need to have an antagonist, and a super bland one at that. What I love so much about the first is that there is no real antagonist or threat until the very end. The story worked with Hiccup and Toothless becoming friends and also Hiccup and his father's relationship.This one feels the need to add a character who is the catalyst for the threat, but on who is the most uninspired villain I've seen in a long time. The story could have just been that hunters threatened the dragons and Berk, and the plot moves long as they try to find the hidden world and a new place to live. It could have been just as good as the first with a simple heartfelt story.But since it chose that plot, the movie becomes just an average movie with a strong end. Though the ending decision does feel a bit forced to make you feel emotions, it is a powerful one. But it just felt like it happened too quickly and didn't leave any time to feel the emotion of the moment. Like they knew the ending they wanted, but didn't have the right amount of time to wrap it up.Ugh....I almost forgot Tuffnut and how annoying his talks with Hiccup are...also Snoutlot kind of having the hots for Hiccup's mom?? Those parts brought it down a whole star for me. There's no need for those tertiary characters to have any little subplot at all here.So it all ended up just being an alright movie. Entertaining in it's own right, but nowhere near the classic that the first one is. Definitely the weakest of the three movies, but still worth watching to close out the series.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
155,Ingrouille181,The Fanfiction that got chosen instead of DeBlois' script,6,2 February 2019,"""There were Dragons when I was a boy"". For almost 5 years I had that quote stitched into my mind, wondering what Dean DeBlois would have in store for the finale of the How to Train your Dragon trilogy. The world was set, the characters were fully realised, the possibilities were endless and..........we get what's possibly one of the most mediocre and disappointing plots to a third trilogy finale film since probably Spider-Man 3.Story: Hiccup and his gang have been rescuing dragons from Dragon trappers and bringing them back to their home on Berk. That is until one day, an EVIL villain named Grimmel arrives to kill Hiccup's night fury Toothless, and do some other stuff with dragons (honestly other than the forced ""I needs to kill za night fury because REAZZONS"" plot, the villain sucks), and so the gang takes all of Berk to find the mysterious Hidden World. Toothless also finds a love interest, a white collored Night Fury dubbed the ""Light Fury"". That's all I got.Before I get to the negatives, the positives first. Animation as always great. There are parts too where the scenery looking Uber realistic, like I'm seeing real life locations on screen, and Dreamworks has certainly come a long way. The costume designs and the design of all the dragons is very well handled. The music is great, as it's been in the other two films. So superficial stuff, all good. As for the characters, they're pretty one note. I liked Fishlegs' new parental interest in baby dragons, that was kinda sweet. And I also enjoyed the flashbacks between Hiccup and Stoick; nice little pay check for Gerard Butler.As you can tell, this movie is beyond frustrating and incredibly disappointing. I know there's people out there saying ""it's just a kids movie"" no, a kids movie would be Luis and the Aliens, or the Minions. The How to Train Your Dragon franchise has been with us since 2010, and it does for our age group what Toy Story did for the age group a few years older than me; it grew on us, and we don't just want the characters to grow and mature, we want the story, and themes and emotions to grow with them. How to Train your Dragon 2 was AMAZING partly because it introduced themes and emotions that flowed so well with young adult versions of the characters.I have to believe that half way or a third through this DuBois was let go and replaced; 4 years to conclude this trilogy and this is the story and villain he goes with? Seriously? Did he just not care anymore? Now I know what M.Night.Shyamalan fans thought when they were watching The Happening a decade ago.The villain was beyond eye-rolling to watch, and the animators might as well of just given him some twirling moustache on screen, that's how cartoony his character and 'villainy' was. He has the same arc as Drago in the second movie, but the 50¢ version.Overall, this film reminds me of The Last Jedi, it left the franchise on a low note; not for the same reasons, but having waited 5 years for the third instalment, with that one quote fishing around in my brain, expecting the ultimate conclusion, the ultimate villain for this franchise, with no new jokes, or concepts to explore. How to Train your Dragon 3 is uninspired fan fiction, and I'm giving it a 5 out of 10",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
156,askeland89,Great visuals,7,13 January 2019,"Good for what it is, but in no way better than the first two movies. They simply did not add anything that we haven't already seen. Story was a bit thin and predictable. Humor was spot on and the jokes were well placed. I think will appeal more to a younger crowd than adults.
Still a good entry and a worthy final to a great trilogy!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
157,janmanuel2,Boring,1,21 March 2020,"We watched this movie for 35 minutes. We were so bored and shocked since we liked the first one so much. Dark, drab animation, no fun, no wit - just terrible. I can't see this holding the attention of any child or adult. We had also received The Secret Life of Dogs and switched to it. That was a delightful movie.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
158,subwmn,Awesome tear jerker,10,29 August 2019,"I loved it. It was awesome and made me cry a few times. I know some reviewers thought it was sub-par, but it is life after Stoic. Those who kept up with the movies know what happens to Stoic in the second movie. The characters grow up and eventually Hiccup will take over as Chief. It is nothing we do not already know. I do like it that they made a light fury for Toothless and was hoping they would. Tuffnutt's voice threw me off because the voices are different from the movie and the Netflix show, but that is what DreamWorks does. Being that I have seen the show a few times, the voice threw me off. At the end where Hiccup and Astrid marry, I thought Toothless would have been there with the light fury. Their dragons come back to the village to visit when they get married. I like the ending as it is, but having them at the wedding would be nice.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
159,Scarefish,How To Train Your Dragon 3: Toothless Gets Laid,2,17 March 2019,"This installment fails to overcome the temptations of going the generic sequel route, opting for cutesy imagery over a compelling plot and characters. While 1 and 2 weren't afraid to go dark with their violent subject matter, 3 reels it back significantly, going with a more cartoonish villain and a plot stuffed to the brim with filler. There is very little in this film in terms of story of character development. The villain is supposedly a genius who is able to predict everyone's every move based on just about nothing as he isn't shown on screen to be intelligent, but is somehow all-knowing. The characters around the villain simply act dumb to make him seem more intelligent. I would say the film is a rollercoaster ride if that rollercoaster had a lot of plateaus in it, thus making it unexciting and ultimately disappointing as well as feeling rather misguided and confused. It feels like a romance film that feels the need to copy and paste the core elements from the previous two films as an afterthought, and the spirit of a nature documentary under the guise of an animated fantasy film.The clear point of this film is marketing and merchandise. The paper-thin plot takes a backseat to provide many long sequences of Toothless flirting with the light fury. Basically what you get is dragons based very clearly off axolotls imitating real life mating dances of various animals. Certainly it's nothing new for artists to try to emulate realism in an unreal way, but it feels like a lot of money and work hours went in to creating a very mundane film with little thought put into pacing or other tried-and-true conventions of filmmaking. I'm sure a herpetologist would love this film and appreciate the work put into it, but it fell flat for me. In 2, I felt Hiccup was a frustrating character, but this time around it's flipped where I found it kind of hard to believe Toothless would be so initially aggressive to Hiccup at the end of the film after years of them being separated just because Hiccup grew facial hair. Though I'm sure this is somewhat accurate to real animals, I sort of expect the dragons in the series to be a bit beyond the regular pets we have in our everyday life. The villain even calls out Hiccup for treating dragons as equals but the film makes a point to portray them more as dogs than mythological creatures to an extent beyond the previous two installments.I felt bored out of my mind until about half way through the movie once somewhat compelling things began. Up until this point all there was was a very generic threat to our heroes which could have been literally anyone, which is emphasized when Hiccup makes a big speech pointing this out like it's self-aware writing or something, but it doesn't make it any more compelling. Half way through, things finally started getting done with some sort of reasonable pace, but even still nothing long-lasting or meaningful truly happens until the last 10 minutes of the film where they release the dragons to live freely and safely in The Hidden World, and both Toothless and Hiccup start their own families and then meet up again before the credits roll. Just about everything else in this film is inconsequential, being introduced and solved within the same film. Ultimately the movie feels like it wants to be a cutesy romance film but still feels the need to rehash elements from the previous two films in order to cater to those expecting more of the same, but this time around there's much less enthusiasm and life in each action sequence. There is simply no suspense throughout the film due largely to cringey comical moments constantly pulling tension out of each scene, and the timing isn't even done well. Everything flows at a very casual pace even at the most intense action scenes, and there's hardly any pause, providing a very consistent homogeneous watching experience. The film seems to be insecure with its ability to entertain children and panders to them with constant noise and flashy visuals in specific scenes and then barely any flair in more mellow sequences, amplifying the pacing issue and making the film feel like two ideas spliced together like a horrible Frankenstein's monster.This may be a visually stunning film, but the bland story and shallow characters might prove challenging for more demanding viewers to find entertainment in. If you have young children who can simultaneously have enough patience to sit quietly through the boring parts of the film, this may suffice. There were certainly numerous exclamations of awe throughout the film, so if you're already largely interested then you'll probably enjoy this film, but I feel the first is vastly superior of the trilogy, and the third is vastly the weakest. This film perhaps would have been better suited as a lower-budget little kids' show. Though 2 wasn't a great movie, I still feel it's worth a watch and brought enough new to the table, but despite being a full 180 in large part, 3 doesn't seem to bring anything new to the table. There are simply too many underdeveloped elements put into the film with no passion or vision for me to really view the overall product with much positivity. Incredible visuals can only pull a film so far, and as it turns out it isn't very far at all. Great, compelling writing is more enjoyable and economical, and I just wish film companies would realize this by now. They've had a century to figure this out, after all.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

161,andrewtisler,A satisfying finish to a practically perfect animated franchise,10,7 November 2021,"DreamWorks Animation's work with the ""How to Train Your Dragon"" movies has to be their best works in film to date. They're action-packed, emotionally stirring, and well animated. And ""The Hidden World"" just so has to be the perfect finish to the franchise that might be as perfect as the ""Toy Story"" movies by Pixar.In this concluding entry to the HTTYD universe, Hiccup is now the chieftain of Berk, and has created a ""dragon-viking utopia"". However, there are way too many dragons in Berk, and this is making the isle a bigger target for threats. One threat in particular, Grimmel the Grisly, is planning to hunt down the last Night Fury, Toothless, with the help of his drugged dragons and a Light Fury that Toothless falls for romantically. Hiccup and his subjects must find a new home to keep the dragons safe or else they have no future. Meanwhile, Hiccup and Astrid are being pressured into getting married, causing Hiccup to question his relationship with her. The story is a tad light-hearted compared to the previous entry, but still has lots of action, comedy, and honest emotion, as well as romance, which is used for the different plots that Toothless and Hiccup are involved in dealing with their significant others.The Light Fury is a strong, level-headed, but lovestruck dragon that Toothless falls for romantically, although does not initially trust humans due to being held captive by Grimmel. Grimmel himself is a terrific villain, stemming from his sick adrenaline of killing dragons, intelligent strategic planning, and creepy sense of humor. He also serves as an example of what could've happened to Hiccup if he killed Toothless in the original film instead of saved him.The animation of this movie is fantastic. Beautiful, crafty, and visually stunning. This is as near-perfect as the franchise will get with its computer-generated imagery, and its design helps to end the series on an emotional, if slightly high-noted, standpoint.John Powell's score also comes full-circle in this movie, effectively bringing it to an end. The instrumentation nicely wraps up the trilogy as a whole and leaves us feeling satisfied that everything finished well and even brings a few tears to our eyes.The ending of this movie is also very profound, and beautifully connects to the first two movies with a parallel scene to the first film where Hiccup and Astrid have children that meet Toothless while on a boat. That's a conclusion, people.""How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World"" is a very satisfying finish to a practically perfect animated franchise done by DreamWorks Animation. Well done, DreamWorks!!!!!!!!!!!!!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

163,Thekeybaldemasterrises,Dreamworks has finally created their perfect trilogy,8,4 February 2019,"Dreamsworks nails it again!! How To Train Your Dragon 3 is fantastic! I can't really think of a better way to end it all. I didn't like it as much as part 2 which is my personal favorite of the trilogy, but this is hands down the most stunning and most emotional movie in the franchise. That's not hard to do when the movie is the most recently made, but the animation holy cow the animation! The dragons have great designs and expressions, while the environments are absolutely breathtaking. I couldn't even take my eyes off the sand Toothless was rolling in it just looked soooo goood!!! All good things must come to an end though and this movie finds the perfect way to send off Hiccup and Toothless' friendship. By showing themes of growing up, responsibility, leadership, and sacrifice. It successfully ties their bond in a nice bow and you really feel satisfied watching their story end. The ending had me in tears but it felt right. The only negatives I can think of is the villain isn't really that full of depth and the supporting characters aren't all given enough to do. But when the core of the movie is so strong those things didn't hinder it for me. This is the animated movie to see this spring if you had to choose between this and the Lego Movie 2 I would say go see this. HTTYD 3 is a stunning and heartfelt piece of art that Dreamworks should be proud of. They've finally created the perfect trilogy that could match the Toy Story trilogy for Pixar. I hope they can create something just as compelling and entertaining as this because I will never forget the beautiful friendship between Hiccup and Toothless. It's the perfect bridge between two worlds story for all ages. And it reminds us of the power of peace and love between all of us. This trilogy is gonna stay with me for a long time.

I nodded and continued to wipe the wet places under my eyes with my sleeve.
Yes, there were weak point in the movie, and the anticipation of a second Fury seemed like an advertisement ploy, but the handling of the new characters were deployed with complete grace. I get a little tired of the whole nemesis thing, and why this rather well defined character had the specific drive seemed out of place and could have been caped with something a bit darker.
All the characters have grown up a lot, and now that Birk is a haven for dragons spawns its own set of problems. Some cat lover would say ""you can never have enough cats"". I'm sorry, but yes. You can have too many cats. So a side story spawns. If a spoiler is defined by a story line, then here's your spoiler:
""What happens when you thought you befriended the last night fury in the known dragon world and found out there was one more - and it was female?""
You know the inevitable is going to happen, but you don't want anything to get in the way.
Production wise, music, color, animation were all spot on. I love John Powells score and Chris Sanders influence (Lelo and Stitch) has such an influence on the graphic nature of all the characters there is not much here you can't love (but there will always be those that will say different. But the one thing most striking about this is the way it closes off the trilogy. I hope and pray they don't resurrect this in the unforeseen future, it's perfect the way it is.

166,Vishal_s_kumar,Ending on a high note!!!,10,1 February 2019,"The ""How to Train Your Dragon"" series has become big business for DreamWorks Animation, who've gone beyond movies to deliver video games, books, and multiple television shows that detail the epic fantasy world where humans and dragons are learning to live with each other, often heroically. That's all well and good, but the real magic of the franchise is found on the big screen (the biggest, if you can find it), with ""How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World"" the most awe-inspiring and thrilling of a trilogy that began in 2010. Closing out the saga of Hiccup and his pal Toothless, writer/director Dean DeBlois gets a little sentimental with the second sequel, but his aim is to end things as excitingly as possible, delivering a healthy amount of action and discovery, along with plenty of Viking tomfoolery. While lacking the sweep of the last chapter, ""The Hidden World"" makes up for the loss in other ways, with DeBlois crafting a divinely animated, supremely felt effort.Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) has tried to build a utopia for his fellow Vikings and friendly dragons, hoping to turn Berk into a permanent home for the new society. He's done well, creating the Dragon Riders team with girlfriend Astrid (America Ferrera), twins Tuffnut (Justin Rupple) and Ruffnut (Kristen Wiig), Snotlout (Jonah Hill), and Fishlegs (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), but trouble returns to the land when dragon hunter Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham) emerges with plans to capture Toothless, the last Night Fury. Sensing change is needed to protect his people and winged friends, Hiccup organizes a move to find The Hidden World, a mythical realm of dragons, with hopes to keep the creatures from human harm. However, as Grimmel works out a plan to collect his prize, Toothless finds his match in a Light Fury, with the restless dragon suddenly finding maturity as he gets close to a possible mate.While there's no major technological upgrade to ""The Hidden World,"" DeBlois is certainly more comfortable with the world of the Dragon Riders and the cinematic potential of their quests. The story picks up a year after ""How to Train Your Dragon 2,"" but a lot has changed for Hiccup, who's now a man prepped for royal rule, leading his fellow Berkians into battle with a flaming sword and a tireless quest to protect all dragons, with the feature's introduction showcasing Dragon Riders teamwork as they manage a rescue mission, making first contact with the mystery of the Light Fury. ""The Hidden World"" is teeming with gorgeous vistas, fluid flights, and richly detailed character animation, with DeBlois submitting a more refined vision for series highlights, amplifying movement and capturing nuances to best prepare the movie for its eventual dive into highly effective emotionality concerning Toothless's future.The Night Fury remains as rambunctious as ever, enjoying his position as Hiccup's partner, keeping his friend soaring through the skies. The screenplay takes a longer look at the inner needs of the dragon, with DeBlois comfortable enough to go for long stretches of screen time just focusing on Toothless's silent quest to capture the Light Fury's attention. She's an enigma, and one with the ability to teleport that wows onlookers, but ""The Hidden World"" has a good time with her position as love interest for Toothless, who embarks on elaborate courtship rituals that bring big laughs to the picture. Hiccup has his own matrimonial questions to be answered during the course of the film, and the team is slowly divided by destiny, with dragon and man offered opportunities to become the leaders they're meant to be.Character is prized by DeBlois, who fits in little bits of mischief for the Vikings, finding Snotlout crushing on Valka (Cate Blanchett), Hiccup's mother; Tuffnut becomes a romantic advisor for the leader; and Fishlegs takes on the responsibility of caring for a baby dragon. While Hiccup focuses on the plan at hand, he's also reminded of his childhood with Stoic (a gentle and warm Gerard Butler), who plants the seed about The Hidden World in tender flashbacks to their tight bond. And while Grimmel is not a profound threat to Berk, the villain has a menacing fixation on destroying the last Night Fury, leading his pack of goons and acid-spewing dragons on an effective path of domination, searching for Hiccup with plans to destroy the very idea of Berk.""The Hidden World"" has its thrills (propped up by John Powell's rousing score), with a defined interest in swordfights and mid-air dragon battles, making the run time fly by. However, the focal point of the movie remains where it should: on Hiccup and Toothless. Finding themselves easing out of their codependent relationship, the pair discovers maturity and a path to peace, and DeBlois isn't about to allow fans of the series to leave without becoming a blubbering mess. He's earned the emotion, helping to guide the ""How to Train Your Dragon"" series from a magical discovery nine years ago to this gem -- the closing act on one of the best animated trilogies around. It's difficult to part with such lush, amusing, and electrifying fantasy storytelling, but the production is careful to exit on a pitch-perfect note of hope.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

It again manages to tell a fairly compelling story, coupled with absolutely stunning animation and a mesmerising score from John Powell, which really adds impact to certain scenes.The story does well to create emotional stakes, which is something How to Train Your Dragon 2 also did very effectively, which incorporates into the bittersweet message that the film is creating. This then leads to some powerful scenes at the end which I really connected with. Much like with the ending of the Harry Potter film series I was left with a hollow feeling by the end as I knew no more films would be made in that series, but that is testament to the quality of the films' storytelling.For minor gripes I felt that villain Grimmel could have been developed more than he was, but he was voiced well by F. Murray Abraham. Likewise the voicework was decent across the whole cast.Overall, the How to Train Your Dragon series remains one of the most consistently good trilogies, animated or otherwise, in recent film history and deserves all the acclaim it has received.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
171,TheConnoisseurReviews,"A Bittersweet, but Satisfying End to an Amazing Series",9,23 February 2019,"The first two ""How to Train Your Dragon"" films have been one of the greatest sets of films of the last decade and the third one does not disappoint in capping off this amazing series of epic films. Yes, to put it bluntly, ""How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World"" is amazing.The first thing you'll notice is the leap in animation. The first couple movies are pillars in terms of visuals in the animation world and this one only enhances and improves on that. The backgrounds are vivid and well detailed, the character animations are fluid and weighted, the details in the character's design are precise and meticulous, and the fire, water, hair, scale, and other visual effects are breathtaking. Yes this film is a visual treat from start to finish. The cinematography like in the other films are just breathtaking. The flying sequences are absorbing that you get lost in the visually detailed world. The camera work along with the stunning visuals create a living breathing world that you almost forget doesn't exist.The characters are great. The dynamic between Toothless and Hiccup is still the heart of the film. It's amazing to see the amount of growth these two have had since their previous adventures. One thing that I particularly love about this series is the character progression from film to film, they don't stop growing and evolving. The side characters are great and I like how they are tested on how well they work together under Hiccups leadership.Music has always been in the forefront of this series and it does not disappoint here either. John Powell's classic scores still bring that same sense of wonder and mystique, while the new ones enhance the world and character themes, It makes you feel every emotion that the filmmakers want at every venture of the film from beginning to end, whether it's humor, fear, or tears.Dean DeBlois has crafted an amazing world with so much heart and wonder. He's made a modern epic series of films that rival the greatest Hollywood fantasies and epics, such as The Lord of the Rings or ""Gladiator."" He knows exactly, when to throw in humor or make you cry. The final 15 mins of the film are some of the best moments in any film, period. It's filled with moments of real danger, visceral action, and tears that would make even the hardest of souls cry.I've praised ""How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World"" and made it sound like it's even better than the second film. However, it does fall short, but only by a little. This film is more humor heavy, but that doesn't take away from the real emotional moments in it. However, the stakes do feel less here and the villain, while solid for the film, wasn't necessarily needed. He added a nice dimension, but the film could have sufficed and excelled on the drama between Hiccup and Toothless and them learning to grow and be individual characters. These are minor complaints in an otherwise great film.This is how you end a trilogy. The Dragon series is one of not just modern animation's, but modern film's greatest series. And The Hidden World concludes this franchise in a bittersweet, but satisfying end. I give it 4.5/5",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
172,wliia,An amazing conclusion to a fantastic trilogy!,9,10 March 2019,"It's amazing how far we've come since the beginning of this trilogy back in 2010. The first film was a wonderful story of a boy and his dragon, and how their actions changed their world forever. The second film was a worthy sequel with a great moral about not all people can be changed for the better. Both films have amazing animation and fantastic sequences of flying and action. And this final film is no different.Anyone who's seen the trailers will know what's coming, but even if you do know that it's coming, it's still an emotional moment that really gets to you. The epilogue that follows it, however, was absolutely beautiful and a worthy end. As for the animation and action sequences, nothing short of brilliance. I sadly didn't get to see this film in 3D (like the previous films) so I don't know how great it is, but even without the 3D, they are still lots of fun and an absolute joy to watch. I have heard some criticism regarding the villain, but I can look over them. Voiced by F. Murray Abraham (The Grand Budapest Hotel), he still provides a chilling performance.How to Train Your Dragon is nothing short of a fantastic trilogy (with a great TV series to match), filled with amazing animation, great action sequences, the most beautiful music ever composed, and a great cast of characters that you really get to warm to. In the end, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a worthy conclusion to a great animated trilogy.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

I felt that new plot turns really helped explain the story really well. Was like you never know what was coming. The growth of characters helped came though at end so it felt like you really got to know them. The ending I did not see coming since there no clues fro. The other films. I felt the ending really put All the films together.
The bad guy was the weakness of this film. It did not live up to the other bad guys in the other films. The lack of view time of main relationships in this was other weakness in this films.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
175,deothor,This movie was disspointing,5,12 April 2019,"The villain was always a step ahead of Hiccup and CO, yet for no reason he just lost pointlessly to frontal assault.ALL dragons leaving the human world... Did Toothless really had that insane power of the alpha? Isn't alpha just the leader of the pack? Not all dragons? Even then how the ""news"" did spread that dragons are to return to home-cave?There was amazing scene of baiting hiccups death and I'll be honest, this could have been the best way to end the movie with Hiccups death. I know this sounds insane, but somehow it felt like it was a good setup.The scene of Hiccup returning to waterfall could have been a good start for new movie, but that's just imo.I'm just dissapointed tbh. 1st HTTYD was amazing, second was stupid, third one altho not as bad as the second felt empty.

This movie is visually stunning, wonderfully voiced, and while it is an action movie- it's funny in all the right places. If you're a fan of the series it's sure to make you tear up and laugh.
Parents should know that (just like in the other films) there is bathroom humor and moderate violence. This movie is probably more appropriate for younger kiddos than the second movie was though.

We found the plot engaging enough, a lot of the visual humor landed pretty well, and the story actually hit pretty darn close to home for us in a number of ways.That said, I do feel there was one area where the film was greatly lacking: villain. After leaving the movie, my wife and I talked at length about how much better the movie COULD have been if they had done more with the villain or had a different one all together.Regardless, we enjoyed it greatly.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

181,oneofthesilence,A perfect ending to the trilogy,10,4 June 2020,"This movie does have of few problems, of which I will discuss first. Tuffnut was very... very annoying. I think they wrote his lines when T.J. Miller was still a part of it, and he probably would have delivered the lines in a way that was a lot funnier, but then TJ got into some controversy so they had to replace him with some guy. And sorry but whoever that guy was didn't do very well. Also Snotlout was weird. For some reason he likes Hiccup's mom... romantically. Obviously Valka doesn't like him back but that was a running joke that felt completely useless. And also spoilers... it felt kinda strange the LITERALLY EVERYONE ON BERK was so willing to let their dragons go. In hindsight it does make sense but it's still a small nitpick.So now the positives. All the important characters are still great. There are one or two new characters that are pretty good too. The action and plotting are actually interesting and engaging, which is an impressive feat after 3 movies. And the animation just keeps getting better. I didn't think it could look better than the 2nd one but holy crap they made it better. I think this might be the first time my jaw dropped from pure spectacle in an animated movie. Also weirdly enough the ""romance"" between Toothless and the Light Fury is actually investing as well. And above all the thing I love most about this movie is the ending. Even with the few problems I listened earlier it would feel wrong not to give this movie a 10, simply because the ending is just so powerful, so satisfying, and just so perfect. Even though I've already given some spoilers I'm not going to say exactly what happens, but know that it is just perfect. I give this movie 95%",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

This series of animated films can't quite decide who they are apparently. Great warriors? Which requires quite a bit of practical experience. Or peace-loving folk? Enough already.

184,SugarandIce,Saying Goodbye,9,22 May 2019,"How to Train Your Dragon is a wonderful franchise as it has aged with the viewer. As you grow up, so does the series. It's final film now brings the message of growing up and letting things go. If the first film was about a child finding themselves and the second was about entering adulthood, this film is about what being a full-fledged adult means. In this film, Hiccup remains a fantastic protagonist with his passion for dragons, excellent leadership, cunning, and kindness. Astrid is also a great leading lady with her courage and bluntness. And our dragons remain as adorable and spectacular as ever, especially Toothless. The villain in this film isn't as intimidating as Drago, but he's more interesting a character.The visuals remain utterly gorgeous. This is the best looking of the series by far with flawless character models, environments, lighting, and color. The music is also beautiful, thanks to John Powell. This film has several emotional and utterly amazing moments involving dragon flight, new locations, and sacrifices in exciting action scenes. The last thirty minutes are utterly flawless, moving, and sure to elicit tears from the adults in the audience. The film's pacing is not as perfect as the second film's and I still slightly prefer it to this one, but it's still a wonderful conclusion to the series. Thank you Dreamworks for bringing dragons into my life and also letting me say my farewells by offering an excellent conclusion.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

First off grimmel was good he certantly had more charisma to him than drago but drago had that menacing ability to him people feared the very grounds he stood on but grimmel was more or less a badass assassin but we needed more of him to get a good feel to him.
Light furry, simply just gonna put it annoying, she just made the movie feel less emotional and more romantic and that made it less for me.
Hiccup and Astrid were great in this movie there wedding in the end was beautiful and well worth the wait and hiccup with a beard was amazing really showed his growth.
There was a weird Roman e triangle with snotlout and valka which was the worst part.
Toothless was great acted like a kid and it was funny but was serious at times when needed be.

The movie succeeds in the animation cus it looks amazing, it's ok in dialogue and kinda feels rushed but it makes sense probably being chased by an Transylvanian villain who I liked all also this movie is pretty emotional and yet hopeful for what to come in future sequels and that's a maybe.

I'm just hoping that Dreamworks doesnt screw it up with a fourth film. This thing ended just as it should have, with everything beautifully in place.

189,TheJohnnyPHreak,Fitting End To One Of The Most Underrated Trilogies Of All Time,8,3 February 2019,"I would say that it's hard to wrap up a movie series well these days. A lot of people over hype the sequels then they seem to be a big let down. Not many trilogies get three good or great movies that wrap up well. Even The Avengers movies, which not a trilogy, but almost don't get everything right. It's very refreshing when a film franchise in the process of making a trilogy gets three separate films that each stand on their own but also connect a very long story it's trying to tell. Guess what ladies, gentlemen, and children of all ages? How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is that movie that ends the trilogy so perfectly but stands on its own as its own movie. And this film culminates a trilogy that I think more people need to look at as one of the best trilogies of all time.This third film in the series follows Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) and his Viking clan Eret (Kit Harrington), Snotlout Jorgenson (Jonah Hill), Ruffnut Thorston (Kristen Wiig), Fishlegs (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), & Astrid (America Ferrera) try to fight to free the dragons as they all co-exist in this world. It seems a hired hunter Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham) has other plans and he found the only other ""night fury"" in existence. This all causes Hiccup to question his leadership. The Viking clan sets out to stop Grimmel before he can wipe out dragons for good, meanwhile, they come upon a dragon utopia called the Hidden World, which also needs protecting.As I wrote what is above, I really made things a lot more convoluted than the plot actually is. It's very straight forward and flows well despite really not having that three-act structure. Everything moves so fast, that you get sucked into the story and characters that when it ends you want more. Writer/director Dean DeBlois has created a rich world here with excellent characters that are three dimensional. Even the dragons don't feel like cardboard cutouts. They, especially Toothless, have their own journey they are all working too. It's a journey that I wish we had more films to watch in this series.All the actors bring their game characters it seems they all love to voice. Hiccup gets his evolution as a leader. He has ups and downs. Nothing is forced, each character goes through their own story that just flows throughout this beautiful world. The visuals are at a high level in this film. It's one of the best looking animated features I've ever seen. The Hidden World, when seen on the big screen, is something to behold. It seems the entire cast, crew, and animators wanted to go out on a high note. The film is emotional, heartwarming, occasionally scary, action-packed and extremely funny. The comedic moments are natural. When they come, it's at light speed and you won't realize until later that you are laughing so hard you missed something.Along with the characters I mentioned Hiccup's mother Valka (Cate Blanchett) comes back in a good leadership/mother role. Even Gerard Butler's Stoick has some poignant tug at the heartstrings flashback moments. The only issue with any of the characters I had was the villain Grimmel. He's a bit underdeveloped. We here pieces of his backstory, he's always one step ahead of Hiccup and his crew. But it just didn't win me over. He's basically a hunter and that's it. He felt very much akin to the hunter in The Lost World: Jurrasic Park, just an actual villain not an antihero.The Hidden World along with Into The Spider-Verse have shown that there can be lasting animated films that can impact and inspire kids and adults alike. Both films have great character works, wonderful visuals, excellent comedy and strong ideas they aren't pushing on the audience. This film is smart in letting the audience feels something natural. The script works so well on some many levels as an action fantasy, a character piece and most of all a great end to fantastic movie trilogy. If you don't get a bit choked up at the final few minutes and the end credits sequences, I'm sorry you have no soul. How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a fun, fitting end feature to a great film trilogy. The film will give you all the feels and then some. I can see this being one of my favorite films of the year. It's also my front runner for the animated feature Oscar in 2020.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

For me, it was not a great watch, but there is some unexpected parts which kept me awake.The main theme of this story is that the Vikings continue to rescue captured dragons in order to bring them to Berk and its bustling dragon and human utopia. Their efforts have resulted in the island becoming overpopulated with dragons. In a response to the overcrowding, Hiccup desires to find the ""Hidden World"", a safe haven for dragons spoken of by his late father Stoick .Meanwhile Toothless finds his perfect date and that was this Light Fury who was held captive by warlords and she was given to infamous dragon hunter Grimmel the Grisly (Night Fury Killer) as bait for him to capture Toothless himself for the warlords' use as an alpha.

When they arrive back on Berk, to which Hiccup exclaims to the new rescues, ""this is Berk, your new home away from home!,"" we see how the quaint village is now overrun with dragons. What Hiccup sees as a successful dragon utopia, Gobber (Craig Ferguson), and Hiccup's fiancee, Astrid (America Ferrera) both think that the dragon population has gotten out of control, leading them to be an even bigger target for trappers, hunters and those who are against their peace loving ideals. When Grimmel the Grisly (F. Murray Abraham), the dragon hunter responsible for the near extinction of Toothless' species of dragon, the Night Furies, catches wind of the one that got away, Hiccup realizes that Berk and its winged friends are no longer safe on their island. Going by memories of tales about a mysterious land of dragons called the Hidden World, a place that fascinated his late father, Stoick (Gerard Butler, in flashback), Hiccup leads his people in a search for the land ""from which all dragons come."" This is not before Toothless meets a female Fury dragon, whom Astrid refers to as Light Fury due to her white scales, who gets his wings all ruffled. What follows is part introspective journey, part nature documentary, as we see Toothless and Hiccup realize that there is in fact a life outside each other, and what major sacrifices they may need to carry out in order to keep each other, and their people, safe from any further harm.Image result for httyd 3 gifOne important thing to note is that ""The Hidden World"" goes back to the roots of the first film, in which we have a smaller, slice of life tale, told excellently through character moments, animation and pacing. One may judge this threequel against the epic scope of the second film, especially since the commercials flash ""experience the epic conclusion."" While there is certainly some epic moments in the film, and it is a beautifully told story, this is a much more introspective look at Hiccup and Toothless as characters, both together and apart. If ""The Hidden World"" were as massive as HTTYD 2, it would have come across as a mere retread. The smaller scale works best here, much like in the first movie. There are several homages to the earlier films scattered throughout, with one scene in particular making a reference to ""Forbidden Friendship,"" where Hiccup helps Toothless woo his new lady love. Indeed, instead of relying on the first film's iconic scene, it shows how much Toothless has learned through his friendship with Hiccup, and in as such it creates a magic all of its own. It takes its time to build, and is easily one of the best scenes in the franchise; to see Toothless' tragic courtship dances, Hiccup's cringing and the dragon eventually realizing he needs to do this alone, is wonderful storytelling. The scene is around three to four minutes long, and has zero dialogue. The emotion and frustration are palpable, and you find yourself both cringing and laughing along the way. The very end of the scene throws into motion one of the major plotlines; the dynamic duo need to spread their own wings, and find their own footing.Image result for httyd 3 gifThe themes of tolerance, friendship and our relationship with nature, that have permeated the entire trilogy, are still very much present. While the second film went even darker with the core themes, ""The Hidden World,"" while it has less subplots, presents to us the closing chapter of this vast, coming of age saga, and it still very much holds its heart and soul in its sleeve. It is here we see that the story isn't just about Hiccup, even though we already knew that. Dean gives much of the spotlight to Toothless, who is just as adorable and memorable as he was at the beginning. Here, in fact, we see what six years of hanging around with a socially awkward youngster can do to a wild beast; Toothless has, naturally, become more domesticated. While we have always seen his primal, visceral nature when it comes to protecting Hiccup, he has most certainly become more tame, without losing his wild edge. This can be seen when he begs Hiccup to play fetch with him, or when he copies his friend's exceptionally dorky mating ritual dance, in a way that flummoxes the Light Fury. Even though Toothless' feral side has never truly dissipated, with his strong loyalty to his rider coming to the fore in the most natural manner for any beast, it's when he spots the Light Fury that we see that Hiccup's ""big baby boo"" has matured into a young animal. He is still, at his very core, a wild beast, and seeing him being completely taken with Light Fury, reverting back to his more wild nature, is exhilarating. All the while, we see how he's torn between his adoration of his best friend, and the call of the wild. He wants to be in both places, but simply cannot. His glances and coos towards Hiccup during the moments where he is most torn, such as when Hiccup makes him an automatic tail so he can fly alone, or his coaxing of his mate to try and see that she can trust his best friend, all scream how much Toothless yearns for both sides of the coin. His interactions with Hiccup when they make the most painful decision of their lives are simply gut wrenching; this is not just a case of a mysterious lady coming to swoop the best friend away. This is the culmination of what nature intends, and how the bonds we make are waxed and waned by the roll of the tide. Toothless is as much a well rounded character as Hiccup. Toothless' attraction towards Light Fury is naturally faster than his slow burning bond built with Hiccup, given his animalistic instincts, but the friendship they have nurtured over their adolescence and young adult lives is still at the very centre of the film.Related imageIt is, as such, the natural way of things. This is what the film tells us. The timeless friendship between man and beast is incredibly complex and powerful.The last fifteen minutes of the film show us this in the best way possible. The message herein is about learning that the things you love the most, are often the ones you need to set free. The path the film takes to show us this, is like a sucker punch to the stomach. This is why it works. It's real. Nothing feels forced, or pushed. The sequences of the film, how the character's emotions and plights are presented, are done with such genuineness.Image result for httyd 3 hiccup and toothless gifToothless isn't the only character with difficulties in the story. Hiccup is the human face of this interspeicies bond, and he's not handling the change very well. Now 21 years old, and still convinced that he can make the world safe for dragons everywhere, Hiccup's stubborn streak (inherited from Stoick), mixed with his naivety, continues to land him in sticky situations. These scenarios feel warranted, given his tender age as chief, and deep rooted insecurities about who he is as a person. When Toothless is lovelorn over his alabaster crush, Hiccup quips, ""am I not enough?"" ""I'd take that as a no!"" retorts Tuffnut (Justin Rupple, replacing T.J. Miller), as the twitterpated Night Fury watches two Nadders courting, hoping to pick up tips for his repitoire. Hiccup seems to be oblivious to Toothless' deep need for his mate, much to the alarm of Astrid, who shows with nary a word how worried she is about her fiance through knowing looks and gestures. Hiccup sees himself and Toothless as part of the one soul, and while that isn't entirely untrue, it's clear that he's unwittingly falling into the dragon as a massive, scaly security blanket. ""You are nothing without your dragon!"" the villain scoffs. A bit on the nose, perhaps, but it's through Hiccup's interactions with Toothless, and his actions besides that we see how much turmoil he is in about Toothless pulling away from him. When he makes the new tail, we are lead to believe that Hiccup is giving Toothless his full freedom, but he says to Astrid ""it's only until he brings Light Fury back,"" and admonishes half jokingly to Toothless to ""bring her back by sundown at the latest!"" Hiccup desperately wants what's best for his friend, but is hanging on tenterhooks on how to broach the situation - will Toothless come back with the Light Fury, or stay away for ever? Even the audience is left with bated breath in regards this question. It's not that the friendship is severed, far from it. It is that the appearance of Light Fury has provided a missing link in the Night Fury's life, and it will drive a natural wedge in both the lives of himself and Hiccup. It's Hiccup's own demons, the fear that he is worthless unless Toothless is by his side, that threatens the relationship more than anything. One of the most heartbreaking scenes i",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
214,aileencorcoran,Hiccup and Toothless' manage to stick the landing.,10,5 May 2019,"The ""How to Train Your Dragon"" films are two of my favourite films of all time. The charming story about a boy and his best friend, in a fable about respecting nature and each other. I was waiting the bones of 5 years for ""The Hidden World,"" and it personally didn't disappoint.The film takes place a year after the events of HTTYD2. Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is now the chief of Berk after the death of his father, while his best friend, Toothless the Night Fury (vocalizations designed by Randy Thom), is the alpha of all the island's dragons, since he bested the Bewilderbeast to protect Hiccup. Berk is becoming overcrowded with new dragons that are being rescued by the young chief, much to the growing concern of the villagers, especially the paranoid Gobber (Craig Ferguson) and Hiccup's fiance, Astrid (America Ferrera). Hiccup, too attached to Toothless to even consider the dragons may be safer in the wild, takes heed from the stories his late father, Stoick (Gerard Butler, in flashback), about a mysterious Hidden World from which dragons hail. Hiccup's plans to move his village to the mythical world are jettisoned with the arrival of Grimmel (F. Murray Abraham), who has killed all the Night Furies, bar one, and the alabaster Light Fury, who ruffles young Toothless' wings. The two friends are shown their true destinies, in an adventure that shows the struggles of finding one's feet, having good faith and loving enough to let loved ones go.The first thing to note is that the film isn't as epic as HTTYD2. In fact, it is much more on the level of the first film, where it's a deceptively simple story told in a big way. The reason why the film works is due to the time it takes to show the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless, as well as Toothless and the Light Fury, through subtle animations and wordless actions. It feels incredibly authentic . One can see the internal struggles of both characters through their expressions alone, from Hiccup beginning to realize that Toothless may be safer in the wild, to Toothless being town between his mate and best friend. This leads to an emotional crescendo of a climax, where the inevitable end is met, not because the characters want it, but simply because no other choice is viable. It's heartbreaking, and you can feel the pain seeping from the characters. Toothless is even more of a star in this film, and seeing him struggle with his tame and feral side is enthralling, so when he finally accepts his place as king of dragons, you can't help but feel both proud and sad at the same time. The film masterfully takes you on this rollercoaster of self doubt and realization, to the point where you feel as upset as our heroes, but are at peace with the outcome.The themes of nature and nurture are in constant flux, as shown through Hiccup trying to help his best friend in wooing his new lady love, to Toothless noticing that he needs to fly alone without Hiccup for the first time in 6 years, and how conflicted it makes him feel. The elements of respecting nature, loving one another and independence are tantamount, as is the ultimate theme: love and loss. This film is the stages of grief, personified, and it is through the ultimate acts of adoration, loyalty and sacrifice that we see this trilogy come to a near perfect conclusion.Yes, I said near perfect, for it has a few blips. The pacing, while not horrendous, does suffer from being hodge podge in places, especially when the villain is on screen (or his goons, rather). Another aspect that can sometimes miss is the humour; a lot of it works, such as Tuffnut's (Justin Rupple, replacing T.J Miller) pep talks, anything with Toothless and his mate and Gobber, Ruffnut (Kristen Wiig) being the underappreciated legend that she is and all the subtle humour. However, there's the issue of Tuffnut's fake beard, and Snotlout (Jonah Hill) trying to impress Valka (Cate Blanchette). While there are one or two moments of these jokes working, they largely fall flat. There's also the issue of Grimmel teleporting to New Berk just as the Furies arrive, but then again, we have baby dragons being ridden in 2, and Toothless suddenly controlling flight in 1 when he spooks Astrid. So, it comes full circle. Some take issue with New Berk's height, and with the new prosthetic tail fin. I don't, to be honest. I can suspend disbelief in those regards, especially for the fin, as it'd be incredibly insulting to those with disabilities for an organic tail to suddenly grow after 6 years.The villain is the perfect antithesis for Hiccup, but is bogged down by lackeys that could've been eradicated. I loved him and his talks with Hiccup, but the presence of the warlords just irked me.The animation is beyond amazing. They updated the character designs wonderfully, the texture and lighting is gorgeous. It is easily some of the best CGI I've ever seen. The music is also sublime The parts with Toothless and Light Fury and Toothless have zero dialogue, and play like a David Attenborough documentary. I didn't want any scene to end, only to be extended (save for the Snotlout and lackey parts!)Of course, the main heart of the series still stands; Hiccup and Toothless' bond is the cement that binds this trilogy, and it is no different here. While they spend a lot of the film apart, the connection they have is only strengthened by the events of the film, so when the ending and epilogue come around, you can only cry and cheer that the friendship has most certainly stood the test of time. It is indeed, the friendship of a lifetime, and this film shows this just as much as before.Overall. I was delighted with HTTYD3. It's a beautiful conclusion to DreamWork's benchmark series. While some of the jokes don't land and the pacing is a little off, the character relationships and themes are handled perfectly. It is an amazing film, both visually and thematically, and is a wonderful capper to my favourite animated series. I can't wait to own the Blu-Ray, and analyse all three films together. It makes me beyond elated to say that Hiccup and Toothless managed to stick the landing.9.3-4/10",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

219,markbarner,The most messy of all the movies,7,5 April 2019,"I love these movies and the first is one of my all time favorites. This one is way more messy in the actions taken throughout the movie. It's clear that all ratings are given by fans like me. But I expected way more from out human main characters. I don't feel we got as deep as the other movies. We bearly touched the surface of emotions if the characters if you ask me.
I felt way more connected to the earlier movies especially the first movie.I loved the part about dragon paradise. I wanted more of that.
The bad guy was okay but seemed a little lame at times. Too weak and I kinda got surprised that he might be dead if not he survived the fall. Also the bad guys motives seemed a bit too weak for his characters intelligence. It seemed more like a revenge plot but in the story it doesn't go that deep. He just does it to ""finish the job"" or feel that the attention he gets from it makes it worthwhile. While he sees that the Vikings has tamed the dragons he still doesn't believe in it and for his intelligence it seems out of character that he doesn't believe in the fact that he can see that the Vikings has befriended the dragons - it's right there in from of his face and we still don't get explained why he doesn't acknowledge the fact.The whole joke about one of the youngsters being in love with the mom was weird and out of place. Didn't understand the fun or why it was part of the story line. It felt misplaced to try to draw up a fun side of a character.The kid with the baby dragon was kind of pointless and compared to how many times it was shows it only really got useful one time that really didn't do much either.Why is it that when toothless with his new tail goes after the white female dragon that all the other dragons doesn't follow. But when he is captured then suddenly all the other dragons stupidly follow him?!When our main character falls from the sky near the end why doesn't he fight back the bad guy but just passively falls while the bad guy pulls off his wings. Makes no sense.Toothless is clearly great at smelling females and other things. But when the movie ends he doesn't recognize Hiccup. He doesn't smell him at all or attacks. He just wait for the famous hand gesture. Seems a bit much and I get where they are going with this.The bearded (non bearded) character seemed to get too much attention. I feel the strong characters are hiccup, his girlfriend and the mother that should have been more in focus.
It felt a bit messy and too many small scenes that made no real sense or attributed to the storyline.I feel there are too many weird scenes with no point or conclusions. Cut away like 15-30min of the movie and it might get close to the feeling I had with the first movie.But I must say I was entertained though the movie sometimes was kid like (and we have grown up since the first movie) and a few times boringly cliché.The animations are sooo awesome and still true to the first movie's style and quality / looks but then still being amazing and beautiful.I recommend the movie though it was my least favorite.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
220,Alondro,Apparently no one has seen other generic kid-animal movies...,4,22 February 2019,"This is no 10/10 by any measure. Aside from CGI, which is meaningless today (if you have bad CGI in your movie, it's basically the equivalent of those 90's Disney rip-off films from Italian studios with no budget), there isn't anything to this story I haven't seen a hundred times before in generic kiddie movies. The story is just a series of hashed-together tropes:The Lightfury was a form-fitting metaphor for this movie: a pale, featureless imitation of the first, with several new shiny bells and whistles, but no other purpose aside from breaking down everything built up.1. bad guy is bad because he's bad (previous movie's villain had a reasonable motivation and drive to his actions).2. Sudden love interest immediately drives wedge between friendship3. Animals must 'return to the wild' because for some reason it's the only way they can be safe... (PETA, is that you?) Heck, this exact sort of thing is what the 1967 ""Jungle Book"" gave us, just inverting the trope in which Mowgli gets the sudden love interest and leaves his friends after they defeat the main villain. FORMULAIC!!4. Long-term memory functions of the animal characters' brains are clearly damaged, despite numerous cases of REAL ANIMALS remembering people for DECADES, despite being nowhere as quasi-sapient as these fantasy dragons. We see this often in typical Hollywood movies about 'wild animals' since they know nothing about animals, but like to pretend they do because they all support fanatical animal rights rhetoric.Heck, this plot plays out extremely similarly to ""Back to the Future 3"". Love interest, bland villain who's a copy of a better one from the previous film (a more literal copy in that case), the danger of the plot device now suddenly too dangerous to be permitted to exist (Delorian too risky, dragons staying with humans too risky)the smashing of the first movie's plot device (literally having the Delorian hit by a train), and the pseudo-partings.And if that were not enough, every other element of the film is a pale pastel puzzle of parts, many of which don't fit together well into the narrative flow.It's exceedingly formulaic, to the point it hit EVERY SINGLE NOTE I and some writer pals were hoping it WOULD NOT lay out after we'd seen the trailers, given that they are THE MOST PREDICTABLE AND LAZY POSSIBLE OUTCOMES for those plot devices.People are, as usual, allowing their 'feels' to run their brains, when just the slightest application of reason reveals this film's story is about equivalent to a typical fanfic which wouldn't pass muster in a college creative writing class.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

224,David_Habert,What an emotional but great way to end this trilogy. Brilliant story and animation at it's best.,9,1 February 2019,"If there is anyway to bring an animated trilogy to an end, this is the way to do it.Out of the trilogy this is the most visually stunning and also the most emotional of the three and if you've seen the trailer to the movie, you will understand why. In fact when you do see the movie, the title ""The Hidden World"" will give you a subtle clue as to what happens to the dragons at the end of the movie. (Don't worry, it's nothing bad)This time the story centers on Hiccup who is now the chief of his village, one year after the events of the previous movie and the defeat of Drago. Hiccup has succeeded in his quest to have a viking/dragon utopia. But his greatest test is yet to come.There is a new, more deadly and a smarter enemy called Grimmel. Erit who was a reformed dragon trapper in the previous movie is fully aware of not underestimating Grimmel and tries to advise Hiccup of not doing so, in fact he proves to be a worthy ally for Hiccup. Unfortunately for Hiccup, he does meet his match in some scenes.Toothless on the other hand discovers a female version of his species and is called by Astrid a Light Fury. So Toothless ends up having a girlfriend. (Yes dragons can fall in love too)Later on Hiccup and Astrid manage to find a hidden world full of Dragons (which in flashbacks to Hiccups childhood, is described by his father Stoick). They realize they don't belong there and you will find at the end of the movie, that it causes Hiccup to make a heartbreaking choice. Which is why it has an emotional ending.Later on in the movie, Grimmel succeeds in capturing Toothless, the Light Fury and other dragons which causes Hiccup and his tribe to go on a rescue mission and epic battle to defeat Grimmel once and for all.After the battle, Hiccup realizes that with people like Grimmel and Drago in the human world, the dragons will never be safe, so he encourages Toothless to take them to a world where they will be safe.Years later Hiccup and Astrid get married, they and their children reunite with Toothless, the Light Fury and their children. (I'll let you work out where they reunite) I believe that with the way it ended, it could leave it open for a new generation to experience the ""Magic"" of this series for years to come.The How To Train Your Dragon trilogy, Spin off movies and TV series are BRILLIANT both for children and adults alike and I think you will defiantly enjoy this one. But beware, because this is the last in the series, it's a lot more emotional.HAPPY VIEWING FOLKS.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

The emotions this film gives the audience are very strong, whether it be some good laughs or some powerful moments. Admittedly the film has its predictable moments but its not enough to bring it down too much. The action scenes are highly engaging and the characters are a lot of fun. It's also nice that it shows some flashbacks of things that take place before the film series (which also gives Hiccup's dad another appearance.)

The company is amazing at movies that are self-contained, yet, seeing a great story bleed into two sequels, the stakes were high.The second film gave us a great villain who relied on shear strength. This film gives up a great villain who relies on manipulation. One of the little things I loved is how they didn't make this new villain a viking. They wanted to make them new, something our heroes hadn't encountered. What better than someone who is NOT a viking and handles strategies differently?This was the first villain in the trilogy to give me anxiety any time they were on screen. You hate them, you get mad at them, but you also understand their motivations, but still want to see our heroes succeed in taking this creepoid down.The ending will enthrall you. I cried, I laughed - it's the best ending you could hope for something like this. Many times during the film, I kept comparing it to Lord of the Rings. And it's very similar in its overall epicness. However, that's not a bad thing - clearly. This is one of those rare films that will stand the test of time.

Keep in mind, I really enjoyed this movie, but there was something about the third act that felt off. The ending itself was well done, but I feel it didn't have the build up it needed for the impact to really set in. It was set up throughout the movie, but the villain was a complete distraction from that part of the movie, so whenever he's on screen, it almost feels like the point of the movie has been abandoned. Now I brought up the third act because of how rushed it felt. Personally, I could've used another 10 minutes in the third act, maybe an extra 10 minutes in the movie as a whole. If I did a terrible job at explaining my point, I apologize, but it's something I wanted to bring up.

With echoes back to the first and second film, The Hidden World is a touching finish to see Hiccup and Toothless soar together for one last time.A beautiful soundtrack and even some nods script-wise to the track titles of previous films the film feels like an appropriate goodbye and Swan-song to the franchise name.Having grown up with this series I waited so desperately long to see more and more and now its finished I finally feel satisfied. With a lot of loose ends tide up, a nice fast paced action story that is relentlessly interesting this film really does prove a worth threequel, though not quite as compelling as HttyD 2.A brilliant family film to watch and start the year with or to sneak away to your own Hidden world and enjoy the fun with one more wild ride!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

The film adds more to each and every single one of the major character arcs we have been following over the past two films. The animation is incredible and the action sequences are top notch also. The Hidden World also consists of some very good moments of interaction between the main characters that add to the sheer heart and magic of these relationships. The weakness of the film lies with its villain.

Fell in love with the series and still have not stopped loving it, so going to see HTTYD3 Being 15 and having to say goodbye was tough, but besides all the emotions you feel throughout the film. You will definitely love the film, There is plenty of action, a good story, and will make you experience all emotions. All honesty I would give HTTYD3 a perfect 10, sure the villain may not have been the greatest or the story seemed a little different, but that was easy to ignore (in my opinion) definitely recommend going to see it when it releases!!BTW, Dreamworks thank you for being apart of my childhood and closing it properly!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

251,haydenagain,The best ending of a trilogy I have seen in a long time!,10,13 February 2019,"Get your horned helmets on everybody for we have our first major review of 2019 on the horizon! Starting with How to Train your Dragon: The Hidden World. After the critical success of the original and the sequel, can The Hidden World live up to the 5 year hype? There is only one way to find out.PlotThe Hidden World is set a year after Drago Bloodfist's attempted plot to destroy the Dragon race and enslave the Viking Nation of Berk. From the ashes of this conflict, Berk has become a major utopia for both humanity and dragons, all thanks to the first dragon rider and visionary Hiccup, who struggles to live up to his late-fathers expectations as the Chieftain of Berk. But after discovering a secret conspiracy by infamous Dragon hunter called Grimmel in his endless quest to hunt his Dragon Toothless, the last Night Fury, Hiccup and his family set out to find the legendary Hidden World of Dragons in his hope that Mankind and Dragons can continue to co-exist in peace.LikesHow to Train your Dragon 3 (or The Hidden World I'll call it) brings us to the ultimate finale. Where the stakes are raised even higher for both the people of Berk and their Dragon allies.
The Animation for a start is a big new step for the franchise and DreamWorks films in many years. And like its predecessor the aging of characters continues to be very realistic even up to the final scene. The combination of Human and Dragon action is better than ever and the environments and settings are spectacular to gaze upon.The Voice acting and dialogue is well orchestrated and written in with the story that flows and continues to get better from each act at a time.
The Story in general is the best I've seen in this series so far, and truly shows a large amount of tension as to how far Hiccup and Berk would go to make Man and Beast co-exist as equals. The story also brings back the long lost vibe that such films as Star Wars: Return of the Jedi had once before.The Drama and situations are written in well and bring in much needed character developments to the leads such as Hiccup and Toothless and to newer characters. And how they End the story is brilliant and a very definitive way to close the trilogy on a high note by having the Dragons returning from whence they came in order for both Berk and Dragons to be safe from future Danger.The characters continue to grow better such as Hiccup as he finally goes from Village nobody, to Dragon trainer, to Warrior and finally as the Chief that his father wishes him to be in perfect transition. And his chemistry with Toothless is much more personified and his aiding of him to get close to the female night fury is ingenious.Astrid shows much more stronger development from her many other appearances and continues to be the biggest female Viking Badass in battle while showing many powerful, romantic moments with Hiccup and his daughter in-law relationship towards Hiccups Mother throughout.The Villain may not have much of a soul-shattering human motivation like Drago did as to why he wants to kill the dragons. Grimmel is actually as much more Intelligent and far more Dangerous and resourceful antagonist than the latter. And with the acting of F.Marry Abraham, you have a very sinister foe you wouldn't want to cross.The side characters of Gobber, Snotlout, Fishlegs, Ruffnut and Tuffnut continue to provide more and inventive comic relief. Enough to bring in many moments of laughter even when things get much more serious.
If you were expecting me to add a Dislikes Category on this review, well sorry to say this folks, this entire Movie is as flawless as a polished sports car.
VerdictThe incredible thing about this movie is that How to Train your Dragon: The Hidden World proves for the first time in many years that ending a franchise on a definitive high note IS and CAN still be made Possible. Other Animated Film series such as Shrek, Despicable Me and Cars have all tried to end their trilogies in a good way but never seem to push their boundaries enough to bring audiences something new that they could love. But never say never as The Hidden World has everything that a finale could ever want with enough story, drama, danger, humour, romance, likable characters and heart stopping twists that brings this beloved series the perfect closure it deserves!I give How to Train your Dragon: The Hidden World an acclaim score of 10/10!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

254,william-carmichael,Disappointing ending to great series,6,14 February 2019,I have loved the entire series of tv and movies in this dragon world and looked forward to this third movie. Unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations. The animation doesn't live up to the tv series animation. The characters weren't as three dimensional as on the tcmv series. The storyline was the greatest disappointment though. The entire series worked on the premise of integrating dragons and humans in a friendly loved coexistence but this movie trashed all of that. Apparent the human existence is too brutal to see that happy ever after big family. And the interplay between Astrid and Hiccup wasn't shown to its best. Sad disappointment to the series. Hope they continue the tv series though in spite of this misstep.,How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

256,ModishMovies,"Very Overrated Franchise, but Harmless for Kids",4,17 January 2019,"Let's get the obvious out of the way: The animation is great. It's lively. It's colorful. It's about on par with where you would expect computer animation to be in 2019. The film also has a satisfying ending that is sure to please nearly all viewers, especially those in the target audience.But this franchise really isn't for me. The humor is dumb and rarely inspired. The story tries to make itself seem more important and interesting than it really is. The characters are forgettable and there are too many side characters when there's no need for that many other than to build up the star-studded cast.This film rips off Thor: Ragnarok's wonderful line, ""Asgard isn't a place; it's a people."" I never thought I'd be saying this, but Smallfoot deals with the philosophical theme of monsters vs. humans in a much more nuanced and understandable way.The dragons are still cute, though, but I don't understand why they are treated exactly like dogs from their facial expressions to the ""boy's best friend"" habits. I love the world this film creates as well as the magical animation moments, but not so much the (human) characters.

Lets see next month with Alita, but this can be one - if not THE ONE - of the best animations of all time. Period. That good it is. Since Final Fantasy you didn't get such level of sharpness. The textures, the colors, the details, hair, skins,eyes, everything at max level! The story is very good too and overal you get a great product with also a terrific soundtrack. I spend more than 9 tickets and no regret at all. All the family enjoyed the film. As an advice is recommended to see the previous ones before.

270,Doeh,A satisfying conclusion to a fantastic trilogy,8,3 February 2019,"Let me start by saying that this is my LEAST favorite How to Train Your Dragon movie. For me, the first one will always have a place in my heart and will still be my favorite for years to come. The second one is also amazing, and If I had to choose, I'd pick it over the third one. But, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is still a fantastic movie that takes you on an emotional roller-coaster and wraps up the trilogy in a brilliant way.The animation in this movie is incredible, and when you get to see ""The Hidden World"" your mind will be blown. Each character in this film brings something to the table, whether it be jokes, romance or great life lessons you get it all in this film. Hiccup and Toothless' relationship gets built upon more, and there's no way to describe it except by saying its awesome.Regarding negatives, the writing in this story is the weakest of the trilogy, and the final fight is rushed and very anti-climatic. But the ending somewhat makes up for it. Very few movies make me cry, but this ending made me cry like a little girl. It's bittersweet knowing this is the final chapter in the How to Train Your Dragon saga, but the conclusion gives us a satisfying ending that we can all enjoy.Result: It's Great",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

273,kumadan,A good and emotional end to an entertaining trilogy.,8,29 June 2019,"Before I begin writing about the third part of this trilogy, I would like to first address a few things regarding the first two films. (SPOILER WARNING of the first two films, SPOILER FREE REVIEW for the third film)The first film which came out in 2010, is still my favorite of the trilogy. Mainly due to the fact that it did not have the standard ""good vs evil"" plot and did not have a proper ""bad guy/villain,"" except for perhaps Hiccup's father, Stoick. The first film focused more on a coming of age story about Hiccup and the special bond he has with Toothless. AND THE MUSICAL SCORE, wow I loved the music throughout the film, and they kept using it for the other films as well as the TV show.The second film, although with some truly emotional moments (Stoick's death at the hand of Toothless, Hiccup finding his mother, Toothless becoming the Alpha) does sort of fall into the equational trap of most standard heroic films. Which is fine, the entire MCU is built on that equation, and most animated films are too. But that is what set the first HTTYD film apart from the second. While I still enjoyed the second film, I found it slightly flat narratively compared to the first.The Hidden World, the conclusion to this heartwarming and touching trilogy is a film sure to be remembered. While the film does start and end on high notes, it is the entire second act that feels quite derivative. Again this is a spoiler free review so I will not go into plot points.At the start of the film we are treated to a well choreographed single take action sequence. Even though it is an animated film, it is still wonderful to see a nice long take done right. Another animated film that I feel did a great long take was The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn. If you haven't seen that film, it's worth checking out, at least for the long take.""Thou shalt not deviate.""
The Hidden World starts very colorfully and as the narrative tone changes after the first act, so does the palette, but then once again shifts towards the third act. The first act does also show the large scale of the film and the large growth of the village of Berk. I do not want to go into spoiler territory but I will say this, the last 30 min of the film is quite an emotional journey. I actually teared up twice during the end of the film, for me it has been a 9 year journey of Hiccup and Toothless and this film has a fitting end and conclusion that gave justice to such a beautiful cinematic bond of characters. Once again, the same as the other 2 films before, the highlight of this film is the characterization of Toothless, his bond with Hiccup, and the musical score that elevates emotional and motivational moments of the film. Overall I recommend this film to all those who are fans of the franchise, and to those who haven't seen the previous films I would say that you are missing out on a great animated trilogy.Rating:
I am giving How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World an 8 out of 10.
Highly recommend it even though it's not the best in the trilogy, it does give it's fans and audience a perfect closure to a beloved franchise.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

But the movie still charms with the amazing
Animation quality best I've seen 11/10
Fantastic voice acting
And killer soundtrack
I really gotta download the main theme though🙈
Somone below said ""The movie takes time to connect"" but I think at this point we know who the characters are so we already share an emotional bond with them especially with hiccup and toothless!
The movie is all about growing up and letting things go, something we people don't want to because it's hard.
Towards the end of the movie you will shed a tear or two if you have watched the previous movies and know how beautiful the bond hiccup and toothless shared!!
A series I would definitely recommend and would buy blurays to show it to my family or kids in near future!!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
276,Derekrusselpurvis,I walked out of the theatre....,6,25 February 2019,"The movie looks absolutely amazing. The animation, and effects are breathtaking; the characters look stunning, and the environment is beautiful. Do I even need to mention the music? From what I was able to hear, A+ as usual with this series.Toothless and the Ligh Fury relationship seemed to be a decent push for the movie, and I was looking forward to some cute moments that hopefully wouldn't be handled with too much cliche.However... cliche is the very word that comes to mind when I think about this film...So far biggest issue I had with the film (as far as I watched) is the villain. (What's his name again?.... eh...) His motives were so basic and ""cliche"" that I only made it about 1/2 way into the movie.... I just couldn't stand the lack of narrative and story telling the movie brough to the table.I'm sure that fans of the trilogy will truly enjoy this 3rd installment... but I doubt it will be anyone's favorite. I plan on renting the film and finishing it one day... But I could sit there any longer.To me, a movie is only as good as its villain... and this villain brought nothing to the table. It would have been better if there was no villain at all honestly, but the laziness in writing that came along with the villain truly did spoil this movie for me... call me petty... Dreamworks hasn't really captured my attention in a while.... I really hope I don't start developing a bias against them.Let's make sure our story is worth telling, especially when ending such an beloved series.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

280,kaydentullett,"A good movie, overall, but with plenty missing pieces",6,31 March 2019,"I enjoyed this movie and poured my heart into its animation, characters and stories like I always have since its first instalment. Although I, overall, enjoyed my experience, I felt that this particular instalment was predictable, tail-pulling rushed.The animation is as good as always if we're going to talk about the good points first. Once again, the producers have proven that they are more than capable of animating such beautiful shots, especially concerning the miraculous beauty of the 'Hidden World', and the Light Fury's and Toothless' teleportation techniques were executed fondly.The music is heavy and hard-hitting as always. How To Train Your Dragon likely has the most inflicting soundtrack out there, among many other animated hits, but this one just sticks to me like old, dull blu tack.Moreover, the characters were the same old characters from the previous films. Nothing had really changed about them; no personality differentiations, no side-effects from the previous films. They just continued to be them, which proved quite a problem for me. I expected Hiccup to be suffering from some form of PTSD since his father's death. This would have shown an example of how I wanted this conclusion to conclude, which I'll speak of in the next paragraph.What did I want from this film, and what did many of likely want? Well, the grittiest, saddening, devastating but applauding conclusion of this animated series. I'm not acting spoiled, I already stated I enjoyed watching, but I wanted a long-term effect to contact with me. For example, Hiccup could have actually died. I know some may disagree with that, but c'mon, Hiccup is supposed to prove how much he has matured and present to us, the audience, how far he'll go to make sure his family is safe and sound. Also, maybe a few character injuries, or deaths, could have kicked us in the ribs. I know these are dark things to swallow down about a conclusion. But hey, it's a bloody conclusion!
Overall, this conclusion didn't do much to butter my bread. Yes, it was fun to watch, but nothing has changed, and the theories people had when the trailers dropped just seemed misconducted. Clearly, some movie producers need to understand that an audience must develop multi-generated feelings when it comes to the literal finale of a great series. Bad things need to happen, but good things need to conclude considering that this is a children's movie.
Farewell to another great series, and now we must heave on to the next like a herd of true Vikings!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
281,ThePeruvianPost,Hey buddy! Remember me?,8,11 July 2019,"""You might say that the final part is not as exciting as the previous two films, however the third instalment proved to be a solid better-than-expected movie which signified the conclusion of the second best cartoon trilogy after Toy Story""It has been nearly five years since the second movie was released. From then on, I was waiting excitedly to 2019 because my childhood most-impressive saga was about to come to an end. Afterwards, I watched the first trailers, they reinforced my expectations and gave me chills because everything I loved about the saga was in. When I arrived at the premiere, I felt a little weird because I was surrounded by 9-year-old kids. They were laughing about the childish behaviour presented in the movie and also about baby dragons, but I was a little uncomfortable. WHY? Because I realised the saga became more about providing laughs and less about developing the characters such as the villain, who was not bad but could have been boosted. Nevertheless, there were many laughable moments and basically throughout the movie I was having fun as a little kid I used to be. I love how director DeBlois still gave importance to each character, considering they were a bunch of 10 individuals, like if it was their first appearance ever. Have I mentioned the visual effects became some of the most outstanding beautifully-crafted details I have ever spotted in an animated flick? Dreamworks, after all, is mending fences from its previous non-convincing films released. I bet our studio production will be nominated at the Oscars next year. I deeply believe so. The relationship between Toothless and the new Night Fury is just gorgeous and lovable in every way (if not, consider yourself douchebag, hehe...). Briefly, I loved Hiccup-Astrid moments so much I almost cried at the finale.The little problem I had with it was the subtle affair between Hiccup's young friend and Hiccup's mother ... Can you believe it? (80/100)",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
282,mistakenlymade1,BETTER THAN EXPECTED,9,27 February 2019,"Dreamwork did it again, making another fantastic and beautiful trilogy. After their amazing Kung-Fu Panda, came How To Train Your Dragon. Sequels and especially trilogies most of the time are never as good, it can never live up or beat the original of course, but some of course do it amazingly.
This movie had a beautiful, emotionally heart-touching story, beautiful music and stunningly jaw-dropping scenes.
I am very impressed with how well they handled the trilogy and hope that they make more as good and heartfelt as this one.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

284,mau-26,"""Mummy, are men really all that stupid?""",3,17 May 2019,"For me, this part of the ""How to train your dragon"" series is a total depreciation of the trilogy. The dialogs are dull and this film drips with sexual clichés and applied sexism.Unfortunately, sexual clichés in kid's movies are commonplace (for Americans, at least). While women in this film are all portrayed as totally normal people, all male actors (both humans and dragons) are portrayed as either abysmally evil or mentally dull, almost retarded beings who are busy all the time recruiting female sexual partners.One might think that the script for this film was written by a frustrated woman who has a deep-seated frustration or hate against men.If women had been portrayed as clichéd as the men in this film, the outcry in public would have been great - especially because this is a children's film! Imagine what criticism there would have been if all the women in a film had been portrayed as blond, stupid and willless.To portray men so one-sided seems to be okay? Why? Strangely enough, sexism directed against men seems to be socially accepted. We here in Europe are already two decades further than the people in the states and know: a human being is a human being, independent of his sex - and ALL kind of sexism or sexual clichés doe not help us to overcome this old encrustation. So while we in Europe are currently breaking down sexual prejudices and clichés and focusing on a person's CHARACTER, films like this help sexual cliché are further cementing - or they just turn old sexual clichés into the opposite. Is that what we want to teach our children?A child's brain absorbs everything it sees or hears. A child's mind does not filter. I can still see mmovie scenes in my mind that I saw as a child and that influenced me a lot. And that's exactly why as a father or mother you should pay attention to what you present to your children. And so I am currently worried about what is presented to our children in animated films from the States, because they are dripping with sexual clichés.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

I cried in many parts and wasn't ready to say goodbye to these amazing characters. Just an amazing spectacular film. It's sad that these characters are not coming back.

How to rain your Dragon is one of the most sucessful franchises in animation this past years.It tells the story of a beautiful
frienship between a boy and his dragon.
Let´s talk about the animation,is absolutely gorgeous, there is one scene specially in a cave of dragons that is a standout.
The story is good, altough i think the second movie had a better script, it had twists and it was unpredictable.This third movie is a bit like the second one.There is a Villain and the group must deffend his island.So the second movie was more well written.In this one the story is still good too and exciting. The action scequences are great, well directed, the movie starts with a great one.
The villain of the story was menacing and convincing, even tough it has some generic lines sometimes.
The soundtrack is very good too, grandiose, epic sometimes.The sound effects well created and edited.(The sounds of the dragons).
And as it is the final movie, the ending is beautiful, hearwarmming, and worthy.

309,jdthird,Hit all the points I had hoped.,9,3 February 2019,"The HTTYD series has been just about my favorite animated story. The first was amazing, and they just got better from there, unlike more of the recent slew of sequels that were good, but not as good as the original.First off - the animation is just mind boggling. You can see how far technology has come since the first movie, and even since the second. The small details like hair are just amazingly well done.We all knew there was going to be ""cute"" in this movie, between Toothless and the Light Fury... And there was, in spades. But unlike some things where it's too much, they never crossed that line. It was an overload of cute that didn't go overboard. Great job maintaining that very fine line between adorable and sickeningly sweet.The story since the first movie has been about the progression of Hiccup and Toothless, their growth and maturity, and coming into their responsibilities. This movie is about the absolute perfect cap to the entire journey. I had a lot of story arcs I wanted to see nicely closed, and this nailed them all, exceeded my hopes. My 15 year old son and I both had tears in our eyes a few times. And a movie that can evoke that kind of emotion from us clearly knows how to pluck those emotional strings.It started at a slow pace, but built up, and once it got going, it didn't really slow down again.The only reason I took a star off is that I thought the final battle was a bit too abrupt. But even so it was very well done, and the various points in it again reiterated the growth of both Hiccup and Toothless, and how they both have grown into their roles.The music is excellent, nicely accompanying the scenes, bringing them depth without being obtrusive.Both my son and I loved this movie, and thought it was about the perfect ending to the saga. We can't wait for it to be released on blu-ray now because he told me many times, ""We will watch this one more than we ever watched the others, this was awesome.""",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

314,soulsplosion,no plot just dragons,6,10 March 2019,"As I was leaving the theater I heard several people asking each other what they thought of it... and the positive answer was always ""It was cute."" That's all it was. It was cute. It critically lacked the emotional depth to the characters and stories that the first two movies were filled with, there was no story, no well played moral or lesson, nothing that left you thinking like the past films did. It was just.... cute, and if that's what you're looking for then so be it, but I was expecting the creativity and mastery the first two movies had set us up with.Everything about it simply lacks depth. The plotline meandered: There was no growing tension, no climax, no falling action. Things just happened, and one scene followed another with no cohesion or sense of progress. The characters act out of character: There was no careful planning, no cleverness, no deep insights into their minds and what they were going through, aside from a very brief inspirational talk here and there that is also out of character or is uncharacteristically forgotten later. The very world and setting itself lacks any complexity; the plot has more holes than a block of swiss cheese put under a machine gun. There are concepts and implications that completely contradict what we learned in the lore of the past two movies, or lore that we learned earlier in this movie itself. It is painstakingly obvious that the creators hadn't planned for these films to be a trilogy, and shove in bits and pieces that simply contradict any connection between the films. The ending is generic, forced and out of character. The entire existence and design of the White Nightfury is exactly as generic as you'd expect it to be.If you're easily amused by cute dragons then sure give it a chance... but while the first two films had a sense of maturity and depth that made them enjoyable to all ages, this film feels like it's been dummed down for kindergartners.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
315,dupregalaxy,A touching finale to a wonderful series,9,3 January 2019,"Almost nine years we have waited for this dramatic conclusion. Was it worth it? Definitely!There are moments when watching this film that I thought that it was getting a little slow paced for me. However at the conclusion, I had come to appreciate every scene knowing that those scenes contributed greatly to the emotional ending.The movie itself continues with the journey of Hiccup and Toothless. Hiccup is now chief but his focus is divided between looking after his people and the saving of dragons that are still threatened by humans outside of Berk. Hiccup embarks on a quest to find ""The Hidden World"", however he only has stories and few notes passed on from his father to go by. He believes that moving all dragons and his people to this mystical location will be the safest bet for their survival, given that Hiccup has made Berk an enemy of many tribes by raiding and saving dragons from those that do not mean well.As expected there is a new villain in this film by the name of Grimmel the Grisly. On a Villain meter this guy gets a solid 10. Cunning, ruthless, and hunter of dragons for the pure joy of it.As Toothless meets a new mate, Hiccup is faced with one of the hardest decisions of his life. However is it one that he is willing to make?How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is nothing short of a work of art. Is it the best movie in the series? I would say that it is on par with the others as each film captures the growth of Hiccup and the bond between himself and Toothless in a particular point in time. However I can say that this film is easily the most emotional.The supporting characters all play pivotal roles as Hiccup has grown to trust and rely on his dear friends over the course of the three films.This movie is great for all ages. Dreamworks have done a wonderful job in creating a timeless classic. I would strongly suggest watching the first two installments before watching this film.Signing offSilly D",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

321,welcumdadarkside,How to trust your dragon,9,23 March 2019,"I missed skipping out of a theater like a child. Its been a good 10 years since a I have seen an innocent coming of age film that did not push an agenda. The magical journey from self doubt to self discovery as a united family of Vikings and Dragons, was a breezy watch with many life lessons strewn throughout the film like gems hidden in plain sight, waiting for our young chief to discover each, at his own pace.Men, women, children and dragons- walked foot and paw in tandem in this Utopian Viking tribe called Berk, as equals. Most importantly, they had Hiccup's back even when Hiccup hadn't discovered his. Instead of snuffing out his light like adults often times do, they let him run amok, ,make his mistakes, dust off and stand tall, brimming with confidence and purpose.This is a library movie for anyone who wants to preserve the innocence of their child for as long as possible. Far away from labels and debilitating media spun narratives. Hiccup is as doubting of his capability without his beloved Dragon, as Harry was without his magic, or Spiderman without his suit. Self Doubt is not only normal but essential.This is a story of knowing the difference between love and possession. That as hard as letting go is, it truly is liberating once you do it. We don't need dragons and wars to understand the true essence of life, life throws at us villains all the time to test our perseverance as it is.The animation is both magical and real. They've used true tone colours to show that despite the animation , it is not as perfect as Avatar, and that is a good thing. the dragons are stunning. The underground world beneath the waterfall was a visual treat. The vikings don't look like MCU heroes, but regular folk being heroes.The love story is as minimal and uncomplicated love should be. A dragon taking cues from his friend and chief, to woo his lady love is so.... equal. That the dragons don't talk, all the emotions are felt, and not said.I think everyone should go watch it!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
322,yengahan-254-257374,Somewhat underwhelmed,7,4 January 2019,"If you saw the first movie in the series, you will know it was absolutely brilliant and fantastic. One of those you can see several times and still want to see it again. A definite 10. If you saw the second movie, you will know that too was pretty fantastic. Bit less depth in the emotions, but a very good storyline and the multitude and variety of dragons was amazing. Worth an 8 or 9. I find this third movie a bit different. Reading the summary of the storyline, I was expected quite a bit of emotion surrounding the maturing of Hiccup, but there wasn't much there. Toothless was quite convincing in the change of his focus to a mate instead of Hiccup. The battle scenes were at times very noisy, confusing and hard to tell who were the good or the bad guys. Here again, lots of dragons in flight at one go, but not much time to have a good look at any of them, apart from the main ones. I found none of the main characters and dragons to provide the same laugh-out-loud moments as in the first movie, with a few exceptions here and there. The lights and sceneries with light were very magical, almost Christmassy. The end of the movie presented a nice surprise and happy end, all without a lot of special effects. Glad I have seen it, but to me, this is indeed a movie that says goodbye to Hiccup, the other villagers and the dragons. Another sequel would be very farfetched. A low 7.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
323,eaglescout910,Absolutely Stunning.,10,25 February 2019,"What a way to end the trilogy! Wrapped up the story beautifully. Makes me wish these characters were real because that's how it felt throughout their entire journey - I felt like I was literally in the story with them. You get so attached to these characters that you've watched over the years.
The ending is touching and truly well thought out. I know some people don't like stories to come to an end, but I believe it actually would be a disservice to continue to drag this series out just to make more money. It ended wonderfully and felt like the appropriate way to finish off the series.
The animation is breathtaking, the villain is intriguing, and the timeframe feels right. They pack a lot into the 1 hour 44 minutes of screen time.
The best film to come out so far this year and a great tribute to the entire series. Nothing negative that I can say about this film. I hope it's as great a journey for you as it was for me.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

328,therevanchist-14739,An amazing movie!,10,24 March 2019,"Honestly had some fears on how they would conclude the series but they blew it out of the water! Not only did they conclude the series in a great way but they developed the characters and all of their personal challenges to compliment the pace of the movie. Every main character has their challenges especially Hiccup and Toothless obviously. Hiccup has a few obstacles he has to overcome in his development one is that he needs to start being more confident in himself, Since the first movie Hiccup has always been that shy, nervous, dork who was a good kid but no confidence at all, although we see how much he had come along and grown since the first movie by the end of this one you can't help but be proud of who he becomes. Toothless finds a female Night Fury and according to the movie they are the last ones in their species, Toothless finds the female and it's clear that Hiccup needs to learn to let go of Toothless Sadly and in the movie we see how far Toothless comes along as he is respected amongst other dragons and seen as a king. Overall the movie was great and definitely worth watching, the scenery is truly beautiful and many of the shots were breathe taking and will leave you wondering how they animated it! If there was one sub par thing for me in the movie it would have been the villain, His history as the Night Fury killer was a cool idea that they should have expanded on with a better villain.

330,mlgayler69,Disappointing and repetitive,4,3 March 2019,"I wasn't holding out much hope after the trailer revealed the plot would be about - again - someone wanting to hunt down the dragons...
It's nicely shot but has lost the originality and drive that marked the first two. There is nothing new to say about any of the characters, so it falls back on repeating shots and scenes that were popular in the other two films. Toothless's backward, underneath glance - again; the scene with Astrid and Hiccup talking and the dragons in the background - again; flying through the mist, dragons captured on ships - again; villain who wants to destroy all dragons - again. Dragons captured and used by the villain, attacks on the village - seen them all before!
Characterisation is disappointing too - Hiccup is constantly talked about as daft in order to boost Astrid as the 'clever' one. Shame they couldn't stick to the characters they had in the first film where they were much more interesting. Toothless is a pale shadow of himself - the first two films made us laugh out loud quite often but here he just flies around a lot and pulls a few faces.A disappointing end to the series, but not so bad it detracts from the absolutely brilliant first two. Have still not forgiven the Oscars for failing to give HTTYD1 an Oscar - it should have had best film let alone best animated! If the poor, messy Toy Story 3 can get an Oscar on the back of the first two, then maybe it's time for this one....",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

It was also kind-of his father's dream (watch the previous movie in the series for the back story). The good-guy is also kind-of clumsy (maybe to connect with more audiences). He, and his team, are so committed that they even raid others who have the dragons.There comes a bad-guy who kills the dragons ,especially the alphas. The good-guy has an alpha (night-fury) as his own. So, the bad-guy brings a female for the alpha (which isn't expected to exist), as a bait. The alpha is in love and is shown to be torn sometimes between the good-guy and the only female available.A lot of team work... great animations... It was just too good to watch.

The first two were already incredible movies, but this one just takes the crown out of the three! The animation is beyond gorgeous, it's giving Disney and Pixar a run for their money!I love the story, I love how they focused this one on less action and more characters considering this is the final film.Kids, teens and even young adults will enjoy this movie. My ONLY criticism for it is what a WASTED opportunity NOT to have Hiccup and Astrid sing Hiccup's parents song at their wedding, from the second movie!If they didn't have time for an entire dance number like the second film, then at least they should have done Hiccup and Astrid singing a few of the notes softly while exchanging vows. Just...UGH! I LOVE this movie, everything else about it is perfect, but that ONE detail being left out is incredibly frustrating!But otherwise, Hidden World is a gorgeous, well written and beautifully paced finale to one of the best animated trilogies ever put to the big screen.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

The villain in this film was the direct opposite of hiccup, giving this a great full circle feel. Many are saying that he lacked motivation but that isn't true either. He said that he met a night fury when he was hiccups age and killed it. His town then treated him like he was a hero, giving him the motivation to kill more so he could continue to gain power and notability. It was showing how hiccups life could have change had he decided to kill toothless, along with several other truths about love, friendship, leadership, sacrifice, and more. It's also funny some people in these reviews are saying that ""this was never a love story (4/10)"" although it is a new movie and a new story and the obvious direction this was going to go. Even stitch from Lilo and Stitch got a girlfriend after awhile.This was a perfect ending to this story.

348,choitaejin,A bittersweet conclusion,8,23 August 2020,"The animation is truly exceptional - a veritable benchmark for fire and dynamic fluid movement and texturing. Some ocean + sea-spray shots, seemed realistic.Also, the portrayal of the ageing process is both beautiful and commendable - the creators were not afraid to let their characters grow up and change - which I believe has led to some of the negative comments on here. I for one, miss Hiccup's sarcastic demeanour, but this franchise likes to break the rules of American animation - people drastically change.The close unbreakable bond between Hiccup and Toothless that glued together the ENTIRETY of the first two instalments, just fades away in this film. It's heartbreaking, but it's real. Everyone experiences this, whether it's losing touch with friends, colleagues or family and whilst this portrayal tries to tactfully hide behind a dragon looking for a mate; the realism of a very emotional situation that affects us all, is handled very beautifully.As others have said, the villain appeared generally lacklustre, though I believe this is because of subconscious comparisons to the villain in How to Train Your Dragon 2 who exuded perfectly barbaric, guttural qualities and was a threat to both man and dragon alike.The ending left me feeling empty, and I cannot gauge whether this is in a positive or negative way. I really liked the movie, but the notion that the dragons were happy to co-exist with the Berkians in Berk, but were reluctant to co-exist in their hidden world does not make logical sense to me.But then again, these are dragons, they do not possess human logic.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
349,simplyshalee,Phenomenal end to a fantastic trilogy,10,4 January 2019,"I say it all the time, and I'll say it again. Animation is delivering THE BEST storytelling I'm film and TV and has been doing so for years. The HTTYD series is no exception and is absolutely fantastic for all ages.
The third instalment is the pinnacle of the trilogy, rounding up everything in a breathtaking adventure that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The animation is utterly stunning, so vivid and beautiful in design, particularly the hidden world itself which just jumps off the screen with its metallic and glowing vibrancy.
The characters are well fleshed out, the stakes feel high, and the plot is meticulously crafted. Also, nearly every piece of dialogue in this film is hilarious!! I couldn't stop laughing throughout the movie!
Definately go and see this trilogy, it's unlike any other trilogy out there, animation or otherwise.

356,ethanbeard,The weakest of the trilogy,5,23 February 2019,"I'm a pretty big fan of the How to Train Your Dragon films. I enjoyed the first film, though I thought it was somewhat generic, and I was absolutely blown away by the second and its natural progression of the characters and world of the first. So, I went into this film with pretty high expectations considering all the positive buzz it was getting. Unfortunately, I was very let down.Starting with the positives, the film has stellar animation and has very unique character design for all the different dragons. As well, all the voice acting continues to be good, even if the dialogue isn't very challenging from an emotional standpoint. There's quite a few interesting action scenes and, knowing this is the final film in the trilogy, for the first time the action really has stakes. The message of the movie, and the paralles drawn between Hiccup's story and the side-story with Toothless was quite engaging. Finally, the ending feels well-earned and is by far the most emotionally resonant scene in the film.All that said, there's a lot wrong with this film. The villain (whose name I already forget) is bland and forgettable, and his motivation is nothing more than evil for evil's sake. The writing in this film is baffling. Absolutely none of the jokes landed, and most of the dialogue felt clunky and cheesy. The story itself feels very unfocused. The film is called The Hidden World, yet that location plays a very minor role in the events of the film, to the point where it feels more like an afterthought. The pacing doesn't help this either. The plot progresses at a brisk pace, but the film feels significantly longer than it actually is. But easily the biggest problem with this movie is how unnecessary it is. And the film knows it. The first and second film each have a purpose. The original told the story of Hiccup meeting Toothless and how he changed the way his town of Berk viewed dragons. The second film built off that story by testing the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless, and pitting them against a foe much stronger than either one of them, while also exploring Hiccup's relationship with his father and mother. This film feels like an afterthought. It doesn't bring anything new to the table or present a challenge to its characters that is any bigger than those they have faced before. The idea to give Toothless a ""girlfriend"" feels like a major step backwards for a franchise that seemed to be moving in a more serious and dramatic direction.All in all, I feel very let down by this film, but it certainly has some redeeming qualities and is worth checking out for any fan of the previous films.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

361,gugateixeira,"Beautiful, but not epic closure!",8,1 March 2019,"How to Train Your Dragon in a general context has turned out to be a beautiful animated trilogy, and now comes to an end. My expectation for this continuation that is in the movies was high because of the previous releases.
The first film released in 2010 is very good in terms of script, characters and soundtrack. With the second film released in 2014 proved to be even better, as it maintained the quality of the first. In my opinion How to Train Your Dragon 2 should have won the Oscar for best animation.
And now we have the third film, which according to the trailers should have an epic ending, but certainly not what happened. The film suffers from an excess of jokes, some are funny for both kids and adults, others are not. The villain in the film is also not very good, he is annoying and his plan is a little controversial. Another problem is that if you compare with the previous ones some inconsistencies can be observed in this film.. However, the ending retains the essence of the previous films, with a great soundtrack, cinematography and it is remarkable that this is a film made of heart, is not only a sequence made to make easy money like Hotel Transylvania 3 (2018).
As a fan of the trilogy I would say that the saga of Hiccup and Toothless ends in a dignified way with this film, even this one being by no means the best of the three.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
362,georgibukmeikara,Just read the review .. please,6,14 January 2019,"The First movie was perfect(10/10), the second was still very good. Both were received well from kids and adults at the same time which is not an easy task. This one cant match that bar. Imagine having to write an essay. You wrote 5 pages while the required minumum is 10. So you start to throw some random things inside it and every next one is cheaper than the previous. The end result, at best, is a wash.
The movie lacks dept. The story sucks and lacks continuation with the previous chapters. The villain lacks charisma, motivation and everything you can think of. The characters lack development and to be fair its very crowdy for all of them to have a screen time. All of the sidekicks are making the same jokes and have the same behaviour as in the previous movies which becomes repeative, they should be adults by now. Kit Harrington these days should be an A lister or slighly below one, his character have a 2 min of screen time and I suppose his promoting clip for the movie with Tootless was 95% of his paycheck.
The humor was so-so. Some great moments to make you smile and some extremely lazy jokes like one of the ""kids"" falling for Hikkup''s mom.

1. A little bit overcrowded with many subplot makes it not focus. we have *SPOILER ALERT* Hiccup's overattachment issue with Toothless, Toothless romance with Light Fury, Hiccup and Astrid issue.

374,iamdraygoes,Great ending to the series.,8,24 February 2019,"Review on How To Train Your Dragon Three.
Let's start with the basics. This movie brought emotion to me as a finally wonderful answer to our questions. (our being those of us that followed the series.)How to train your dragon two caused a separation between those that watched the first movie and those that watched the following series. If you did not watch the animated series, you would not know about the progression between the two movies.
It was a sad move on the writers part, as they made a number of assumptions.
They corrected that in the third movie. There is no series that you have to watch if you saw the second movie. It continues as if nothing happened.
It also explores when someone should decide that they are defeated. At some point in time, your pride will get the better of you. You always have something to learn. No matter what you think you know.PROS: It has a lot of action: But not as much as you would expect from seeing the other movies. It gives a lot of life lessons. It will make you cry.Cons: It assumes that you have known from the other two movies how the dragons came to be. It repeats a lot of the same rhetoric that it did in the other two movies and throughout the in between series. ""Dragons are part of Berk"". People make a lot of dumb decisions. Expect some cringe there.Overall rating. I am a bit biased on this movie as I have watched from the beginning. Still, I can only give it an 8 out of 10.
The acting was amazing. Nobody disappointed me. At no point did I at all think that the actors were acting. The story was great.
I do recommend it.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

I also saw the ""we won't make it to the hidden world so we'll send our dragons there and make for an emotional parting between Hiccup and Toothless"" storyline coming a mile away.

377,lahejarishabh,Not a much impressive conclusion to the httyd saga,7,23 March 2019,"The much awaited finale to the dragon saga is here but it doesn't fulfil ones expectations. The visuals are stunning, much better than the previous films. Animation is spot on. The movie is filled with innumerable, vibrant, variegated, goliath dragons each with their eccentric ability. The scene where the hidden world is introduced is absolutely breathtaking, visually and with the synced soundtrack. One could simply re-watch that scene over and over and never get bored. Although the film has much of the fun and frolic to rejoice about, it still denies to deliver something new. There is alot in their basket but only a few things executed. Too many characters introduced but only a few are given the spotlight. The plot isn't that good, it lacks originality and could be better. Much of the story is centered around the chemistry between night fury and light fury, depicted in a rather Bollywood style, consuming much of the film's runtime. Humor is facetious. The purpose of the villian, to be the villian is not very convincing. Most fighting will give u an epiphany, with a question ""couldn't they have done this before?"" The film feels like the director focused too much on finishing the saga with a sentimental ending and failed to pay attention to the paramount part of the film - ""the storyline"". When juxtaposing this film to its predecessors I believe that httyd 1 is by far the best, regarding its content...followed by httyd 2 and then httyd3.

Other than that, so so disappointed...Yes, we all wanted for Toothless to finally find a mate, one of his kind... But the way they did this was horrible...In past two movies they build up the true meaning of friendship and with this one they trow everything in the water just because Toothless has a crush? He doesn't want to be with his friends anymore, he is miserably and after he wanted do die for Hiccup now he can't stand him because he had to save his life? And he chose his crash over everyone else's life? And in the end he doesn't even recognize him after everything they went through?I don't want to even start on the way Toothless was acting when he was ""in love""... It was so creepy...

381,ernestwan,Full review with spoilers: An extraordinary movie for fans devoted to the relationship of hiccup and toothless,9,14 February 2019,"I'm gonna say this just to be honest, there will be bias in my review, not that I'm a huge fanboy that wants this to be a high rated movie but the fact that I'm watching this movie at the age of 18.This movie is truly amazing, a near perfect ending to the trilogy and it will hit you harder than anything before if you're truly devoted into hiccup and toothless's relationship. However, there're a few minor flaws.Firstly, the villain is lacking in a solid motive, the reasoning behind it just feels bland, he's praised by people after killing a night fury, therefore he must kill all the night furies to ensure world peace. Although, this acts as a juxtaposition to Hiccup in how they dealt with their night furies different, showing this guy that hiccup could have become if he did kill toothless. It's an iffy motive and lacks development.Another small complain, the trailers, they kinda spoiled majority of the things and made it less impactful, especially the scene where hiccup tells the light fury to save toothless, it would have been much more emotionally impactful if they'd kept that secret. That's about all the bad things of the movie. So let's move on to the good stuff.The relationship of Hiccup and Toothless just shined as much as how it did in the first film if not better. All these build up for the final separation of them, it's done beautifully. The movie also made sure you cry with multiple moments that just brings you to tears, the moment where hiccup tells the light fury to save toothless, the hug, and their reunion in the end. I think given the audience who are watching are the right ones (teens who grew with this movie) the movie can easily get a 9.5/10.I still remembering watching episode 1 when I was young seeing the friendship of them, I was so excited and happy about the challenges they would face as this duo. From that point the audience just grew with the characters facing problems that hiccups are also struggling to deal with. It just creates the bond and it's fully utilised here. As a teenager sometimes you gotta give up time with your best friends to have time with your girl/boyfriend and the issues here are very relatable and illustrated amazingly.The moment where hiccup is willing to sacrifice his life for the happiness of toothless with his girlfriend just speaks volumes about the bonding in between them. The scene in which toothless has to leave and hugs hiccup is one of the best scenes in all of animated films, the hug holds so much weight as you dive in this nostalgia of remembering what they've been through together. There're also a lot of scenes where they draw parallels with other movies especially ep 1, the natural habitat of a night fury toothless's behaviour in film 1, his drawings and much more. Most importantly the ending scene, it's the reunion of hiccup and toothless and it just creates this nostalgia from the first film when they first met in how hiccup gained the trust of toothless.Overall definitely an amazing film to watch if you are a huge fan of this series. 9.5/10 for teenagers who watched the first film when they're young. 8.5/10 for people who are not in the target audience zone but are still fans of the film. 7.5 for people who didn't watched the first two films. So Go Watch The First Two Before Watching This!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

386,dindadango,DISAPPOINTMENT,4,11 February 2019,"I thought the final one will be even more epic. But I was wrong. It's the weakest of the trilogy, and I feel like it didn't live up to its standards. I don't even know the main focus to this final movie. It should be about ""Hiccup letting Toothless go"" right? But I feel like this movie is about ""romantic partner"" rather than focusing ""the best friend bond"" that they have. I mean, this is a story about ""a boy and his dragon"", right? The main focus should be about ""best friend"", right? So, for god sake, please focus more on them! Also Light Fury is very clingy to Toothless. I hate her because she's the main reason Toothless leaves Hiccup. Hiccup's reasons to move Berk to Hidden World is dumb and makes no sense. The wedding scene is pointless. It's not important and add nothing to the story. Why not skip the wedding and show us the Haddock family in the end? After all, we all know Hiccup will marry Astrid sometime in the future without even showing the wedding scene. And the ending oh my good I hate it. It's like fan fiction. I thought they were going to be separated from each other for good, but they actually meet again. I wanted the goodbye to feel more real and emotional, and also because of the popular quote ""There were dragons when I was a boy"", I keep convincing myself the dragons were disappear for good. Apparently not. Guess I was hoping to much. Overall until this day I'm still very upset and I won't acknowledge it's existence. My deepest fear has come true, Toothless leaving Hiccup for some girl dragon. I hate this movie. It's sad tho, because I love this franchise so much.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
387,alexx432,And my New-Favourite-Movie Award goes to...,10,1 February 2019,"The solitary movie that has managed to surpass the greatness, the brilliance and the epicness that SW3:Revenge of the Sith had offered me for many years up until HTTYD:The Hidden World rolled around and snatched that number one place from it. THIS - I'd never thought was possible. Episode 3 had been my Numero Uno for but a few millions reasons...
But THIS near masterpiece of an epic conclusion of a much beloved franchise outdid not only SW3 but itself. As if the movie itself ain't aware of just how phenomenal is. The thing is, I've been struggling to describe the movie in a single adjective.
Phenomenal had sprung to mind before I had even seen the movie. However, on my way out of the theater I realized the adjective just simply doesn't do justice to how the film actually made me feel.
I had waited 4 and 1/2 years to see HTTYD3, and boy it delivered all I had expected and even so more. So, eventually, I settled on 'I would've waited forever to see this'. Frankly, the wait felt like an eternity all the same.
All this isn't to say that the movie is 'perfect'. Far from it. I believe it would have been pretty dull to have a 'perfect' movie. In fact, the first HTTYD is a couple paces closer to being impeccable than either sequels. About the latter...
Besides the ex-most-fantastic The Lord of the Rings trilogy, only this film series has managed to build on its predecessors and enhance the experience by adding new tension, new stories and expanding on the world shared by Vikings and Dragons.
Up until the started after a four-and-a-half-year wait and another 30min in the cinema, I had my worries that the film would underwhelm. And I would lie if I didn't admit the first 5min felt like a commecial or a lead-up to the actual movie. Past that, I couldn't help but smile as the tension rose and the story got into motion. By the end, I was so emotionally depleted that I didn't want to leave my seat, much less make my first step towards the exit, clapping then, all the way to the exit, as well as the moment the credits began to roll.Negatives:
Separately, none of the points belove inflict serious damage on the integrity of the story. However, once all problems are combined; collectively, they take a star away from the movie's rating. Hence, the 9 stars. HTTYD3 reminds me of Infinity War for both films have numerous minor/petty issues, but none so significant as to remove a star per se.Snotlout and Eret - Personally, I was really looking forward to seeing Snotlout all grown-up more than most of the rest of the cast. I still find it hard to believe that he was more juvenile than ever before. Moreover, he was the butt of all jokes in every scene he was in. Now, this would have been fine had they given him more serious parts. As far Eret, he was so underutilized, they could've easily removed him from the equation and give his lines to someone else instead. Unfortunate, for I was expecting him to play some crucial part and be a more active player. Technically, he was sidelined and I can't really think of a way they could have used him more.Sountrack - The score of the first two movies have been a longtime favourite of mine and for a very good reason: Forbidden Friendship, Romantic Flight, Test Drive, Two New Alphas, Where No One Goes, Stoick's Ship, Together We Map The World to name but a few. The third installment on the other hand doesn't really seem to understand how important score was for its predecessors. It has a mixture of new and old soundtrack which is always welcome but not this way. When it was time for some classic score, it was there. In the past, score lead the scene and it wasn't just something going on in the background, which was exactly the case here. The score just didn't have the same effects on me as before. Which was a shame!Fight scenes - HTTDY franchise has never been renowned for its battle scenes. This doesn't mean they are dreadful and unwatchable and easily the worst part of the movie. Quite the contrary, for they are fun, simple and easy to follow. Toothless/Hiccup vs Red Death was alright. It had genuin tension and didn't drag on. The battle was easily resolved and untilized the set-up/pay-off technique in a vary satisfying way. The two battles in the third act of the second movie were equally exciting and grand, but never enough exciting, grand or epic. Both left much to be desired and made me want to see more. Sure, they were far from complicated and messy because the camera panned from one part of the action to the other in a plain manner. And the final confrontation between the antagonists and the protagonists was little short of climactic. Nothing horrendous but not everything it's cracked up to be. Same here. The finale lacked the seriousness the second movie made an attempt at pulling off, and failed (somewhat). I think, in this case they just didn't try as fights scenes had never been the franchise's greatest strenght and I believe another reason played into the final decision when they were making it. They must have understood that the fight was not the climax of the movie, nor was it the pinnacle of the story. So, instead of making another attempt at creating something gritty and true to life, they decided to go along with something safer and more fun. They used the battle to introduce us to fully realized characters, putting their new-found knowledge and skills to use. Still, I felt like it could've been just a wee bit more serious.Jokes fell short - I've actually come to terms with this one, especially after I realized that HTTYD2 had a complete change in tone. That was exactly the reason behind my contigency plan. I didn't like the second movie initially for it had a different feel to it and they just left the comedy behind almost completely. That was difficult to process at first watch. However, after having seen the second movie for the 3-4. time, I realized there was more to this sequel than the creators cared to reveal at first watch. This is why I decided to plan a second watch for this one to make sure that I fall in love it; if not for the first, then the second time should do trick, considering I would have put on my objective glasses and tried to read into the movie's themes and scenes that were hard to conceive. Back to the jokes, HTTYD3 has it fair share of jokes, but unlike Infinity War, The Hidden World failed more in this department than I would have liked it to.Positives:Ending - I knew saying goodbye to these familiar faces; characters that I wholeheartedly would turn out to be a bitter-sweet experience. Little did I know that I payed to experience the biggest heartbreak in my life. It was so brutally painful that I wouldn't dare ruin it for others and, instead, let them suffer the way I did (in a bittersweet way). By the end of the film, I was left with no tears to cry; my eyes were so dry.Hiccup and Astrid's relationship - I love how natural their relationship felf in this movie; so slick; so gentle; yet, so indescribably realistic and inimitable. If anything, moviemakers and scriptwriters should take example from Dean DeBlois and Team on how to create not only relatable but exemplary couples in any medium. The second movie didn't provide enough Hiccstrid moments, nor did the two TV shows. This third installment on the other hand has managed to deliver exactly what I had been craving for for way too long.Creativity/Ingenuity - There is something special about the way the movie utilizes these two terms, hand in hand and not ever really disappearing, that I was left flabbergasted and astonished for the entire runtime. The lack of creativity and ingenuity in first 20min in Mission Impossible 6 turned me off of the reamining runtime of the film. HTTYD turned out to be a far more clever movie than anticipated, that I still struggle taking in its gimmicky nature and how in Thor's name did they manage to pull this off when so many in the same genre fails. I was taken aback by its unanticipated and undimished presence.Transitions/Simplicity - HTTYD3 plays with open cards and I can't name a scene when information is withheld from the audience for the sake of a plot twist. Personally, I like a well-established plot twist, so long as it doesn't undermine the plot itself or serve as a distraction for the lazy story and half-cooked characters. The plot doesn't need much time to kick in and from then on, it becomes a non-stop joyride. The plot is convenient for the better and the scenes are not at all disturbingly long. I'm especially fond of the transitions as they lend themselves to the beautiful visually stunning backdrops.Recall of plot points from previous entries - Unlike HTTYD2, the story here realied heavily on visual storytelling which remained at the forefront for the majority of the runtime, especially all scenes including Toothless and the Light Fury. Following in the footsteps of the first movie, HTTYD3 understands and practices the set-up/pay-off technique in a satisfying way. I not once felt cheated, nor have I called ex-machina once because the movie knew better than to practice such lousy and half-cooked techniques. Naturally, that's for the better. I'd recommend watching The Gift of the Night Fury as it holds relevance to the final chapter.Visuals - One of the first thing people praise regarding The Hidden World is its unparalleled scenery, topography and attention to detail. It'd be foolish not to touch on it briefly. It is; every scene is magnifient, colorful and blindingly mesmerizing. If anything, The Hidden World should be awarded the Best Cinematography Academy Award.Having scene what is probably the best movie ever created with so much love that is palpable in every scene, every minuscule detail from texture to landscapes to the display of physics, gravity and motion. It saddens me, however, that movies these days are not made with the same care and passion as this one was. I clap and hats off to the team behind this phenomenon.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
388,alexx432,And my New-Favourite-Movie Award goes to...(second review),10,3 February 2019,"I'd just like to say that I had a change of heart regarding the jokes and soundtrack after my second watch. Starting with the jokes, they felt more heartfelt and less forced. It may be hard to believe but the jokes worked much better the second time and the same goes for the score. It is undeniable that the first time I was too overwhelmed to notice and enjoy John Powell's more subtle and nuanced soundtrack. Though I haven't wavered in my opinion that the third has the weakest soundtrack out of the trilogy, yet I must admit the film utilizes the music from the previous two entries. John Powell composed new music for The Hidden World but only a secect few can stand any chance against score, namely: Furies in Love, Exodus, Night Fury Killer, The Hidden World. Furies in Love is easily the best along with all the recalls to the previous entries. Exodus, Night Fury Killer and the Hidden World are all short-lived, meaning they are really loud and fantastic just like one would expect from John Powell but they die down far too soon and they never linger. They do leave me with a feeling of wanting more, though.Theme - While 'letting-go' is what lingers on our mind all the way to the end, there are some other central themes that may not present themselves so early on. For instance, conversations regarding independence doesn't even happen until the end of the second act, at which point it becomes the focal point of everything that is yet to come; this theme is especially present in the final confrontation between the protagonist and the antagonist as well as affecting Hiccup's final decisions. All this goes hand in hand with a much minor theme but nothing short of pivotal in the completion of Hiccup and Toothless' arc that, poetically, so happens to be 'self-realization'; a theme that has been present since the beginning of the first movie; a theme carried over to the second movie and ultimately to The Hidden World; a theme that was so beautifully played and incorporated into the best trilogy ever created.Villain - I was satisfied with how Grimmel turned out to be. I mean, I was not expecting another Thanos, because there is only one Thanos, unrivalled. I'd most certainly found Grimmel twice as intriguing as Drago. I have no problem with either antagonists, but Grimmel is a much more proactive character, while Drago was hardly present in the second movie, not to mention he was a rather reactive antagonist. Grimmel was undoubtedly a menace to be reckoned with and he had this baleful aura that just wouldn't cease, and was ever present even when Grimmel was not in the scene. I could just feel his presence; Dean kept the audience in the dark just as much as the characters never had any idea about when and how Grimmel would strike. Grimmel was such a powerful and unpredictable force that he held leverage over all of Hiccup's decision. Grimmel's brilliance derive from his single-minded thinking, and similar to Hiccup, Grimmel will fight to the bitter end for his cause and for what he believes in. I found him very captivating, albeit he is but a one-sided antagonist.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
389,popcar2,"Don't listen to the reviews, this movie is a borefest that also managed to ruin the lore of the entire trilogy!",3,31 January 2019,"I won't go into any spoilers but since the movie isn't out yet in many places and there aren't many reviews at all because of that, I wanted to give a quick heads up to anyone wanting to watch it soon. Don't. It's a horrible sequel to two fantastic movies, and I'll get to why here:It feels like a cheap knockoff of the first two. Most of the movie are just quick one-liners or jokes to keep children entertained, except, they forgot one thing: a goddamn plot.The plot is very basic and the poor villain doesn't help. It doesn't really feel like anything is at stake because the villain is literally just one person that wants to hunt Toothless, and nothing else. He's constantly said to be very menacing and smart but he doesn't really do anything clever except for the first time he's revealed. After that, he just takes a seat back and become your run of the mill saturday morning cartoon villain.The movie feels like it's more about toothless being in love than anything else. In fact, it feels like they completely ignore the threat at hand in many parts of the movie just to shoehorn some scenes where toothless tries to get with the female night fury. These scenes are 10 times longer than they should be, they're not funny when they repeat the same joke again and again, and they're just boring. One of these scenes are almost 10 minutes long, 10 minutes of literally nothing happening.Which leads me to my biggest issue in the movie: it feels like 50% of runtime is just establishing shots and literally nothing happening. I'm not even kidding, the plot doesn't advance at all after a certain point until the very last 20 minutes of the movie. All of it is just a dragon flying through the air with whimsical music in the background. These scenes were used sparingly in the first 2 movies, but here they just act as filler between plot points.Even the action sequences aren't very good. Hiccup is holding his flame sword almost every scene but he never uses it once in the entire movie. None of the people use any weapons they're holding in any of the fight scenes, none of the fights feel like actual fights, most of them are just the heroes bumbling around until the villains fall over or hit a wall or something. It almost feels like the hidden village fight in kung fu panda 3, it's just silly and was made with no effort.The only redeemable thing about this movie is the heartwarming ending, but everything else was just... Bad. Not even a good kind of bad, a boring ""I'm considering just leaving this movie because nothing is happening"" kind of bad. Most of this could've been an episode in the cartoon network show, only with good CGI and stretched as a movie.TL;DR: I went in this movie expecting something along the lines of the first two movies. I decided to watch it regardless of reviews, and oh boy I wish I'd gone to another movie.

The romance was too forced and I wonder if the romance between ; Toothless and Lightfury, Hiccup and Astrid, was meant to replace the friendship of a boy and his dragon. It doesn't make sense that the friendship and love between Hiccup and Toothless were easily forgotten when a strange female dragon appeared. The message of letting go was only a lame excuse to conceal the fact that Hiccup and Toothless friendship is not strong enough to keep them together. We used to see Toothless would die for Hiccup and vice versa but here, we saw Toothless would leave Hiccup for a female dragon (though in the end, all dragons had to leave to protect themselves from greedy human in the future but again. I think it's also a 'weak' excuse to made dragons disappear from this world) and it made all what Hiccup and Toothless have been through became useless, as useless as their so-called special bond.

408,akarso-398-274219,Somehow feels both dragging and rushed,3,15 March 2019,"Let's get this straight: this film can't hold a candle to the first installment in this franchise.I felt like ""maybe I'm exaggerating and my memory doesn't serve me correctly"", so I decided to watch part one. And so I did. And the second time following day. And I must admit, that for me it's not only one of the best animated movies ever, but one of my favourites overall. It's entertaining from start to finish, every line of dialogue is memorable, it's fun, it's wild ride, music is top notch and it stays with You long afterwards.""Hidden world"" on the other hand seems contrived and boring. Jokes fall flat, characters are one dimensional, everything looks like a cash grab with a hint of ""let's tie all those loose ends, and fast"".So for the first 2/3 or so film is dragging and meandering between one illogical plot twist and another, then takes up some pace near the finale, but at the same time all the resolutions and emotional moments are shoehorned into the finale too, so it looks like the checklist on fast forward.Animations are technically first class, no two words about this, but somehow, with every installment they decided to reshape characters from lovable and humane while not perfect into the epitome of coolness. Gosh, Hiccup and Astrid could be the face of some fashion brand right now. Or perfume line. Or drive the newest cadillac, or whatever car there is...Remember the scene with the fish and Toothless in the first part? How much was going on there without words? Remember the dialogues? ""I'll be back, probably. And I'll be here, maybe"". The flow of action in the scenes alternating between Hiccup on the arena and Hiccup bonding with Toothless? The music?They were able to make music in this one bland, too. It was integral part of the first movie, now it's barely recognizable.Frankly speaking - I don't think there were ever any sequels needed. HTTYD stood firmly on it's own, it was well rounded, complete story. Sequels only watered it down and left bad taste in mouth. Paradoxically the least offendig was perhaps the animated series.Were it not part of the, well... 'canon', I would give this move maybe four stars. For being pleasantly looking run-of-the-mill story. But because of the whole picture and impact left on the whole franchise, three is max I can give. Only upside is that it made me watch first movie again.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

411,patiakleonard,Overwhelming finale,8,18 March 2019,"How to Train Your Dragon will forever be cemented as one of Dream Work's best original films, and this ending is just brings out a warm and fuzzy feeling of a brief nostalgia of childhood since I grew with the franchise. Watching it as a child, and having seen the sequel as a teen, and finally watching the end as a young adult, i can see how my taste has never unexpectedly changed at all. I was still able to recall the story and the memories and how far the universe and story has gone from the first film and it perfectly builds up to this last one. That is tough especially targeting a whole new audience who might not be able to catch on the franchise while people are finally changing their tastes in movies nowadays. Its kind of hard to replicate what Toy Story has done. Being almost 9 years ago from the first film, i can't believe how i was able to catch up with this even remembering teeny bits of the first film. That is how the franchise struck to me as unforgettable and the last movie just like the first two is still breathtakingly funny and visually beautiful and it perfectly builds up to an ending in which gives proper closure and gives the audience and the fans the last film they deserve. It is not that much exciting as the first two in my opinion, or maybe i just grown up, but i can say that it still gives me the feeling of being a child and the feeling of contentment after finishing a series in which you have sympathize for the story and the characters. Beautiful film, GOOD WATCH.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
412,izvest,A great ending for the trilogy,9,28 January 2019,"I was both excited and dreading for this movie as it is (rightfully) the last movie of the trilogy. But despite some minor plot weaknesses and weaker side characters, the movie was definitely a worthy ending for Hiccup and Toothless's tale.The good:
The strong point of the ""How to Train Your Dragon"" movies, in my opinion, has always been the cinematography, soundtrack and environment building. And that they really nailed in this last one. The soundtrack is well ""coloured"" and has a more ""grown-up"" feeling to it with more celtic vibes, and it works beautifully. It doesn't take focus from the imagery on the screen but adds more detail and depth to it. And, I mean, that is on top of the amazing imagery and animation they've managed to produce for the movie. Especially the aerial and watery shots have been always really good with the series, and now with more advanced technology more beautiful shots have become possible. But of what I'm even more impressed by is how they now managed to master both the lighting in the vastly different environments and the balance of very colourful and gloomy-gray environments in the movie. Visually this movie was just stunning, even more so than the two films before this.The bad:
While the plot definitely had some holes here and there, and there were cliches to be seen, I'd still call it a solid story. But in my opinion the most underwhelming aspect about this movie in particular was that the side characters in this movie felt more like caricatures of their selves. Snotlout was even more obnoxious than in the previous movies and the twins's personalities were completely lowered to ""just annoying and dumb"". Meanwhile Valka, Eret and maybe even Astrid had had a tone-down in their personalities to less vibrant and more just supportive of our main characters. Maybe it's partly (or even mostly) because I've grown along these movies and that I have more nostalgic mental images of these characters in my head, but I can't help but to feel a little disappointed about that.Verdict:A solid movie with a lot of eye- and ear-candy that is well worth watching, especially so if you've grown up and loved the previous ones.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
413,zesli1,"The weakest of the franchise, not that that says anything anyway",8,14 January 2019,"I have now seen this film four times, and have had weeks to think about it.I am someone who absolutely loves the first two installments of this series. From the awe-inspiring visuals, to the cat-like dragons, to the amazing voice acting, to the realistic character interactions... I love these films. And I was a little sad to know that a movie series that made such a big part of my childhood was ending.But more so, I was just worried. Australia gets this a month and a half before the U.S., and two weeks before any other country and the review embargo was lifted ON the magic day. But... my fears were entirely nonsensical. Let's just say I can't wait for the rest of the world to see this.
Where do I start? The animation, as good as the second, and the visuals are even more interesting. One water fall shot made me think it was just real life until I saw Hiccup riding Toothless. The fight scenes have improved a lot, there are tracking shots that follow hand-to-hand fight scenes. Fog is used interestingly, and the lighting was all really cool. The dragons are awesome. I really like how they use fog to get away with the dragon trainers murdering dragon trappers and still getting a PG rating.I'm just going to say that this is a really cheesy film, but I was fine with it. It is a very funny film, with a villain on par with Djimon Hounsou's Drago Bludfist. The plot is secondary to the characters, but all the interactions and relatonships were great. The writers have really perfected the chemistry between them all. The romance between the Light Fury and Toothless was done much better then I expected.I was glad to witness Hiccup and Toothless's friendship one last time.
I randomly quote these movies in everyday life, and can basically play them out in my head. I think this will leave most fans satisfied. And the more times I watch it, the more I fall in love with it.Let this franchise end with a monetary BANG, it is already made more then the first two did in Australia at this point, which is cool. At my usual cinema, HTTYD 3 started with screenings in the smallest auditorium (maybe 100 seats) but within half a week the amount of screenings had doubled, and there were quite a few in their largest auditorium (540 seats). It has died down a bit, but for it to be in the 540 seat one still, it means that HTTYD 3 is the highest grossing film in my city at the moment. Which is AWESOME.In summary I think this is a worthy concluding chapter that I have enjoyed more on each of my three rewatches. I think most fans will enjoy it, there is amazing action, good comedy (better for some characters then they got in the first two). It has heart. More then most family films have these days.

The villain was never really a ""villain"" to the degree that you'd hope and we're expected to gloss over the fact that they allowed those drugged and captured dragons to die at various points throughout the film. The ending monologue from Hiccup felt like the writers were just trying to put a bow on the series without fleshing out the ending. Why Hiccup couldn't see Toothless for at least 7 years after the dragons left makes no sense to me seeing as they were living quite close to one another..",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

420,twegman,A Letdown,2,9 November 2019,"I absolutely loved the first two films in the trilogy. I was blown away by how original the story was and how it differed from animated movies these days. It honestly took me awhile to get around to these films. I didn't give the series a chance until about 2 weeks before the 3rd film hit theaters. With that being said, the animation was phenomenal in the first two films. Now I'm not sure if I noticed this huge fault in the production of this film because I went to college for media arts & animation. Or if it was that damn obvious. But some how not a single review mentioned the fact that throughout the entire film the color palette & background layer of the modeling and animation was very poorly executed. It seemed as if the animation team spent to much time on other parts of the film. It appears very lazy and is pretty disappointing considering it came out of one of the highest quality studios in the world. Really dreamworks? Your team couldn't of spent an extra two weeks on the subtle details of the film? I'm baffled at how this project passed the through the final production team with that obvious of a mistake leftover. Honestly after 20 minutes of the film I had to turn it off. Watch it again and check it out.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

The villain is bland and has nothing on past Villains in the How To Train Your Dragon franchise.Why is the first few series of the series 100% better then this movie?Why was the ending so terrible, why did the characters feel so out of character? How do people like this movie?Hiccup has spent his entire life doing stuff with dragons, and yet the movie is just OK with him not doing that for a decade? We all know Toothless would pick Hiccup over leaving Hiccup. They have an incredible bond. And what, Toothless Tail is all of a sudden a non-factor? What?The short showed that Toothless would rather NO auto tail then one, does this make that short pointless now? The short has no feeling at all cause Toothless would just abandon Hiccup at a drop of a hat because screw them ever having a bond? I just don't get it. The second movie had a true Villain and sure it introduced the Giant Alpha Dragons, bit at least they were actually Alpha Dragons, not Toothless who just suddenly is one now because movie. Felt like actually a lot of scenes could be explained with ""Because Movie"" Bad guy is a bad guy because bad guy does bad guy things villain is a bad idea. There is no feels from this movie, no reactions, its just a bland addition to something that was great at one point before being milked for every bit of money they could milk it for while being released at a time where you are not allowed to have any opinion outside of ""its the most perfect thing I've ever seen"" given to everything.I feel sorry for people who are even more fans of the series then I am.

This has become one of the most critically acclaimed film series in history! Anyway, the best part about this is the relationship between Toothless and the white dragon he falls in love with, Light Fury. Perhaps the best part of this movie are the scenes where he's trying to impress her by acting goofy with Hiccup's help. It's just a freaking adorable scene! We even get more into the relationship between Hiccup and Astrid, though I personally find the dragon romance to be a lot more believable!Anyway, the plot is that a dragon hunter named Grimmel is trying to kill the last Night Furies. Both the humans and dragons need a new place to live. My only real complaint is that Light Fury is used as bait to get Toothless, but it's never really brought up how it was because of her that the villains were able to track down the heroes. I really thought she should have taken some responsibility for that. Well, I guess she is just a dragon.

I am a huge fan of the franchise but this movie was a huge let-down. I agree with the criticism I've already read on this page. Story underdeveloped, the villain extremely underwhelming... The whole movie is basically shown in the trailer. Sure, I had a tear in my eye when the dragons leave at the end, but hey, it's toothless and Hiccup... The hidden world only seems to be a few miles away from the island and is accessed through a simple waterfall and a cave. Why then can't the dragons just move there, safely out of the way, but come and visit sometimes? Why do they suddenly turn savage? Why does Toothless go away and just leave Hiccup behind, without saying goodbye, when last movie he would have given his own life to save him? Just a lot of loose ends and irregularities, really.

433,sopalucac,Big disappointment,4,31 January 2019,"Compared to the other films this one makes no sense, the first one was a masterpiece and it made me a huge fan of this series, then came the second one and with Chris Sanders gone it wasn´t as good as the first but still sort of enjoyable or decent, but this one? it basically ruins what all the other 2 established
Why would Toothless leave Hiccup for a female he just met? since when was this series about romance? why would they leave Berk now? i mean in the first film, second and tv shows it is established they have been through dragon attacks and worst enemies and never felt the need to leave, also the Light Fury looks like My Little Pony! meanwhile the Deathgrippers look awesome! In Gift of the Night fury Toothless destroyed the atomatic tailfin but now he sees a girl and runs off? really? he challenged an alpha because he loved Hiccup in the second but that gets ignored here, instead he would rather live inside a cave with a white sausage he just met instead of a life with more adventure and a human who sacrificed everything for him.
The pace is terrible and too fast, and why is the mother Valka taking the departure of dragons so well, and giving advice about relying on humans? didn´t she live with dragons for 20 years and abandoned her family? shouldn´t she take this worse than anybody?
Hiccup acts needy when we have seen him plenty of times standing on his own without Toothless before! he even lets him go that easily! (And Toothless acts disturbingly gross)
Grimmel is the worst villain in this entire franchise, the only awesome things are his dragons.
The animation looks too smooth! what happened to the cool textures Toothless used to have? the hidden world looked nice though!
The soundtrack is good but not as good as the other 2 soundtracks.
I could go on and on about how terrible this is, i appreciate the flashbacks with Stoick but i was expecting more grieving and leading problems (since this film takes place 1 year after httyd 2 according to Dean the director) instead it´s kind of ignored for the sake of spending time with the lame romance (with bad message saying friendship isn´t enough and that everybody needs a partner)
It´s just that this film only wants to make you cry with cheap and lame formulas ruining the heart of How to train your dragon.

443,nikolkahodonova,Adore the film,10,9 March 2019,I absolutely loved the film it was exciting and funny,How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
444,Expertbear,A great ending to an amazing series,9,11 March 2019,"The How to Train Your Dragon series as always been important to me because I saw the very first film in theaters all the way back in 2010. I am very sad that this is the final movie in the series but I think that this movie ended the series in a very good way. Hiccup is great as the main character and has finally gone from being a small boy to the chief. In this movie you can see the excellently written struggle of him deciding what is best for the village and what is best for the dragons. Toothless also finds the light fury who is an interesting part of the movie but doesn't seem to be unique in any way compared to the other dragons. The other dragon riders are pretty useless in this movie and are just there except for Astrid who marries Hiccup in the end. I do however think that the other dragon riders provided good comedy and prevented things from getting to sad. The villain is named Grimmel and has killed every night fury and now wants to kill Toothless. He is an interesting threat and probably the most dangerous villain they have fought yet. However, he felt exactly like every other villain in the series and his motivation was just that he had killed a night fury before and wanted to kill Toothless. At the end he falls and is never mentioned again. It was as if they just wanted to say goodbye to him after an okay flight in the air. However, the animation in this movie was BEAUTIFUL and the voice acting was also great. I felt incredibly sad when the dragons left and it really felt like the end of an era in animation. At the end of the movie, adult Hiccup and his children ran into Toothless again and he rode Toothless for one last time with his son. The ending to the movie was flawless showing that the dragons were still out there and waiting for humans to accept them. Overall, the movie may not be as good as the first to but has a great main character, an intriguing plot, and beautiful animation. I definitely recommend going and watching it.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

451,cepef,Absolutely touching,10,27 November 2020,"These movies hold a special place in my heart. I had no idea what to expect when my girlfriend at the time showed me the first one, as a norseman I got goosebumps and loved the depiction of a relatable dork being an epic dragon taming Viking. The relationship not just between his best friend toothless but between he and Ingrid reminded me of my own relationships. The way they make each movie really show us the growth of each character was so well done and really expanded on this lovable world. Saying goodbye to dragons in this movie was especially poignant to me as this was the first movie of the trilogy that I saw without that girlfriend that introduced me to this world. Bittersweet, an absolute heartbreakingly beautiful ending to a beautiful story.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

This one is a fitting finale to the series and I accept that these films are supposed to be for the kids, but I don't care, I loved them. Bravo!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
455,movykappa,Quite disappointing,6,24 February 2019,"So I am not the type of person that reviews movies, but I have to do it for this specific one. That's because I am a fan of the first two as they really touched me with their meaningful messages, something this one was not able to do.First of all, the positive aspects I found for the movie: graphics are quite spectacular and the sound tracks are also fine, although sometimes too much exaggerated for the moment they relate to. For example, some battles are surrounded by orchestral sets which clearly do not fit the moment. The final moments where Hiccup meets Toothless again, when they already have children, is also cute, but it's so much a cliche that it hurts. (Now that I read my positive aspects, I'm finding them not so positive at all).Now, for what I didn't find so good about this. Where should I start?The villain: It's terrible. These guys from Berk have fought against some fearsome villains, such as a Dragon that was the size of a mountain, which also managed to destroy that said mountain. This villain really has nothing; a bunch of boats made of wood that could burn in minutes (as they eventually did), his special attack was firing syringes to put dragons to sleep. And yes, that's about it. So it's basically as harmful as a homeless guy in any capital city of this world.The retreat from the Isle of Berk: now this has to rank as one of the worst moments of this film. These people lived amongst hundreds or thousands of dragons, and then one guy (the ridiculous villain) enters their territory with just a bunch of drugged dragons and his ridiculous ""drone"", makes some empty threats and leaves. And that's when things start to get reeeaaallly ridiculous: instead of immediately destroying this guy, which clearly was outnumbered like +1000 dragons to 4, including a flipping night fury which would have destroyed this guy in 2 seconds, Hiccup manages to act childish and decides that he prefers to leave his hometown where literally thousands of dragons can defend him in order to flee from this syringe-spitting guy that nobody ever heard of. It get's more ridiculous: he decides to flee his entire community, children and women included, to a place nobody ever saw, but that he heard his papa talking about when he was like 2. But it's just a myth. And he is willing to put them all at risk just because of the ridiculous villain. Wow. Just. Wow.Then, there is all this cliche thing about Hiccup needing to marry so that the community gets stronger. Clearly this message his all flawed and I can't even imagine what the producers are trying to make people learn from watching this. Having a relationship is necessary for you to make the right decisions in life? What year is this? 1700?Then there's the whole process of Toothless meeting this night fury female, which is a nice part of the film. But...then again, it all sounds like a big cliche again as this happens exactly at the same time when Hiccup is held down by his community to marry.The final battle is ridiculous. As it was expected, this absurd villain got destroyed in like 5 minutes. And it could be just one, but he somehow manages to put to sleep two night furies with a flipping syringe. Which sounds ridiculous af. All it had taken was forToothless to appear one night and it would destroy all the boats in 1 minute. And that could have easily happen in the first 10 minutes of the movie. Aaaaand they wouldn't need to leave Berk....anyway...The final part of the movie is another cliche farewell. There is no clear message that I can take from here, except that:
-marriage and guaranteeing offspring is more important than friendship, and both cannot even coexist;
-dragons lived in collaboration with these vikings due to Hiccup but, in the end, and misteriously, they cannot live any longer together for some reason that I could not understand: So, his father was right all along, and this completely destroys the lessons about cooperation and learning to live in harmony with different species that the first two movies taught us;
-all dragons leave to live in a cave; so they could have all lived there since the beginning of movie 1. This is all too childish;
-these vikings now live again without any dragon contact; in a few generations, dragons will be but myths and newborn generations will most probably be fearful of these beasts, starting the fighting cycle all over again.One last call for the hidden world, where is all the water flowing to? Somebody must be pumping it strongly.That is how much disappointed I am with this. First two movies are amazing; clear and important messages to learn, plots that actually make sense, frightning villains. This one is childish and the main lessons are flawed. Marriage and guaranteeing offspring are not more important than friendship; these can and must coexist. It is not ok to leave their collaborative society amongst dragons because of some downsides. This is a sad message that can be extrapolated for example for leaving an animal just because it destroyed a couch. It's just absurd.I hope they don't make any other movie cause this is already dead.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

463,pincerfae,how to have a bittersweet ending to a franchise,7,24 February 2019,"Going in, I was a fan of the franchise, having watched Riders of Berk, and Race to the Edge. I was also dismayed at the delay to this third movie in the trilogy and was surprised by the trailer, having only seen it two months ago.
So let's cut to the chase Is it worth seeing?In short...yes. It more or less follows the sequel (but leaves out the TV series, as there's no mention or showing of ANY characters in the series (no Dagar, no Heather, no Mala).
This felt more like a story of Toothless and his new light fury mate than the rest of the characters, which is fine, because we were all wondering if Toothless would ever find his mate.
The villain was one-dimensional and lacked the interest of, oh, say, Drago, or any of the villains from the TV series.
There were times where I wondered if the plot would've been better off in a TV episode, than an actual movie.
There were also moments that seem to forgot what Hiccup and his crew went through when dealing with the likes of other plots and villains (from the TV series).It is still worth watching, because there's a few places, especially towards the end), that tug on the heartstrings.
It was a solid way to close out the franchise and I recommend it.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
464,chaz-broam,Not as big a tear-jerker as I thought it was going to be...,7,9 April 2019,"I read the other reviews first before I watched the movie (not the ones with spoilers) . Quite a few of them said the movie was more ""emotional"" than the other two before it. They were right, in that the movie's action was not as big as the other two previously. I guess those reviewers just didn't expect the ending that was coming. I guessed it halfway through the movie. Which also means this movie was a tiny bit predictable for me.
It was a good closing story to the trilogy. Not as good as the other two. But very close.Pros: great closure, alright story, beautiful imagery, good humor
Cons: character development for the villain, not as epic in the action scenes, somewhat predictable plot.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

467,sandraorlando63,Very cliche,5,12 September 2019,"Female fury was cliche and lame. The ending made the bond between hiccup and toothless just an average owner and pet. The whole point of the first movie was to show that humans and dragons can live together and now the first movie is irrelevant because turns out he was wrong. And thus no real point of the whole 3 movies. Nothing special anymore, they should have left it on the 2nd movie or come up with a cute ending.

The first episode of ""How to train your dragon"" was one of my favourites, the second one slightly lacking, but this third installment is just mind-blowing. The animation quality is a massive step up, being so photo realistic, from the wind-blown ripples in the ocean to Toothless' drawing in the sand and Hiccup's leather apron. Some of the characters are much more developed than previously, with Ruff-nut showing us how excruciatingly annoying her babbling can be and Tuff-nut providing his obnoxious unsolicited relationship advice to Hiccup. The story has all the elements of humor, romance, adventure, camaraderie, rivalry, suspense, victory and loss, but it seems so much more cohesive than in the first two films.

479,FaithfulXplozion,My opinion (FEW SPOILERS),7,11 May 2019,"How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is NOT my farvorite in the franchise, the movie is rushed... They kept on pushing the years for this 3rd movie in the franchise, but Dean and his team should have made the story more detailed and less rushed, it feels like you need to concentrate to be able to understand the movie, it feels like the only thing the animators took care of in the 3rd part was the graphics, because the movie looks absolutely amazing in quality, but they also said it would make HTTYD and HTTYD 2 look like they are from the stone age, but I don't agree with that, the movie looks great yes... But it's not like your eyes is getting a god look at the movie.Inside the movie (Spoiler zone): Hiccup has a lot of flashbacks from Stoick who died in the 2nd movie, and he want to make Berk better and bigger to make his father proud, which he does... The movie cuts a lot and makes a lot of different scenes throughout the start of the movie, and it doesn't really get any better throughout the half and the end of the movie, Hiccup and Astrid takes most of the movie into finding Toothless and the Lightfury, which is sad that they haven't taken more time into making a huge fight, like in the second movie, it feels like they haven't had any love for this movie what so ever, and just wanted to make a 3rd movie, just to end this franchise, which I found sad... I am a huge fan of the HTTYD universe, but when the developers ruin the last movie and makes it rushed and not done, it hurt on tryhard fans like me, to say that this movie might be the worst out of all 3...

The visuals are stunning with a well performing cast, a goosebump-inducing musical score with touching yet satisfying final act that lives up to expectations in every way.
With the relationship between Hiccup & Toothless being the main focus of the saga, this film takes it to new heights and makes it the emotional drive of the story.
The animation is incredibly attentive and much more realistic; it shows how far DreamWorks have come since the franchise began back in 2010.

496,skrillrknight,"Extraordinarily animated, epic, emotional and satisfying conclusion to round off the franchise",9,3 January 2019,"With two other excellent films preceding it, How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World caps the trilogy with a trademark maturity and wonder audiences have come to expect.The quality of this film can be lended to cleverly intertwined story beats that make up one whole of a singular conflict which the film revolves around- Can dragons and humans live together? Or are they better served apart?Utilising its villain, natural world progression, the core relationship between Hiccup and Toothless, and the introduction of a wild, untamed member of Toothless' subspecies, the film drives forward this question in a very clear (sometimes heavyhandedly) manner that never feels too overly forced and rather cleverly integrated into the heart of the tale.Though the very beginning of the film take a little bit of time to find its footing (a recurring factor in the Dragons films it seems), when the plot kicks into motion, it sets the audience up for a rollercoaster of emotions that rarely slows.Once the first act is over, the movie is paced quite well, never feeling too draggy or stop-and-start. Its 1 hour 44 minute runtime is just right and helps it from going on for overly long. It also attempts to worldbuild and give subtle hints of being larger in scale by introducing some Asian/Eastern elements to some new characters who often consult with the villain, Grimmel the Grisly, though they are not touched on much, only existing to give a little nudge in the way of the audience to remind them there is a larger world at play.On the topic of villains, Grimmel, while exceptionally voiced and oddly charismatic in his writing, seems memorable from these two points alone (oh, and the extremely cool and iconic dragons he keeps around). Outside of this, he is largely undeveloped, giving small hints into his personal motivation which are left mostly to the audience to draw meaning from his implications, meaning he never really goes much deeper than simply being bad. That being said however, he isn't a poorly done villain, still posing a formidable threat and accruing a screen presence that is far more imposing than Drago Bludvist from Dragon 2 (even though he never quite does those menacing screams).Now onto the meat of the story, which is largely Toothless, Hiccup and Astrid, as well as their new challenge in the form of an elusive Light Fury dragon who seems bent on drawing Toothless away.
Hiccup, as expected due to the events of Dragon 2, is now carrying out tasks as the village chief. With this additional authority it only seems reasonable that someone such as himself would be intent on building a dragon utopia, which is shown on his island in a creative and colourful manner.
Astrid, is much more integral to this film than the previous two, and her building relationship with Hiccup helps her to be not only one to assist his growth but to help drive him to take on certain decisions, which thankfully makes her much more involved in the story this time around.
Regarding the Light Fury, a love interest for Toothless seemed trivial when first revealed, but the movie very quickly justifies her existence by writing her as a catalyst for many of the character changes between Hiccup and Toothless. Dare I say these two dragons may have been more interesting to follow than Hiccup due to an absolutely beautiful sequence that plays out with no dialogue, the dragons' faces showing such expression they may as well have been humans.One unfortunate by product of the captivating protagonists is that it leaves the supporting cast on the wayside, meaning they remain the same as always, though this is only to be expected. However a bit more unfortunate is the lack of time given to the two new characters of Dragon 2, Valka, Hiccup's mother, and Eret, a dragon trapper who switched sides, leaving them with not much throughline from the previous film and not a whole lot to do.The film's animation remains stellar and in fact one-ups the already beautiful Dragon 2. Props can be given to both animators and visual consultant Roger Deakins. While the first film retains an overcast, more naturalistic aesthetic, and the second going for a wondrous northern landscape with cool blues and warm lighting, Dragon 3 uses a striking mix of gloom and bio luminescence in deep purples and dusky oranges, representing its bittersweet tone and conclusive nature (like the setting of a sun), respectively. While not as much time is spent in the film's namesake ""the Hidden World"" as I would have liked, the scenery built in there are an insane visual feast and sure to remain in the minds of those leaving the theater.I simply can't say much about the soundtrack, as John Powell is so consistently incredible in all of his works on the previous films. Though Dragon 3 holds a quite different feel to the tone of this music with a fair few new themes, it still has the iconic cues of the franchise to keep it integrated within his works, contributing to some truly epic scores, or truly heartbreaking ones...If you are a fan of this franchise as I am, then prepare for the film to rip into your heart and toy with it, while if you are not as invested in these films, there is still a captivating tale along with equally captivating animation to keep your interest.Many wondered if the How to Train Your Dragon franchise was Dreamworks' Toy Story, their crown jewel, after the success of Dragon 2 as a sequel. With Dragon 3 I can safely say that this collection of films has wholeheartedly solidified its place as one the greatest animated trilogies of all time.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

These movies have become my life and now that all is ended, I don't know what will be of me...I don't understand why DreamWorks Animation is so underrated, so Disney is not always good making movies. DWA deserves the same attention than Disney, just saying that my favorite movies are from DWA.I need this movie win an Oscar because they deserve a lot since the first one, and because I want everyone see the perfect and awesome these movies are.

499,hendrydext,Most 10 stars is spammed by newly registered members,1,14 January 2019,"I have to be honest. I watched this film because I read imdb reviews that say that this film is ""wonderful"", ""perfect"", ""stunning"", etc with so many helpful marks. However, after I watched the film in cinema, I feel being cheated by the reviews. And you can see that most review with 9 or 10 star is created by user that registered in January 2019 (it is new member)This third film of How to Train Your Dragon series is in fact the worst of all.
1. PLOT
The plot is predictable and the trailer just tell all the main plot. First, there are villain. Second, the villain capture the dragon. Third, the main protagonist save the dragons. The End... You may say that there is more.. So, here are the other points:
2. JOKES
The film is just bad making jokes. Mostly, the jokes are missed. For example, (1) First 10 minutes, the guard is mistaken the human as a demon... No one laughed at the cinema... (2) there are conversation like ""move your butt to the left a little bit"", and again no one laugh.. The funny moments I remembered are just 2: when toothless dances like human, and when there is someone got freed from prison because she talk too much... The other jokes are missed.
3. MESSAGE
Most good films have to have a good message to the viewer. I notice that this film's message is not good enough.. It tries to tell us that we have to have hopes and we have to let our friends (in this case dragon) to go free. The film want us to cry... But, no one in the cinema cry... Me and my friends seems failed to see the message... Comparing to ""Toy Story 3"", the message is wonderfully delivered (even it was toys!).
When Astrid tried to gave some speech to Hiccup when they have to save the dragons, for me it is not a good speech too. It fails to convey the message again.
4. LOGIC
I find that there are 2 logic fallacy in this film:
(1) When they want to save the dragons from the villain, they said that it is ""impossible"". They use the ""squirrel"" suit to catch up with the ship which is illogically impossible!. Since when squirrel suit can replace bird functionality? Since when squirrel suit is faster than the ship? And how come they can beat the villain with no preparation, no weapon, no strategy, and in the end no one got hurts? Remember, the first statement that this mission is impossible, but in the end, this mission is just piece of cake... There is no thrill here... It is just ridiculous.
(2) They decide to let the dragons free to the hidden world. However, there is no way they know that there is hidden world, because they never communicate it before, except they are esper and can read each other's mind... So, the logical and reasonable way to let go of dragons should be: someone should ask first whether the hidden world exists - If they are not esper!
5. CHARACTER
I cannot find reason why we should make this main character as a role model... Just mention to me, what characteristic Hiccup has, because I find it difficult to find any. The film is quite racist, because it make you the leader, because you are the son of the previous leader.... And toothless is made as a king, because it is night fury... For me, It is racist.
6. VISUAL
Ok. The visual is good, but not good enough.
7. MUSIC
music is good, but not memorable..To get the more objective review, you should sort the review by ""Profilic Reviewer"" instead.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
500,hendrydext,Character and story could be better.,1,15 March 2020,"One of the strong points for this film is the great animation it has. I have to be honest to say that it really does not live my expectation.First the villain.
I know that this film is made for kids. There should be no blood, no violence. However, when there is a war, they made it like it is a piece of cake of battle. They made a joke of it. To my view, the villain is just an ordinary villain that want to capture dragons, but no power at all. They could have beaten the villain when the villain appears. There is no need to go from place to place.Seconds, characters
Hiccups, as the main characters, is shown as the leader, and the film want to show that Hiccup can lead, and make good decision. Also, the film wants to show the affections between the Hiccup and tooth, to captivate the readers when they let go of the dragons to the wild.The problems with the ""Hiccup's leadership"" are there is no strong internal conflict in the leadership. Hiccup is chosen as the leader because everyone choose him from the start. Hiccup does not want to. The same goes for toothless. Toothless become the leader of dragon because he is one of the rare kind of dragons, not because he wants to. Moreover, I feel there is no strong obstacle of Hiccups becoming leader. Even when his decision is wrong, there is no consequences with the village and everyone seems does not care of Hiccups being right or wrong.Many people may cry when Hiccups let go the toothless and other dragons to the wild. It might bring up viewers to tears. However, the pace just too fast for me. When I am in the position of the villagers, when I am asked to let go the dragons into the wild, I must questions of ""why"" and ""how"". I see there is no reason to let go of dragons at that time since they already won the war pretty easily.. I mean, you are right that saying, ""There might be possibility of other villain capturing the dragons"", but I will say ""We have won many times. Why we release the dragons? Are you sure that this is the moment?""What can be improved?
For example
a villain does not have to be a just bad person. But we need to have their point of view and sometimes we said ""Oh, this villain is right too.""Make Hiccup have the leadership crisis badly. Make other people lose trust of him. Make Hiccup frustrate sometimes. We want more that frustrations seen in his face. It will make the story better.Make strong reason why we need to let go dragons to the wild. For example: Showing how happy the dragons when release into wild. (Actually this conflict is just same with how we release our pet into wild)Above of all, yes, the visual animation is great.For dreamworks, I will be very happy if they realise that there is a person who has a big expectations for their films. I hope they can be much much better.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

503,dumbmovieman,A Great Conclusion to Dreamworks' Astounding Trilogy,10,4 February 2019,"The How to Train Your Dragon Movies are some of my favorite of all time, and now Dreamworks brings us the final installment to what is undoubtedly their finest work to date.I was really excited for this, and it did not disappoint, it was a great end to an amazing trilogy. The visuals alone made my jaw drop, showing how far technologically the series has come since 2010. From the second the first action sequence starts, you will not believe how much things have changed. Not only is the audience learning more about the world they live in but the characters are doing the same thing, bringing about a greater understanding in the world that you are watching. The characters also still hold relevance, concluding their arcs that will leave you satisfied. The bond that Hiccup and Toothless share is also very notable. While the scenes with Toothless and the Light Fury are really cute and funny, it does bring some emotional weight on Hiccup, as he faces a reality that he has feared for so long. The story this movie tells is also a great way to end the series, and comes together in a way that makes sense and is also very emotional, making this truly feel like the last chapter. I grew up with this series, watching it since I was a kid, so seeing it come to an end left me with a bittersweet feeling that did bring tears to my eyes.How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a movie you cannot miss. With dazzling visuals, great characters, and a great story with an ending that had me in tears, this movie brings an end to one of the best series out there, leaving me with that same feeling that I had while watching Toy Story 3, the feeling of having to say goodbye.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

The kids & myself (ages: 11, 15, 22, 40) had to dry many tears after the movie ended; happy we grabbed extra popcorn napkins. We didnt think it was possible, but it further deepened & embedded just how strong the relationship between Hiccup & Toothless is/was/& will ALWAYS be!! It also went on to demonstrate the relationship/love that each character has with their own personal dragon! Even as I write this review, I find myself choking back some tears..... Absolutely fantastic movie that I'd pay to see again & plan to preorder ASAP! ❤ If youre someone who ponders whether to go to the theater or wait til the BluRay releases... my advice is to pay for both!

I absolutely love this franchise. My eldest is the reason I started watching RTTE, and I haven't regretted a single moment since.I only have two problems with this movie. Number totally one, they turned the twins into absolutely nothing characters. The twins were made to seem like they had no awareness of what was going on and like they were too dumb to understand what was happening. When really, they're ditsy and clumsy, they're always doing their own thing, but they're actually incredibly detail oriented and they've always got a grasp on whatever is happening. Multiple times Hiccup challenges one of them and they can always perfectly recount what was just said, until this last movie. They were treated as extension characters. They contributed nothing to the main plot, despite being part of the original five-member Dragon Riders, outside of a conveniently placed use of Ruffnut as a plot-furthering device. Honestly, this is such a travesty. They were nothing but stupid, vapid, self-centered idiots, when in the rest of the series they're the comic relief and also the unconventional heroes. Personally, the twins are my favorite characters, and it was so disappointing to see them used as cheap, stupid plot fillers when I know they are so much more.My second problem is with the ending. I won't spoil it, but it gave the impression of ""If I cant be happy no one can!"" While I understand the premise behind what was happening, I've been around since the first movie, and watched everything they went through to reach this point, so it was very disappointing to see this certain ending be the end result. I cried, my daughter cried, and then we cried again.Great movie, but you hurt my fee-fees lol",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

519,guzmangabriel-99895,Good Ending,8,7 April 2019,"The director of How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World (Dean Deblois) did an amazing job of incorporating new changes to the movie that made the movie more of an exciting film to watch. The voices of the main protagonist Hiccup (Voiced by Jay Bruchel) and antagonist Grimmel (Voiced by F. Murray Abraham) Have plenty of story plot that goes on between them that also bring tons of excitement along with them.
Overall, I would give this movie an 8 out of 10 because it left us off with a potential movie storyline that could commence years after when How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World.
The young new chief of Berk, Hiccup is devoted to change the way people and dragons coexist with each other. Before hiccup was the chief of Berk, his dad was chief. His dad believed that humans and dragons can not exist with each other and that all dragons should be killed. Ever since Hiccup was a child, he wanted to change the way people think about dragons living with people.
This movie is the future that hiccup always wanted. A utopia of people and dragons he calls it. Hiccup is so concentrated on the idea that dragons and humans should live with each other that he makes sure to bring back every dragon he finds off a raid and brings it back to his village where they can be safely stored. The village is on the verge of overpopulation and needs to be relocated.
A notorious dragon slayer shows up, named Grimmel wants to cause trouble again to feel like he was young again. Grimmel causes all types of anarchy to the village of Berk when he declares that he wants to eradicate the last of all night furys.
The animation of this movie is well done from all the precise animations of the dragons and people to the glow in the dark scene when Hiccup and Astrid (Voiced by America Ferrera) find The Hidden World. The creators of this movie did a really good job of paying attention to the little things such as intricate background designs. The title of the movie is kind of deceiving because The Hidden World is not the main focus of the film and yet the name and movie art portray it as the main focus.
The main audience for this film would be the youth. Children would be captivated by the by the bright colors it has and storyline of the movie. The movie follows the classic new villain that wants to destroy what the good guys have left. (which are dragons) The suspense that the final raid brought to the movie would definitely bring children to the end of their seat wanting to see who is going to win.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

523,tgordievskaa,A Great Finale for a Terrific Franchise,9,25 April 2019,"The 'How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World' movie is the last movie in the 'How to Train Your Dragon' franchise - and it is a perfect ending of the story of true friendship between a boy Hiccup and his pet dragon Toothless.
One of the best parts of the whole franchise is that each film explores different topics. The first movie was about peoples' prejudice about creatures they don't understand, the second one was about the importance of the family, and the last tells us how important is to part with the ones you love and care about. In the film, there are many memorable characters, including Hiccup's fiancée Astrid, his mother Valka, and group of his loyal friends. However, the story is mainly concentrated on Hiccup and Toothless, and studies the nature of their friendship. Both of the characters completed an amazing growth, which, of course, has transformed them and their relationships with their friends and family. The movie also has a fascinating animation, and some of the scenes, such as a flight on a dragon, or demonstration of the hidden dragons' world, can definitely blow your mind!
I believe that the movie will be enjoyed not only by kids, but also by adults, so it would be a great decision to watch it with a whole family. It is the best third act for the amazing trilogy one can imagine, so I definitely recommend it!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

525,briannaseg,A Satisfying End to an Incredible Series,9,13 May 2019,"Fantasy movies have been at the center of popularity among children and young adults. They can feature times before modern civilization as well as periods far after our modern civilization with space ships and grandiose technologies. How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a DreamWorks animation that delves into the ancient past of Vikings and their times on the earth. In doing so, we find ourselves following the life of a group of unexpected friends, Hiccup, Astrid, Ruffnut, Snotlout, Fishlegs, and Tuffnut in their journey to bring peace among humankind and the dragons of their world.This movie is the third and final movie in the series which configures an ending that all fans of the series would be satisfied with. The series has proven the strength in friendship as well as the faith given in families while going through emotional times. With the death of his father, Hiccup has risen to chief of Berk and attempts to fill the large shoes his father-Stoick the Vast-has left for him after having only been the young and naïve village boy from the first movie. Although he has grown with age, his frivolous ideas continue to be produced and implemented taking the community to a new ""Berk"" after trying to find the hidden world where humans and dragons can learn to live together, however, in all great movies, there is the antagonist who is out to kill Toothless-Hiccup's rare night fury.Although it seems as though the plots of each of the three movies have been copied from one to the other, each have their own intense realities that emerge. The movies all show a conflict with the dragons of the world and how many had continued to exploit or kill them. Some wished to be at peace with them, however, most had wished to eradicate them. Eventually, most became tolerant of the dragons, but rather than fearing them they instead decided the dragons would fear the humans and incorporated them into a slave industry for war which Hiccup, and the other villagers of Berk attempted to end. In ""The Hidden World"", the last movie, all questions seem to be answered and the greed of humans in controlling dragons has been solved causing for celebration among movie-goers who followed the series and the characters throughout the years of its production with the satisfaction the end has inspired.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

How to train your dragon 3 the hidden world review
The movie was a wonderful way to end the series. I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. It left nothing out, it provided a wonderful beginning that lined up with the previous movies and it ended by telling us about the future and what happens after. There's nothing left and that's exactly the way a series of movies should end.Artistic value -
This film did what lots of films don't. Most of the time we are left with big cliff hangers or secrets that will never be answered in a series ending film. But this time all the bases were covered we were finally told how it all ends in a wonderful fashion. Everyone ends up happy, even though they had to leave some friends behind they can still visit. It's a very good ending to the series.Entertainment value -
This movie is extremely entertaining family friendly fun. It's a wonderful way to set the stage for normal life to begin in the world. There once were dragons, but when the world couldn't handle them, it took them away. Until they could return peacefully again. I enjoyed it so much the ending was beautiful. I couldn't imagine a nicer way to end a movie especially since there were no cliffhangers.Educational value -
The big moral theme in this movie is that humans fight way too much. So much that ""dragons"" had to leave because there was no peace. And they will return when it becomes peaceful again. The point of the movie is to inspire peace in us all so that ""dragons"" can return. Of course there aren't really any dragons but still this movie hopes to bring a bit of peace to all of us.
Literary value -
The internal conflict was hiccup both ignorance and pride. Mostly ignorance, the pride comes from the fact that his father wanted him to protect his home and he wants to leave and find a better place to live with his people, but everyone else believes that he should stay and not give up there home that they have lived in for so long. In the end hiccup is right and the decision to leave turns out to be best. The ignorance comes from hiccup not knowing if he's making the right choices for his people and not knowing what to do without his dragon. He believes he's worthless without his dragon but really the truth is that hiccup is a strong brave leader and he has earned the right to be chief.It's a wonderfully formed movie that leaves nothing out. I couldn't think of a better ending myself I loved this movie. Thank you.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

529,piecakeslice,Satisfying overall but fails close inspection,7,8 July 2019,"This movie is incredibly satisfying if you are simply looking to end this series with a smile on your face. (Seriously it's adorable and worth it just for the last scene) However, I took issue with key details of the movie which could have been executed better. Often the film introduces themes and ideas that are never fully executed. For one they attempted character development without actually doing anything to develop the characters. The beginning of the movie brings up a great point that the characters don't rely enough upon each other and need to work together but never shows a deepening of intercharacter relationships or depth in any of the side characters. When the final battle rolls around, the characters sudden teamwork falls flat. With Hiccup they make the valid point that he feels like nothing without Toothless and needs to gain self confidence but don't do anything with it. They jump from oh he's insecure to hey he jumped off a cliff and saved the day without the crucial steps to get him from point A to point B. And the new villain felt like he came out of absolutely nowhere, hated dragons for no reason except he got glory when killing them (however there was an interesting duality between him and hiccup as he's what you get if hiccup made different choices) and is out of established lore. The fact that no one has EVER killed a night fury is essential to the plot of the first movie and is part of what made hiccup special and his subversion of expectation (befriending rather than being the first to kill) powerful. The looming question of what happened to all the night furies and why the suddenly disappeared was a huge driving force of the earlier movies. Having an evil dude who hunted them all for sport feels like a cop out and kills all intrigue of the night fury mythos. That being said the animation was gorgeous the score epic and the movie was touching and engaging as a whole so I still like the movie, I just wish more care was put into more subtle aspects of the storyline.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
530,joshuajones-59707,Perfect way to wrap up the trilogy,10,14 July 2019,"This movie is gorgeous, has amazing cinematography, lovably distinct characters, solid story telling, and amazing dragon design.My wife and I can't help but to laugh and smile when we watch these movies. The action is exhilarating and smooth. The three How to Train Your Dragon movies are Dreamworks' magnum opus in my opinion. I honestly have to question what people really want in life and entertainment in general if they don't consider this movie to be at least 8 stars, but for me, it's a solid 10.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
531,kathlarson,A great conclusion to a great trilogy,10,12 October 2019,"So much has already been said, but I'll say more anyway. How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a beautifully animated, funny, emotional conclusion to the How to Train Your Dragon trilogy. Now, why does it work so well? The drama is still compelling, the characters are still likable, Toothless is still the cutest thing ever made, and so on and so forth. There are a couple flaws in the story here and there, but they don't take much away from the overall experience, and still leads us to a very satisfying ending. Also, the soundtrack of this movie, just like the first two, is GODLY. Just listen to ""Exodus!"", ""Furies In Love"", and ""The Hidden World"" to see what I'm talking about. Trilogy cappers are notoriously tricky to get right, as the main goal is to at least be on par with the first two, and there are plenty of instances where it went horribly wrong. But this movie, while not quite as strong as the first two, is still on par with them. And that's why, at the end of the day, I gotta give this movie a big old 10 out of 10.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

533,icetealover-75115,I have never love 3 movies more in my life,10,25 January 2020,"For me the How to Train Your Dragon series are is some of the best movies of all time. I genuinely think it does the best job intertwining humans and dragons without being super cliché. The characters are incredibly well written and all the actors super talented. The animation has gotten better with time, in this final one it's so perfect that every shot is beautiful. One of the best features of the movies is that it matured with the audience. It grew up with the kids who watched the first movie and you got to see hiccup go through this changes and challenges. They have a fantastic soundtrack and do a phenomenal job at setting a very good emotional scene. Those movies were my childhood so I do have a big bias, I also love dragons to the ends of the earth. But I know a lot of people have seen the movies or at least seen the first one but no one really talks about it. I think it deserves more recognition for the amazing movies they are. If you haven't watched all three of those movies please do. I swear I was sobbing in the theater at the end of this movie. I could not stop myself from crying. I've never had a movie make me cry so hard. I had to make it as quiet as I could possibly make it before the credits rolled. As soon as the credits started I was a crying mess. I love those characters with all my heart. The people behind these films are amazing humans and I wish I could tell them how much their movies have helped me. They are imbedded in my childhood and life in a irreversible way. I can never thank them enough for making these movies. I'm sad to see it end but I couldn't ask for a better one. Thank you, thank you, thank you. :)",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
534,Burglar-Hobbit,A great final chapter,8,11 October 2020,"Simpler than the first two in terms of plot, but definitely a great ending to a wonderful series. There are obvious nods to the first movie and book series, which fans will appreciate. The animation is beautiful (among the best I've seen in any CGI film), and the already incredible soundtrack is taken to another level. Hiccup and Toothless' relationship is continued and wrapped up in the best way possible.

I think it would have been better if they had just given us a villain you could hate! Drago was terrific and terrifying! He hated dragons because they killed his family, and he used his hate to create an army of hatred. The real villain of the first movie was Hiccup's own family, caught in the old ways and the fear of the unknown and of dragons. And Grimmil? He's a guy who likes to kill things?Give us a better villain and I would have liked this movie way more. He's the Generic version of Viggo Grimborne from Race to the Edge. But Viggo had motive, he was a business man with an evil mind. Grimmil just likes to kill Night Fury's? Could have done better.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

549,denkena_dachshund,Ugh what a waste,5,31 March 2019,"Felt a very rushed ending to the trilogy. Sound track was non existent. Barely any humour. What also bugs me is that there is no clarification what species light fury is?! The director claimed that light furys are a sub species but Grimmel says i have a female and they mate for life but also In the same conversation he killed all the night furys, would it of killed them to clarify it even in a flashback, they had time to add another two lightfurys in the hiddenworld scene. Niether hiccup or astrid mention any differences infact notice her straight away as a female. The uae of the flashbacks, tho needed for the story they seemed rather random in there placement.
Seems rather rushed not finished as it should be still leaves me with answers, did they settle on the bew island? Go back to berk? Is grimmel actually dead? What about the dragon trappers? What about the other dragon riders in the series, do they give up there dragons too? Why are the babies miss marked colour?",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

551,Uadaya,How to Train Your Expectation,6,16 January 2019,"Don't expect much for this movie as I will rated this a 6 out of 10 star with how weak the execution of the story' itself. I will list the strength and weaknesses for this movie down belowStrength :1) The Animation and Graphics : the movement of the character's were smooth, the places that our protagonist visited were AMAZING, especially the hidden world itself (u will be mesmerized seeing it), the dragons were top notch (more detail, more colorful, and more numbers of diverse dragon)2) The Voice Actor : i truly enjoyed all of the voices for all characters in this movie, all of them can express their character's emotion beautifully! Definitely a top-notch casting choices!3) The Soundtrack : one of the best orchestra music went to when we saw the hidden world, it was chilling in a good way and was very mysthical at its best!Weaknesses :1) Story Concept : for me, it was weak. The first half of the movie was bland and unexciting. What i was dissapointed was the fact that it was full of unnecessary one-liner comedy between our protaganists. The director said that this movie was about ""letting go"" and i can see that, but in the end it failed. I didn't feel that MUCH emotion in Hiccup and Toothless goodbye scene, because the movie didn't give you the dramatic tension between them. The movie didn't show how SERIOUS and CONSEQUENCES their choices were for them and the world. They didn't give you much DEPTH of the story itself. The bond between Hiccup and Toothless was always spot-on, but it wasn't enough for me to cry at the end of the movie. I would prefer if they just focused more on the Berk tribe having struggle balancing life with dragons and showing the life and existance of The Hidden World itself. The antagonist didn't really add much meaning overall to the movie.2) The Antagonist : basically we have another Drago-clone but this time it's a dragon KILLER and not a HUNTER. When i saw the trailer i thought it was cool, but when i finally watched it..........it wasn't. Grimmer's character was very straight forward, we never saw his past, his history with Night Furry, so we never really understand 100% WHY did he HATE and KILLED almost the entire clan of Night Furry. His reason was weak. His ability to kill dragon were never really shown fully, his hundreds of army were meaningless and just there being a dresser. They were also this 3 Warrior-clothed-looking character that i didn't even remembered their name because of how unmemorable they were. Basically the antagonist characters were unnecessary in the first place.3) The Climax of the Fighting Scene : it was laughable (in a bad way), the fight were a joke to the characters, they didn't have any STRUGGLE AT ALL to finished off their enemy. It was like they were fighting off an 8 year old army. We don't even feel to root for our protagonist because the scene were never really SERIOUS to begin with. Even the fighting scene on HTTYD 1 & 2 were FAR BETTER than this sequel. On top of that every fight scene in this movie used a fun and upbeat music as the soundtrack, it was weird. It seems the filmmakers doesn't want us to take the fight seriously, if that true, then they delivered it well. The soundtrack were good but it was misplaced in the fighting scene, especially the climax.Overall, this movie is perfect for children, they would love the dragons and the joking parts. But for teenager and up or someone who loves a good movie, i don't recommend it. Probably it still worth your money one time to watch, but i think after watching it you would not think twice to not watch it again in theater. As a huge fan of HTTYD i was truly dissapointed, i prefer the first and second movie over and over again to this installment.I was expecting A LOT for this movie to be awesome, especially the premise of ""letting go"" and IS the final chapter of HTTYD trilogy, unfortunately they didn't deliver it well as the previous installment. This movie should have been more focused on the struggle between Hiccup and Toothless life to make a big change to their life and how they conclude their decision for each other friendship and Berk's life without dragon. They shouldn't create an antagonist whom didn't even have a strong background characterisation nor had huge impact to the story. This movie felt solely focused to kids audiences that they created a safe choice and execution for this. I understand it is based on children's book, but it doesn't give you any excuses to create a FINAL movie with story' that only gives the audiences more question than answers. Too many plotholes and inconsistency for me to handled.The title said ""The Hidden World"" but we only saw 10-15 minutes of that world itself. We never really learn how the dragon's life were like in there, how it was existing in the first place, why the place were full of colorful lights between stones, why the newborn dragon were emitting bright orange light, why
at the center of that Hidden World had a huge crystal stone, why Toothless SURVIVED from Grimmer's slaughtered in the past, how on earth that Grimmer can catch the Light Furry in the opening scene? We didn't even see why he can outrun the speed and camouflage from her. Basically the Hidden World were still a mystery place for us. We didn't get a chance to fully immerse ourselves to that world because the movie didn't allow us to feel it.In the end, you can watch it, it's not an AWFUL movie, but as a final trilogy of HTTYD it didn't deliver as smooth as i thought it would be. As a long-time fan of this franchise i was not satisfied by it. Well, at least when Hiccup and Toothless reunited and had their own family it was quite a touching moment :)",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

564,anne555,Dean doesn't let down. Incredibly fulfilling story.,10,22 February 2019,"I am a hard movie goer to impress and there is nothing I would change about this film. It is emotionally satisfying and tear-jerking for the last 1/3 of its run. Every scene, every moment is meaningful and impactful; there's no fat, nothing to cut out. Beautiful visuals, amazing soundtrack-once again.
What I love most is the mature themes it doesn't shy away from: change, growing up, letting go, love, loss, sacrifice. Hiccup's coming of age story is unlike any other. I love that he's imperfect, insecure, as he's still learning how to be chief and still needing of his fathers guidance because of that. He sometimes makes the wrong choices but he recognizes it and does what he must to fix them. His emotional journey is one to be remembered and one that will pave the way for movie trilogies and animations to come.
Particularly love the nods to the first movie. Some are more subtle than others which is perfect, letting the audience pick up the connection ourselves rather than hitting us over the head with it. The more obvious ones I immediately knew just how ingenuis it was (Forbidden Friendship goodbye, with his hand slipping away this time) and other references only came to me hours later, when the film was still in my mind, only then realizing what Dean had done with such well-crafted subtly (Hiccup losing his leg again at the end).
As soon as it was over, I immediately wanted to see it again.
Thank you, Dean. You've changed my life with this trilogy and particularly with The Hidden World.

576,fundayokari,Great movie horrible voice actor for hiccup,9,2 May 2020,I love the movie. It was well written and executed. But the voice of hiccup was horrible. Who thought it was a good idea to have a that voice actor as a the voice of a Viking?,How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
577,Dhiraj1,Left me Emotionally Raw - One of the Best Trilogies Ever Made!!!,10,2 February 2019,"This is my first review despite of being an avid IMDB visitor. This series has always been close to my heart as to how it balances all emotions and quality and appeals to all ages, and with this epic conclusion to one of the best movie series every made, i had to break the mould and write my first review!Yes the story has some blemishes and i felt bit disappointed at Valka, Eret and Gobber not having bigger roles than they had - considerably less than what they have had before and i was expecting even more than before! Some of the jokes from the side gang seemed forced and flat too but might work well for younger crowd!But those are nitpickings on an otherwise superb movie and masterpiece of a trilogy with an amazing story and overarching character development. I loved the moments between Toothless and Lightfury and also Hiccup and Astrid, they are sweet and lovable. However, as always the crux that keeps the whole franchise alive and close to fans hearts is Toothless and Hiccup together and boy these are golden moments as ever! Animation and music is topnotch and you feel fully immersed and the whole spectacle is just breathtaking! A solid villain too though he reminded me of alot of Drago!Do yourself a favour - Please watch all movies in order before seeing this one! Or if you have watched it before, please rewatch them and then go and see this!
I defy anyone who watches these 3 movies in order and isnt crying by the end of this movie - As Close to Perfection as it can get for an Animation Series!!!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

I had some problems the first 20 minutes with the script, it took some time to connect with the audience. But still the movie was amazing! Was emotional and had memorable moments!!!

583,mollymntgmr,NOT GOOD!!!!,1,27 February 2019,"In earnest, I could not be more disappointed with How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World. As a (former) fan of the previous two films, I expected a certain level of quality and nuance that the final film seemed to promise. In all facets, it left me disappointed. The story falls flat (with no character whatsoever) and the animation was unimaginative and one dimensionally. The plot unravels in the last 7 minutes and leaves the entire trilogy fatally undermined as a consequence. Do not waste your money.I will, in concession, that the soundtrack slaps.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
584,slushiepower,"Breathtaking, incredible and worth the wait.",9,6 February 2019,"I cannot explain to you how much this movie made me cry, it was ridiculous, I balled my eyes out at serval parts! However at times, I did feel like the movie was a bit rushed, trying to cram all of our wonders and questions, our wishes for the final movie, into just one hour. Within a flash the whole entire franchise is over, and still there are some questions that were yet to be answered. But I'd say this movie was definitely worth the wait! My bar was set very, very high on this movie as the finale, and I could definitely say that it was above my expectations.This movie definitely was the greatest finale, there wouldn't of been much that could've been added to make it any better. The ending was just pure heartbreak but also lovely. You could realise the love you had for the characters you'd known for 9 years, love for the story and fantasy world that was built.I believe they depicted how hard saying goodbye is to someone you love. It's hard, you feel like you're losing a huge part of yourself and everything gets just that bit more difficult without them. You have to adapt to a life without them anymore, without them being at your side. It's a cruel choice, but in the end you decide it's the best for both of you.I fell inlove with How To Train Your Dragon 9 years ago. And walking into the theatres 9 years later, and realising I'd have to say goodbye to the world that I love was definitely tough!To describe the ending in a more in-depth manner... it was beautifully presented and well thought out. At the very end when both Astrid, Hiccup and their children went to see Toothless, the Light Fury and their babies one last time, that was so heart touching. To see where the characters had come just one last time was just so nice. The fact that Hiccup showed his children how he befriended Toothless many years back was so nostalgic, and made me go back to see the first film.I am not able to put in words how beautifully animated, beautifully thought out, and how beautiful the ending was. I have absolutely no words to describe the movie. If you don't want this movie spoiled, try not to go through anymore spoilers, wait for the movie and you'll be just as surprised.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

As good as this was, from my point of view, it's still unable to beat the first sequel on the originality.

It's the epic conclusion that we needed and even though I mostly knew what could happen the end still wasn't predictable. I cried hard several times through the movie. The plot was great, the visuals were amazing and the feels... It's both for children and adults but it'll make the adults cry. You have to watch the first two movies though, or else it won't be as emotional. I wouldn't be lying if I was to say this is the best one in the series. Knowing DreamWorks's other third movies, they really did it with this one. It's definitely one of the best animations out there, if not the best.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
593,tahouraariana,The ending wasn't the best :/,6,21 January 2019,"I grew up with how to train your dragon and i was obsessed with the movies and the series. I love every character differently and everything about this show i loved. But i have to say I was really disappointed with the ending of how to train ur dragon 3. Don't get me wrong i still loved a lot of the movie and really loved how hiccup and astrid got married but the ending that annoyed me was when the dragons left their riders without any remorse.
The whole point of this movie/series was to show how dragons and humans can live together no matter the challenges, then this ending went against the whole thing. Specially when the dragons left their human without any grief or doubt. Sure they got a lil upset but not even close to how they should have really felt. The ending was really rushed and i think they could have done it in a better way. I mean after all the dragon and the human were basically each others half and lived together everyday for years and one day they just leave cause its what best for them?? Like hiccup tried so hard to live with the dragons and fight against the enemies and then just gives up!
They could have at least moved in with the dragons in the hidden world and got along with them.
Anyway im really sad my favourite movie/series has ended and even more upset it ended like that :/",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

595,blankeda,Brilliant trillogy ending with only minor setbacks,9,2 March 2019,"Overall this was an amazing movie with a heartwrenching, but satisfying conclusion. The animation was above and beyond and currently probably some of the best animation cinematography to date. The sound and music was once again fantastic, with John Powell once more proving himself to be one of the greatest Hollywood composers of our time. The story was good, but perhaps not as original and clever as the first and second one. The villian being the main issue. Although being charismatic and well characterised, the sense of a real threat was missing. Another issue I take with this movie are the sometimes very annoying side characters that most of the time just slow down the main story. I would have wished for more scenes with the villian instead of those characters. The chemistry between, hiccup, toothless and astrid is great however and the new found love interest for the dragon really serves for some great humor. All in all, this is a trillogy that did it right from the start and ended on a high note that should leave most fans perhaps a bit sad, but definatly satisfied aswell. The so far best movie series from dreamworks has come to an end, oh and what an epic finale it was....",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
596,tonifer,Disappointing end to the franchise - too many plot holes and inconsistencies with the Netflix series and the other movies,5,13 January 2019,"My review contains spoilers so be warned...Let me first say, I'm a big fan of this franchise - both the movies and the series on Nickolodeon and Netflix. I'm one of those people wondering why this series has to end when based on the Netflix series there are more stories to tell... I wonder if my dislike for this movie would have been less if I had not been watching the series on Netflix, because if you have been watching that series you will see why this movie ended with a big WTF for me. So what didn't I like in the movie?(1) The villain - I'm sorry but the villain in this one is just plain 'bleh'. Compared to the well-characterised villains in the TV series or even Drago in the second movie, this villain is just plain boring, cliche-ish and 2-dimensional. I would have preferred to see Drago returning. Frankly, I don't see what's so threatening about this villain. He has 2-4 dragons in his command. For all his cunning, is he really that threatening?(2) Plot holes and loose ends such as:
Why did Hiccup think it best to leave Burke? All throughout the Netflix series, they have managed to defeat so many different enemies, more menacing than the villain in this movie. And even if you haven't seen the series, Hiccup has this big declaration in the past movies of how strong their village was because of the symbiotic relationship they had with their dragons. I would have understood better if they were being challenged by Drago coming back with a bigger arsenal of dragons, but nope. Just a hunter with two dragons and other dragon trappers with none.I can understand why Toothless was Alpha outside the Hidden World, but how in the world did he establish being the alpha in the Hidden World after being there for a few days? There is no other Alpha there? In the first movie, there was a queen dragon, in the second two male alphas, but NOT A SINGLE one in the Hidden World??? For real?At the beginning of the movie, Hiccup mentioned they were trying to set dragons free from other trappers. But yet in the end, he lets their village's dragons free to join Toothless in the Hidden World. So what about all the other dragons he hasn't set free yet? The movie indicated there were other trappers out there. So how could they save those other dragons, if they have no more dragons to work with? And what if there are other groups of dragons under different alphas, which could be enslaved? Drago could technically still be out there...Younger dragons are known not to follow the alpha's call. This was strongly emphasised in the second movie. So how could all the dragons follow Toothless???(3) Inconsistencies with the TV series
The TV series have painstakeningly tried to be consistent with the first and second movies, even showing how Hiccup's dad got the dragon he had in the second movie and how Hiccup's mother ended up being with the white alpha dragon in the second. So it just boggles my mind how this 3rd movie completely ignored everything established in the series such as:(A) all the allies Hiccup made with other villages with their own dragons (eg an island completely relying and worshipping a dragon protecting it from a volcano) - couldn't Hiccup call on these other allies for help in this movie as he done so in the series?
(B) other islands they discovered with other dragons and other dragon species, including big ones under the sea which I doubt could live in the Hidden World.
(C) the mysterious island where dragons go to die(4) Fishlegs, Tuffnut and Ruffnut and Snotlout hardly had any lines in this movie. A bit disappointing given how great they are giving LOL moments in the movie. I also noticed the difference in Tuffnut's voice and discovered that TJ Miller who had been voicing the character in the movies and in the Netflix series wasn't voicing the character for this finale - a bit disappointing as he made the character really funny. Just as well the character was hardly used in this movie.(5) Battle scenes - too dark and chaotic and over too quickly. I also wonder, with no dragons, Hiccup and his crew manage to defeat their enemies and rescue Toothless and the other dragons so quickly. One would wonder, why did he decide to leave Burke the home they established for centuries and not make a stand in the first place if the enemies were that easy to beat???Overall, the only things I liked in the movie was the animation - truly great and better than previous movies. Too bad it got wasted in a storyline that had too many plot holes, inconsistencies and a disappointing ending. Note that I knew the ending BEFORE I saw this movie as I read the screenwriters who adapted this series from the books said they were going to end it in the same way the book series ended. While I appreciate they didn't make the ending as sad as the book series, I'm quite disappointed they didn't make the ending more consistent with the universe they created.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
597,icelandpuffin97,A captivating way to end a journey between a boy and his dragon,10,10 January 2019,"I've been a fan of How to Train Your Dragon movies since I was 12 years old, but I never had a chance to watch them in theaters. Only when the movies came out in the internet I could experience them. As I heard that this movie is the last, now that I'm 21 and get a job, I'm looking forward to see it. And I didn't regret it, every piece of frame.
How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is an awesome, breathtaking emotional ride. It's an epic finale to an epic adventure that will bring one litre of tears to your eyes, with its important message of growing up, accepting realities, and letting go. Not kidding, I was like the only one crying in theatres when Toothless departed with his girl and the other dragons, and I didn't even bothered to hide it because the emotion I feel was raw, a result of saying goodbye to a series I love the most, and the message they brought was so relatable. I've never had that time in my life when I find animated movie becomes so relatable since Disney's Lilo and Stitch, Pixar's Up, and Toy Story 3. Well, Bonnie Arnold was also the producer of Toy Story, and I think that's why this movie reminds me so much of Toy Story 3. It has a sad ending, but it will bring you happy memories when you think about it.
I'll have to disagree with many reviews about the villain, Grimmel, saying he's uninteresting and one-dimensional. Actually, Grimmel is more like a mysterious character that you want to hear more, and makes you guessing while at the same time, you spend the rest of the movie hating him. The villain Grimmel might not another Lotso or Drago Bludvist, but he's pretty much psychotic in nature. He's like a classic Disney villain who doesn't have any reason or motivation to do his evil thing; and can be charismatic in such ways. You cannot sympathize with him, and that's what he wants. He captures dragons for excitement, while, not to mention manipulates them to obey his command. A typical animal abuser you don't want to forgive for the rest of your life. In addition, he serves as a projection of Hiccup's dilemma, and makes him realize that the more dragons live in Berk, the more threatened the lives of his people, and family. Sure, the main story about this movie focuses about Hiccup accepting his duty as a chief, but I want something more from Grimmel. I think a backstory involving him and Stoick, or maybe Drago in the past could be a great build-up for his character. A comic book miniseries could be a better choice to develop his complexity.
However, I really love that this movie also highlights its side characters, for example Ruffnut and Tuffnut. They started as typical stock characters in the first two movies, always fighting and bragging, but as the series progressed, with the help of animated series, they're finally shown to have personalities of their own, like Tuffnut's desire of having beard and his attempt to give Hiccup a pep-talk, or Ruffnut's talkative, care-free nature which annoys the heck of the villain. Also, the movie shows you the rivalry of Snotlout and Eret for Valka's attention, although it doesn't have anything to do with with the plot, it makes you kinda feel bad for Snotlout, as he wants acknowledgement from people just like Hiccup, and feels overshadowed by Eret's presence. Personally, I think the movie didn't have time to develop his character because its main focus is Hiccup and Toothless, but that's forgivable since... well... it would've worked for a miniseries than a 104 minutes long movie.
Gerard Butler as Stoick the Vast in flashback scenes are great additions. He only appeared like five minutes but he serves as Hiccup's moral compass throughout the movie. Butler did a great job with his character, and you can see it through his advice to Hiccup and his thought about Hiccup's mother in the past. Whenever he appeared in Hiccup's thought, the lines he spoke always brought tears to my eyes.
Despite its flaws, if you grew up like How to Train Your Dragon like me, you'll find this movie a satisfying garnish to your childhood. And like I said before, you'll never regret watching it in theaters. Thank you, Dean DeBlois, for the love and effort that you and your team put into this movie. Also John Powell, I salute you as one if the best composers in the world, next to Hans Zimmer, James Horner, Howard Shore, and John Williams.
I can say five years is worth the wait. How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World is a masterpiece, a love letter to fans, and it should never let to be consumed by the masses like the other animated movies. And now, it's time to let the series go. It's time to fly on your own.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

After a long journey the main characters grew up but still got his issue. It's a journey for a boy to grow as a man. It's time to learn what is life, what is love and what is yourself. Movie scene is beautiful, some people said bored for some scences, but I felt peaceful to watch the hidden world - natural beauty.

But this film is a masterpiece perfectly made and worth the 5 year long wait. We started with film 1 where were introduced to Hiccup, Toothless and co. Film 2 shows the change after 5 years and the hidden world is set 1 year afterwards. I'm not bullshitting when I say this but as a 16 year old who grew up with this franchise I obviously got emotional but regardless of me, I strongly believe if you're considering this film and you don't know httyd you will still be moved.Adventure-action packed emotionally touching lesson about love is the most important thing in our world but sometimes you have to let go.

it lacks the drama and suspense of the epic battle scenes with the huge impressive alpha dragons from the first two instalments, and the battle scenes are getting a little tired, with them able to avoid all projectiles while flying and/or escape after getting captured (again). it just doesn't feel like the characters or concept have developed much.the focus on this instalments is more about developing love story, for Hiccup, Astrid and also for toothless. there are lots of feel good moments but it gets a little soppy towards the end. although looking at other reviews, it appeals to plenty of people.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

612,alliyahbal,"Absolutely stunning display of friendship, leadership, romance, courage and so much more...!",9,3 January 2019,"Walking into this film I had very high expectations.The first movie, I'd watched when I was about 8 years old and I fell in love with the characters and the world behind Vikings and dragons. It was a movie in my childhood that I admired and loved, as well as the rest of my family.The second movie, I'd also watched in the cinema as soon as it came out and it also touched strings in my heart and I loved it as well. I was around 12. Though it didn't quite surpass it's predecessor, it was certainly at the same the level of brilliant animation and story-telling of ancient Norse culture and myths.Therefore this third movie needed to at least live up to the previous two, if not be better! And I was blown away with the phenomenal graphics, overall plot which was cleverly woven with both child and adult humour. It mixes enough action and battle scenes to get you hyped up, while making you laugh with great one-liners from each character, then it will fill your heart with beautifully choreographed animations of the dragon culture and the friendship between Hiccup and Toothless, and it will even make you teary-eyed for the love of these characters.This movie especially, in my opinion, is one of the best animated movies (up there with Toy Story, Coco and Loving Vincent); not just because of the success the series had had - but I was overly impressed with the development of the characters and it almost feels as though I, myself, grew up alongside Hiccup, Toothless and the rest of Berk. From watching the first movie when I was 8, and watching the third and now I'm 16 - it really felt like a second home.This movie is absolutely incredible to watch for all audiences as it plays with important social and personal themes. The reason why it's not a 10/10 is because it made me cry so bad, I was sobbing even after I left the theatre!100% worth your money and I might even",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
613,alicemingasson,The most beautiful end of the most beautiful journey...,10,5 June 2020,"I watched the first HTTYD years ago, and I always admired that love and trust between Hiccup and Toothless, and how they would go through everything, every danger together. I fell in love with that last one because there is still that unbreakable bond between these two friends, even if they end up separating, and it's so emotional and beautiful at the same time. And I'm really sad that some people are disappointed by this end... To me, this is the best end they could make: Toothless and Hiccup both found their place, and they're both happy where they are, even if they're now far away from each other. Plus this doesn't mean it's the end of their friendship: even after ten years of separation, they never stopped loving each other!

614,benoevans,Perfect Ending,10,3 February 2019,"STORY SPOILERS START ONLY HALFEAY THROUGH: FIRST HALF IS SPOILER FREE!!!I've grown up on this movie series, it is my childhood.I remember when I was roughly around 4 years old and me and my dad went to go see the first movie. I was obsessed with it. As I got older that obsession stayed with me.
Me and my dad then went to see the second movie as soon as it came out and I loved it so much.I waited for the third movie to come out ever since the second one. I was a bit sad when I found out the Hidden world would be the finally bit that changed when I saw the movie.This movie is the best. It is perfectly placed and the characters are the same loveable ones I remember.
The story is so week thought out and amazing. It fits on perfectly with the previous 2 and concludes the trilogy amazingly.The animation is also outstanding. They have: water, hair and sand all at the same time and it looks great. The characters all move humanly and look stunning.
Just like the animation the cinematography is yet again outstanding. Each shot shows what needs to be seen and shows the emotion that characters are going through. Yet again like previous movies the flying shots are brilliant and ahead of their time due to the fact they move around the character like an actual camera.Back to the story.
SPOILERS BELOW!!!
The begging scene where the gang are saving dragons is great and shows what our beloved heroes are now doing.They have great scene changes like when they introduce us to the villian and Hiccups memories with his Dad.Even though it was sad, it's great how realistic the solution is when the Villian attacks Berk and every flees to a new Island in search of the hidden world. They don't stay put and try to fight, they realise their problem and move.The scenes with Toothless and the Lightfury are great because they show what is going to happen later on in the movie. Toothless settles down with her.The drama between Hiccup and the Lightfury is so sad to watch because it brings realisation to the characters and the audience that the dragons can't stay with the berkians and keep running forever, they need to be free.When the main Villian captures Toothless and the Lightfury it caused the most dramatic scene in this series because their were so many times that our favourite characters could have died.Though luckily hiccup frees Toithless from his trap and chase after the main Villian who is riding the Lightfury. Hiccup then decides to jump if Toothless and to glide over the the Villian. Which works for him, barely because his wing gets ripped from and crossbow shot form the villian, luckily he lands on the Lightfury, but Toithless gets shot and is now falling from the sky to the sea.
So Hicxup is holding onto the mask on the Lighgury which the Villian was using to control her. The Villian is holding onto Hiccups torso. Hiccup does the only thing he can and breaks of the mask and tells the light duty to save Toithless which she does. But now Hiccup is falling to his death fighting the Villian who tore of his wings.
This falling scene seriously made me sad since I started to think that they were about to kill of Hiccup. And I started to get worried. Luckily the ligytfurys puts Toothless on land and saves hiccup before he hits the water. The Villian falls into the water behind hiccup to his death.After this Hiccyp and the gang get to land with all the dragons. Hiccup explains to Toothless that he understands that he was always making a world that he wanted and not what the dragons wanted. So he says he ubderstands that the dragons must leave. So everyone else takes of the saddles if their dragons and let them be free, after they all cry and give their dragons hugs.
Toithless stays behind a bit longer and satnds on his back legs and hugs Hiccup. This scene was the most emotional and sadest scene. I knew it was coming but it still hit me. I'm still sad thinking about it.So after all this Hiccup and Astrid get married which is an extremely happy scene. The wedding ends with them staring of where all their dragons left them obviously a few months before since it's now snowing.Then we get a time jump. Hiccup has a beard now and he and Adtrid have had 2 kids. They are ok a boat outside the Hidden world, where the dragons fled to, and there is Toothless and the lightfury with their 3 kids. Toothless comes over to their boat and recognises them and the movie ends with all of them flying. Hiccup on Toothless' back with his son and Astrid on Stormflys back with their daughter. This scene was so happy and a great ending. Even better about it was that Hiccup was narrating about how the dragons are in the planet and waiting for when humans and dragons can get along, and that berkians will keep their secret, and that every eruption and earthquake is the dragons aksing are we ready.This movie was the best yet and the absolute perfect ending to this amazing series. It couldn't of been done better.
It was extremely sad and extremely happy with it's ending.
The ending was so good because we have followed Hiccup and Toothless through their Journeys and now we have to say goodbye.I love this series so much since they care so much about their fans and the story. I love that no moreovies are being made and this is it for the trilogy.Now I want to thank DreamWorks for this series that I have grown up on. This series is my childhood and I can't believe how lucky I am to have grown up with it. It is bringing tears to my eyes as I write this thinking of the adventures we have been through with our beloved heroes, all the hard times and happy time. All plot twist and endings.
This trilogy is part of me now and I could not ask for a better series to of been brought up on. This series is the best movie series I have ever watched and will always, no matter what be in my heart. When I have a tough time I each or just think got his series because it's brings pure Joy to me. I can not thank the director, voice actors, animators, music composers or DreamWorks enough for this series.
But to put simply:Thank you DreanWorks for my childhood.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

The effect were as amazing as ever and the ending was perfect!However, here is where my criticism starts. The conflict in this movie was not very well done. The main villain was not developed whatsoever. Stoick (Hiccups dead dad) had probably just as much screentime in flashbacks as the villain did. There were a few hints potentially giving him a bigger purpose, but weren't developed. It was a movie that like the first one tried to be a person vs society conflict, but included a main villain. Overall his presence felt redundant. But, this was the only criticism I had. The ending was probably the most beautiful ending I have seen in a long time!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

622,thecritic-90437,How to train your dragon the hidden world review,8,6 February 2019,"How to train your dragon the hidden world is the third and the final installment of dreamworks's adventure series about dragons.Visual
how to train your dragon the hidden world is a visual feast for the eyes. from dragons that are individually unique and real to the hidden world that is vibrant, beautiful, brilliant in one word stunning.Story
the story isn't going to blow someones mind but it's good. it's compelling and concludes this large series almost perfectly. but one big issue with the stroy is that it's feels too much similar to previous installments. and i'm not a fan of this film's comedy. i was not a fan of comedy of two previous movies but in this film, it's worse. but i mean comedy is a very subjective thing so it might be funny for you. also more childish than the previous films. don't get me wore the story is good and it's a almost perfect conclusion but it is not great.Characters
the bond between hiccup and tooothless was the strongest element in the series and it is also true for this movie. but in this movie there is also another relationship for toothless, a light fury. it gives some nice romance vives. as for hiccup and toothless it's hard to explain without spoiling something but let's just say it's perfect. the villain of this movie, Grimmel the Grisly feels like a genuent threat unlike two previous villains.Music
i really liked the music in two previous films but this film's music is a bit disappointing. it doesn't do something new and it feels like it's just a remixed version of the two previous film's music. i mean it isn't bad (it's actually pretty good in certain points) but it's just underwhelming.End
how to train your dragon the hidden world is a almost perfect conclusion to the highly anticipated series with its amazing visuals, compelling story that rather feels repetitive and wonderful well developed characters.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

We saw the gang when they're children and now we see the gang as they're finally grown as adults and everything wrapped up nicely. This movie is both heartbreaking and heartwarming. It's sad to see there's an end of the dragon riders age, to see there comes a day where hiccup and the gang have to pace forward without their dragons. However it's also delightful to see the whole Berk evolved into the Berk it is at the end-the final decision that have to be made is logical and the plotline concluded beautifully. Honestly as a fan I'm not disappointed. Personally even, I think this is the best installment within the trilogy. Also the animation works are at its greatest.

A heartwarming story and hilarious scenes. Heros and kings are men and men a just dumber than women, the girls always save the day!!!!
And boys, the best way to impress a lady is not to dance (please!) just be yourself, do what you love most - or just draw your silly face like Toothless. She will like that!
The attention to details is just spot on showing equality in every little bit ie how Hiccup's children are featured and how they swapped kids so both can have a ride. And how the boy is just a little more sensitive than the girl. Love how they kept Hiccup & Toothless disabilities and turn them into their strength. Great lessons kids and grown-ups!!!
Also Toothless was the last one to leave, sentiments and all but also shown that he was a true leader. The leader of the pack like in wolves always the last one to watch out for the rest.
The only thing is that Toothless love story took most screentime so not much was said about the villain but, do we complain? Absolutely not!

The logic in the movie is as complex as the film "" Mission Impossible"" and the action resembles many military movies and some of the action actually reminds you of Just Cause.

633,xxdragonawsxx,Amazing movie to wrap up this trilogy!,10,5 January 2019,"With the two past films and series, How to Train Your Dragon the Hidden World lives up to its expectations of being a very successful and being an extraordinary movie.Throughout the instalments of How to train your Dragon the themes of it were always friendship, courage and teamwork as well as having useful messages for young children. The Hidden World also does this.The ending of the movie with the two best friends spreading apart from each other without a fight, so that they can go and live with their loved ones for their own safety and care, shows that you can always move on and that connections with people you love never change.This movie had great emotional complexity with Hiccup struggling to be a leader and believing in himself while also thinking about how they can keep themselves and the dragons safe. Toothless, who struggles to fit both the Light fury and Hiccup In his life. Astrid and Valka mainly focus on getting Hiccup to believe that he is something without Toothless and that Toothless didn't change his personality but he only made it ""easier"". Astrid also brings in the romance element and Valka brings in the family one. The other characters like Gobber, Tuffnut, Ruffnut, Fishlegs, Snotlout and Eret play a vital role in making the film humorous and fun. The new villain Grimmel is a very smart villain, smarter than the Riders have ever faced. He gives a good challenge to the Riders and makes the film fast pace and he makes sure that the film never stops. Stoick, also manages to come into this film during the flashbacks that Hiccup remembers about moments in his youth when his father was talking about the legend of the Hidden World and how much love means to us.One of the best parts of the film was the nostalgia and links that it made to the first one. They did this by using lines and actions that were used in the first one including the famous: ""what are you going to do about it?"" that we got in the first film. Also this film had parallels with the four most important characters which are : Hiccup, Astrid, Toothless and the Light fury. Hiccup and Toothless share a similar personality as well as Astrid and the Light Fury who symbolise the strong and stubborn people who find it hard to adapt to vitality different concepts like the one where people and dragons can live together in harmony. Astrid and the Light Fury are the ones who are able to keep people together. Also, they used actions like Hiccup falling like he did at the end of the first movie and then the Light Fury saving him in the exact same way that Hiccup and Toothless saved Astrid from the Red Death in the first movie.The film also had amazing graphics that were vibrant and colourful and showed off the Viking world wonderfully. The soundtrack was amazing as always and we also were able to hear the classic themes of the last two films.For a 104 minute movie the characters also go through growth in accepting that not all things last forever and for there and the dragons safety it's best that they split apart.Although it took 9 years to complete the How To Train Your Dragon franchise this film was well worth the wait. It is fun, fast paced, exciting, romantic and also had a lot of nostalgia and emotional moments. It is rare for animations to have the characters have such amazing character arcs and density that this film has. In my opinion this film is one of the best animated movies every made.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
634,magictyron,Stunningly Beautiful Finale,10,5 January 2019,"I promise not to spoil the film below.
This film is both emotionally and visually beautiful. The film took a good five years to produce and you can see every second of it was put to good use. The plot is outstanding, and works perfectly as a third chapter for this trilogy. The character has completed some of the most outstanding growths in what I'd consider to be films as a whole. Getting to watch these characters grow from children to adults has been one of the most realistic experiences I've ever seen put to film. This movie is amazing, now go watch it!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

The characters develop so much through the film and the meetings set behind the movie are so relatable.This is the best animated movie ever created be far, and I would recommend it to all kids and adults alike, as well as being fast paced and intense it brings out themes of humour and love.This movie's sparks the inner childhood dream of dragons being real in very persons hearts and soul.

The movie is engaging, a little slow to start, but once it gets moving, I was totally engrossed. We have a despicable new villain, some pleasant advancements in minor characters, growth for both of our lead characters, undiscovered magic, romance, laugh out loud moments, moments worthy of applause, a testing of friendship, and a moment of pure nobility and fear.

I wanted to sob in the middle of the theatre.In all seriousness however, it was absolutely brilliant. This movie is jam-packed with important life lessons about what it means to sacrifice for love and how to adapt to dramatic change. Humor and action nicely balance out the intense emotion of the movie. The visuals are as stunning as ever, and if you enjoyed the scenery from the second movie, this one almost puts that to shame.Although this movie isn't the idealistic blissful kind of story that most animated movies are, it is bitter-sweet and relatable to life. After watching it, I knew that this was how the conclusion was always meant to be. It left me with intense melancholy, but also satisfaction. There was nothing, in my opinion, that could have made this movie more perfect.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

The reason I gave this an 8 is because of the villain, I felt the like the villain was too weak for this film and if the how to train your dragon 2 villain was in this film then it would be a menacing villain and suitable
villain , I felt like it was too easy, They should have stretched the PG mark to the limit and include a better villain more menacing, something like Thanos but PG rated and less extreme. Apart from that I liked this film and this is a good example of how the last film should be made, the third film of every film is usually the last one and is quite bad. The matrix 3 was an example. But they nailed this, Good work dreamworks, I wonder what they are gunna do now. They definitely made it certain that this would be there last film.And idea for a sequel would be a master villain that captures all dragons in the area And the children of both parties have to work together to save them. that would be interesting, this could be a good series",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

After I saw the second movie, I could not wait to see the epic conclusion as to how they going to end the series. Oh boy did it worth the wait.
I am a grown 30 year old man and I was in tears for a good 10 or so minutes after the movie ended.I am happy and sad at the same time that the series has concluded. Without any spoilers, all I am going to say is that the last installment ended on a way that it was kind of what we can expect.I would give it 15 stars if i could. Definitely worth a watch!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

673,adove-24615,The Worst Film of the Trilogy,3,22 February 2019,"First, I'd like to say that I am a HUGE HTTYD fan (I even have a Toothless tattoo and a massive collection of HTTYD merch!), but this film just left me feeling disappointed.The good:
The animation was STUNNING. By far the most gorgeously rendered animated film I have ever seen.The voice acting was stellar. Jay Baruchel killed it again, and the villain was phenomenally done.This film had some of the best humor of the films.The bad:
The story itself was very boring. The movie ended up feeling longer than it was, and it never seemed to find its momentum.-The way the story was told was fragmented and choppy.
They tried to cram too much in, so nothing got the time it needed/deserved. Every storyline felt rushed and empty.The whole movie was centered around the writer/director's need for a gut-punch ending...A fact that robbed the movie of any greatness it could have had. The vision was lost and the focus was off. Instead of a magnificent film (like the first two), it played out more like someone's bad fanfiction.The relationships that were built in the first two films and the shows were all but ignored in this movie. Most especially the relationships between Toothless/Hiccup, as well as Hiccup/Astrid. I felt like what we saw in this film only served to ruin what the past films had created. Examples: Toothless basically abandons Hiccup without saying goodbye at one point in the film and ONLY comes back to Hiccup through necessity (to save Hiccup and Astrid when they enter the Hidden World). Toothless ultimately abandons Hiccup for a dragon he doesn't know - which is not at all in line with the Toothless from the first two films OR the TV series. Astrid refuses Hiccup's hand in marriage several times, and it actually feels like she doesn't care for him.The score for this movie was the weakest of the trilogy. The only shining moments were call-backs to the original soundtrack.The villain is wasted. Even in scenes that you know are supposed to be suspenseful, you're left feeling bored.The ending didn't feel right. As someone who LOVES these movies - probably more than anyone - the fact that I didn't cry when the dragons left was a huge deal. I felt nothing.In the end, you leave the theatre feeling punished rather than rewarded.Ultimately, this film weakened the trilogy as a whole. It even managed to cool my nearly decade-long rabid love for the franchise. And though I will always consider the first film to be my all-time favorite movie, The Hidden World will remain one of my greatest film disappointments.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
674,fatboy-34269,Beautiful heartfelt adventure,10,23 February 2019,This was a saga I liked not loved but was so happy with this one it seemed to be the best part of the saga to me so much action fun humor and heart such a sweet movie very entertaining my only word of advice is be careful with small kids as the movie is intense and could frighten them,How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
675,G_TML,A beautiful end to a fantastic series,10,24 February 2019,"The movie was an absolutely wonderful film to watch. This film, for anyone who is familiar with the HTTYD franchise is a must see. The storyline has been well written, combined with the stunning visual effects and epic music score, it is a truly beautiful finale.

YOU NEED TO WATCH THIS MOVIE!!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
677,durielgalvez,Disappointing,6,24 February 2019,"In brief: this third part of the series lacks of the basics that made HTTYD 1&2 such a good movies, which is the magic of the relationship between Hiccup and the Nighfury. The first gets the best out of the second, and viceversa. Together, they become the Viking King and the Dragon Alpha. They complement each other. Instead, in this third film, Hiccup has become a wonderful fighter and the Nightfury can even fly alone. Come on... they even admit that Hiccup doesn't need the Nightfury! Hello Dreamworks, this is not a story about Hiccup the hero, but about the understanding of two worlds, about friendship, about shared leadership... all lost for My Little Pony LightfuryAnd can anyone tell me where is Toothless the reckless fighter? The same toothless that amuses us with his amazing powers capable of destroying a Mega Dragon... in this third movie he doesn't even fight, he just tries to make funny jokes while seducing My Little Pony Lightfury.And why exactly does the nightfury know how to get to the Hidden World but has never lead the dragons before? They need Hiccup to tell them to go? They never wanted to come back before? Let's assume they are lost and only a human could make them think about going back (which is ridiculous), why didn't Hiccup's father thought about finding the Hidden World after they domesticated the dragons in the end of the first movie? Oh wait...Let alone the poorly executed end of the villain, the fact that the hidden world is just presented very briefly... and many other things that the users here have reviewed already very well.And at the last act, they realized the villain has trucked them down and they are being followed because Hiccup's mother goes to find it out, but later on the we see that the whole fleet is actually very close to the Island, so why they didn't see it before?Disappointing.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
678,colinhudsonusa,Incredible and Stunning - Speechless,10,24 February 2019,"It is very rare that after seeing a movie I am taken a back and speechless but this was one of those movies. I watch hundreds upon hundreds of movies and this one took the crown. Closing up the How To Train Your Dragon Series in the most perfect of ways. Most movies with sequels tend to not wrap up their stories well but Universal and DreamWorks did a tremendous job with this series. To not spoil the movie, the heartwrenching moments, action, romance, conflict, battles, and coming of age issues were intertwined so well with the entire story line and just played out in the most unsuspected ways. The entire writing and story was just incredible and unpredictable in the best of ways. This movie has some incredibly deep and moving moments, if you've been watching this series since the first film came out your going to be speechless when you leave the theatre and want to go back to see it again and again. I have never given a film a 10/10 on any review but The Hidden World is a 10/10 movie that closes out the best mythical animated series ever produced, the jokes and action intertwined allow parents and children to enjoy. I started watching this series when I was 10 or 11 now I'm 20 and still absolutely loved it. Romance, Action, Deep Moments, Deep Decisions, etc. Best Movie Ever, and you have to see it. I recommend seeing the first two movies first.Incredible and Stunning - Speechless.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
679,xluiishd,A beautiful and emotional finale to the best series!,10,26 February 2019,"I have been waiting for this movie for years because I became a huge fan when the first one came out which was nearly 9 years ago. I am 17 years old now and I watched this movie on Sunday and I was a bit nervous because I mean I literally love this series and I didn't want to be disappointed. I knew there was going to be emotional scenes but I literally told myself that I wasn't going to cry and guess what? I started tearing up towards the end of the movie. The Light Fury really got Toothless attention and so he always wanted to be with her because he obviously fell in love with her! The thing I didn't like was how fast the scenes were going by! I also really regret watching the trailers because that made this movie so predictable for me. The saddest scene to watch for me was when Hiccup and Toothless said goodbye to each other and when toothless hugged Hiccup!!! I teared up in that scene!!! I also feel like the last scene could've been better and it should've showed all the characters in berk reuniting with the dragons but that didn't happen. I'm also not a fan of the ""hidden world"" like that's kind of dumb especially because this is the last movie and why would all the dragons live there if it's literally the last movie so that means they won't be in danger no more!!! It was so nice to see Hiccup and Astrid get married. It all makes sense though I mean all the characters have grown up and the dragons and vikings have been looking out for each other for a while now so I guess it was time to move on and the dragons have a real home now. I had hope that there would be a httyd 4 until the final scene showed that Hiccup and Astrid had kids and so did Toothless and the Light Fury :'( it's beautiful but sad to see this series come to an end! Httyd will always be my favorite movie series and it will always be in my heart! All I can really do now is just keep watching these movies over and over again and NO IT DOESN'T GET BORING! Really appreciate the creator and dreamworks for really making the best series EVER! If this movie doesn't get an Oscar then I might kill someone...i'm jk but still tho it better get an Oscar!",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

681,naomigmarkley,Had Potential but didn't use it all,6,9 June 2019,"I personally liked this movie a lot, my main issue, however was the villain. They put him in there for the sake of a villain, no memorable and unique character traits or flaws. In other words, the story would be fine if he wasn't there. Another issue that is mainly my nitpicking nature is the ""Nightlights""(Toothless and the Light Fury's hatchlings). In the movie they stated that the Light Fury is a female Night Fury. How would that work. Genetics don't work like that. If it were actually a female Night Fury then the male babies would be Night Furies and the females would be Light Furies. Just a thought.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
682,travisbittel,"The Least Impressive of the Series By Far, But Still Enjoyable",7,28 February 2019,"Even with the touching ending, this film stands well below its predecessors in terms of story, comedy, and overall enjoy-ability. The amount of time devoted to unneeded and often downright annoying dialogue from Hiccup's ilk should have definitely been spent developing the villain or helping the emotionally charged ending scene hit a bit closer to home.I found myself so annoyed with the ""funny"" moments that I was longing for more scenes between Toothless and the Light Fury - and not for the right reasons. The romance between the two is interesting and, if you are in the right mood, enchanting. The focus on their relationship, however, comes at the cost of less time between Astrid and Hiccup, with their relationship being mostly relegated to a strange and unnecessary secondary plot-line of the village pressuring them to marry and to giving Hiccup the motivation he needs to waltz in and defeat the villain without his team even breaking a sweat.What hurts the most is that this film has no shortage of brilliant inspiring moments (Ala Forbidden Friendship, Flying With Mother, Stoic's Ship, etc. from the previous films) but they are so drowned out in half-hearted attempts at comedy that they fail to make me feel as invested as the other two absolutely masterful films did.Even with all of that, the scene in which Hiccup willingly sacrifices himself to save Toothless hits like a truck; it's just a shame that the first part of the movie leading up to it is meh - with no real feeling of tension between heroes and villain. The goodbye scene hits equally hard, but again: there isn't the trauma in the first half to make it feel as major as it should have.As a brief aside, the music in this film pales in comparison to its predecessors - it seems unbelievable that John Powell could make two full films of unprecedented genius and then sort of ""let it slide"" in the third.Overall, the messages and themes - most poignantly, the theme of human greed and violence forcing the dragons away - elevate this movie to a high status, just not on par with the sheer brilliance that came before it.Oh, and don't be surprised to cry at the end - it's every bit as emotional as other reviewers have made it out to be.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World

Most movie series don't get the ending they deserve, but this one did, and I'm glad.From the bottom of my heart I say thank you to this series, to Hiccup and Toothless, to Astrid and Stoick, to Gobber and Snotlout and Fishlegs and Ruffnut and Tuffnut.

The theme of reunion with the nature, with dragons is so amazing and wishful, that I was dreaming about that world when I was leaving the cinema. All our favorite characters are almost adult, they are growing, there are driving the dragons even better and they must leave them at once, because the most dangerous predators on the earth are..people..but they are, somewhere, hidden, until the humankind is ready. I love it, the movie provocs dreams and thoughts, inspiration, and I've already downloaded all the beautiful music. Highly recommendable.",How to Train Your Dragon - The Hidden World
