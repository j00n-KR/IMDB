0,MartinHafer,Wow...talk about uneven!,5,20 October 2021,"""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" is a frustratingly uneven film. It's made up of six stories all set in the old west and the problem is that the tone and quality of the six segments varies widely. The first is, by far, the best and most interesting...and the only one that has anything to do with Buster Scruggs. The segments about the limbless man seems, to me, to be the most pointless and cruel. And the rest all fall somewhere in between. It's also very odd, as the first segment was completely comedic...sort of like a Roy Rogers or Gene Autry film with a sociopathic singing cowboy. But, oddly, most of the rest aren't funny in the least. Because of this, I just felt very frustrated as I watched....it just seemed incoherent overall. I would have much preferred if the first segment had been stretched out to a feature-length film....that would have worked for me. But overall, it just didn't work....with segments ranging from 10 to 2 in score.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
1,SnoopyStyle,Coen anthology western,6,7 December 2018,"The first part has a chipper Buster Scruggs (Tim Blake Nelson) who turns out to be a deadly gunslinger. Nelson is such an odd choice for a gunman which only highlights the comedic surrealism of the Coens. It sets a great tone for the rest of the movie.A nameless cowboy (James Franco) gets caught in a bank robbery. He's strung up to hang when the posse is massacred by Indians. He's left to die when he is rescued by a cowboy leading some cattle. This seems to be the most obviously funny. Franco does some sly humor.An Impresario (Liam Neeson) takes his armless, legless charge from settlement to settlement as a sideshow where he reads from the classics. This one is kinda boring and repetitive. The actual act is kinda boring, too.A prospector (Tom Waits) arrives at a remote creek. He's alone in a place without people. He finds gold flakes in the creek bank. I love the beauty and isolation of this natural setting. There is a zen to his digging and the climatic event starts with an intriguing shadow.Alice Longabaugh (Zoe Kazan) is with her older brother on a westward bound wagon train. It's a tough journey that culminates with a desperate fight against an Indian war party. This section starts rather bland. It seems like it's going for a slow romance when it suddenly turns into a old-fashion fight against the Indians. The fight is tense but it does reek of old westerns where the Indians are nameless savages.A stagecoach is carrying five passenger and a dead body. The set is static. This one is the least compelling. With no background, the dialogue is meaningless. It's almost background noise. I don't care about these characters and the reveal has no shock value.The Coen brothers are doing an anthology western. The movie flips through a book where each chapter is presented as a vignette. The last vignette is the most problematic and perplexing. It has few action beats. I can see the guys loving the dark quirkiness but it's not the one to close with. I'd probably close with The Gal Who Got Rattled and its shootout ending.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
2,boblipton,How About Them Westerns?,8,18 November 2018,"When they remade TRUE GRIT, the Coen Brothers clearly thought there weren't enough John Ford westerns -- I agree with them -- so they offered the audience one. With THE BALLAD OF BUSTER SCRUGGS they clearly think there aren't enough movies offering the strengths of the classic B and short westerns: open vistas, lone prospectors, wagon trains, bank robbers, cattle rustlers, gunslinging, moralizing singing cowboys who wander the barren west, strumming their ""Radio King"" guitars for their horses, and five people inside a stage yarning to each other. So they stuck together half a dozen stories, got their usual assortment of top talent and offered them to us. I am extremely grateful.Their cinematographer, Bruno Delbonnel, offers us a variety of lighting. I was most impressed by his choices for ""The Girl Who Got Rattled"", which is staged like posters for WESTWARD THE WOMEN and lit like the covers for Louis Lamour paperbacks in the 1960s. There's an air of artificiality that pervades the movie. That's common enough for the Coens, who like to mock their dead cinematic peers, but. like HAIL, CAESAR shows their fondness for their subject.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
3,nogodnomasters,People are like ferrets,8,25 November 2018,"This is a Netflix original and consists of a western anthology of unique stories. The first one is clearly an homage film to the singing cowboy. The stories are humorous, sometimes with dark humor. They are not zany like a typical Coen production, but have welcomed twists.No sex or nudity.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
4,kosmasp,Addition,10,4 May 2019,"If you are into Western movies and into quirky humor and don't mind violence being displayed on your screen. Some of it is also comedic, but don't get it twisted is is mostly with lethal outcomes. And very vivid at that (so there will be blood). If you don't mind that or rather cherish most of it (in movies that is always), than you will have a field day (no pun intended).And even more without knowing anything about this other than it is in the genre of the Western, my surprise after - well let's call it the introduction (20 minutes in or so) - was quite high. I did not expect this to happen at all. But it works for the movie and it really is gem as others have described it. So while you may have mixed feelings about Netflix or Prime or any other streaming service out there, this is something we have to cherish about them - making great movies like this",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
5,classicsoncall,"""Things have a way of escalatin' out here in the West...""",9,30 January 2019,"I've never run into a Coen Brothers movie I didn't like. Their skewed way of looking at the world and placing oddball characters into their stories appeals to me tremendously. This film may not win over fans of traditional Westerns like ""True Grit"", which the Coens took a crack at almost a decade ago with favorable results. Their anthology approach here is designed to introduce a diverse assortment of tales with only one common element running through all of them - each one produces a dead body! A couple of the deaths don't actually occur on screen, but are offered in ironic juxtaposition to the story in which they took place. Because of the widely (and wildly) diverse nature of the tales, it's kind of difficult to pick out a favorite, if in fact the word 'favorite' even applies.Each of the chapters in the movie comes with it's own title and introduction, and it starts out on a most favorable note with the appearance of Buster Scruggs (Tim Blake Nelson) astride his white horse Dan. He evokes the memory of Gene Autry in countless B Westerns of the Forties and Fifties, coming on the scene while strumming his guitar and singing an upbeat tune. Of all the little episodes, this is the one that plays most as a caricature of the Western genre, and it contains an element I've never seen in over seven or eight hundred Westerns - it has Buster's nemesis, The Frenchman (David Krumholtz) mount his horse from the right side! Seriously, no one EVER mounts a horse from the right side, and I had to wonder if the Coens' goofing with the audience included this little tidbit intentionally.I'm not going to discuss each of the vignettes offered in the film, or attempt to pick a favorite, because none of them really lend themselves to being particularly likeable in the sense that their resolutions end favorably for the participants. Especially gruesome were the fates of the Artist (Harry Melling) in the segment titled 'Meal Ticket', and that of poor Alice Longabaugh (Zoe Kazan) in 'The Gal Who Got Rattled'. In your traditional Westerns, you'd never have a character like The Artist, and the fate of an Alice Longabaugh would have been anathema for the likes of John Ford or Howard Hawks.The only story I didn't particularly understand upon a first viewing was the final one called 'The Mortal Remains'. It ends somewhat humorously, but everything leading up to it is mere conversation among stagecoach riders in somewhat antagonistic fashion. I'll have to go back to that one to see if there's something I missed. But overall, I got the biggest kick out of this off beat Western in a way I haven't experienced since 1995's ""The Quick and the Dead"". Chances are if you liked that one, you'll like this one too, but of course, the opposite could be just as true as well.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
6,lee_eisenberg,the Coens go west,8,24 November 2018,"After the unmitigated disaster that was ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" - no plot and it completely ignored the role that the folk revival played in the Civil Rights Movement - Joel and Ethan Coen could only go up. They certainly did with ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"". It's an anthology movie about the old west. Although the title references the first segment, each one has its own perceptive story. There are some truly Coenesque scenes here. Maybe it's no ""Big Lebowski"" or ""Fargo"", but it's still a good one. Definitely see it!",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
7,jboothmillard,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,7,28 February 2019,"I looked up all the movies that were nominated during Awards Season, I was really happy to find this one that was made by and featured on Netflix, it was rated very well, so I was looking forward to it, written and directed by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen (Fargo, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, No Country for Old Men, True Grit, Inside Llewyn Davis). Basically the film consists of six unrelated stories that take place in the American frontier, or the Old West. ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" - Buster Scruggs (Tim Blake Nelson) is a cheerful singing cowboy, a wanted man, with great skills with his pistols, he kills a man insulting him. He enters a saloon and replaces a player in a game of poker, after seeing his hand he asks to change cards, but the other players insist he play what he has been dealt. When Buster refuses, large menacing player Çurly Joe (Clancy Brown) stands and gets out a concealed pistol, but Buster repeatedly kicks the table plank, tipping Joe's gun so it points backwards and fires into his face, he shoots himself three times and falls dead. Buster sings a song boisterous song about ""Surly Joe"" to the delight of the crowd, but then Joe's brother Ike (Danny McCarthy) arrives and challenges Buster to a gunfight in the street. Buster gladly obliges and proceeds to shoot off each of Ike's fingers from his right hand, before finishing him off with a shot delivered over the shoulder using a mirror. Then a young gunslinger, The Kid (Willie Watson) rides into town and politely challenges Buster, he obliges, but to his surprise the young man is much faster on the draw, Buster is shot in the forehead, the young man and the spirit of Buster sing a duet as the dead cowboy floats towards heaven. ""Near Algodones"" - a young Cowboy (James Franco) robs an isolated bank on the prairie but is forced to take cover when the jabbering Bank Teller (Stephen Root) shoots at him. He returns fire, but the taller charges at him wearing a washboard and several pots and pans as armour, deflecting the cowboy's bullets, and the teller knocks him out with his rifle butt. The cowboy regains consciousness and finds himself sitting on a horse under a tree with his hands tied and a noose around his neck. A lynching posse, led by a lawman dressed in black (Ralph Ineson), ask for his final words, but the execution is interrupted by ambushing Comanche warriors who slaughter the lawman and posse but leave the cowboy in place upon the horse. The cowboy struggles to stay on the horse, until he is found and freed by a scruffy young Drover (Jesse Luken), who is actually a rustler. But the cowboy winds up captured by another lawman's posse, he is sentenced by the grumpy old fart of a Judge (Michael Cullen), the cowboy stands upon the gallows with three other men, the hangman abruptly hoods him and pulls the trapdoor lever to cheers and applause. ""Meal Ticket"" - an aging Impresario (Liam Neeson) and his artist Harrison (Harry Potter's Harry Melling), a young man with no arms or legs, travel from town to town in a wagon that converts into a small stage. Harrison theatrically recites classics such as Shelley's poem ""Ozymandias"", the biblical story of Cain and Abel, works by Shakespeare, and Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. The impresario collects money from the audience at the end of each performance, but profits are dwindling as they visit increasingly remote mountain towns with smaller and more indifferent audiences. Following a performance with no profit, the impresario observes a man nearby drawing a crowd with a chicken performing basic maths by pecking at painted numbers to answer addition and subtraction equations called out by the audience. After buying the chicken, the impresario drives the wagon through a mountain pass, stopping by a bridge over a rushing river to drop something into the water, and he continues to travel, the caged chicken as his only passenger. ""All Gold Canyon"" - a grizzled Prospector (Tom Waits) arrives in a pristine mountain valley and starts digging for gold in a grassy meadow beside a river. Over the course of several days, he pans through mounds dirt to find gold specks, trying to identify the source, until digging a deeper hole in the area he believes it is located. On the third day, he digs out gold nuggets of increasing size, until he is overjoyed to find ""Mr. Pocket"", a large gold vein running through the quartz. At that moment he has made the discovery, a young man (Sam Dillon) stands over him aiming a pistol, he shoots the prospector in the back and he falls face down. After leaving him to bleed for a few moments, and presuming he is dead, the young man jumps into the hole to steal the gold, the prospector wrestles with him, and grabs the gun to kill the young man. The prospector cleans his non-fatal wound in the river, and finishes mining the gold, pushes the young man's body into the hole to serve as his grave, and he walks away. ""The Gal Who Got Rattled"" - Alice Longabaugh (Zoe Kazan) and her older brother Gilbert (Jefferson Mays), an inept businessman, are journeying in a wagon train across the prairie towards Oregon. Gilbert dies of cholera shortly after they embark, and the wagon train's leaders, Mr. Billy Knapp (Bill Heck) and Mr. Arthur (Grainger Hines), help Alice bury her brother. Alice decides to continue the trip, Matt (Ethan Dubin), the young man Gilbert hired to lead their wagon, mentions money he was promised when they reach Fort Laramie. Fearing Gilbert's money was buried with him, she conveys her predicament to Billy, who offers his support of what to do next. With continued conversations, Billy becomes fond of Alice, and proposes to solve her dilemma by marrying her in Fort Laramie, to close the debt, and build a family. Alice is surprised with by Billy's proposal, but she has grown fond of him, she accepts, and Billy informs Mr. Arthur that this will be their last ride together. The following morning, Mr. Arthur notices Alice missing, he rides over the hills and finds her, when they spot an Indian army approaching. Mr, Arthur gives Alice a pistol so that if he killed, he can shoot herself and avoid capture. A battle ensues, Mr. Arthur appears to killed by a charging warrior, but he kills the Indian, but he is devastated to find Alice has killed, as he has instructed, he does not know what to say to Billy. ""The Mortal Remains"" - at sunset, five people are travelling to Fort Morgan, Colorado in a stagecoach: Thigpen, an Englishman (Jonjo O'Neill), Clarence, an Irishman (Brendan Gleeson), René, a Frenchman (Saul Rubinek), Mrs. Betjeman, a lady (Tyne Daly), and a fur Trapper (Chelcie Ross). There may be a corpse on the roof of the stagecoach, the Trapper rambles about his past relationship with a Native woman, and the other characters discuss their opinions and experiences of love, often disgusting the devout Christian lady, who has an attack. The driver's policy is not to stop for any reason, but she is calmed down, they then continue their conversation, talking about hunting, until they reach hotel in Fort Morgan where they will all be staying, and a corpse is taken from the top of the coach inside. Also starring David Krumholtz as Frenchman, Paul Rae as Chicken Impresario and Billy Lockwood as Father. I will admit the last two stories are not as interesting as the first four (it was originally supposed to be a television series), but all work to create a heartfelt love poem to the Wild West, the performances are all terrific, and you can tell that the Coen brothers have a deep affection for the genre, a most worthwhile western anthology. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Original Song for ""When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings"", Best Costume Design and Best Adapted Screenplay for Joel Coen and Ethan Coen, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Costume Design. Very good!",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

9,grantss,"Largely lightweight, especially by the Coen Brothers' standards, but always entertaining",7,1 December 2018,"Six stories of the American West, written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen.I am a huge fan of the Coen Brothers but their output and quality as directors has dropped off over the last few years. Their last brilliant movie was True Grit, released in 2010. Their two movies since then, Inside Llewyn Davis and Hail Caesar!, weren't bad, but weren't of the quality we have come to expect from them. Also, it appears that they are concentrating more on writing nowadays, having written the screenplays for Unbroken, Bridge of Spies and Suburbicon.So it was with some apprehension and degree of intrigue that I viewed The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. Turns out it isn't bad, but, like Inside Llewyn Davis and Hail Caesar!, it isn't brilliant either.The idea of six stories wrapped into one movie was reasonably novel. The six stories are of mixed tone and quality. The first two are largely comedic and contain the key Coen Brothers element of a clever twist. While being entertaining, they are quite lightweight though and this made me set my expectations for the rest of the movie quite low.To my surprise, number 3, the Liam Neeson story, was quite dark and engaging. Entirely drama, with a powerful ending. It did feel too short though - the ending could have been drawn out a bit.The next two stories - Tom Waits as a gold prospector and the Oregon Trail - are the highlights of the movie, the Oregon Trail especially so. Both could have been made into full-length movies as there was enough room for plot and/or character development to work with. Maybe a sign of the Coen Brothers current insecurity as directors or writers that neither of them did become feature films.The six story was interesting, for the most part. Almost entirely dialogue-driven it reminded me of a Quentin Tarantino movie: the long monologues, the clever biting dialogue, the sense of foreboding, as if the dialogue is building up to something. It seemed headed for something powerful and profound but ended rather weakly, leaving me feeling rather disappointed.There is also no links between the six stories - they exist independently and nothing and nobody ties them together at the end - is also a bit disappointing.
Overall - good, but not great. It is never dull and all six stories are worth watching.On a broader note, before watching this I was figuring The Ballad of Buster Scruggs would herald a new era in movie-making. Netflix movies have never really rivalled cinema movies for quality and even the really good ones (e.g. Beasts of No Nation) don't seem to have the same presence and gravitas as a cinema movie. Most tellingly, Netflix movies have never been directed by top-notch cinematic directors, indicating that Netflix was still the poor cousin to cinema.However, with The Ballad of Buster Scruggs being Netflix-produced and -released, it looked like that relationship was about to change. The Coen Brothers feature in the highest pantheon of movie directors and them directing a Netflix movie seems like a major coup, and a revolution / evolution in film-making.The fact that the movie itself is not brilliant, and features a narrative that lends itself more easily to TV movies, has tempered my thoughts on the matter. When a Netflix movie wins a Best Picture or Best Director Oscar (they can be eligible, and Netflix documentaries have won two Oscars) then the revolution will be upon us.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
10,evanston_dad,Not One of the Coens' Best,5,30 November 2018,"I don't much care for anthology films as a rule, and I also don't much like westerns, so I might be a biased audience. But I loved the Coen brothers' ""True Grit,"" and I'm always willing to give them a chance, so I came to ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" with an open mind. Sadly, I didn't enjoy it much.The Coen brothers must have been ticked off at humanity when they made this series of vignettes set in the old West, because the running theme in the film is how vile mankind is to each other, usually because of greed but occasionally for other reasons. I was worried after the first story that I wouldn't even make it through the movie, because it's done in that exaggerated, grotesque style the Coen brothers sometimes adopt where characters mug and speak straight to the camera and everything is played for broad laughs. I find it hard anymore to laugh at violence in movies, especially gun violence, but what grated on me more than that was the performance of Tim Blake Nelson as a singing cowboy. Thankfully, that entry is short, as is the following one featuring James Franco that goes for dark humor but ends up being pointless. Indeed, the whole movie felt pointless to me. There's so much to talk about right now in our current culture, and I couldn't help but wonder what such intelligent filmmakers like the Coen brothers were doing wasting their time on such an irrelevant movie.I did like the story featuring Zoe Kazan as a young pioneer woman making her way with a caravan across the plains toward Oregon. I felt like there were the seeds of a compelling feature length movie, primarily because it's one of the only entries where the actors are given enough time and material to create full characters. Of course it has to end bleakly and remind us yet again of how awful men can be to one another, but the story leading up to that ending is good, and Kazan gives probably the best performance in the whole movie.I will always give the Coen brothers credit for not playing it safe. If nothing else, their movies are original. But some just work for me while others don't, and ""Buster Scruggs"" didn't.Grade: C",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
11,deloudelouvain,The Coen brothers did it again.,8,28 December 2018,"To be honest I hesitated to watch this one as I saw it was also categorized as a musical because if there's one genre of movie that I absolutely hate it's musicals. But I'm glad I watched it because it was much better then I thought it would be. The singing parts were actually very funny, with their thick southern accents and humorous lyrics. Six different and independent short stories in a movie that will please alot of people. Ethan and Joel Coen have their unique style of film making and The Ballad Of Buster Scruggs is a very good example of their, most of the time, excellent work. I don't like all of their movies but this one is one I will watch again, like Fargo and The Big Lebowski. From the six stories my favourite was the first one with Tim Blake Nelson playing Buster Scruggs. It set the tone for an excellent movie night. Some stories were slower but still entertaining to watch, in that unique way that only the Coen brothers can bring a story. The dialogues are quirky and oldschool, and are the best parts of this movie. The Ballad Of Buster Scruggs is a keeper, a movie you will watch more then once.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
12,Mr-Fusion,Tim Blake Nelson owns,8,5 April 2019,"An unexpected, bizarre and positively enthralling treat, ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" is the Coen Brothers using the Western as a sandbox; herein, they explore everything from surly bankrobbers, to traveling showmen, even the lowly prospector. All of the characters seem to be operating at varying levels of deranged, and as a result, this movie is never less than mystifying. Even during those sequences of pin-drop stillness. The title character only occupies one of the six stories, and it's impressive that the movie is able to maintain such a level of interest after Scruggs' time is over.That said, Buster Scruggs is easily my favorite part of this film, and honestly one of my very favorite Coen Bros. characters. Tim Blake Nelson is wildly endearing as that wascally wabbit who narrates himself from one death to the next, going to town on that ear-candy dialogue and hamming the hell out of those fake teeth. He is the movie's comedic core, as well as its most violent character (in a film that oscillates between humor and savagery with startling ease), and there's just no one else like him.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

15,cherold,"you'll like some of these, won't like others, and won't agree about which are the good ones",7,20 March 2019,"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs contains six short movies, western-themed but otherwise distinct in approach and style. Looking through the user reviews, I see that few people liked all six but that people don't show much agreement on which were the good and bad ones (although most people seem to like #5 and not care much for #6.In a way the movie illustrates the Coen Brothers filmmaking evolution. The first movie represents the wacky, gimmicky, tremendously fun early films like Raising Arizona, while the later ones represent their more sedate, ""adult"" approach.The first one, about a violence-prone singing cowboy is the sort of over-the-top craziness the Coens don't do much anymore. It's funny, dark, ridiculous, and wildly imaginative, and my favorite episode. I give it a *9*.The second is another black humored piece about a two-bit criminal. It's not as nutty, but it's entertaining and has a good punch line. *8*Things get serious after that. The third episode is strange, downbeat, and overlong, fueled by a brilliant performance by Harry Melling. *7*The forth is an interesting, leisurely-paced portrayal of a prospector. *7*The fifth is the closest thing to a fully formed story. A lot happens in it, the characters are finely drawn, and it has a quiet solemnity. But I wouldn't say I loved it. *8*The finale is five people arguing in a stagecoach. It has its moments, but would have best been left on the cutting room floor. *6*Overall an unnecessary but somewhat interesting curio that doesn't pull them out of their post True-Grit slump.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
16,ElMaruecan82,How the Coens Won the West,10,13 January 2019,"The title is ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" and it does sound like something the Coen brothers would come up with. But that's the limit of its predictability, whatever you expect, you will be surprised. And you know why? Because I think they surprise themselves in the first place. Hitchcock said style is self-plagiarism, Tarantino has style in that specific sense, ""Django"" was a Western version of ""Basterds"" which was a WWII version of ""Kill Bill"". But the Coens have style in the opposite way, covering their own tracks. So I knew I wouldn't have to expect a new ""True Grit"" and I was right... while still being mislead, see what I mean?The titular ballad starts like a Disney animated classic with the ""book of the same title"" opening... only there's a subtitle that says ""and Other Tales of the American Frontier"". I foolishly thought it was an adaptation of preexisting tales when it only had one, from Jack London, the rest plays like a splendid and authentic looking tribute to the Western genre that would have made the Holy Trinity of Ford, Leone and Peckinpah go all ""yee-haw"" in their graves.All the colorful, enduring and endearing archetypes from Western movies and Lucky Luke adventures are there: gunslingers, duels, bar brawls, prospectors, desperados, wagon trains, ""Indians vs. cowboys"", stagecoaches, bounty hunters etc. and all displayed in various storytelling textures: humor, tragedy, action, fantasy ... and served by an impeccable cast. In the comedic parts or those that lean toward absurdity, you can tell actors are having fun, in the 'serious' parts, you're being haunted before the story ever finishes.Indeed, as colorful and catchy as the title sounds, once you get near the end of the third segment starting with an unforgettable Harry Melling (Dudley Dursley sure grew up!) and Liam Neeson, you have totally forgotten Buster Scruggs. I just loved Tim Blake Nelson in his goofy impersonation of ""Shane"" in a live action version of a Tex Avery cartoon and I loved the more cynical but no less comedic tale of a Karma-beaten bank robber played by James Franco (glad to see him back) but the film is never as riveting in its drama parts, which is saying a lot .The third segment is about a crippled comedian, with no arms and no legs, being fed by a seemingly generous theater owner (Liam Neeson) until spectators rarefy and 'hunger' strikes and with it, and one lesson about the unlimited extent of greed. The following story could be about greed as well, a prospector (Tom Waits) tries to find a pocket of gold near a river, you can tell the man's experience grew into inner wisdom, talking with nature, addressing respectfully the pocket as Mr., it takes time but we're mesmerized by the beauty of the scenery (some of the finest I ever saw in a Western). I won't dare reveal what happens but it's got something to do with greed too.And it makes you understand that prospection isn't just a matter of gold, it's not the destination that matters but the journey. Not that it applies for all the following story, the most exciting one set in the wagon train. Now, when you have an anthology made, you're tempted to find a common thread and besides the frontier setting, I guess the overarching idea might come from the final tale, set in a stagecoach, which makes it interestingly both dynamic and static, the passengers, among them Brendan Gleeson and Tyne Daly share views about life and death and try to figure out what is the main distinction between men: weak and strong, upright and sinning etc.I guess in the Old West, it was about fit and unfit. Some die because they found their nemesis or their match, some because bad luck will have the last word no matter what and some because it's not fair that they live, there seems to be some Karma of the Old West that determines with an implacable Darwinism who'll be able to survive or not and whether in comedy or drama or action, those who survive leave us with the certitude that the Old West inspired so many myths because it was a catalysis of a nation's identity.And I enjoyed the film because of the format as well as the content, each story had the perfect timing, it's more than an exercise in style but in precision, and I'm glad there's no recurring character as it's often the case with the Tarantino and Rodrigues films: once a story ends, it ends and there's a feeling of total completeness, just as satisfying as closing a book, the film doesn't cheat or try to over play it... and paint with a documentary-like artistry the fauna and flora of the old west with its sheep, wolves, coyotes, rattlesnakes, skunks through stories where the animal world has a role to play, and not jut metaphorically.And I can't believe this movie hasn't been in more awards talk (is it a Netflix issue?), this film would have deserved many nominations or at least a spot in the AFI Top 10. Now, we're in mid-January, in the midst of the awards season and all the Oscar yacking and yet the title haven't popped up many times as far as I can remember, which seems to point out that we'd be lucky if Bruno Delbonnel gets a nomination, if there is a nod for costumes and boy, count me among the first to be cheering if Zoe Kazan gets noticed for her supporting performance.But the Gold prospect seems rather dry and for some reason, that gem of a Western from the Coen brothers didn't find the right pocket... but I'm not sure the film tried to dig any gold, for there's one certitude in my heart, the film IS gold and gold doesn't dig itself, does it?",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
17,MOscarbradley,"These tales, taken together, are as good as anything the Coens have done.",9,15 August 2021,"I guess it was inevitable that the Coen Brothers would do a portmanteau picture, little pieces resembling short stories or comic strips brought to life. Wasn't that what ""Raising Arizona"" was, a Roadrunner cartoon with actors? Of course, anyone can do a portmanteau picture and add nothing to the segments other than a fundamental blandness. The Coens, however, have distinguished themselves from the beginning with a style unlike that of any of their contemporaries. You can recognise a Coen Brother's film from a distance. In the end, they may all look and sound the same but that's their signature just as we know a Fellini or a Bunuel or a Hitchcock.""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" is six tales of the Old West; part pastiche, part homage, part realism, very funny certainly but philosophical and deeply moving, too. The link lies in the Coen Brothers' style and the depth of feeling they bring to the individual pieces. The title comes from the first story, a surreal comedy-western inspired in part, perhaps, by Mel Brooks as a vehicle for the great Tim Blake Nelson as a singing cowboy who isn't quite what he seems. It's very funny and is closest in style to ""Raising Arizona"".The second story is a gorgeous black joke about an incompetent bank robber played by James Franco in dead-pan style. The third segment, ""Meal Ticket"" is virtually a two-hander and is a small masterpiece of visual storytelling with wonderful performances from both Liam Neeson and a remarkable Harry Melling and it shows the Coens can do 'serious' impeccably and the same can be said for the fifth and longest segment, ""The Girl Who Got Rattled"", a tale of the Oregon Trail that again never goes where we expect it to and taken on its own is one of the very best things the brothers have ever done.If the other two stories don't quite measure up they are still remarkable in their intelligence and are beautifully played. The first is really a one-man show for Tom Waits while the closing segment is like something Guy De Maupassant might have written and the whole thing is stunningly photographed by the great Bruno Delbonnel. Made by Netflix it was rumoured that the film was originally to be a television series but now it seems it was never intended to be anything other than what it is and surely these combined stories must rank with some of the brother's very best work. I look forward to revisiting them frequently.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
18,ThomasDrufke,Full of Death and Misery,7,2 March 2019,"Originally pitched as a mini-series, the Coen brothers returned to feature films (but not theaters) with The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, the anthology film with six different stories from the old west. With anthology films or TV series', you're hardly ever going to like everything. With Buster Scruggs, I was about half and half with what I thought was worth watching. I could do without the first 2 Vignettes and the last one, but the middle 3 stories were engaging, provided their own voice, and even proved to be thought-provoking. Meal-Ticket was devastating, All Gold Canyon was earnest, and The Gal Who Got Rattled was both of those. There's more good than bad here, and I guess at the very least it's a reminder as to how depressing and full of death the old west used to be? Eric Kohn from IndieWire said it best, it's a reminder of what makes the Coen brothers so appealing yet also a reminder of so many better examples in their filmography.7.0/10",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
19,gbill-74877,Great concept,7,24 August 2020,"I loved the concept of the six vignettes, the creativity, and how they're all loosely tied together by the cruel ironies of death. The film starts very strong with the title character eloquently speaking the slang of the old west, cheerfully singing, and blowing people away with a smile. It drops off a bit as it goes, never precipitously, but I didn't like how in two of the stories Native Americans were portrayed in that tired way, as savages. It's part of the exaggeration of all these old western tropes I guess, but c'mon Coen brothers, it's 2018 for chrissake.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
20,Cineanalyst,Illustrations from the Book,6,23 November 2018,"This Coen Brothers anthology of Western stories, ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,"" features some entertaining tales and lovely cinematography, but I suspect it's a movie that I'll soon find forgettable, its details becoming hazy in my mind. Perhaps, that's because there's nothing particularly profound about it; moreover, it's rather a pastiche of the familiar genre. There's the singing and poker-playing gunslinger, a bank robber, hangings, cattle rustling, traveling theatre, brothels and taverns, a gold miner and trapper, wagons on the Oregon trail, protestants, bounty hunters in a stagecoach, and the tropes of damsel-in-distress and savage Indians popping in a couple times to attack the narrative progression of Manifest Destiny. We've heard and seen these stories before, so much of the effect of this retelling relies upon the alterations, inversions and ironies introduced by the Coen Brothers. The anthology of six separate stories, with only the genre and its themes linking them, almost seems an admission that none of these variations is enough to carry any one of the narratives on their own.There's a good deal to like here, though. The treatment varies from dark comedy (with James Franco delivering the best line) to just dark, with plenty of emphasis on death. In fact, a few of the characters die in similar positions and generally in an ironic fashion. One dies admitting he should've seen it coming; another we see coming, but don't actually see--and, instead, see what he sees in the final moments; another, indeed, does see it coming; another we see and don't see; and another is just tragically unnecessary.There's the framing device of the stories being illustrated from a book of the same name. The eponymous singing gunslinger eloquently breaks the fourth wall--telling his story directly to the spectator. (Scruggs uses a hand-held mirror a couple times, furthering his story's self-reference.) Singing is repeated by the gold miner, along with his indirect address to the spectator in the form of him seemingly talking to himself, and the art of oratory continues through all of the episodes. There's the irony of a limbless traveling orator who's mute off stage and the leader of the wagons West who's inarticulate during leisurely travel but surprising succinct and effective in a pinch. Perhaps, most telling of all is the story involving the bounty hunters, who distract the wanted with such stories in order to slay them. It's no accident that that this is the final tale, nor that the first story begins with Buster Scruggs displaying a wanted poster. The Coen Brothers and Netflix are the bounty hunters, and we're distracted by their stories.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

23,tomgillespie2002,"A couple of standouts, but ultimately doesn't gel or flow",6,4 December 2018,"The Coen brothers have long weaved their love of the western genre into their movies, whether it be capturing its core essence with the likes of Blood Simple and Raising Arizona, or tackling the genre head-on with No Country for Old Men and True Grit. Their latest, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, which makes its way onto Netflix after a limited theatrical release, sees the siblings hark back to the horse operas of old. Initially marked as an anthology series, it soon evolved into a feature of six unrelated stories, bound together only by the imaginary pages of the short-story book we as the viewer are supposed to be reading. The final product suffers from the same problems faced by any film attempting the portmanteau format - a couple are great, some are either frustratingly short or unnecessarily drawn-out, and at least one you'll be struggling to remember after the credits have rolled.There's also the feeling that Buster Scruggs blows its load far too early, as the titular Ballad, featuring one of Tim Blake Nelson's best performances, struts into town on the back of a horse carrying the smoothest country singer and deadliest gunslinger in the West, and knocks it out of the park. It's a bizarre little tale that mixes the yodell-y crooning of those white hat vs. black hat genre pictures of old with bursts of the ironic, darkly humorous violence the Coens are so well known for. The tunes are wonderful, the cinematography (by Bruno Delbonnel) is ingeniously inventive (watch out for that shot from inside the guitar), and Nelson is a lively narrator. It ends too soon, and you can't help but think that a standalone feature for the sharply-dressed Buster Scruggs may have been warranted instead. The next story, Near Algodones, sees James Franco's roaming thief hold up the wrong bank and come under fire from the gun-toting teller, played by Stephen Root. It's supposed to be a funny tale of irony and karma, but ultimately feels like an afterthought in the wake of Scruggs' more well-rounded story.Meal Ticket is more sombre in tone, following opportunistic impresario Harrison (Liam Neeson) and his performer, the legless and armless Artist, who is played with great poise by Harry Melling (Dudley Dursley from the Harry Potter films). There is a great idea here, one fraught with tragedy and sorrow, but it simply doesn't have enough time to fully develop its ideas. Slotting nicely alongside Buster Scruggs as a stand-out piece is All Gold Canyon, in which Tom Waits' grizzled prospector digs for gold in an untouched valley. It's like the opening scene of There Will Be Blood, only this also has a nice surprise in store as the weather-beaten old man searches for 'Mr. Pocket', the place in the ground holding his grand prize. The remaining two stories, The Gal Who Got Rattled and The Mortal Remains, touch on romance and horror elements, as the characters are transported by wagon train and stagecoach, respectively, to the destination that may or may not await them. They round off a mish-mash of tones and themes, and although they each have individual merits, they simply don't gel together or flow naturally. Fans will no doubt find some wonderful stuff here, as I did, but recommended only for Nelson and Waits, whose stories are up there with some of the Coens' very best.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

""Hail, Cesar"" was a low point, but things have gone downhill since. 6 storylines going nowhere. Good actors for sure, good photography as always, but what this movie really is lacking in, is a climax of ANY sort. It lacks meaning. It lacks connection between the stories. It's just a mess. Let me just try and forget the Coen Brothers ever teamed up with Netflix for releasing such nonsensical trash as this Buster Scrugss movie.This all doesnt mean the Coen Brothers have lost their edge, because they have had similar periods before in which they indulged themselves into farcical comedies which just never measure up to the genre in which these twin directors really do excell: making claustrophobic mentally twisted thrillers.Just watch ""Blood Simple"", ""Barton Fink"", ""Fargo"" or ""No Country for Old Men"" and shiver and squeak with terror and joy simultaneously, because these classics will blow your mind.

27,Vartiainen,Quite the spectacle,8,14 January 2019,"An anthology film by the Coen Brothers, featuring six tales taking place in the American frontier. The tales differ greatly in subject matter and tone, but they all have that Coen Brothers undercurrent of black humour.If I had to name a favourite, I'd have to go with either The Gal Who Got Rattled or All Gold Canyon. The former is easily the best story, and the one with the most substance, but I also really like All Gold Canyon's simplicity and the prospector character. Both of these films also manage to surprise you and they're not nihilistically dark like some of the other stories.Which brings me to my least favourite, which is a toss-up between Near Algodones and Meal Ticket. The former has the least amount of substance and story out of all six, whereas the latter is way too grim even for the Coens.The Ballad of Buster Scruggs and The Mortal Remains fall somewhere between. I enjoyed both of them very much and the former especially was very pleasingly exaggerated version of the gunslinger mythos. The Mortal Remains however is the one story I would like to see as a full-length feature. There's potential in these characters, the two bounty hunters especially.Overall, I'd say this is a very good film. The stories connect very well with one another and form a whole. The cinematography is once again amazing, as is the dark humour, and none of these vignettes are something you're likely to forget.

Number three stars Liam Neeson as a man with a handicapped sidekick telling tales and collecting cash from the audience at different towns. Next up is Tom Waits as a gold prospector who digs relentlessly for the precious metal. Another surprise ending which worked for me. A wagon train carrying a young woman to a hopeful destination with all kinds of obstacles along the way. Another unexpected conclusion.

The odd, sometimes unsettling, combination of pathos and bathos may not be to everyone's taste.

The anthology movie is a hard thing to do well. I believe, more so than any other movie, when you can clearly see a film is divided into parts, you judge them separately and generally walk out thinking, ""the first part was much better than the other parts"", or ""the middle bit was my favourite but the other parts sucked"".I think an anthology flick with not three (the usual amount) but six stories is really pushing its luck. Of course, the movie looks great, and I kept watching to see what actors would come out of the woodwork, but I missed the endings of some of the tales because I wasn't paying attention. With six short stories, you feel less inclined to devote yourself to what you're watching, knowing it's going to be over soon anyway, and they are rarely attention getting or punchy enough to keep you engaged.Some of them are also just weird, particularly the first and last story.

Most of the six unrelated stories misfire however as the boys slow draw with an itchy trigger finger.The opening episode featuring a homicidal Gene Autry like singing cowboy (Buster) in sparkling duds offers some smug slapstick violence and a Destry saloon tune musical number but the comic absurdity is jarring introduction to the mostly tragic and melancholy mood of the subsequent episodes. The second episode (Near Algodones) displays a rythym and energy that the rest of the film never embraces as it features a bank robbery, cattle rustling, Indian massacre and two hangings in the briefest of the stories.The remaining four episodes all bog down in pace, precious detail and mighty pretty country as a prospector (Tom Waits) searches for gold in a paradise like valley and sturdy good looking Conestoga wagons make their way across the prairie. But while the form is beautiful the content lags with the brothers too busy to concentrate on one story outside of making it look good visually.The Gal who Got Rattled (#5) is the best of the bunch as it develops characters of interest outside of the caricatures that both help and hinder the film in other stories.

They are bold and contemplative for those who choose to contemplate what they just witnessed. Each story starts off one way and ends 180 degrees in another. The stories cover a cocky and skilled pistol-touting cowboy, a man without arms and legs who tells stories for money for his 'partner', a gold prospector, a bank robber, romance on the Oregon Trail and people talking during a wagon coach ride with a corps on the roof.

42,jadepietro,"Western Tales That Say A Lot, Partner!",8,21 November 2018,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An entertaining anthology that pays homage to the Old West.JIM'S REVIEW: Anthologies have a built-in formula for failure due to their episodic format. One chapter may exceed expectations while another literally disappoints by comparison. It's a win-lose situation. The Coen Brothers latest cinematic treat, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, is a collection of mini-stories about the Old West. It doesn't avoid the pitfalls of its format but it remains an entertaining assemblage of late 19th century tales about cowboys and Indians.These six short Western stories of the old frontier may have a unifying theme of life's irony and death's ultimate judgment, but their tone ranges from comedic to tragic. All are beautifully lensed by Bruno Delbonnel with a wonderful music score of original tunes and country favorites complied by Carter Burwell. The masterful vision of directing and writing team of Joel and Ethan Coen make these mini-stories individual in their approach to the varied subjects and their meaningful commentary on the human condition.We meet the title character in the very first chapter. Wearing a 10 gallon hat that looks like three sizes too large and dressed in white, he strums his guitar as he strolls into the nearest saloon with his guns a-blazing and eager to play some cards. Tim Blake Nelson plays Buster, a wanted man who continually breaks the fourth wall in telling his story (with musical interludes) of a legendary outlaw...himself. Sardonic and brutally violent, this vignette is pure Coen and highly enjoyable. Grade: BThe second story, Near Algodones, stars James Franco as a bank robber whose fate takes an unexpected turn of unfortunate events. This chapter doesn't deliver as effectively as it should due to its brevity, but it still wildly entertains and gorgeous in its imagery. Grade: B-Meal Ticket takes us to a traveling side show with a disfigured actor delivering a freak show of Shakespearian verse and sophisticated monologues on a nightly basis. This thespian along with his caregiver, shill their way through the Old West dispensing culture and art to their rowdy dwindling audiences. Harry Melling plays this tragic but talented orator and Liam Neeson is his gruff keeper. Both are superb in a story that questions our own humanity and sense of personal responsibility. Grade: B+The fourth tale is based on a story by Jack London. All Gold Canyon begins with lyrical panoramas of nature's beauty before man intrudes on its majestic splendors. An old prospector (well played by Tom Waits) destroys the land, digging and searching for his share of gold. A rather weak entry about the positive nature of ecology and caring about Mother Earth, the story gets very contrived very fast, even with its twist ending of survival and greed. Grade: C+Fifth on the list is The Gal Who Got Rattled. Zoe Kazan plays Alice, the girl in question. She joins a wagon train with her sickly brother (Jefferson May) and his loyal dog. On the trail, she finds hardship and peril. Alice befriends the wagon-master, Billy Krapp (Bill Heck) and his friend, Mr. Arthur (Grainger Hines) who admires her strength and takes pity on her dilemmas. This is the longest section of the film and it goes on and on. Its leisurely-paced storytelling lacks excitement or any action until its conclusion. The title character and her motives remain an enigma from start to finish and the story fails to engage. Grade: CThe Mortal Remains is last chapter tales place on a stagecoach. Five passengers are aboard on a mysterious journey to nowhere. They include a cross-section of diverse personalities. Brendan Gleason, Tyne Daly, Saul Rubinek, Jonjo O'Neill, and Chelcie Ross play these colorful characters with their bias and prejudices intact. The dialog is sharp and very well-written. (The sparring between Ms. Daly and Mr. R is the film's highlight.) This allegorical tale is tinged in sadness and filled with underlying wisdom of which the filmmakers excel. Grade: B+The Coen Brothers have created a film that is as uneven as its source material but thoroughly unique and quite satisfying. Hopefully, many will partake of this moviegoing experience. Overall Grade: B",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

AKA - crap.
Except these b-sides and outtakes are little more than snippets of violence porn. Frankly, if it weren't for the non-stop gibberish I'd say this is a compilation of Quentin Tarantino's leftover junk.
At least the jaunty singing and humour redeem the first section with Tim Blake Nelson. But the James Franco section is just cheap irony wrapped in gratuitous violence. By the third section, with Liam Neeson, I wanted to provide the blood and gore by slitting my own wrists.

50,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Marvelously done anthology film!,9,28 January 2019,"***Possible Minor Spoilers Ahead***The Coen Brothers are among the all-time great auteurs for me; everyone of their movies is something to behold on some new, fascinating and innovative level of cinematic ambition. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is no exception to their impressive filmmaking canon: the only real difference here is that this is an anthology film set in the Old West. It's got comedy, tragedy, drama and of course lots of gun-toting action throughout the film. Its six varying segments really do add to the atmosphere the film shows you right away: it's like flicking through a book containing many different stories and each one has something to tell about the Old West, however beautiful, brutal and simple America may or may not have been back then.This is a film that shows how non-conventional Netflix's film-distribution can truly be: give established talents the reigns of a project and let them do as they please: make Tim Blake Nelson a happy-go-lucky wanderer, James Franco a down-on-his-luck robber, Liam Neeson as a struggling Roadshow exhibitionist, and so on; the film goes from place to place throughout, from a prospector, to a wagon train, to the last one set in a horse carriage.This 'ballad' is one that shows the Western is not a dead species of cinema; it's still got many places to go yet and for other filmmakers to explore in the future. Buster Scruggs may yet catch on as an iconic cinematic character of Western cinema. Who knows?The Ballad of Buster Scruggs gets 4.5/5 stars.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

The first two stories were really flamboyant and stylish actioners that nonetheless reveal the meanness and nihilism of the West. The next three stories are quite meditative. ZOE KAZAN is excellent in THE GIRL WHO GOT RATTLED. Even this one has a great action scene. It reminded me of John Steinbeck novels in which life on the road is uncertain and things do not pan out as we plan them. ALL GOLD CANYON which is about a gold prospector made me recall Robert Redford's JEREMIAH JOHNSON with its account of life in and against nature. MEAL TICKET was disturbing, it was a lot like GIUSEPPE TORNATORE's THE STAR MAKER. The last tale went over my head completely. I might need to watch it again. All the actors were excellent.

53,maurice_yacowar,Six Western tales reflect upon contemporary America,10,28 November 2018,"The Coen Brothers revive the tradition of using the Western film genre to reflect upon contemporary America, especially its relationship to its core ideals and history.
If one thing sets this work apart from the traditional Western it's its wordiness. Against the reticent Westerner, here babblers abound - the poetic Buster, the crazed banker, the ""dramatic reader,"" the tediously compulsive prospector and trapper. This Western occupies a time of noise and verbal profusion. Like today.
Also against the genre grain, the film opens on high comedy that unwinds into the tragic. The comic is the hero and the mortal doom the sidekick.
Otherwise, the six episodes draw on the genre's most familiar icons: the innocence of the white-garbed singing cowboy, the criminal individualist ennobled by vigilante ""justice,"" the American aspiration to and detachment from European ""culture,"" the settler's (here miner's) violation of his idealized Nature, the hazards of the wagon train's spread of civilization through the savage wild, and finally the ambivalent ""glories of civilization"" revealed in a stagecoach trip to salvation (in the 1939 Stagecoach the journey went literally to Lordsburg). The film's parables start in America's political Now but move toward the universal.
The eponymous opening story records the death of American innocence and power. That's the meaning of the all-white dressed singing cowboy, freshness and innocence but preternaturally gifted with lyric and gun. This is the pure America that supposedly was. But as the gunslinger myth always proves, ""Can't be top dog forever."" So here the invincible hero perforce trades his spurs for the angel's harp and wings. The ghost of the innocence of Roy Rogers and Gene Autry - the ghost of the America that led the world in democracy, humanity and idealism - gives way to a new, more pragmatic and corrupt power. Pause for reflection indeed, as Buster uses a mirror to take a backward shot, and again to discover his own mortality, despite his astonishing effectiveness in his world.
Buster's nemesis, a black-garbed gunslinger, segues into the matching villain in the second story. In a setting of Beckettian simplicity and despair, he robs a crazed teller in an isolated bank on the creaking prairie. But for this model ""hero"" his destiny proves Absurd. His lynching is interrupted by an Indian attack, then by a bypasser, who only leads him to be lynched again for rustling. Anticipating the film's last scene, the brief anticipation of a romantic salvation is curtly killed. That last black joke follows on the series of comic killings in the Indian attack and the irony of the stretched rope in the first lynching.
The third story carries the film's heart. It centers on a travelling entertainer, a promoter who tours the west with a pop-up show of ""Dramatic Readings."" His ""Meal Ticket"" is a legless and armless young man who recites, rivettingly. His opening poem is Shelley's ""Ozymandias,"" where a legless, armless torso discovered in the desert celebrates the global conquest of some lost king, now reduced to dust. He ends on Prospero's valedictory epilogue, ""Our revels now are ended,"" while his manager passes the hat - to a dramatically diminishing audience. In between come the story of Cain and Abel, Shakespeare's sonnets 29 and 30, and Lincoln's Gettysburg pledge that ""Government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth."" Right.
As Buster liked to call himself a singing bird, the reciter here is ""Harrison, The Wingless Thrush."" As his Shelley bemoans ""the decay of that colossal wreck,"" the Shakespeare enables him to ""beweep his outcast state,"" yet still feel equal to the richest kings. The tour initially celebrates the frontier's hunger for culture. But winter comes, the audiences dwindle, and that classic culture is supplanted by a conman who offers more sensational entertainment: a chicken that purportedly does math. Harrison's partner is gulled into paying big bucks for the chicken (Fake Math?) and dumps the lad who embodies America's highest aspirations, for which grasping limbs are unnecessary.
In a variation on that theme, in ""All Gold Canyon"" the film celebrates the glorious abundance of American nature - only to pock it with a prospector's hunger for gold and a young criminal's attempt to rob him. The prospector switches between singing ""Mother Macree"" and apostrophizing ""Mr Pocket,"" the spirit of the gold he craves. The humans pass but the glorious nature persists, defiled but surviving its insentient plunderers.
""The Girl Who Got Rattled"" provides an alternative example of people reaching out to each other. The two-man team of wagon train leaders become involved with a naive young woman when her brother, a dogmatic, headstrong failure, dies of cholera, leaving her helpless in the wild. The younger man Billy wins her hand, but the older man unwittingly leads to Alice's death by handing her a desperation refuge from abduction and rape. Alcie found her brother Gilbert's ""certainty"" oppressive and inadequate to the times. She accepts Billy's preference for ""uncertainty,"" the pragmatism and openness required to navigate the world's dangers. Alice kills herself because of her premature certainty that her guardian is doomed.
The final episode continues that moral dialectic. The stagecoach passengers exchange conflicting views of human nature. To the cynical trapper, people are all like ferrets. To the sermonizer's wife, people can avert sin, exercise virtue and sustain selfless love. The French sophisticate takes a broader view, positing moral relativism against the others' absolutism.
The audience for this debate are a couple of bounty hunters, the one a diverting storyteller (like the Coens) and the other the effective killer. The latter's ballad of romantic betrayal makes poetic expression and storytelling instruments of justice. Significantly, it's the cosmopolitan pragmatic who cockily closes the door on his fellows' fate.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

55,aciessi,Dusty Trails.,6,29 September 2019,"The Coen Bros. love making westerns. From the modern day takes like No Country for Old Men to overt tributes like the 2010 remake of True Grit. At this late stage, why not just make their own old fashioned westerns? That's essentially what The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is. An Anthology of ideas that Joel and Ethan conjured up to be attributed to the western genre of their imaginations. But one begins to wonder if this film would have worked better as a digital streaming miniseries? Instead, we have a disjointed standalone film that wonders in some sections and bores in others. The titular short story and ""All Gold Canyon"" are by far and away the standouts of this film. Buster Scruggs is the lone gunslinger of our dreams, and provides one of the funniest short films I've ever seen. All Gold Canyon is a tremendously crafted, wonderfully told little vignette about prospectors during the gold rush. But when Buster Scrugg's momentum peters out, the results are awkward.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
56,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A beautifully scenic and masterfully directed anthology of the old west.,9,8 March 2019,"The Coen Brothers have a curiously innate ability to be able to create stories that can one moment be comedic and laugh-out-loud funny before taking a dark turn into tragic territory. While their latest work, the Netflix film, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018), looks like it would trend more toward comedy, it basically spends most of its time in the realm of violence and tragedy. Now don't get me wrong: this doesn't mean it's a bad movie. In fact, once the first few ""comedic"" pieces conclude, the movie really gets into some fantastic stories.Arranged as a series of six vignettes, the main star of The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is the setting. Filmed on location in a variety of western locales, the beauty of the scenery is on full display in each of the six stories (even if in lesser amounts in the last piece). The cinematography is superb, only barely outperformed by the acting. Whole segments could be performed without a single word spoken, thus emphasizing the vast and lonely space of the west. While some of these segments work better than others, they all bring a different facet of life in the wild frontier to the forefront of the audience's mind.For those looking for some classic Coen Brothers' fare (a la Fargo (1996) or True Grit (2010)), The Ballad of Buster Scruggs should be right up their alley. This film almost seems to be a return to form for the Coen Brothers, especially after their somewhat muddled love letter to classic Hollywood, Hail, Caesar! (2016). While the anthology approach to this film was an interesting choice, I think it allowed this directing duo to really flex their range of storytelling without trying to stitch it all together in a single narrative (which is likely what made Hail, Caesar! not work as well as it could have).A beautifully scenic and masterfully directed anthology of the old west, I give The Ballad of Buster Scruggs 4.5 stars out of 5.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
57,Holt344,Six short stories made into a great Western,9,17 November 2018,"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs was one unique western, it's 6 short stories and every single story brings something fresh and unique to the movie, the two first stories had great gunfights, nice music and the humor was on point, hilarious.

Over to the most dark and depressing story, Meal Ticket, it was just superb filmmaking from start to finish with some great acting with almost no words from Liam Neeson.My two favorites was All Gold Canyon and The Gal who Got Rattled as they felt like a true and realistic western, beautiful landscape with some superb cinematography made it look beautiful. Tom Waits as the gold prospector made it fun and interesting, he nailed it!

58,carbuff,"""Tales from the Crypt"" meets The Old West",9,7 September 2020,"These six disconnected vignettes are slick and most of them pack an emotional punch. They're easy to watch, although the film seems like maybe it would have been better if it had been a bit shorter, but I'm not sure how you'd edit it much tighter.It's a pretty bleak picture of ""The Old West"", but that's how I've long figured it probably was--not at all like the John Wayne and Roy Rogers fairy tales I grew up watching. I'm sure it was much closer to a more ""natural"" state of nature than most people imagine in their minds, and death was much more arbitrary and capricious than it is in our romanticized mythologies. (So many people consider nature ""beautiful"", but to me that only demonstrates an inadequate knowledge of biology and ecology.)Most of the episodes seem like they're following a predictable path until suddenly a twist is thrown in (or at least they were suddenly for me), except for the last episode, which became obvious around halfway through and finished as expected. All in all, an interesting and take on ""The Old West"" with very high production values that should shift more people to my side, specifically, ""Pardner, I wouldn't have liked to live in them thar times.""",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

60,petra_ste,The coup de grâce I'll leave to the wolves and Gila monsters,9,21 November 2018,"The Coens' movie I enjoyed the most since True Grit, this anthology film includes six unrelated Western tales wildly different in plot and tone, ranging from black comedy to drama. In a way, it's like a microcosm of the brothers' whole filmography, as they effortlessly handle different genres with sharp intelligence and a keen sense of humor concealing a deep existential pessismism.My favorite segments are the first and the fifth. The first stars titular Buster Scruggs (Tim Blake Nelson, hilarious), a cheerful, fourth wall-breaking, cheesy gunslinger who dispatches his opponents with sociopathic, bemused efficiency before breaking into boisterous songs; with its mix of music, cartoonishly comedic violence, parody and surreal elements, this segment has an almost Monty Python-ish vibe. Buster has to be one of the funniest characters ever conceived by the Coens (and that's quite a gallery); every line he utters is hysterical.The fifth tale is more earnest, straighforward (and ultimately heartbreaking), as it follows the blossoming relationship between a shy young woman (luminous, expressive Zoe Kazan) and one of the guides of her wagon train headed towards Oregon.The weakest segment is probably the sixth and last, with two bounty hunters and three strangers chatting about life and death on a stagecoach; it's basically plotless and its symbolism feels a little obvious (the faceless coachman, the fog, the mysterious destination...); still, the Coens' dialogues are so good (this specific chapter has a certain Tarantino flavour) that I was quite entertained.The second is a droll vignette with James Franco as an unfortunate bandit facing first an unexpectedly prepared bank teller, then a problematic hanging. This segment features what is possibly the movie's best joke (spoiled by the trailer).The third is the bleakest, with Liam Neeson as the grim impresario of a disabled actor; as the two travel from town to town and their shows grow less and less successful, the man begins to consider drastic measures.The fourth is the more classically western in plot, tone and general feel, with an old prospector (Tom Waits) searching for gold and facing a bandit's ambush.This was the Coens' first movie shot digitally; while their eye for composition is fantastic and nearly unparalleled in modern Hollywood, I feel digital has a certain flat, cold look which is perfect for, say, a Michael Mann urban thriller but doesn't fit the Western genre, which benefits from the more vibrant, textured, warm quality of film.8,5/10",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
61,bankofmarquis,A winning anthology,8,10 January 2019,"I am NOT a Coen Brothers apologist. For every good/great film that they have made (like FARGO, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN or underrated THE HUDSUCKER PROXY) there are duds/movies that didn't work for me (like O' BROTHER WHER ART THOU, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS and the movie I ranked as the worst film of 2016, HAIL, CAESAR). So when I heard that the latest Coen Brothers flick was going straight to Netflix AND (like HAIL, CAESAR), it was a film anthology of 6 short stories, I dragged my feet in checking this out.But...I am glad I finally got around to it...for THE BALLAD OF BUSTER SCRUGGS is a strong film, taking on a heavy subject (death) in a variety of ways - light-hearted, poignant and deadly (pun intended) serious. The tone of this film - or, more accurately, these 6 short films - worked for me and I felt they wove together very well to tell an overarching story of man's relationship with death - as seen through the eyes of Wild, Wild West characters.And what characters they are! From Tim Blake Nelson's titular character, Buster Scruggs, to James Franco's hapless (but lucky) Outlaw to Liam Neeson's traveling theatrical show to Tom Waite's grizzled prospector to Zoe Kazan's lonesome Prairie Widow to the group of passengers on the Stagecoach in the last vignette, all are interesting to watch, and listen to.Credit, of course, needs to go to Joel and Ethan Cohen. These characters are interesting to watch, because these two put wonderful scenes and scenery up on the screen with dialogue (or lack of dialogue) that perfectly reflects what is going on and what the characters are feeling. In my opinion, the Coen Brothers are at their best when they focus on gritty subjects with poignancy (BARTON FINK) but fail when they try to get ""wacky"" or ""over-serious"" (BURN AFTER READING, A SERIOUS MAN), this film is full of the former and has very little of the latter.I'm sure, like all Coen Brothers films, that this anthology of short films is not for everyone - and not every film will work for everyone - but they did for me. I thought each short film was the better than the one I caught the vibe of what the Coen's were after and I fell under their spell.Letter Grade: A-8 stars out of 10 and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

64,AhmedSpielberg99,The Coens Are Back!,8,22 November 2018,"I'm not a big fan of anthology films, but nothing annoys me more than when someone criticizes every single anthology film for being uneven or a mixed bag. I mean, of course the majority of anthology films are so, but that's because they fall into the same trap; the trap of inconsistency. But that by no means proves that all anthology films suffers from this common issue. With a solid script that can tie all the different stories together by making them, in one way or another, share the same tone, and somehow connecting their different morals and messages, each story can feel unique, yet cut from the same cloth. And that's exactly what the Coen Bros. did in one of my most anticipated movies of the year that definitely didn't disappoint.That said, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is neither a flawless movie, nor even one of the Coens' best; every story has its flaws. But what makes the movie's flaws, in general, less harmful, besides the fact that they aren't not many, is that the majority of the segments variably suffer from moments of monotony, regardless of how different the reasons are in each segment that caused this ennui. Another issue most of the stories share is that their endings that aren't completely satisfying and fulfilling. With that said, allow me to focus on each segment separately, and pinpoint what I liked and what I didn't:
Segment ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs""The first story of the movie has no shortage of the Coens' idiosyncratic dark humor and quirkiness. Maybe this why this story is what I liked the most among the others. From the opening sequence I got O Brother, Where Art Thou? vibes thanks to the amazing song Cool Water which is performed by Tim Blake Nelson who stars this first segment, and delivering an incredibly spirited, vibrant and energetic performance which is, in my opinion, the best performance of this pleasant anthology film.In this segment, the Coen Brothers shut the mouths of those who criticized them for shooting on digital by making an astonishing use of the digital cinematography of Bruno Delbonnel. Whether you think the stylish visual of this segment is nothing but a gimmick or not, you can't deny that your eyes have been delighted by these visual effects that didn't only serve the humorous nature of the story, but also suited the fantastical and mystical quality the story has. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case for the rest of the segments that could have even look better if they were shot on film.The moral of the story is what I didn't hundred percent like. Sure, there's a good message here, but it's also a well-worn one. I was about to ignore that as the over-the-top violence, and the hilarious death sequences kept me thoroughly entertained throughout the entire segment, but it's the ending that made the message feels corny. Not because the ending was poorly executed, but because there was nothing in it to make the message seems fresh, except the gorgeous-looking ending scene.(9/10)==================================================================Segment ""Near Algodones""One one hand, this story has the most complex message compared to the rest of the stories. In contrast with its predecessor, the great, profound moral of the story is what made it truly shines, not the visuals, nor the visual humor. The humor comes from the irony in the character arc; the movie subverts the idea of fate not by avoiding it, but rather by giving the audience a space to make their assumptions. As a result, Near Algodones is the segment that is most responsible for linking all the other segments together, and therefore making the entire movie feels consistent. James Franco is as appealing as usual, giving a performance that has the grittiness of his performance in 127 Hours, and the gleefulness he usually brings with his charming on-screen presence.On the other hand, and also in contrast with ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"", this segment is utterly soulless and flavorless. Pretty much everything from what I mentioned above I felt that I've appreciated more than enjoyed. The dark humor undoubtedly didn't work as much as it should due to that, but the problem I had with this story is that I didn't find it as entertaining and vivid as it tried to be, or as it easily should have been. Everything should have made the movie engrossing, yet the wishy-washy narrative structure, and the prompt shifts from a scene to another offered a fair amount of glimpses and flashes of glimmer which, at least, I have grasped and sensed behind the colorlessness that prevailed the movie.(8/10)==================================================================Segment ""Meal Ticket""This is without a doubt the most underwhelming story of the six; simply, because how much I was invested in the characters, especially Harry Melling's character, the Artist, and how much I was enjoyed with Liam Nesson's presence, yet how achingly disappointing the ending was. After some of the most interesting minutes I had watching the movie, the Coens ended this mostly entertaining story with nothing more than a commentary on the predatory nature of show business that neither offered something new and smart enough to be biting and effective, nor ended the segment in a fulfilling way.The story also suffered from repetition that made me feel that it should have been shorter, but I have to admit that most of the run time was spent in enriching the two main characters, and hence making them more and more interesting. Alas, all what we knew about the characters didn't pay off at the end.(7/10)==================================================================Segment ""All Gold Canyon""Aside from some boring repetitive scenes that stretched the run time without avail, this is the most story that absorbed me. Tom Waits gave a soulful and honest performance that is more than enough to make you sympathize with his character, and root for him until the last second. It's not only the sympathetic protagonist that made it difficult for me to take my eyes out of the screen throughout the entire segment, but it's also the way this Venice Award winning screenplay kept surprising me, and shattering my expectations over and over.(9/10)==================================================================Segment ""The Gal Who Got Rattled""Featuring two of the best performances in the entire movie from Zoe Kazan and Bill Heck, this gritty themes tale is decidedly stands out from the rest with its quite complex story, well-developed plot, and endearing characters that managed to make it riveting, harmonic, thought-provoking and soothing all at once.Alas, it feels overlong, and hence boring sometimes. For it has a long build-up that, in a similar way to most of the other segments, has a hugely frustrating and clumsily direct end.(7.5/10)==================================================================Segment ""The Mortal Remains""This is the only section that I didn't like. Although it has a remarkable Gothic atmosphere, and a Tarantinoesque dialogue, the unsubtle, heavy-handed way of symbolism made this segment somewhat off-putting. But, fortunately, it's the end that was sabotaged the most by the ostentatious, and poor use of metaphors. So I was in fact engaged for quite some time due to the smart dialogue, and the top-notch performances.(6/10)*****************************************************************************Overall Rating: (8/10)",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

The last one, ""The Mortal Remains"", requires at least two viewings; it's like something by Guy De Maupassant.The only problem with modern CGI - there's a DIT in the credits, I guess that's Digital Image Tech - is that sometimes you start to wonder what's CGI and what isn't, which can be a distraction, especially when it's awesome.Please can Joel and Ethan cast Bob Dylan before time runs out?

69,0w0,"Some'a good, some'a bad!",8,6 October 2019,"This movie is essentially 6 short movies in one... so I'll rate each 'movie' by itself and on its own merits.The Ballad of Buster Scruggs Chapter 1 = 10/10
Near Algodones Chapter 2 = 10/10
Meal Ticket Chapter 3 = 6/10
All Gold Canyon Chapter 4 = 9/10
The Gal Who Got Rattled Chapter 5 = 8/10
The Mortal Remains Chapter 6 = 3/10Good: Chapter 1 & 2 are both AMAZING. Chapter 4 is amazing too, but I really wanted to see what the man did afterwards. Chapter 5 is great, but wastes lots of time on useless scenes and story telling (and there's an error at the end of the chapter regarding NO gunshot being heard from the girl).Then we get to the bad ones: Chapter 6 shouldn't have ended that way... I mean, I totally get the meaning of 'meal ticket', but I simply wanted it to end in a good way, instead of in the bad way that it did. And then, Chapter 6 is simply pointless... It's WAY too deep and leaves too much room for interpretation... there's easily 5 or more different ways that you could interpret that entire chapter, and that simply doesn't fit well with the other chapters... all the other chapters (except Chapter 3) ended with a VERY definite conclusion, so why would you make Chapter 6 be such a massive conundrum? If Chapter 6 ended with a definite conclusion then the whole movie would have felt like it was complete and that there was finality, but now it just doesn't...So in summation: Skip chapter 3 and 6... Just watch the great chapters, then the entire 'movie' will be one that you will remember!",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
70,RussHog,Great Coen Bros Film,10,27 November 2018,It's been awhile since I saw a great Coen Brothers movie. And - this film is six short Coen Brothers movies in one. Each short film is very different and full of dark humor and irony. Essentially the film is a collection of American fairy tales that shed light into the western genre. Brilliant filmmaking. I hope this film trends and we get more movies like it.,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
71,MrDHWong,An interesting collection of stories with varying degrees of entertainment value,8,2 May 2019,"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a western musical anthology film written, produced, and directed by The Coen Brothers. Starring the likes of Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco, Liam Neeson, and Tom Waits, it is an interesting collection of stories with varying degrees of entertainment value.The film is told in six different unrelated stories or ""vignettes"" set in the Old West.
""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" is about an infamous singing cowboy (Tim Blake Nelson) who shoots his way through any opposition.
""Near Algodones"" is about a bank robber (James Franco) who attempts to rob a bank in the middle of nowhere.
""Meal Ticket"" is about a wandering showman (Liam Neeson) who exhibits a young man with no limbs (Harry Melling) to audiences for money.
""All Gold Canyon"" is about an elderly prospector (Tom Waits) searching for gold near a river.
""The Gal Who Got Rattled"" is about a young woman (Zoe Kazan) travelling with a wagon train to Oregon.
""The Mortal Remains"" is about a pair of bounty hunters (Jonjo O'Neill and Brendan Gleeson) riding in a stagecoach with three other concerned passengers.Although this is not the first Western the Coen brothers have made (see True Grit and No Country For Old Men), The Ballad of Buster Scruggs has so much of their hallmarks and personality that it can be easy to forget the others that preceded them. The first two stories stand out the most, as they brim with the brothers' trademark black humour and gritty stylised violence. In addition to being an anthology, the film is also a musical, and all of the songs help move things along nicely, in particular ""When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings"". Unfortunately, the overall film fizzles out during the final two vignettes. Instead of being fun and quirky, the film departs from this to become unnecessarily bleak, which complicates the pacing and ends up dragging at times. While not everything may have worked out perfectly for this Coen brothers anthology, this is certainly a curious piece of filmmaking that is well worth a watch on Netflix.My ratings for each story are as follows:
""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" - 9/10
""Near Algodones"" - 8/10
""Meal Ticket"" - 7/10
""All Gold Canyon"" - 8/10
""The Gal Who Got Rattled"" - 6.5/10
""The Mortal Remains"" - 6/10I rate the film in its entirety 7.5/10",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
72,Alexander_Blanchett,Was not a fan of the screenplay,6,17 November 2018,"Well I was not a big fan of it. I respect its remaining qualities but story wise it did not connect to me at all. I am all for short stories but those were rather boring (with two or three exceptions) and to a certain sense also pointless. I think this would really have worked much better as a mini series where you can flesh out the story elements better.
The style of Joel and Ethan Coen was definitely visible and also their humor and usual kind of drama but it left me cold in the end. Acting wise there were a few stand outs like Tim Blake Nelson whose segment was one of the best but just too shot, compared to other segments that were long but boring. Also Liam Neeson was fine as he played well against character and I liked Zoe Kazan (whose segment was just too overlong compared to the others) and Tom Waits.
The great qualities of the film lies in technical aspects such as cinematography which was breathtaking and that movie ends up as one of the best photographed films of the year. Also the score by Carter Burwell was outstanding. I liked that most of the segments had their own visual style and music but I just wished for more on the story side. Most of the characters deserved a better plot frame for sure.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
73,bshaef,Excellent,9,20 November 2018,"The first, fifth and sixth episodes were the best, with the fifth one probably being the best of the series. Those guys are geniuses.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
74,cardsrock,A unique addition to the Coen brothers' canon,7,17 November 2018,"While anthology films often struggle with maintaining a through line, this film does have an underlying theme running throughout its six stories. Some are definitely better than others and the most interesting ones seem to be at the beginning. The shorts do all mostly contain the Coens' unique humor and storytelling. Originally intended as a TV series, the Ballad of Buster Scruggs ultimately justifies its existence as a film.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
75,cliftonofun,"Inconsistent, but a ride worth taking",7,13 April 2019,"The Cohen brothers have never made a truly awful movie - there's always an interesting moment or a great character or a laugh you didn't see coming. This film was no exception. It's structure was ingenious, and it was filled with fascinating characters and compelling stories. Even when I knew what was coming, I loved getting there. Of course, the downside of telling ALL those varied stories is inconsistency. This movie fell prey to just that trap. It also fell prey to tired cartoonish stereotypes of American Indians. In short, there were flaws. But a bad movie? They have not made one of those yet. And honestly, I would rewatch some of these vignettes right now...just not all of them.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
76,apryla-58795,Each story gets interesting but then they move on,3,23 November 2018,I did not want to watch this but my husband did. I was ready to leave the room after the first story. I can't stand Blake Nelson. He gives me the creeps and he was really annoying in this. Then I saw James Franco and I got interested but then that story ended! Then I was annoyed with the 3rd story but it got interesting then it took a creepy morbid turn and then it ended! The 4th one was annoying and boring but then I got into it and then it ended! The 5th story was odd. It was all over the place but strangely held my attention. Then everyone dies and it's over! The last story I assume everyone was dead already so when that ended I was like um ok. At the end I didn't know if I'd enjoyed it or not. Each story had a lot of potential but then just as you're getting into it they yank the rug out from under you. So you feel mad that you got invested only to have it end unsatisfyingly.Not sure what they were trying to prove with this. Life is boring then you die? I don't know and now I guess I never will. And that's why my rating is so low.S#%k it Coen Brothers!,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
77,elicopperman,Consistently Great Anthology from the West,8,18 December 2018,"Anthology films have come quite the long way, as they are a highly imaginative method of telling multiple stories through one key theme or point of view. In the case of this particular film, the Coen Brothers set out to make an anthology flick for the western genre where the core theme is death, and they manage to succeed in each one wonderfully. Some are funny, some are sad, and some are a good mix of lighthearted and depressing tones. In the end, each vignette manages to pull together a clear and crisp narrative centered around this basic concept, making it a very satisfying experience.The first segment, coincidentally entitled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, is about the titular outlaw roaming around an isolated town, causing shootouts and getting shot himself. This is the most comical out of all the vignettes, as Buster goes around murdering people with a very relaxed manner and many of the murders are done in such a comical slapstick way that one wishes Seth MacFarlane would only take notes. In addition to being well shot, Tim Blake Nelson really sells Buster's quirky personality, as he breaks the fourth wall so much that we end up loving the guy. It's not too often when we end up feeling for a character that deserves such comeuppance, and yet here we are.The second segment, entitled Near Algadones, revolves around a bank robber where everything goes wrong for him after he attempts to rob a small bank. This one is very ludicrous in nature, but it works in favor of presenting all this chaos that happens to this robber, with most of it being earned. Even when the robber himself thinks he is saved and free from danger, reality comes in to take his life away. Karma is taken for granted many times, so this vignette manages to showcase the dangers of breaking the law and how it can affect you in the long run. No matter how absurd this flick can get, it certainly speaks the truth in many ways.The third segment, entitled Meal Ticket, centers around a traveling impresario using a young man without arms and legs to recite classic poems and literature. Out of all the vignettes in the feature, this one has got to be the most dark and depressing. Not only is the armless/legless man very sympathetic from how he is used, but the film also paints a dark side in how show business comes with massive consequences. The impresario does care for the deformed being, but it's no more for the sake of earning profits in plays, and it all comes crashing down when he buys out an intelligent chicken. Liam Neeson perfectly captures the occasional warmth needed to give to the deformed being, but he also knows when to show signs of callousness. While I do love this segment, be warned that you might never look at performance art the same way again.The fourth segment, entitled All Gold Canyon, revolves around an old prospector who searches profusely for gold in a pristine river. Tom Waits plays the prospector here, and he really brought the character to life through his struggles in finding gold the hard way. You really feel for the old man as he desperately searches for what he desires, especially given what becomes of him. As it turns out, a young man secretly had the prospector find the gold himself so he could steal it from him. It's such a surprising twist that really paints a dark picture around the valley itself, which proves how dangerous certain territories can really be. In addition, some of the animals were computer animated, yet they look convincing enough to blend in, so they were not distracting in the least.The fifth segment, entitled The Girl Who Got Rattled, centers around a young maiden named Alice Longabaugh, who has nothing but bad circumstances happen to her on her wagon trip to Oregon. Her brother dies despite leaving behind a promising fortune, her dog has to go on account of disrupting barking, and despite being engaged, she gets ambushed by Indians and eventually dies after so much chaos. It's definitely a tragic tale that proves how having big ambitions doesn't always lead to satisfaction. The characters are very charming in their own regard, and they have bittersweet chemistry with each other, which only makes the conclusion all the more heart wrenching. You never know what will become of you when you start anew, hence why taking such a risk isn't always a good idea.The sixth and final segment, entitled The Mortal Remains, where an Englishmen, an Irishmen, a Frenchman, a religious woman and a trapper are all riding in a coach at night, and if that set up doesn't sound funny enough already, the pay off is equally as rewarding. What makes this segment work so well is how much it builds up to the resolution. Even though we spend most of its runtime in a coach with these individuals talking, all of their own points of view on communication, love and human nature are just so fascinating to listen to. In addition to the actors really selling the believability in each persona, all these different monologues really make one think about individuality and how our own points of view make us up. Plus, it's quite suspenseful thanks to the somber tone, so that's an added bonus.So in the end, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs may have differing tones based on each individual story, but they all culminate together in depicting the casualties common in the Western frontier way back when. Even the more comedic segments have a very bitter albeit effective payoff to them, which proves how mixing several genres can really work if executed well. If you're in the mood for a good ol' fashioned western anthology flick with differing storylines and content sprinkled throughout, then by all means give it a look. I can't say it will be everyone's cup of tea, but it's definitely worth the price of viewing for the yucks and the performances.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
78,Azanspy,One of the best western story ever.,8,20 November 2018,"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is one of the best movie of 2018 and of Netflix. The Coen brothers did an outstanding job as always. All the six stories was equally good and we can't choose one from them. Hats off to the cinematographer. He did a good job. By meaning good, this is one of the best cinematography among recent times.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
79,jwwalrath-227-85487,The Cohens do it again,9,5 December 2018,"This new film on Netflix from the Cohen brothers may not be a new Fargo or Big Lebowski, but it is in the upper echelons of their work.The Ballad of Buster of Buster Scruggs is an anthology of six Western tales. The movie uses the interesting framing device of the tales coming from an old book complete with color plates. In fact, each tale feels sort of like it was written back in the day. (A couple are based on/inspired by actual stories.) The tales are stuffed with the moments of darkness, humor, violence, and well-written dialogue and plot developments the Cohens are known for. Also, the segment All Gold Canyon, which takes place out in the sunny untouched wilderness.Includes a cast of well-known or veteran actors. It's better to be surprised than to tell you who they are.The only major weak point is the second to the last segment The Gal who got Rattled. Though well acted, it runs a bit long and the ending isn't strong enough to justify the length.I highly recommend this to Cohen fans. If you're not into dark films, then this isn't for you.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
80,andrewroy-04316,"While inconsistent, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs has some good combinations of humor, darkness, and surprising energy",6,1 December 2018,"While there are many really great moments and fun scenes, I don't think the six, or even some of the individual stories, came together satisfyingly.
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs sets the tone off well with lots of energy and an unexpected juxtaposition of friendly, Western jabbering and singing with some gory sharpshooting. It also set the tone of ""in the West, things just happen."" While the individual moments where Scruggs flips from jovial singing to killing people were very fun to watch, the segment was just fine outside of that.
Near Algodones definitely had the most fun and amusing scenes of the movie, and was my favorite of the stories as a result. The first five minutes are just excellent, with the bank teller scene being funny and well-done and then the pan shot scene was absolutely hilarious, easily the funniest part of the movie. It slows down a good bit after that, though Franco's hanging was funny and the events that follow him reinforce the unpredictable nature of the West. The ending line - ""First time?"" was a really funny ending. Like the movie overall, not exceptional but the really fun moments make it very enjoyable.
Meal Ticket was my least favorite story. Very little happens, we never have any connection to either character, and the novelty of his orations and their relationship wears off quickly. Obviously the ending is very dark, but it just was not an engaging story.
All Gold Canyon was fine, but wholly unremarkable. I will admit its cinematography was gorgeous, and the acting was very good, but the first 95% of it is a quite boring, linear story of a dude panning for gold. The ending was well done, again with the volatility of the West, and Waits makes it fun. While the details and ending were good, it was a little too plodding and linear for my taste.
The Gal Who Got Rattled was very good, and my second favorite story. The acting is very good, and while the plot is mediocre, this is the only story where we really connect with a character and have real, substantive interactions. The story is well set up and the ending, while very sad, is fitting and well done.
The Mortal Remains is another unremarkable segment. The vast majority is stranger discussions about what kinds of people there are and personal matters. The monologue at the end where the distractor explains how they run their operation created very real tension, where in a few minutes I went from bored to anxious. That moment was great, and the conversations were fine, but overall it was just fine.
So looking back at the six pieces, I liked them and there were always some really fun moments, but I wasn't consistently engaged throughout.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
81,bgar-80932,Uneven,6,9 December 2018,Some of these were interesting but some just didn't pull me in. Like others I liked the Buster Scruggs part. I liked the James Franco one but it didn't really add much. I also liked the one at the end in the stagecoach. The rest I could have done without all together. Really they could have made a whole stagecoach one with those characters that continued into the hotel and I would have been really intrigued. It all looked good though so there's that.,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
82,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Six Pairs of The Emperor's New Clothes,1,16 November 2018,"A more fitting title for The Coen Brothers' Western Anthology THE BALLAD OF BUSTER SCRUGGS would be Six Ways to Die in the West. Not only is each vignette about death, but the misleading title refers to the first story and that's it. Maybe if Tim Blake Nelson's singing cowboy was the blanket narrator it would make more sense...Then again, he's so annoying, maybe not. In fact, SCRUGGS is one of several of the main characters that doesn't only die but deserves death: The hybrid of a THREE AMIGOS style gussied-up Amigo, Pinhead from FREAKS, Jim Varney's Ernest and Kermit the Frog, the entire point of a surprisingly tough crooner who only looks nerdy steps upon the second story featuring James Franco as a scruffy bank robber, titled NEAR ALGODONES...In this case, Franco's outlaw loner only seems more resilient than a chubby bank teller played by nerd's nerd Stephen Root. There's some potential in the sparse-shot, Spaghetti Western tableau, but like the first story, it ends before it really begins (and concludes with an absolutely gorgeous actress named Grace LeSueur in a small but very important role)...Leading to the worst of the lot, featuring Liam Neeson as the traveling manager of a limbless (no arms or legs) British storyteller, who looks and feels embarrassingly contrived and unrealistic. In attempting to be Gothic and eerie, MEAL TICKET is boring, dreary and monotonous, relying on jump cut edits and, once again, ending with a death that lacks meaning or, worst yet as part of a post TWILIGHT ZONE anthology, any kind of irony whatsoever...Which can't be said for (skipping to) the finale, THE MORTAL REMAINS, an ultra-dark fable that's perhaps intentionally obvious, being spoiled in the summarized description: Three people on their final carriage ride... Seeming to exist merely for the Coens to paint-stroke some good old fashion religious-vs-existential philosophical dialogue, it's overloaded with pointless, meandering exposition... In fact, the images shown from a page-turning hardcover book before each segment are far superior than what follows...As the quietest story has Tom Waits in ALL GOLD CANYON as an old, gruff, determined and of course, gravelly-voiced miner who thinks he's found ""the pocket"" on a hill, ascending from a creek between what's the most beautiful scenery. At least this one has a decent twist, somewhat, but it takes too long to pan out (pun intended)...And the most intriguing entry stars young and homely-cute Zoe Kazan as THE GAL WHO GOT RATTLED: On a wagon train after her vapid brother dies, she's awkwardly courted by a shy yet perfect-looking, potentially cool cowboy who winds up overshadowed by his strong yet mild-mannered wagon master: the closest thing to a heroic, no-nonsense, Indian-fighting John Wayne type: But the nervous, cruel ending is a microcosm of the entire movie: one that painfully looks and feels like a made-for-cable, non-theatrical program before they started to look and feel like the real thing...Marred by intrusive CGI, sloppy edits, pretentious camera maneuvers, and futile attempts at symbolism, the Coen Brothers really fail at capturing the essence and purpose of The Short Story. Making what was originally intended to be a Limited Series... six full-length episodes to binge on... utterly unfathomable. So while the worst thing about BALLAD are the endings, the best thing is they do each end i.e. die-off quickly. It's just too bad the characters couldn't have lived and breathed a little beforehand for their inevitable exits to matter. What's here are six Western tragedies without a single ounce of tragedy.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

It is sure to be considered a classic one day.The film is made up of six short stories, and is an anthology as such. Each story is different and wonderful, though all take place in the old west.

89,david-meldrum,Much Better Than The Muted Critcial Reception Might Suggest,8,2 September 2019,"It may seem like a relatively minor film in the Coen brothers' canon, but coming to this fairly late in the day I couldn't shake the feeling that had this not been a Netflix release it might be considered more fairly. Anthology films are not, as a rule, something I thin tend to work too well. Unifying themes can often be hard to find, ideas crowbarred in with no better place to put them. That's true to a certain extent here, but 2 possible central concerns suggest themselves - the nature of human interaction with the natural world and the significance of stories. The latter is easier to point to, and seems well summed up in the final segment - the most self-consciously artificial of the set, but not any worse for that. Attention did wonder as the segments rolled on, but that may be more about my physical tiredness than anything else; certainly the film has the addictive trademark of the Coens' love for playful use of language, language which the excellent cast enjoy exploiting. Such a cast would attract attention in any major cinema release; I can't help feeling that the understated critical response to this film suggest we're in danger of taking the brilliance of Joel and Ethan for granted. Even when they're flying somewhat under the radar, as they are here, what they give us is stimulating, funny, shocking and challenging. When they finally stop making films, we might realise how special they are.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

91,markgorman,Just too many duds in this very mixed bag.,5,4 December 2018,"Portmanteau (anthology) movies are hard to pull off effectively. My favourites would be Amores Perros, Inaritu's incredible debut that uses three dog stories to loosely draw together his take on the fragility of love, and The Argentinian classic, Wild Stories, written and directed by Damián Szifron, united by a common them of violence and vengeance.Other directors who have tackled the 'genre' effectively are Hitchcock and the celebrated triumvirate of Coppola, Scorsese and Allen for New York Stories. It's most widely used as a structure in horror.Here, The Coen Brothers continue, for me, their hit and miss career with a near miss, but a miss nonetheless.It's a six story Western. Part spoof, part serious drama. But the mix of genres they employ means that the whole is less than the sum of its parts. Some of the stories reach a conclusion when the stories are barely developed, others could last longer to make them more engaging,By far the highlights are the opening Buster Scruggs spoof which is laugh out loud hilarious and the endearing ""The Gal Who Got Rattled"" featuring a stand out performance from Zoe Kazan, ably supported by her love interest Bill Heck (playing Billy Knapp) and old timer Grainger Hines as Mr Arthur.Tom Waits puts in a good turn as a prospector in All Gold Canyon. But the story is daft.The sixth and last, featuring Brendan Gleeson, is just not very good at all.I'm not sure what's to blame here. Are the Coens just such royalty that they can't be challenged? Certainly a number of their films are just not very good at all but Fargo and No Country For Old Men are absolute classics.I also felt the colourisation was overused and again variably effective. At its best it created a richness and depth that was highly appealing.

It was worth watching beginning to end.The second segment was cool too, at first... James Franco was good, and I recognized E. E. Bell from Married with Children as the piano player (wait.. that was in the first segment). Either way - cool!But... things went horribly wrong when it ended. The ending of the second segment was garbage, ultimately proving that it had no substance or anything of value like the first segment did, no message, no point.As the next segments dragged on, this whole thing started feeling boring and uninteresting, especially after seeing how the second segment ended and expecting the rest to have no point either. Why would I get invested in the last few boring, long segments when they'll just have no point or payoff either?The ""quirkiness"" / ""black humor"" can't carry this movie.

Some focus more on characters (such as the first, and best short), others on self-knowledge, depression, utility, capitalism and reflection (like the latter, and my favorite).
""The Balled Of Buster Scruggs"" has touches that go far beyond the ordinary, with open plans, sharp soundtrack, high angles and precise artistic driving, which mixes humor with suspense as it should be, as if the Coen brothers were having fun and using all their techniques throughout the story, despite the lack of rhythm of some short films and the ""silly"" transition between them, technically ""The Balled Of Buster Scruggs"" is very good and ambien their history in the old American West of exemplary way. Something common to all nuclei is the great performances featuring ""Tim Blake Nelson"" who could easily have a solo film stuffed with black humor and absurd scenes that would look perfect in the hands of the Coen Brothers.
""Balled Of Buster Scruggs"" is a film of multiple genres and difficult to be framed, we can say that it is a comedy, maybe an action, a musical even suspense, but more important than that, it is a competent, well acted and entertaining, far from being a technical and artistic perfection, but it is a legitimate movie good note 7.5.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

Too bad the bros didn't bring along anything else. Hard to tell what they might have been after in this sad little collection of pointless tales of the old west. Homage to Hollywood westerns? Doubtful. Stories are too brief & the acting much too flat. Comment on current political state of affairs? Not even close.

100,WalkdenEntertainment,A Stack Of Great Ballads Worthy Of Your Time...,9,9 January 2019,"For those who are not aware, this is a film which tells the tales of six different characters. While all our stories are set in the Old West, each story has a different theme, tone and element even when the setting remains the same (or at least it feels like it).This film is directed by the talented Coen Brothers (Ethan & Joel) who are best known for their direction of films such as Fargo and The Big Lebowski. Anyone who has experienced a Coen Brothers film in the past should know what to expect in advance. If it's your 1st time in a Coen Brothers film, you might be left in shock or left feeling surprised. Personally, being a fan of the directors work, I was rather curious about the new Netflix film.As I expected, The Ballad Of Buster Scruggs is loaded with many great elements. Firstly we have the stories which are incredibly unpredictable and loaded with surprises. Each story also had an end result that I found myself either saddened by, shocked by or was left smiling in my chair. Each story is completely different and as the overall film continues I felt rather glued to the film just wanting to know how a story would end, and of course I would then get invested into the next story as if I was watching a really good TV series.The film is also loaded with sensational talent and a great line up of actors. Actors Liam Neeson and James Franco are just some of the names who make appearances. To reveal all the cast members here would only spoil some of the film's surprises. But I found each actor and performance to be rather outstanding in every way. Certain actors also surprised me with some fun musical numbers on screen which also sets the film's tone (plus, fun music is always expected for a Coen Brothers film).Visually? For a digital title, this film is the best looking film I have ever seen on Netflix. And to top it off, it's all supported with a fun and unique surround audio track. Gun shots, animals and the sounds of nature all presented here and it's awesome.Overall, I was left feeling incredibly surprised by this film in a positive way. If you're expecting a guns blazing western, you're in for a shock. If you've seen the film's trailer, you're also going to be in for a shock. This is a film that is set in the Wild West, telling 6 stories all loaded with unpredictable paths that will leave audience members filled with many different emotions. I for one really enjoyed this film, but being a Coen Brothers film, the humour and style isn't for all. If you're seeking something different with some style and creative flare, this might be for you. I personally had a great time.8.8/10

There's also a good chance you'll miss some of the film because you're hiding behind your hands. It's scary, it's gruesome, it's funny, it's sad. Are you coming or are you going? You'll be on the edge of your seat, stuffed at the back of your seat. You'll definitely be awake - though you may feel like this is a nightmare!.

A film which shows that music truly is more effective than talking. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a bunch of vignettes put together in the ole west.The stand out vignettes are the Tom Waits one and the Zoe Kazan one. Pretty good acting all around.

103,patriciogl10,Not truly worth it.,6,10 November 2019,"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs functions as the equivalent of an EP in music. Because it deals with 6 different stories, all of them uneven in terms of quality and entertainment. Arguably the only interesting ones are the last two, The Gal Who Got Rattled and The Mortal Remains. Both feature Coen-esque stories that unfold in unexpected ways and it keep the tension arising until climax.So if I had to evaluate this collection of stories as a whole, I would rank it with a 6, mainly because of the last two segments. As for the other ones, they felt so bland and uninspired, dreadful and forgettable. It's been a while since the Coen brothers have released a work worthy of their legacy as directors and storytellers. This effort feels completely unnecessary and is certainly not redeeming in any way.I can't bring myself to recommend this film whatsoever, but who knows?

109,gabriel_sanchez,Six small movies,7,19 May 2019,"Six stories. The only correlation between them is the Old West theme. The movie starts out as a dark comedy musical of sorts, but, as it progresses, it becomes some sort of dark musical; the comedy is replaced by some dark humor. The first tale, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, sets out the movie's standards so high that the last 5 tales can't follow through. The second tale is good, ironic. The third tale is downright dark, no comedy at all there. Same goes for the fourth tale. Those two sour the movie a lot. Specially the third tale. It sets the standards so low that you start to wonder what might come next. The fifth tale is sad too, but epic. The last tale is boring and should be forgotten.All in all, it's not like watching 6 small movies bundled up into 1, it IS 6 small movies bundle up into 1. They all play with the ""hard life in the Old West"", ""death as a minor thing in life"", ""being successful at all costs"", and the dark tone of human nature.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

Stylistically I can see what was trying to be achieved through several short stories, but I didn't feel the end product showed the strengths of the tales properly.Cinematically, this film is flawless; no expense was spared on set design as panoramic shots of the American countryside. Costume design and casting was also meticulous, with astute decisions made to cast certain people in for parts they wouldn't normally be cast in. Some of the stories too were genuinely interesting, but as soon as any investment was reached, it would end for another tale to begin.Overall, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is an interesting experiment and for a fan is probably worth the watch.

Also the fourth story was good, that of the crippled annoying storytelling lad who gets what he deserves later on lol. The cinematography was extraordinary but then again only for the first four stories. After that it was a pain to sit through honestly. The stories that I liked passed like a breeze but the remaining parts literally felt like 3 hours long. The dialogue was plain bad and really uninteresting overall. It tried to be Tarantonoesque but failed really badly. It's really hard to write gripping dialogues like Tarantino and only he can capture your attention for even three hours that too with only dialogues. For eg. Hateful 8. But this is not that. It's very very boring and I was in the brink of dozing due to how bad it was. Was very pleased in the beginning and had planned on giving it a 9/10 but slowly it started becoming unbearable.

116,Jared_Andrews,Watch the first two stories,7,18 December 2018,"I'm not sure if I have ever seen a more eclectic mix of stories. Sure, going in I understood that this movie was comprised of six independent vignettes, but I assumed they would have some similar elements other than they all take place in the old west. Nope. That's it. That's the only common thread between them. Other than that, they could not be more different.The first of the stories will tickle you. It's the one for which the movie is named, and it delivers something silly, fun and oddly hilarious. Buster Scruggs galivants around as if he is the baddest man on the planet, who also happens to be well-mannered and charmingly whimsical in his way of speaking. He has his fun with a bar full of criminals and later breaks into a song dance that is equal parts delightful and unexpected.James Franco stars in the second vignette as a bank robber who tests his fortune at skirting death without ever losing his sense of humor. It's a perfect Coen brothers story. From there, the stories shift into the bleak and depressing with startlingly abruptness. The third story (starring Liam Neeson) is so depressing that it still hasn't left me and may not for some time.Each subsequent story crushed me deeper into despair until the entire film ended on an existential conversation that left me sad and scared.It's tough to review a film like this in its totality because the separate stories within it vary wildly in plot, tone, and quality. I give the Coen brothers credit for their audacity and willingness to attempt something so bold and unusual. I also give them credit for making a few excellent stories. But I also dock them for making one overflowing bucket of sadness, and one heady, meandering debate about life and probably lots of other things that probably went over my head.On the whole, actually, never mind. I don't want to give an overall rating. My advice is to watch the first two then stop. You'll likely leave entertained and free from the despair that comes in the following tales.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

The writing, editing, direction are extraordinary. There is no lack of imagination to how the Coens film scenes. The results are often thought provoking. And you can't help but admire the technical proficiency of the end result. Unfortunately, these film making brothers fall into the trap of admiring their own genius a little too much. There's a lack of feeling and absence of connection to most of these characters. The words, the cleverness of this writing/directing team, outweigh the emotional impact they carry. In fact, the words begin to sound stilted, the actors seem to be reading lines instead of emoting them. The worst offenders are the scenes between Zoe Kazan and Bill Heck, where they exchange words like they reading from a book. The antiquated parlance of the dialog becomes a hindrance to the overall impact of the story. You just don't feel anything. It's emotionally vacuous because it's all too smart, too contrived, too cold. I don't doubt Coen fans will love this because, other than the direction of actors, the movie is so well done, so you're-supposed-to-like-it, that you can't help admire it. But become involved in the actual characters? Heck no. As this film progresses, it all becomes a bit of a slog - pretentious, superficial and well, boring.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
119,ivko,"so dark, so very very dark",7,30 November 2018,"This movie is a series of vignettes, or short stories, set in the American old west. Most of the stories have at least a touch of the macabre, but some are more towards the absurd side of things, with a tongue-in-cheek wink to the audience reminding you that you shouldn't take them too seriously.The stories are all well acted and really, really beautifully shot. The imagery just pops off the screen in a spectacular way. But it's the third story that will haunt my dreams. It isn't just dark, it's pitch black. There's almost no dialogue, a choice that I think enhances the emotion of the scenes by letting the actors say everything with expressions and body language. And it highlights an aspect of humanity that, frankly, I don't like to think about because it kind of chills me to the bone. Which is that for humans, self interest can masquerade almost indistinguishably as friendship, concern, or even love.I like the whole movie, but I've watched that story four times, each time with a vaguely sick feeling in my stomach and equal parts desire to keep watching and desire to turn it off.

120,hunter-friesen,Coen's new film inconsistently explores the Wild West,6,6 December 2018,"Joel and Ethan Coen are two directors that can always be depended on to make a wildly original film. Their films contain an offbeat nature mixed with highbrow comedy that either ends up making a splash with audiences (""Fargo"") or landing with a thud (""The Ladykillers""). ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"", the newest Netflix film by the brothers, lands somewhere in the grey area between splash and thud.Set in the Old West, the film is split up into chapters and tells six mutually exclusive stories. Ranging from wacky slapstick to grim realism, the Coens offer their own unique take on the western genre as they experiment with a revolving door of distinct plots and characters.The Coens have always been able to grab the attention of viewers with their blend of violence and sharp storytelling. Those two attributes show up in ""Buster Scruggs"", but not as much as they should.The first story, starring Tim Blake Nelson as the titular character, is a joyous romp that starts the film off on the right foot through its use of comedic gunplay and witty banter.Unfortunately, having such a fine chapter at the beginning sets the rest of the film up to be a disappointment in comparison. A few of the subsequent stories just kind of come and go without much fanfare.Clocking in at 130 minutes, the film can test your patience from time to time. The length of each story ranges between fifteen and forty minutes. A major problem arises from this as all the good ones ending up being too short and the lackluster ones too long. This creates an unsatisfying feeling at the end of each story as they never feel just right in terms of length.One area that should be applauded is the absolutely stunning cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel. Each wide shot of the great plains is more beautiful than the last as each one is used to masterfully build a living world around the stories.Just like their directing, the writing by the Coens can best be described as a crapshoot.Filling their stories with insights concerning the ideas of existentialism and human morality, the brothers sometimes overplay their hands and start to lull the audience from boredom. The final story is the most guilty of this as five characters endlessly drone on about different philosophical topics such as the nature of God and the morality of bounty hunting.One thing that the Coens have always been great at doing is filling their films with compelling characters. The characters in this film more than live up to expectations as almost every one of them light up the screen with their eccentric personalities.However, not all characters get to shine as some of their traits wear thin quickly and by the end, they become repetitive parodies.With an A-list cast of different character actors, the quality of the acting as a whole is in line with the directing and writing.Tim Blake Nelson as the cartoony gunslinger Buster Scruggs is easily the highlight of the film. His infectious energy and fourth wall breaking wisecracks give levity to some of the film's most brutal moments.James Franco and Liam Neeson appear in the second and third story, respectively, as men trying to make a living through questionable methods. The plot of each story gives the actors little to work with and they each end up turning in average performances.Famous singer Tom Waits single-handedly stars as a prospector searching for a gold deposit in the fourth story. Waits' grizzled demeanor along with his reactionary mutterings keep us engaged throughout and connected to the welfare of his character.Lastly, Zoe Kazan stars in the penultimate story as a woman trying to make her way to Oregon while enduring a series of tragedies. Kazan's shy and innocent personality gives her character a good amount of emotional depth that comes close to making up for the dull plot.""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" is a reminder of what the Coens do so well and what they have always struggled with. Despite their limitations, the brothers are miles ahead of many others that try and fail to match their style. If you have a Netflix account or know someone who does (which is about everyone), this film could prove to be an entertaining time and a great gateway into the filmography of two of the most influential filmmakers of the past quarter century.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
121,keelhaul-80856,"I give it an 8 for originality, and it keeps you entertained, but fell flat at the end.",8,21 November 2018,"This was very interesting, and a fresh take on the Western genre for a change. I nearly didn't watch it, though, due to the pure silliness and absurdity of the trailer and title(Which looks more like an Adam Sandler parody movie or something). Luckily, by the time Buster gets shot in the head, I realized that there was going to be some real irony, humor, desperation, and realism involved.Some of the tales are a bit too long, and get boring, but fortunately, this doesn't happen often enough to ruin the film. 75% or more of the movie will have you highly engaged, terrified, or pondering the human condition and grim realities of the frontier. Honestly, the only one that truly let me down was the final segment. I felt like there was going to be a huge payoff, statement, battle, or tying together of all the stories into one monumental finish, but it was as if they ran out of good ideas. The passengers arguing on the stage coach started off promising enough, and Tyne Daily is a decent actress, so I thought this was all going to barrel into one hell of a conclusion. However, it just ends with some lame, mysterious crap, reminiscent of several episodes of Twilight Zone or Night Gallery.I think if they were able to connect all six stories into some ironic theme or twist, or even come up with a more visceral or dramatic conclusion for the one remaining tale-- it could have been a 9 or 10. It was as if they said, ""Meh, I'm tired. We got some beautiful shots and good writing in the other 5 clips; let's just shoot this entire scene inside a stage coach cabin, and call it a day.""Great stuff overall; just needed a little more development for the ending.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

124,Come-and-Review,The omnicomprehensive western,8,16 November 2018,"Sometimes exquisitely homages Sergio Leone and John Ford in style, sometimes overly ridiculous, sometimes very deep, 'The Ballad' is always steeped in the Cohen brothers' signature style.The project aims at describing the west under all of its aspects through its tales. I believe it gets close enough. I wouldn't say it's the ultimate western film, but definitely a very enjoyable one.
Technically, it has a great score and really stunning photography.As it often happens in anthologies, some tales are better, others worse. This unfortunately is sometimes the case of Buster Scruggs.
I'll try to review each tale separately without spoilers.Tale 1:
The Buster Scruggs one, basically a gunslinger story. It's very comical, maybe too comical, in that black humour, cohen brothers style we all know (and I don't particularly like). What I really enjoyed was the visual style of this part, and the Leone-style violence. Otherwise it felt a bit off, to me, but I'm sure fans of Lebowski will love this tale. 15 mins aprox.Tale 2
Briefly, it's about an outlaw trying to rob a bank.
Even more in the visual style of Sergio Leone (desertic scapes, slowed down pace), it has a comedic side but is a much more serious tale. It didn't have a complex plot (like frankly none of the stories do), but was nonetheless stunning. It features James Franco.
15 mins aprox.Tale 3
Follows a very particular moving stage-company.
The most dramatic one until now, with a very different setting and quite heartbreaking. Also the first non-violent, or at least not including gunfights. It features Liam Neeson.
20 mins aprox.Tale 4
A gold prospector enters a man previously untouched by men. In a way, it is a parable about the conquer of the west and its ""urbanization"". In a way it reminded me once again of ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", a Leone film. 20 mins aprox.Tale 5
The tale about pioneers.
Gets back to a desolate landscape as the first two tales. In a way, it reminds of John Ford's ""Wagon Master"", but with a more mature style. Also pioneers aren't identified as mormons here. A slow-burn tale with an interesting ending. Its ending is very conclusive, I could imagine this one as the final tale rather.
30 mins aprox., maybe longer.Tale 6
I agree with the other reviewers that this story should have been the fifth and Tale 5 should have been the final one. This tale focuses on the passengers of a stagecoach (again, reminds of Ford's 'Stagecoach') and a terror story. The film hence ends in an unsettling, american gothic setting, which honestly doesn't feel in-genre. Nonetheless, the tale is enjoyable. Brendan Gleeson. It is the most dialogue-based story, which makes me believe it is largely responsible for the Golden Lion price for Best Screenplay at Venice.The biggest flaw I found, other than tale 6 not being as conclusive as tale 5 for the finale, was a still stereotyped view of native indians in the few tales that feature them. None of the stories care to give any depth to natives, they are presented only as some enemies to the main character.
It would have been interesting to see a less one-sided view of them (as last year's Hostiles did).Lately, the western genre has had only a handful of great titles. This year, with this movie (and 'The Sisters Brothers'), even with all its faults, it seems that the western genre has received a newfound spark of energy.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

Well, it appears that the Cohen brothers decided to cater to such audience this time, presenting a collection of six rather small and totally unrelated stories featuring the typical Cohen'esque posse of equally peculiar and utterly disposable characters.I won't deny it: The Ballad of Buster Scruggs wasn't the worst two hours of my life spent on watching the figures moving on screen. Each story had its share of charm, and the dialogues, although at times too witty for their own good (I wouldn't use the ""pretentious"" cliche, but there's a certain point after which a masterclass of weaving fancy words together becomes, let's say, a bit tedious), were still fun and enjoyable. But, behind a showcase of small-scale humor, the renowned filmmaker duo seems to have lost a bigger thing - the whole sense of ""why"". Those very ""why""s that made us actually care about the characters' antics throughout all the previous Cohen brothers films - those fine but nonetheless omnipresent threads connecting the episodes together into a quirky but coherent and solid story.Here there's no story. There's a theme - a frontier conquest one. It's of course fascinating, and there's nobody out there who would refuse watching those cowboys vs indians skits, or people recklessly digging for gold. So if the Cohen bros went for opening a theme park, I'd be the first to scream ""shut up and take my money"". But, from what I seem to remember, the guys are still in the movie business, and moviemaking-wise, this production was simply too hollow, if not weak. Not because they lost their sense of taste - but probably because they didn't seem to care to use it in the first place. After all, it's a Netflix production, and what could go wrong with yet another mini-series, right?Here and now, approach of morn has stained the sky as well, but my trousers are sorrily intact. Well, I guess, as a certain someone would have said, this ain't that kind of movie bruv.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

Tim Blake Nelson as Buster Scruggs is hilarious and a great way to kick off the anthology of stories. I could go into each story individually, but that could take forever so I'll mention the one that has stuck with me the longest. Meal Ticket featuring Liam Neeson and Harry Melling is the epitome of storytelling and absolutely heartbreaking. Neither character speaks a word to each other, yet we understand the nature of their relationship and can sense what is happening, but makes you not want to believe it with one of the darkest endings to a story I've ever seen. It a tale that will haunt you far after the credits have rolled. Highly recommend this film and by far one of the best films of the year.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

131,Radu_A,The pros (and cons) of Netflix production,8,6 December 2018,"A perfect example for both what's possible if film makers can completely unleash their creativity, and when that very freedom prevents them from trimming down their work to perfect measure.It's definitely the best Coen film since ""True Grit"" and at times even better. But an anthology film such as this invariably has stories that are more gripping than others. So for the cinematic release, it would have been advisable to go for a redux version and cut the weakest two, ""Meal Ticket"" and ""The Mortal Remains"", which I would rate 6/10. They do not align well with the others. These are the Coens's original stories and they did want people to see them in that order, but this is where more exec control would have helped the film.""All Gold Canyon"" and ""Near Algodones"" are both OK, I'd say 7/10. They both have Jack London written all over them and give a great homage to the Western themes of fall from grace and nature interaction/violation. They are also very well photographed, with a meticulous attention to detail that is all but forgotten in mainstream cinema. But like those Jack London stories, they're simple - effective, to the point, OK at this length but nothing memorable forever.""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" is definitely the highlight and it is understandable that many people feel let down by its brevity, which is why I'd say it's 8/10. That character is screen gold and should be developed into a series. This episode summarizes the themes of the following stories at their most entertaining, so it might have been better to save it for last, as the mood gets progressively darker.""The Gal Who Got Rattled"" is the longest and for my money best story, 9/10. This could have been developed into a full length picture but it's OK as it is. It's just amazing how it builds - coming in 4th, one knows at this point there's calamity on the way, but the resolution is still surprising and very, very well narrated. This is the Coens at their Fargo best, an exclamation mark reminder that these guys are still the greatest living American film makers.So if I add up all the stories equally, it'd come to pretty much where the IMDB rating is at. But this is such a creative relief over the Disney / DC crap that's congesting the screens these days, so it should be rated 8/10. Let's just hope Netflix can keep this up - the best film of the year (Roma) also being one of theirs. May providence prevent Disney+ from gobbling up their subscribers.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
132,PotassiumMan,"Compendium of western tales, passable and longish",6,25 November 2018,"Perhaps the Coen Brothers should take a break from the American West. Their work in this arena has become well-tread and a bit too familiar, although in the case of this film, it takes a while to reach that conclusion. Here, a collection of stories on divergent themes in the West is fascinating for a while but goes on a bit too long.I can't fault the performances. They range from an exploited performing quadriplegic to a yammering elderly prospector to an anxious young woman on the Oregon Trail and many others. Although each of these stories makes a nice contribution, I didn't see much cohesiveness between them. Some amusing and tense moments here and there hint that the Coen Brothers haven't lost their touch even in one of their more middling works.Watching this film made me think of their earlier films in the same genre. In that regard, it was a fountain of nostalgia. Recommended if you're a devout Coen Brothers fan who enjoys their trademark stories taking place somewhere in regional America.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

134,Shostakovich343,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,8,2 January 2019,"In a time where a seemingly endless stream of franchises and interchangeable blockbusters dominate the market, it is a pleasure to find a truly original film; especially when made by some of the industry's most distinguished directors. ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" was conceived by the Coen Brother as a mini-series to be produced and distributed by Netflix, but turned out as an anthology film, encapsulating six tales from the Old West.The first segment, lending its title to the feature, stars Tim Blake Nelson as the singing outlaw Buster Scruggs and is the funniest part of the film, both because of its writing as of its cinematography (one of the biggest chuckles is provided by a POV-shot from withing his guitar), but it is also the most melancholical. There is an ironic sadness running throughout this story of a flaboyant outlaw who does not like violence but is constantly forced to resort to it, the more enforcing his reputation as a criminal. The ending is brillantly envisioned - a duet sung across the border of life and death - but is exectued so tastlessly (no doubt the intent) that the effect is somewhat lost. Nevertheless, ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" is a stong entry, and a good starting point.""Near Algodones"" is the most Coenesque segment, starring James Franco as a hapless bankrobber, and falls somewhere between the bitter irony of ""Fargo"" and the absurdism of ""Burn After Reading"". The story is again very funny and has a great punchline, but is given little time to breathe because of its short length.Not so much ""Meal Ticket"", the first of the film's three centerpieces, starring Liam Neeson as an impoverised impresario travelling with a limbless entertainer, played by Harry Melling (formerly 'the fat kid from ""Harry Potter""', now granted the opportunity to shine in a role of understated Shakespearian quality), who is forced to a desperate deed once money runs out. The tension and tragedy are deliberately underplayed, but build gradually, creating a beautifully woeful short. Visually as well: Bruno Delbonnel's cinematography and Jess Gonchor's production design shine the most here.The fourth segment, ""All Gold Canyon"", is perfectly paced, slowing down even more to give the story proper time to breathe. The opening's luscious nature photopraphy is already enough to hold the viewer's attention, but Tom Waits' stumbling and grumbling gold seeker quickly steals the show. The story reminds of ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" (1948), another gold digger's tale of despondency and greed, and Tom Waits looks not dissimilar from Walter Huston. All-in-all a very satisfying and well-told story.The fifth short, ""The Gal Who Got Rattled"" is with about 45 minutes the longest segment, and the weakest. The tale of a female colonist's struggles on the Oregon Trail is not very inspired, and meandering at that. A shame, since Zoe Kazan's work in the title role is magnificent.
(A minor fuss has been caused by the historically inappropriate portrayal of native Americans in this section. One should keep in mind that the film's aesthetic is an hommage to classic Hollywood Westerns, and not meant as a factual representation.)The Coen Brothers provide more than fitting closure with ""The Mortal Remains"", one of the year's best pieces of filmmaking. The set-up is like a joke's - an Englishman, an Irishman, a Frenchman, a trapper and a lady share a coach - but steadily takes a turn for magical-realism. This sequence is a masterclass in atmosphere. Humour, drama and suspense are meticulouly dosed. The whole is perfectly conceived and perfectly executed, a great finale.The stories have no narrative connection and are not tonally consistent, but form a thematical whole. Although the film is ostensibly a comedy, the common denominator of the shorts is death. All six end with the literal, suggested or metaphorical death of (one of) the main character(s). This can be seen as a metaphor for the dying of the Old West, but it isn't necessary to ponder on the film's meaning for it to be enjoyable. As a comedy, ""Buster Scruggs"" is already very succesful, and the subtext makes it rank among the Coen Brothers' better efforts. This is unappologetic filmmaking, and especially these days, that is something to be treasured.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
135,perica-43151,Becomes better after reflection,9,4 January 2019,"This omnibus Western can disappoint on the first watch. Bleak and apparently uneven, it nevertheless becomes much better after the material has been digested a bit. The main connecting theme is death, which in the Wild West came in many forms. There are many in-jokes both in style and in substance (James Franco ogling the pretty girl does not end up well here either, much to the surprise of the shallow character), and one supernatural ride to the other side to end the all tales. Though most stories are bleak (and the longest and most developed and heartbreaking one stays faithful to the olden view of the natives, which, given that it mocks the stereotypes from such fictional stories, seems appropriate as trolling the public for their prejudice), one in the middle is uplifting and given in vibrant colors. The most depressing and (deliberately) tedious one involves depiction of the high brow art as being beaten by the proverbial chicken, and thrown out like a useless ballast. The movie is dark, cynical, but accurate and playful, and the stories become better the more you think about them. Brilliant cinematography adds to this stylistic collage and parody/homage to the wild west.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

If you like westerns you will love this, but overall three of the stories in my eye failed to engage my interest.

137,torrascotia,Not their best work but still watchable.,6,22 November 2018,"This is the latest Cohen Brothers output which focuses on the theme of death in the Wild West.
Its a series of short stories with different characters which vary in their tone from comedic to violent and dark.
What also varies is the levels of wacky ""Coen-ness"" which is imparted on each of the stories. Some are very straight laced while others have strong fantasy elements found in some of their earlier work.
Most of the stories are a excellent however the final act doesn't really reach the same heights as the previous episodes. It could easily have been left out of the movie and I would have given it a higher rating. All of the stories up until the last one have some fantastic twists and surprises while the final story just ends....
This feels like a let down as the rest of the movie is so well done, it basically has the opposite problems that Bohemian Rhapsody does which is a bad movie with a great ending.
Some editing (as it is quite long) and possibly re-arranging of these stories may have made this a more solid affair.

I can't really give too much away without giving spoilers, but will say this. Each story I liked, the endings or how they played out not so much. I thought the acting was good in pretty much all respects.I would say it's difficult to have 6 stories in a feature length film and have them all play out to ones liking Was I entertained throughout? for the most part yes, there were some parts that drug on & got boring, but overall it had good stories. I don't think the movie ended quite as well as I thought it started out though, hence my overall score which is slightly above mediocre. While all the stories had something great, at the end of them, I for the most part felt let down, some I was like ""what was the point?"" And I guess maybe that brings into light the basics of a movie or story, the fundamentals if you will. And IMHO I think this movie intentionally deviated from that mindset, throwing me off a bit. Now does that make it wrong or bad???In the end I'm glad I watched it, was for the most part entertained throughout, some great monologues & scenes, in that aspect it had some works of art, though maybe not my art...

The film is one bitter irony grafted onto another onto another, told with such humor and skill, that we almost welcome and then laugh at the terrible fates of the characters.Part of the delight of seeing the Coen's evolution as filmmakers is that they never really change. Ever since Blood Simple, their bleak and hilarious vision of humanity has remained, even when their budgets have gotten larger and their craft tighter. On first viewing, there were some clear stand-out gems like the Tom Waits story, and the unsettling darkness of the final scenes, when suddenly the film takes a turn towards something stranger, but I was taken aback by the anthology format and it took repeated viewings for me to hone in on the details. The film as a whole came to life for me gradually, and now I view the whole thing as close to perfect.

152,Mara-Jade-Skywalker-23,The Coen Brothers Best Works,10,29 June 2019,"Introduction:Both the Coen Brothers have made some of the greatest movies of all time. The Coen Brothers made some my favorite films, such as, ""No Country For Old Men"", ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"", and ""Oh, Brother Where Art Thou"". And this film's no different, possibly my favorite film from the Coens, ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" is a very unique film, and one of my favorites from last year.The Narrative:The movie tells six short stories relating to the old west. The film goes on, it consistently gets darker and darker, as every story goes by: both figuratively and literally. The film can be analyzed. As the film deals with themes of death. And the stories tie together in this way, thematically. You see, the stories should tie together, either narratively or thematically, and the stories tie thematically.Story One:
The first centers around a happy, go lucky cowboy, who on the surface, seems sweet and kind person. And he is, it's just in the environment of the old west, he's forced to kill people. And kill he does, as he really demonstrates his skills with a gun. Now, sense it deals with themes of death and the harsh reality of the old west, it's no surprise that it ends with him dying. And the story is presented in a very silly and comedic way. But from beyond the surface, it's an interesting look at human nature, and bad conditions can bring out the worse in people, and even end lives.Story Two:
Centering around a character played by James Franco. This story tells of a time he tried to rob a bank. Even though the bank teller told that the bank-teller, that he stopped robberies before. He tries to rob the place, he fails. And then gets hanged, however, he survives it. But is captured again, and unlucky for him, he's killed this time. It's obviously a sort of critique on the human nature to do something even when not told to do it. And when one little crime is committed, they are blacklisted and it's generally harder to get around in life.Story Three:
The third one with Liam Neeson is about the harsh realities of show business. The main character of the short employs a kid with no arms or legs, and at first, it's a hit. However, people got tired of it. And as a result, he was loosing money. He then replaces the kid with a different show, and it's a massive hit. He then decides to throw the kid off a cliff, as he has no use for him anymore. It's a nice commentary on how one day, an actor can be the center of attention and praise. But once that has passed, they are forgotten about completely.Story Four:
Probably my favorite of the six, and the most optimistic one. This focuses around an old man who has been working all his life, mining for gold, and has a close relationship with nature. And when he finds gold, he is attacked by a stranger, trying to steel the gold he found. However, the old man prevails over the stranger. And this short shows that profiting off of other people's work won't get you anywhere. And people who put in the hard work can achieve their dreams and succeed. And also rooted in the themes of death in a way, as the story is also about survival.Story Five:
This simple tale tells the story of the importance of independence. As the main character of this story is very subservient to people and obedient to others, willing to do whatever others tell her. Now, sometimes this can be a good quality, but it proves to be a bad one in this story. As in the film, she agrees to put down the dog, because it was annoying, and to be married off to someone, and the one that ties it into the theme of death, she agrees to shoot herself if her soon to be husband dies when they were being attacked by natives. And when she believed he was dead, she did just that. As a very someone willing to do what people say, not waiting, not thinking, and doing it right away: if she only waited a few seconds for him to reveal he wasn't dead. She could've saved her own life.Story Six:
The last story, finally. And as the last, it's probably the surreal. We have people riding in a wagon, talking about various different aspects of life. And one man talks about his sensual relationship with a native. Another talks about his desire to be multiple relationships, and a woman who is naive about people's loyalty to one anther. And the story again, ties itself into the themes of death. As the three have to confront and accept there deaths. As they are either going to Heaven or Hell, or ""The Hotel"". And the other two in the wagon are escorting them there, as ""Reapers of Souls"". The short is about the accepting of mortality, and the perfect closing to this series of amazing shorts.The Visuals:Looking like a Coen Brothers film, this movie captures the dirty and grimy look of the old west. Along with great costumes, this film has a great visual flare to it. And along with the ever darkening color pallet as the film goes on. It also has a style that fits the narrative.Conclusion:This is a film that I find hard to see flaws in. From the themes of death, to the thematically connecting tales, to the great visual style, and the entertaining value of each story. This film has a perfectly written narrative, and it's one of the best films of the decade, as well as a film that can rival ""No Country For Old Men"" as the best Coen Brothers film.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

154,ccamp89,Solid 4 // Tonally varied though consistent in quality,8,3 January 2019,"The Coen brothers made a good movie. Again. Only this time it's on Netflix, and it's an anthology: a western anthology starring a fresh batch of hapless characters who ultimately succumb to the cruel randomness of the universe. It's filled with their hallmark black comedy, witty dialogue, unexpected progressions, and flourishes of violence all in a fresh setting with a focus on short-form narrative.The six short stories which comprise The Ballad of Buster Scruggs all reach a threshold of considerable quality, though they are quite varied in tone. That's not to say the stories feel incohesive, as they certainly have overlapping themes well-worn for the duo: nihilism, death, egoism, and the absurdity of existence. However, the tonal variance will likely lead to a somewhat mixed experience with certain stories being more or less appealing depending on the taste of the viewer.For my money, the film is at its best when it's at its most visual and conceptual, be it the harsh commentary on entertainment in the melancholy ""Meal Ticket,"" the rumination on man's relationship with nature and his fellow man in the idyllic and stunningly beautiful ""All Gold Canyon,"" and the observations on ego in the face of life's crushing impartiality with the cheeky and violent ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs.""The remaining three tales too provide quality entertainment, though without quite reaching the same level of profundity. ""Near Algodones"" is an amusing whirlwind of comedic happenstance, though its ultra-fast pacing and thinly-drawn main character (especially relative to the other stories) makes it feel somewhat insubstantial. The final story, ""The Mortal Remains,"" though interesting in its allegorical concept and boasting more colorful characters, suffers a similar problem and feels like a coda more than anything. And ""The Gal Who Got Rattled,"" the penultimate and longest of the bunch, tells a classic Coen tale of misfortune but doesn't quite justify its length given the stronger pathos achieved by other shorter and less expositional dialogue-heavy stories.I'll reiterate though that, taken as a whole, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a highly entertaining and visually striking film. The mixed nature of the experience is clearly intentional and although every story may not be a home run for every viewer, you're always swiftly on to the next. It's all part of the fun.Solid 4/5",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
155,hackraytex,English Lit,3,4 June 2020,"I was attracted to this movie because I am a big fan of Liam Neeson and I enjoy westerns. Know it was six mini stories, I did not get my hope up. I realize the Buster Scruggs was in part a tribute to the singing cowboy westerns of Gene Autrey and Roy Rogers especially the all white with no dirt white outfit. Like any kid who grew up in the fifties, I watched a lot of those movies but they certainly am not attracted to them now. They serve their purpose as entertainment for kid under 10 and it is too bad kids don't have the opportunity now to see them. I will say I never saw the end of that one coming.The Meal Ticket was indeed depressing and I certainly would not watch it again. I guess Liam Neeson did this as a personal project.It took almost to the end of The Gold Canyon when I recognized it as a story that we read in English Lit in High School.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

But, not this one.Coen Brothers come up with some heartening stuff in their signature ""darkly""-comical style - painful, intermittently funny, sad, spooky, but ""good"" indeed until the end of all six stories about Western-folklore (well, of sorts).I liked watching it, surprisingly; though, as I'm in the process of managing that ripeness on my tongue I do realise that this also means - I've sat through a long, seemingly good film.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

All of them are uneven in some way, and most of them - maybe all - are a bit too quick in their endings.The amazing nature footage - some of the best I've ever seen - are so well done that this alone makes it worthwhile. Not even Disney comes close in their best animations!This is especially true in the strongest, and in my opinion absolutley best, episode of these six small films: ALL GOLD CANYON. In this Tom Waits is a gold digger - and that's all you have to know.Tom Waits is even more amazing than ever, and it is truly a treat to see him in his best form again.The other five films are all good - but I expected a bit more from some of them. The actors are of course doing their performances to almost perfection - and they are carefully chosen. Liam Neeson, James Franco, Tim Blake Nelson are all great - but so are actually all of them here.I do suggest you throw out any expectations and see this as six short films, and not one new amazing Coen feature. Be prepared to see something unique, and go into this with an open heart.If you enjoy great photo, epic views, some silly and absurd storylines, quriky dialgoue and goofy characters - then you will love this. And if you ever thought that Tom Waits is great - then this might be one of the best films you can see this year.8 of 10.

Most of the vignettes seemed on par with midtier level Coens, and only ""Meal Ticket"" failed to connect with me at all. It wasn't until the fourth, penultimate entry in the anthology, ""The Gal Who Got Rattled"" where I finally had my socks knocked off. This short film, featuring arguably the least amount of star power of the five, is outstanding. I was so touched by it, I felt physically agitated with an anger that it hadn't been expanded into a feature itself (I still feel like there's enough meat there for it; I digress). When I think of it, I feel a melancholic sense memory wash over me. A 10 out of 10 short film. That story, inspired by a literary work of one Stewart Edward White, is literally ""worth the price of admission."" And by admission I mean ""your clicking on it via Netflix.""

a movie put together from bits and pieces of cinematic tropes, conventions, and clichés, including ones borrowed from a range of genres, from ingenious physical comedy to romantic lyricism to Gothic horror.

Typical Coen darkness and offbeat cinematic style.Stark contrast between sweet songs/ballads versus macabre stories.

165,daniele-iannarelli,Wonderful compendium of short stories,8,13 April 2019,"This compendium (which I'd been avoiding watching for some time) came as a most unexpected pleasure to me. I had expected it to be some kind of inane modern comedy but, having decided to take the time to watch it, I became engrossed from the start.In many ways, this movie is a montage, a work of art, a scrapbook of snapshots... in fact, an homage to the western movies of a time gone by, starting us off with an immediate referential parody of Roy Rogers and Trigger.This contrasts with my previous experience of such films in that I've come to associate compendiums of short stories more to the horror genre such as Alberto Cavalcanti's excellent ""Dead of Night"" (1945).This musical 'wild west' theme came as a very interesting variation, although the final story does pick up on the premise of transportation from life to death, with two of the stagecoach passengers supposedly being the ferryman of Hades (Charon) and his helper taking the newly dead across the Styx to the underworld. In this respect, there is a distinct similarity with previously film stories such as the 1965 ""Dr Terror's House of Horrors"" in which passengers on a train are unwittingly being transported to hell after having unknowingly died.Together with an insight into the failings of the human moral compass, each of the stories is not only linked by its own sense of (often karmic) tragedy, misfortune and death but is also punctuated by often - quite subtle - black humour threaded together by respective musical references and a general running theme of ""Streets of Laredo"" with variations on the lyric. Interestingly, there is also - in many cases - a thread of focus to particular animals. Thus, this film is of intricate complexity, well considered, well written and well directed.With some excellent performances, the acting therein is pretty much faultless, as is the commendable directing by the legendary Coen brothers. The scenery/settings speak for themselves... superb.This is a one-of-a-kind movie and should be treasured on a quiet evening at home.An EASY 8/10 for me.Highly recommended.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
166,Naoufel_B,Not Coen brothers' best but still worth watching,8,20 April 2021,"As much as the Coen brothers love the western genre, they can't deliver a film of this genre without marking it with their special touch. With remarkable westerns already in their catalogue such as No Country for Old Men and True Grit, they gave us this splendid anthology film centered around a variety of western stories that involves triumph, betrayal, revenge, amongst other themes filled with some dark and humorous moments. If you back up this excellent screenplay with a fantastic score, great work of cinematography and solid editing, not to mention the great set of cast, you'll undoubtedly get an outstanding film.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
167,kaaber-2,Variations on Death in the Wild West,10,8 February 2021,"Death plays the lead in this homage to the western genre which echoes practically every good western ever made. The Coens cover a wide variety of characters native to the genre; we have the gunfighter in the wonderfully tongue-in-cheek ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,"" The outlaw in ""Near Algodones,"" the traveling show in ""Meal Ticket,"" the prospector in ""All Golds Canyon,"" the wagon train west in the ""the Gal who got Rattled,"" and there is a hint of Bret Harte's ""The Outcasts of Poker Flat"" as well as Ford's ""The Stagecoach"" in the allegorical finale, ""Mortal Remains"" which adds the gambler, the Bible-pushing lady and the trapper. After all the deaths- and they are quite a few, I lost count - and two near-deaths we witness in this Wild West cornucopia, the Coens end up offing their audience by putting us all in a stagecoach on its way to death in the other-worldly Fort Morgan (or rather, Fort Morgue).All of the stories can stand on their own by virtue of breath-taking cinematography and expert story-telling, but the stories interlock thematically; the sum is greater than the parts because this is sublime writing. Nevertheless, if I were to pick two favorites, one would have to be the short ""Meal Ticket."" Most of the dialogue is the Artist's repertoire in which nearly all the poetry comments ironically on the plot. Shelley's ""Ozymandiaz"" with its two severed legs hints at the disability of the Artist, the Cain story from Genesis refers to the vagabond curse shared by the itinerant Artist and his Impresario, Shakespeare's Sonnet XXX ironicizes the non-existing friendship with the Impresario which the Artist is so dependent on, Portia's speech on the quality of mercy from ""Merchant of Venice"" stands in gruelling contrast to the Impresario's heartless disposal of the Artist when a chicken with math skills proves to be a greater box-office draw - ""Our revels now are ended"" indeed.My other favorite must be the tragic ""The Gal who got Rattled"" with its stark juxtaposition of the unforgiving praire with hostile Indians and the touching tenderness of the hesitant romance of Alice Longabaugh and Billy Knapp. The characters and the acting are unsurpassed. The plot structure is impressively tight: every detail and occurrence mentioned from the beginning proves to have significance as the story moves on to its fateful end. It broke my heart.

170,eismoc,Extraordinary Beautiful,9,29 October 2019,"This is a Comedy/Drama masterpiece. It is this kind of movies that makes one eager to look for and keep watching movies in this category for its wealth in absolutely every detail. To mention at first, there is a rich comedy here coined with one state-of-the-art story. In my opinion this is even richer than ""The Hateful Eight"" simply because there are multiple stories joined within one movie. Each of the six stories is good enough to be a film by it's own if treated in a similar way to the majority of nonsensical comedy/drama movies these days. Each of these stories could by itself drive the audience to the charm of the American wild-west, in an unconstrained way.Beside the story, and of course the acting of all those superstars, it is also easy for anyone to like the customs, music, and scenery; and the final recipe made by the giant directors and writers -the Coen Brothers- is no less than perfect masterpiece.

174,kennprop,Homage to several old standard genres of westerns 7.5 ?,7,17 November 2018,"Westerns are notorious for repeating certain standard themes. The locations were used and reused in Ford westerns. These shorts are some that are based on western themes. They are done as chapters from a book ,Tales of the American Frontier. The first is done in the old mode of the singing cowboy. Ala Gene Autry. The end of this is a take off on Leones Harmonica man. To me this was the best. The songs were well done. The dialogue was sharp. The Surly Joe skit ,where Joe shoots himself three times ,is impossible. Single action revolvers need to be cocked again and again to fire. It was cocked once and the rest is impossible .The gun fights were over the top but lots of the old westerns were. Second skit the twice hung man is ala Clint Eastwood. It was decent. The scenery
and long shots ala Leone. The legless actor skit was depressingly sad and Liam Neeson was pretty blah in his part. Chucking his partner off a bridge
was different, for sure. I guess his chicken was less work andmore profitable. The wagon train story had an O Henry ending. It was a standard western story and well done. The gold story was a Houston tribute to the Treasure of the Sierra Madre. The prospector looked like Walter Houston! The gold is up there!!! Framing the shot with the deer horns is from Shane. A good story.
The stagecoach skit had some interesting dialogue but its ending was pretty dull? Boring? Weak? Was it spooky? Like it combined Twilight Zone and Stagecoach!! Some great western panoramas and cinematography in these shorts. The cavalry was missing in this but all the other components were there and the John Ford locations. I give it say 7.5 stars. Its unique and original but had some fairly weak stories. The huge panoramas of the west do shine in this. The C bros can make a good western. They remade True Grit and it was better than the Wayne one. I dont usually go for C flicks. I enjoyed this.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

176,wlee08,A complilation of short stories that all ring a bit shallow,6,22 November 2018,"When you hear ""Coen Bros"", you're expectations are naturally that much higher. Perhaps that's why I felt let down by this offering. The characters are not very deep, nor do they have much to say. The best story in the bunch, from an originality standpoint, might have been the one with Liam Neeson. But here the two characters never speak to each other, which is especially baffling considering one of them is a professional linguist. The other stories are not particularly interesting - the first story about a gunslinger rings hollow and could have been written by anyone, even a child, although it does feature some very funny music. The one with the young woman traveling to Oregon is more complex but feels unfinished, as they set up an interesting economic dilemma for her and allude to uncertain marriage enagagements. But these story ideas seem superfluous in the end. The story of the gold digger is also on the simple side with nothing very memorable about it, although it is fun to follow along with the character's dogged determination.
""Wild Tales"" - another compilation movie - has set the bar pretty high with it's intense storytelling. Buster Scruggs doesn't quite reach.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

178,BillSims28,Quintessentially Coenesque range of entertaining stories,9,21 February 2019,"The Coen Brothers' distinctive inimitable style sets their work apart from their contemporaries, and this anthology is the perfect setting for them to flex their considerable creative muscles. The 6 disparate vignettes have little in common with each other, save for the inherently dark nature of all the stories and the beautifully drawn book chapters which introduce each story. It's difficult to rank the tales, as each have many positive qualities and make a good case for taking the top spot.The titular first segment is a breezy slice of musical black comedy featuring a superb Tim Blake Nelson as a wildly entertaining, seemingly omnipotent and omniscient anachronistic hybrid between Bugs Bunny, Deadpool, and old Hollywood's classic singing cowboy. The chronicling of his violent exploits and catchy songs is the perfect way to start the anthology, and its material is ideal for a short film.Similar in its darkly comedic tone is the surreal and somewhat nihilistic 'Near Algodones', which features James Franco as an unlucky thief who cannot seem to catch a break. The babbling bank teller with an unorthodox choice of weapon is one of the standout supporting characters of the whole anthology, but this segment is arguably the most underdeveloped of the 6. The fantastically dry ending is truly excellent, however, and this short gives the Coens another chance to showcase their ever-reliable comedic skills.An abrupt change in tone then hits, paving the way for the dour gloom of 'Meal Ticket'. Starring almost no one apart from a grizzled, taciturn Liam Neeson and an impressive Harry Melling, this is an incredibly dark yet elegantly constructed tragedy. Heavy on the pathos, Melling imbues his character, a limbless actor used as a sideshow attraction, with heart-rending childlike innocence. The remarkable dramatic range conveyed in such a short period of time is indicative of the filmmakers' extensive talents and commitment to building a rich world replete with complex characters.The most unique short is the pleasant 'All Gold Canyon', detailing the trials and tribulations of an intensely likeable gold prospector played by a perfectly cast Tom Waits. His humility and respect for nature make him antithetical to cinema's usual morally bankrupt prospectors such the wolfish Daniel Plainview in 'There Will Be Blood'. Its unassuming plot is gentle and endlessly engaging, and whilst it has dark moments it's by far the least bleak of the 6 stories, which is refreshing after the gut-punch of 'Meal Ticket'.'The Gal Who Got Rattled' displays the Coens' penchant for dramatic irony, in an enjoyable yet bittersweet romantic adventure set amongst a wagon train, with more characters and plot elements than the other vignettes. This is probably the most complete-feeling story, and features a stellar central performance by Zoe Kazan. Another fantastic ending makes this another top-quality segment, and - without spoiling anything - should play suitable havoc with viewers' emotions. This was ultimately my least favourite part of the anthology if I had to pick one, but is still very well-made.The film ends on an unsettling note with the claustrophobic, horror-tinged 'The Mortal Remains'. Set in an otherworldly horse-drawn carriage at an atmospheric sunset, it pits five mysterious strangers against each other. This is a finely-crafted story with multiple interpretations which is far more layered than it first appears, and should inspire the most theorising out of all the shorts. The characters are each fascinating, with Jonjo O'Neill and Brendan Gleeson delightfully menacing as a macabre pair of 'cargo ferriers'. Chelcie Ross's rambling trapper injects a surge of comedy into proceedings, but the tone remains decidedly dark, and completes the anthology in the Coens' classic fashion of seemingly unsatisfying endings.Overall, 'The Ballad of Buster Scruggs' is a strong effort by two directors who have stayed on the top of their game for thirty years now. The anthology style would probably have worked better for a TV show, as it makes for an inconsistent viewing experience as a film, but the Western setting is perfect for its creative tales. 88/100.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
179,twhiteson,Tough to rate,8,20 April 2021,"The Coen brothers' western anthology film, ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,"" is a tough film to rate. Its six separate stories are a mixed bag as to quality. The only constants are the good acting and beautiful western cinematography. Yet, the stories themselves range from campy to meandering to outstanding.Overall, I love the western film genre, but I despise two of its subgenres: 1) Roy Rogers/Gene Autry-type singing cowboys and 2) the western ""comedy."" As to the latter, I'm not talking about a parody like ""Blazing Saddles,"" but those super-corny 1960's films such as: ""Texas Across the River,"" ""The Hallelujah Trail,"" ""Support Your Local Sheriff,"" and even John Wayne's entry ""McClintock!"" So, I did not enjoy the opening eponymous story which combines aspects of both of those subgenres. Tim Blake Nelson as the singing cowboy hero is game, but it was just too campy and silly. I came close to turning-off the movie.The next three stories fare better: ""Near Algondones"" with James Franco as a bank robber who experiences extremes of fortune, ""Meal Ticket"" with Liam Neeson as an impresario whose sole act quickly loses its novelty and appeal with mining town audiences, and ""All Gold Canyon"" with Tom Waits as a prospector who comes across a gorgeous untouched valley only to discover that he's been followed. All three are well-acted and beautifully shot, but not very memorable.And then there's the best story of the movie by far: ""The Gal Who Got Rattled."" It's what has me giving this movie an ""8."" I both loved it and hated it. Timid and sweet ""Miss Alice Longabaugh"" (Zoe Kazan) upon her brother's death finds herself both destitute and alone while journeying with a wagon train on the Oregon Trail. She turns to the younger of the train's two wagon-masters, ""Mr. Billy Knapp"" (Bill Heck), for advice as to her dire predicament. Mr. Knapp, a truly honorable man, extends his assistance without hesitation or strings. Needless to say, Alice and Billy just ""click."" Marriage and the promise of new life in Oregon beckons, Yet, this is a Coen brothers' film and they don't do happy endings. I knew Alice and Billy would be prevented from riding-off together into the Oregon sunset, but I wasn't prepared for how the Coens did it. So, I was stunned and angered. Creeps. Still, it's been a long time since I've been so affected by a story ending.Also, showing Plains Indians as warriors not New Age Eagle scouts with a bent for ecology was refreshing. Hunting men was both their sport and the way for advancement within their societies. And Plains Indians' warfare was not pretty. A female character being told what would happen to her if she was captured may not be politically correct, but it's historically correct. Capture by Plain Indians was almost invariably a nightmare for any teen/adult female regardless of race.The final story ""The Mortal Remains"" is a ""is it or is it not a ghost story"" about three elderly stagecoach passengers wondering whether they're being escorted into the afterlife by two ""bounty hunters."" Semi-interesting, but a let down due the greatness of the preceding story.Overall, a definite mixed bag with one truly great story. I cannot speak more highly of ""The Gal Who Got Rattled."" Kazan and Heck are both terrific. The polite and erudite Victorian dialogue demonstrates an effort to capture how people talked in the 19th century. Plus, its ditching tiresome PC clichés was a breath of fresh air. But, man, did I hate that ending!",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
180,lucianomarzo92,"Disappointing, but not without merit",5,18 November 2018,"As you may know, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is an anthology film, consisting of six shorts, which range wildly in quality. The first short is entertaining but suffers from excessive violence that doesn't mesh with the film's tone, over-the-top, unnecessary songs, and an overabundance of camp. The second short is one of the best: darkly funny, unpredictable, and quite clever. The third short I did not care for at all, but found it to be slow, unengaging, weird, and bleak. The fourth short is a very slight piece of work. Phony and self-satirical, it contains a couple of surprises, and has an appealing connection to nature, but is, overall, a misfire. The fifth short tells a simple story, and it tells it fairly well if you can overcome stilted dialogue and acting and a soundtrack that doesn't always complement the events onscreen. It's just ok, nothing special. The sixth short is my favorite and ties with the second short as the best. While the story is not especially developed, the superior characters, performances, dialogue, and atmosphere more than make up for it. In sum, only three of the shorts are passable (2, 5, and 6), and only two are particularly good (2 and 6), making this an uneven work from The Coen Brothers.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

'The Ballad of Buster Scruggs' is solid enough. It's got a nice charm to it, no more, no less. Also, Clancy Brown keep appearing in movies when I least expect it, so that's cool. 7/102. 'Near Algodones' is the best one, it's funny, entertaining and very strange. And now I know where the ""First Time?"" meme comes from. 8/103. 'Meal Ticket' is astonishingly bland. I suppose there's a message and it's supposed to be heartbreaking what happens or something, but I was bored out of my mind watching it. 3/104. 'All Gold Canyon' is not super interesting, but it's uplifting and nice, and I'm always easy to bribe with pretty landscapes. 7/105. 'The Gal Who Got Rattled' is way too long, and I don't know how to feel about it. It has a Shakespeare vibe to it, which was cool, though it wasn't super interesting either. 6/106. 'The Mortal Remains' is half and half, slightly more bad than good. It's very uninteresting to listen to the babble of the lady, the frenchman and the trapper, and I don't care about any of them. When the two bounty hunters start talking it's kinda fun, though not enough to make the entire thing good. 5/10So, the ranking goes: 2, 1, 4, 5, 6, 3. We've got an 8, two 7's, a 6, a 5 and a 3.

The gushing user reviews of this film are seemingly all from Coen Brothers ""fans,"" of which I had no idea until now were so numerous as to actually sway the IMDB score of a film who have judged the film based on who made it, not based on the film itself.If we are to look closely at the film (or films, as this is really a series of disconnected shorts), there are few redeemable qualities to be found other than parts of it look pretty. Maybe the esteemed Coen Brothers don't know much about making short films, but I've seen my fair share and the good ones are just like good short stories: they are good stories that simply don't need that much time to tell them. But the Coen Brothers have confused things and think that a short film is just filming stuff for a shorter period of time, and then ending abruptly when the time has run out. That's how these pieces feel: utterly pointless meandering that end abruptly with (to steal a brilliant line from another review) with a ""pie in the face"" to the viewer. The shorts are gratuitously violent, they completely abandon any notion of realism, the characters are unlikeable, and they are a struggle to watch. And yet some people are calling it ""brilliant."" Yes Mr. Emperor, your clothes look exceptionally ""brilliant"" today....",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

It starts with paying homage to John Ford. It is also a send-up of the B-Westerns (including good-guy in white hat vs. bad guy in black). It is deeply contemplative. It is rich in dialogue. It digs deep into human nature, human folly and the proverbial luck of the draw. None of the 6 stories go where you might expect them to. It should proudly bear the classic theater masks of comedy and tragedy. This movie is art, pure but not necessarily simple.

The chicanery, competition, loneliness, injustice. Telling the story in vignettes allows discrete perspectives that would be difficult using a unified story line.

194,philip-davies31,An instant classic: I cannot praise this magnificent film too highly.,10,21 November 2018,"I agree with all of the '10 out of 10' reviews here. This is a superb piece of authentic Americana, and a beautiful meditation on the history of the old West.There is so much in this magnificent film, and all of it i.m.h.o. perfect. It stands far above most contemporary films.I particularly admire the elegiac tone, which the comically surreal first episode sets up by parodying all the popular dime novel tropes. Once the nonsensical hyperbole of this cheap tradition of stereotypical tall tales is amusingly disposed of, we can proceed with the sheer cinematic poetry that follows.In so many ways, this film is the definitive Western epic, and the truest and greatest tribute to the heart and soul of that vast American experience that I have yet seen. It captures the grand simplicity of all great things. Yet it is in small, precisely observed details that this Homeric telling of tales channels the immortality of the American West - such details lodging like Indian arrows in the stunned mind.These recollections are now intimately my own, fixed for all time. At random I see again the hard men, made dangerously irritable by the boredom of sobriety in a ramshackle tavern under the prohibition of their dry County - - - then the burrows of small prairie dogs felling the charging horses of an Indian war-band and thus helping to save a white man's life - - - then the smiling-through-tears of a man condemned by ill-luck to hang for the second time, attempting awkwardly to make conversation with one of his fellows awaiting their fate on the town gallows, who is weeping openly, by asking him, 'This your first time?' - and who in the next moment observes a young woman in the watching crowd who smiles sweetly up at him, as he thinks, 'That's a pretty gal' as if his imminent death were an impossibly distant prospect, whereupon oblivion immediately supervenes - - - then I am amazed and profoundly moved by the spectacle of the performing quadriplegic child-prodigy exploited by a travelling showman, who begins his every performance of literary classics, before unlettered hicks in obscure towns, with Shelley's portrait of total ruin, 'Ozymandias, King of Kings,' until finally this so-styled 'Wingless Thrush' is murderously supplanted when the money-grubbing showman on whom he must absolutely rely for all necessities, owing to his radical handicap, invests in a rival's more profitable attraction, a 'Pythagorean Pecker' of a novelty chicken, who can by trickery be made to seem able to solve mathematical problems - - - then the film takes off Sergio Leone's Italian style of epic Western in an eccentrically contrived bank robbery scene where the bandit is foiled by a cashier armoured by pots and pans hung around his person, as if with the progress of civilisation the domestic use of metals is overcoming the casting of bullets - - - then there is the edible golden yolk of an eagle-owl's egg frying on a pan like that which an ancient prospector in a remote region also uses to pan for crumbs of the mineral that is so much less enriching than the sustenance freely provided by unspoilt nature - - - and then I see that the sole survivor of a tragic household, consisting also of a young brother and sister, who were travelling hopefully West through the savage hazards of the Oregon Trail, is a nervous and unloved little terrier - incongruously named 'President Pierce' after the President who's pro-slavery policies set the stage for Southern secession and the savage bloodletting of the American Civil War - - - and on and on we are conducted along the lost tracks of a America's painful birth, lined with the anonymous and unvisited graves that compose the very soil of it's growth - conveyed, as in a trance, from one breathtaking scene to the next.The last episode - and they are all linked by Death, as another reviewer here rightly observes - is definitely in it's correct place to sum up, in it's sophisticated and witty dialogue of characters who are trapped aboard an increasingly disturbing stagecoach journey, the sublime tone of our now concluding journey through tragedy, dark comedy and patient endurance, leavened by fugitive glimpses of happiness and hope, glimpsed throughout our progress towards that undiscovered land, indifferently a land of glory and damnation as it is sensed alike by the religious and the profane. This recalls not only Ford's seminal Western, 'Stagecoach,' but even more the European cinema of Victor Sjöström's haunting 'The Phantom Carriage.'(There is perhaps also something chillingly Kubrickian in the revelation that the hotel at journey's end is an abode of Death, like the 'Overlook' of 'The Shining.' The shooting location for the Overlook Hotel's exterior was in fact Timberline Lodge at Mt. Hood in Oregon - Oregon being of course the destination of the pioneer wagon trains.)The native Americans are here, as well, of course, in their old, unapologetic guise as efficient terrorists dedicated to the starkly simple and inarguable cause of the survival of their people against the unstoppable destiny of the White Man.Here is the sad and simple truth of the American experience: It does the troubled dream of America credit, and enriches a wondering world with a deeply humane experience.I cannot praise this magnificent film too highly.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

198,northernpaladin,Uneven Coen Effort,5,19 November 2018,"The Coen brothers films can be, exciting, moving, darkly funny, frustrating and annoying but not usually boring. Not until now that is. The idea is bold; six completely different stories set against the common backdrop of the 'wild west with perhaps an overarching connection; death.
The first, the actual 'Ballad is ironically comic, placing a Gene Autrey style singing cowboy amidst the very real violence of the west but ultimately it is inconsequential and ends quickly. The second, 'Near Algodnes' is another quick tale of irony but one that has a genuine dark humour. The dark theme is continued in the third chapter 'Meal Ticket' which plods along to an obvious and unedifying end wasting the talents of Liam Neeson. Fourth is the equally boring 'All Gold Canyon' which has such a huge plot illogicality as to defy all reason and no Tom Waits isn't outstanding. Fifth is the only redeeming chapter 'The Gal Who Got Rattled' which held my attention with well developed characters within the confines of the structure, a plot that had logic and a final irony that worked in the context of the film and the era; this was the film they should have made. Finally the tediously obvious 'Mortal Remains a film school graduation piece that offered nothing.

199,BestBenedikt,Solid anthology film with abrupt tonal shifts,6,17 November 2018,"All in all, this is a solid anthology film, but of course, due to the genre-specific nature, everyone is gonna end up preferring some parts to others. I particularly liked the fourth and the fifth story (the gold digger and the Great Plains' treck) - they had a very appealing Western-charm to them and worked story-wise.Although I seem to be the only one thinking that way, I felt the beginning of the film was a little off. Especially the Buster Scruggs storyline was very quirky and reminded me of the Coens' early films like RAISING ARIZONA in terms of humour, which I'm not the biggest fan of. Since the first two segments both only last for a few minutes, it's also quite hard to connect to any of the characters up until the movie finally slows down a bit on the third part.My biggest problem with the film were said tonal shifts from story to story - from a very quirky undertone in the beginning to a particularly dark sentiment in the third segment (the one starring Liam Neeson). Moreover, none of the stories are connected in any way, and the film feels a bit overlong towards the end due to a total of six stories that are told. Although I would suggest checking THE BALLAD OF BUSTER SCRUGGS out, it's definitely not the Coens' best movie.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
200,IanIndependent,A Different Kind Of Tension,8,30 July 2021,"What can you say about them there Coen Brothers? Always different, always brilliant. I should, probably, admit that this does not quite climb the heights of a lot of their best projects but that is judging them by their own high standards and this is not too far off.Being honest there are some bits of this that try to be a little too different. Some scenes are a bit too outré to work properly. Yet, you have to admire their failures. Even the Coen's missteps are engrossing entertainment. The beginning of 'The Ballad Of Busters Scruggs' plays out like it's going to be like a Monty Python musical and becomes a bit too affected in its attempt to be unique. It is excessive but still makes for a great opening that compels the viewer to watch further. You just have to sit back and admire The Coen's ambition, imagination and style.With this film the brothers manage to mix humour, provocation and genuine pathos in the flow of six narratives that work together and alone and never conflict with the the impact of contrasting emotions generated with each story. In turn the film funny and provocative but also has scenes of real sadness.Perhaps, not up there with Brother were art thou but still a marvellous film to be enjoyed on many levels.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

202,smithpaulusmc,Them Coen Boys Struck Gold,9,26 November 2018,"The Coen Brothers are well known for their comical irreverence, sharp tongued protagonists, and jovial spirit. The lastest of their installments maintains these trademarks. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a compilation of six Western vignettes. These six tales range from the absurdity of a limbless voice actor to the differing life views among riders in a stagecoach.
The collection of stories starts powerfully, but loses some of its pacing with the third part. Each of the stories has a moral. Some of them lightly float against the brain while others kick you in the teeth. The film is undeniably gorgeous, perfectly capturing the raw beauty of the virgin West. And despite concerns over pacing, the cast members (more an ensemble) seamlessly become icons of another age. They are opportunists blessed with gilded diction and wanderlust.
As the title implies, Buster Scruggs accomplishes a large portion of the storytelling with song. My greatest herald to the film is the extent in which song marries special effects and dialogue. Nothing sounds corny. Everything is well mixed. Also, the Coen Brothers' special word play and smooth talking is razor sharp. Not a single moment needs closed captioning unless the viewer is unfamiliar with Western and Southern drawl.
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is not the Coen Brothers' defining work, but it maintains strong semblance to the longevity of their craft. It is likely the most unique story on Netflix and should not be overlooked.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
203,paulccarroll3,Change your expectations,7,12 April 2019,"I think the problem that most negative reviewers of this film have, is their expectation of a ""movie"". This film may be best watched in separate story viewings, than as one on going story. I won't go over the individual stories details , as that has already been done ad nauseam. The Coen Bros. obviously love and have a deep knowledge of films. This movie is their darkly clever homage to 80 minute long B-westerns, which were ground out by the thousands in the 1930s and 40s. Some segments are better, or more entertaining than others, but this is in the eye of the beholder.
John Ford, Howard Hawks, and other directors put out elevated A picture Westerns, often starring John Wayne, who had spent 10 years grinding out B-movie ""Oaters"" himself, but this Coen Bros film is a B movie dressed to look like and A-film. Of course it contains Their typically clever dialogue, dark comedy, and intelligent classic story themes.

Near Algodones was neat, but I think The Gal Who Got Rattled was the second best.

207,iamjacksmoviechannel,A Positive Step for Netflix,8,20 November 2018,"So Buster Scruggs is a limited television series from the Coen Brothers retooled into a 6 Part anthology film about the American frontier.It's a damn near perfect pairing for Netflix, the Tv streaming service that is slowly but surely becoming a movie studio.Tim Blake Nelson plays the titular character and the movie is never better than in his opening story.Scruggs is a cocky outlaw with a quirky sort of reasoning that is so quintessetial of Coen brothers humor, plus he comes equipped with a guitar and turns his victims into singalong songs.Liam Neeson takes another story where he plays a drunk ferrying around an legless and armless theater actor.The story takes an odd and very dark turn midway through that could very well correlate with the Youtube culture of today.It's worth noting that the cinematography of desolation in this story, and especially of the skylines, valleys, and mountain ridges of the next story where Tom Waits plays a gold prospector are as beautifully old Americana as it gets.As the movie goes on the Coen's touch upon themes of treachery, certainty, and existentialism. Some of these end in a cruel way that snatch victory away at the last second, others will surprise you.All of these are essentially short stories, performed well enough where we care for the characters in a very short period of time.Some go longer than they need to but much of the time it's the point the Coen's are trying to make that keeps us interested in continuing on.""Scruggs"" is very much a gift for fans of the Coen Brothers and one of the most flat out entertaining films I've seen all year.

To be honest it's quite a shame that the Coen Bro's made something that - to me - isn't something I will rewatch. Whilst I have rewatched all their previous movies multiple times.
It felt like they didn't really invest their soul in this as they usually do. Their choice of actors in this film was not good. It seems like they made this just because Netflix gave them a big check for it.

The story that ends the film is also superb, but I think that the real (if I'm right) theme-appropriate meaning is a bit too hidden, it might be easy to see it only as regular Old West folk chitchatting without thinking that there's anything supernatural there despite the strange last couple of minutes.

You can't appreciate a Coen Brothers offering with a cursory, single viewing, just as you can't possibly appreciate a masterwork of painting by seeing it only once.

224,sonicheze8,Enrapturing potent stories in film,9,1 December 2018,"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs tells six stories in a old western setting. While movies nowadays rarely tend to partition the plot, there's a certain edge to having each story tells its own tale with it's unique characters, setting and plot. What I find refreshing is the pacing and captivation each part has as none of them seem weak in comparison to the other. Also, each story often goes at a pace that is slow enough for the audience to process what they are watching, as it allows them to think where the story is headed and what it all means. But not slow enough for it to bore.This skill in the way each scene is captured is what I described as ""potent"" as it evokes a certain weight to each tale in the movie, not dismissing the previous story as it moves on and on to the next. Which can often be the case. This skill is impressive and no doubt in my mind is what has led to the success of the Coen brothers.While there's a quote from the movie that implies the audience attaches their meaning to each story, I'll add that that's certainly the case as one of those stories could be your favourite.

Since then I've seen little that brought many of those often silly myths together until this brilliant, irrepressible movie.I smiled through all two hours of it. What I particularly liked is the way it knows how things can go wrong without the slightest warning. But then there's also the keen eye for authentic western scenes, and the beautiful casting which is as near perfect as I've ever seen. Of the five stories I liked the one with the wagon train the most, though I was more than happily entertained by the other, clever, but more minor, stories.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

228,nyanbatcat,Well ballanced anthology Film,9,30 November 2018,"This is a bold project, not only is it an anthology film with top billed cast, also some of the stories themselves and the western setting are far off the mainstream at the time this was released (apart from the hype around red dead redemption 2 which, I guess, could actually have had quite an impact on the money this made).I dont want to spoil anything, so im not gonna say anything about: the 3rd story was __ and ___. Instead Ill just say that some get your mood up, some get you thinking, some are funny/silly, some sad/depressing. They usually end on a fitting note, like when a tiresome story gets a little knack at the end and pokes at you, as if to say: ""well...just a story, dont take it too seriously my boy/girl"". Or if a funny story takes a turn as if to say: ""thats how it happened, sorry if you dont like it. thats life.""
The theme of old western stories from a book fit for several reasons very well:
wild west is mostly outdated (just as those books)you could always take a message/lesson from the stories (with a few exceptions), just like those goodnight stories you used to hear (i hope)they dont follow a typical dramaturgy, they simply tell you what they want to tell youWhile I just claimed the stories themselves dont have a conventional dramaturgy, the composition and order of the stories altogether DO form a curve, sort of like a nice music album that grows and grows, then keeps the attention and from the middle it slowly ebbs away until it gently lets you go.
Im really glad that streaming services like netflix allow to bring back TV/Movie formats that have gone out of fashion.Im only deducting one star because 2 of the stories drag a little in their middle.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

A great introduction to the stories, the musical, camera-winking Buster Scruggs setting the tone, but not overstaying his welcome. That being said, feature length films like this please?Near Algodones - 7/10
""Pan shot!""Meal Ticket - 6/10

I'm gonna have to admit maybe a slight bias here as a Tom Waits stan, but part is pretty great.The Gal Who Got Rattled - 5/10
The most mixed part. Again, I feel like I should like it more, but in the end I just found it the most... boring? Not to say its bad, just pales a little in comparison to the other parts.The Mortal Remains - 10/10

231,martinlucas-469-207968,"Easy to enjoy, hard to say why",9,23 November 2018,"I'm truly amazed at the naivety of so many of the reviews here. The Coen brothers don't try to make simple narrative films working within the conventions that so many of their viewers expect. It's ludicrous to say things like story six should have been number five, or to allocate different ratings to the different stories, or even to complain that the red indians are not fairly represented!
The Coen brothers are fascinated by the way that over thousands of repetitions, enormous numbers of rules have become hidden away among the narratives that are produced as films, and they love to subvert and play with those hidden rules. One simple example: at the beginning of 'Fargo' a frame appears that says "" This film is based on a true story"". In fact there is no true story. When asked why they put the statement up, one brother said "" because we always wanted to make film that started like that.""
Now if that sounds like it's somehow cheating or breaking a contract between the viewer and the film makers, ie the opening statement is a fact though the rest of the film is of course actors working through a script, it means you haven't realised there aren't really any rules, just umpteen conventions that have accumulated in popular films especially the Western genre, and blunted their capacity of to make fresh and new connections with us.
So, one reviewer says that the first story is a good old fashioned western that they wish had been extended. It's not. Buster is a ludicrous mid 1950' s Gene Autrey like figure. His clothes, even his guitar, are completely anachronistic in the rough tough greasy setting of his segment , his shooting skills are impossible, every element in his story is an outrageous overextension of a traditional western, so, the Coen brothers take the genre forward to a ludicrous conclusion and he abruptly dies and flies off to cheesy bluegrass heaven.
We are now a bit unsettled and confused about what might happen in the following segments. Since they are all stunningly realistic with arbitrary insertion of death, disaster, and coincidence we cannot just sit back and work our way through the usual tropes. A bank robber has a miraculous escape from hanging, as they always do in westerns? Nope ten minutes later he'll be at the end of a rope again but this time.. Gotcha! He dies.
By now the film has you firmly in its grip, anything can happen, and it does, we can't hide safely behind the settee of our expectations, as brave old prospectors, pathetically disabled actors, cheeky little dogs, occupants of a stage coach, all take their chances in life, and we find that we care!As the jolly bounty hunter in the stagecoach says, if you can get your quarry drawn into a story you can pounce on him before he knows it.
In a Coen brother's film it's quite dangerous to make our usual identifications with key characters, you can't afford to relax.The underlying message of this film is simple,enjoy the movies, but remember most of the them tell us reassuring lies, a film like 'The Ballad..."" that is really trying to reinvigorate Western genre, works to escape the comfortable rules of underlying logic, consequence and fairness, and best of all to remind us that in the end, of course, like most of the key characters in this film, sooner or later, we all die.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
232,peterkettle-904-444717,A fine and dandy anthology,10,2 December 2018,"The Coen Brothers latest masterpiece is a somewhat complicated antholgy of the West. It is only somewhat 'real'. The Ballad Of Buster Scraggs is unconventional enough to elicit mixed reviews; is that because it is episodic, and the six stories are not directly linked? Reviews that are mixed get me antsy, so I settled down and let myself go. I loved it, and will see it again for sure. From one story to another, one song to another, from Tom Waites and Brendan Gleeson to James Franco and beyond this was a film in sections that thrilled with its words and its brilliant performances. After sitting through a few dull dramas, which even when well done still seem dull, it's such a pleasure to be entranced by the Coens again. Witty, shocking and brimfull of great performances this film is another great display of script and imagery. These elements combine to make a magical film. Joel and Ethan are in their finest form in this gorgeous fantasy. I have now watched this for the fourth time and dare to say it's a masterpiece. The great Coen Brothers! How do you write a simple letter of thanks to the Coens? Such praise gets treacly, and opens you up to the charge of being a crawler. But I am sincere; I do feel enormous gratitude. Take this compendium of perfection, Buster Scruggs. Praise is earned in every possible department. I regale friends with my admiration but often you'll get a disclaimer who says, as one responded to me recently, 'The Coens? Yeah, they're good most of the time, but what about Burn After Reading? Didn't work.' To which I said it was slightly leaning towards a curate's egg but I loved it. Brad Pitt and the great John Malkovich knocked me out. So how do you thank these guys? Take Buster; every tiny little shot is pleasing, or moving, or astonishing. Why didn't it win medals? (Or did it? I must check) I would have given all six stories an individual Oscar. Crafts, from acting, to sets, to locations and costume were celebrated for every stitch and component.

237,jmrecillas-83435,A masterpiece of Nietzschean filmaking that relives western genre like no one else could,9,17 November 2018,"The Coen Brothers latest film, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018), is another example of the absolute cinematic mastery achieved by Joel and Ethan Coen, whose on-screen film results are unmatched by almost any other active director. Again, this is a western, but coming from this masterful duo, the viewer can expect anything, except a conventional film. And the least expected one of them, is a series of six vignettes around the old west.
As with every film by the Coen brothers, this is a small masterpiece, impeccably photographed, almost a lesson in ambient cinema. Like its predecessor, Hail, Caesar! (2016), the Coens elaborate a meticulous Russian cinematic doll, but unlike that, in this the fragmentary discourse is placed in the foreground, and begins, to the bewilderment of the unprepared spectator, in a comedy tone, to go deeper into others narrative territories.
We know that for the Coen the comedy begins with the rupture of the third plane, that is to say when the characters speaks direct to the spectator, when there is an omniscient narrator speaking to the audience in his seat, while in his serious films this is dispensed with. An example of this are the narrators in Hail Caesar (2016), The Big Lebowsky (1998) and The Hudscucker Proxy (1994). Examples of the second are Fargo (1996) and No country for old man (2007).
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs begins by constructing his narrative from a simple narrative procedure: a book of the same title: The Ballad of Buster Scruggs and Other Tales of the American Frontier, published in 1873 by the fictional publisher Mike Soss & Sons, and whose author or authors do not know anything, but whose origin seems to be a certain Gaylor Gilpin, to whom the book is dedicated, for having told the stories that come in it and many others. Here is already, since before the film began this almost Borgesian mechanism that recalls ""Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis tertius"", one of his most famous stories and that inaugurates a totally new genre in fantastic literature: that of non-existent book reviews . The Coens do not look for something so ambitious, but not for that reason the result it's being less spectacular. The reference to an oral narrator establishes a very characteristic and fully Nietzschean ontological category of the Coen, shared by films such as Hail, Caesar! (2016), Inside Llewyn Davis (2013), The Man Who Was Not There (2001), O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), Barton Fink (1991) and practically all his comedies and his narrative procedure already mentioned, namely: who is the author of what we are witnessing?
The six stories of the book, which give rise to the vignettes of the film, are, in a rigorous literary order:1. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
2. Near Algodones
3. Meal Ticket
4. All Gold Canyon
5. The Gal Who Got Rattled
6. The Mortal RemaimsFrom the outset, we can see that the sixth story contains an allusion of ontological character based on a clever word game: The Mortal Remains, which can be read as ""The rest of the mortal"" as well as ""What left of the dead"", even before even seeing its film adaptation. The kind of winks that the Coen love and that his faithful followers try to find.
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs shares, with its remake of 2010 to True Grit (1969), an impeccable photograph and a splendid setting, and some of its best shots remember not only many of True grit, but of No country for old man, its unique westerns. There is a dazzling beauty in many of the frames chosen by the Coens, a beauty that is more painful because, faithful to his Nietzschean vision of the world, it is an almost sterile beauty, which seems tainted with the presence of man and his desires, as they portrays very well in the passage ""All Gold Canyon"". That sterility of beauty and human longings are also very well portrayed in ""The Gal Who Got Rattled"" when one of the characters asks: ""What is the right thing?"", no less than in ""Near Algodones"", where human ambition only leads to self-destruction, and the Coen's clever wink to the tin man, brainless, of The Wizard of Oz (1939), seems to confirm that vision of null transcendence and the absence of Schopenhauerian-Nietzschean God.
In one of the most notable dialogues of the film, William Bill Knapp (Bill Heck) tells Alice Longabaugh (Zoe Kazan), in ""The Gal Who Got Rattled"", that having certainty (""certanties"") is not a defect. On the contrary: ""Uncertainty. That is appropriate for the maters of this world. "" Moreover, he adds the following, and in that sense, it is very little of the old west, and more of the contemporary world, post-Nietzschean: ""From ancient times and past, what securities survive? And yet, we rush to create new ones. We long for your consolation. Safety is the easy way. "" And in that beautiful world, without God, when salvation, or love, that bourgeois security, Nietzsche would say, makes an appearance, it is time to destroy it, because there is no certainty that it is worth. Only the uncertain remains, like a huge opening to infinity, exactly as the impeccable and implacable final frame of this vignette portrays, impassive.
Another notable aspect of the film is the aspect related to singing, in its purest poetic meaning: singing is memory, it is identity. From the first vignette, ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"", the third, ""All Gold Canyon"" to the final, ""The Mortal Remaims"", passing through the less obvious, ""Meal Ticket"", with its allusions to Homer and Shakespeare, as well as the tradition of oral narrators (story tellers) that are the memory of the entire world, and that in each of the vignettes of the film is shown in one way or another.
The last vignette of the film, ""The Mortal Remains"", is perhaps the most Nietzschean of all, and seems to come out of the final scene of Zarathustra. It is impossible to describe it without ruining the possible viewer one of the most remarkable scenes left from the duo of Joel and Ethan Coen. Metaphorical, cryptic, critical, poetic, static and dynamic at the same time, it summarizes the best virtues of an absolutely exemplary cinematography.
Perhaps it is only necessary to point out why a western like this, of the Coen brothers, revitalizes a genre that, since Clint Eastwood's masterpiece, Unforgiven (1992), seemed stagnant and with few, or very few possibilities to offer something new or important what tell. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs fragments the traditional western discourse. For the American this may seem contradictory, strange. And in truth it is. Because one of the characteristic aspects of the western narrative is precisely unity. It is a closed world, with clear rules. The bad ones are bad, the good ones are good. Clint Eastwood destroyed that certainty and clarity that regulated the western world. The characters that Eastwood gave life, both in his series of Harry the Dirty and in his various incarnations of the West, had always moved between a moral undefined, something that the Coens will portray much better in almost all his films where there are crimes happening: the absence of God means violence without cause, without morality. How to tell stories again in a world where the narrative center has been lost? The response of the Coen brothers is great because it is the only possible one: from the fragment, without the pretension of unity and assurances.
Since Unforgiven had not made a great movie about the old west. The Coens give us, almost thirty years later, the great narrative proposal to recover the western as a genre.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

Of the six stories, about half are actually decent but the rest are either bad, boring, or pointless, or all three of them. I also dislike how drastically different the tone is between the 'actual' ballad of Buster Scruggs from the other stories, like the directors were ready to make the west wild, but then pulled their punches going forward. However, I must also mention some great shots and cinematography.

240,qljsystems,A new take on the anti-western,10,28 November 2018,"Anti-westerns have been around for a long time. The Wild Bunch, High Plains Drifter, Silverado, On The Range - they all take the time-worn archetypes and subtext of the western with its cutout good-guys and bad-guys and magnificent scenery and remove the hero role so that it's hard to discern the good-guys from the bad-guys. For some time now since the early 1980s, a lot of westerns have been dedicated to the premise that The Wild West wasn't as romantic or enriching as earlier movies had made it out to be.Throughout, the anti-westerns served up protagonists' with unclear or questionable motives, drab and utilitarian clothes, people made hard by struggle and violence.Instead, what the Coens have done in this movie is to buck that trend. Their protagonists are all caricatures as in the classic Westerns, driven by the same forces that were present in those old Westerns. Nobody is dark and menacing and all are hard-working, honest and brave. But they live in a world of hard realities, where goodness isn't always rewarded and innocence isn't always protected. There is no law to protect civic order or protect people from exploitation. Every one of the vignettes is beautifully filmed and excellently presented, but although they're each separate unconnected stories, the same central character plays out - The Wild West, brutal, cruel, unrewarding, harsh, uncaring. A place where, yes, opportunity is ripe for the taking, so long as you're ready to embrace the danger or deceit that accompanies it. You never get to find out how each of the mini-stories plays out and concludes, no wrap-up or denouement, but each leaves you feeling heartbroken in one way or another, not spoon fed with a neat conclusion, but left to ponder intelligently just how perilous and hard a place the American Frontier actually was. All in that typical Coen style, wit and intelligence. I say wit, but not necessarily humour, as it's hard to find humour in the subtext to this movie.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

I love the Coen brothers, and I watched this with an open heart. Not every Coen brothers movie knocks it out of the park, but all of them are at least smart and interesting. The same holds true for this one, though I'm sorry to say that I found myself bored throughout most of it.Six stories is a lot to process in one sitting. The problem for me was that I would be watching one of the segments, trying to understand its significance or find something to appreciate story-wise, and then we moved on to the next tale.There was nothing wrong with it and I would consider watching it again some time with a fresh perspective. This movie did seem to have a grasp on itself and I trust that the Coens knew what they were doing. It was very unique and beautifully shot, but I think this one ranks low on the Coen's filmography.

I felt the actors did wonderful performances for each story but I just felt a little weird by the end, wondering if there was fully any point.The true western style living is easily portrayed here, from rotten teeth to the harsh reality of a western frontier that was deadly by many factors. It also portrayed the people of the time very accurately and to some degree it still cleaned it up a bit too.

Each of the stories are unrelated but share a theme. All are offbeat and keep u guessing. Wonderful performances from a stellar cast. I loved all the cameos.
It put me in mind of the old tv series "" Alfred Hitcock presents"" where Mr Hitchcock would introduce a theme relating to a quirky or suprising 20 minute episode which followed. I feel the Coen bros could have presented these stories similarly..the viewer could then pick and choose an episode to watch or binge watch the Lot.

252,The_Film_Auditor,Fun Anthology Film,7,29 January 2019,"The best word to describe The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is variety. The film has a lot of diversity in its themes, tone, and storylines, which makes for an engaging film. Sort of a Western anthology, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a collection of short stories that take place in the days of the Wild West. Throughout the short stories, extreme violence, funny moments, and unique characters provide a cohesive structure for the anthology. However, when dealing with a collection of stories, there are always ones that are better and ones that are worse. For me personally, I really enjoyed Meal Ticket, Mortal Remains, All Gold Canyon, and The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, but did not care for Near Algodones and The Girl Who Rattled. This difference in quality makes it hard to rate the film in total because the group of stories is only as good as its weakest link. If the Coen Brothers would have cut out one of the weaker storylines, I would have considered this an excellent anthology film (similar to Creepshow), but instead, the somewhat inconsistent quality hurt the film.Despite some weaker storylines, there are a lot of other great things about this movie.

But in those kind of films, rarely do we appreciate all the stories, there are always some better than the others. It's a good genre film, but what I don't like is the fact that emotions are just cut off when it begins to show, and other emotions are shown and then cut off, and so on ... To bring you to a ""not very special"" ending ...",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

His story (one of six stories in the film) was by far the most interesting.All of the stories (except for the last one, which was just The Hateful Eight condensed to 10 mins.) were fantastic, but The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (the first story, not the movie) was unique. I love unique. It was both lighthearted and brutal. Cruel, but fun. It reminds the audience that eventually everything ends and a legend (or genre) will soon be replaced by a new one, like it or not.The other stories were more grimey, dark, and serious, like every western for several decades. And that's the problem. I still enjoy the grungy, realistic frontier, but the first story was refreshing and I wanted more of it.All of the actors were wonderful. And, like always, the Coens are great at making the audience shut up and pay attention. Throughout the movie are hauntingly quiet moments (mixed with realistic sound effects) that help you focus on the characters and the unforgiving environment they're trapped in. Sometimes it ambushes you with powerful music and exciting action.A majestic movie.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

The appearance of singing gunslinger Buster Scruggs tells us right from the start that we are in for something very much out of the ordinary run-of-the-mill western.
The tales are told with intensity, and brilliant camerawork which embraces us entirely in what is going on.
Each tale is its own metaphor of life and death, perhaps more death than life, espeically in the final segment. I think the most telling line, quoted a lot here on imdb, is the man asking ""first time for you?"" To avoid a spoiler I won't explain the context.
It is one of those movies that could be watched over and over and you would find something new tucked away in there each time.

The creators of the movie don't need introducing and I thought the idea of 6 short stories in one movie could be intriguing.The movie actually starts off really well, the first story has a Tarantino/Fargo sort of feel to it and had me excited for what I thought would be an awesome movie.Sadly from there it goes downhill. Badly. James Franco's segment is very good and there is some great acting on show throughout the full movie, but the last 4 stories are incredibly boring to sit through.The cinematography is phenomenal and the movie definitely shows some (at times very dark) of how the Wild West was in the past, so in that respect it definitely achieves what it set out to do.This is a very unique movie and one for the purists I think. I fully understand the multiple positive reviews, but I watch movies for enjoyment, and even slow movies can be done right to be enjoyed. This one didn't work for me.Lastly, I thought perhaps the 6 stories would come round to a finish that has them all come together.

273,Koma-Mo,An anthology film that fans of the Coens can enjoy.,9,16 September 2019,"For fans of their work, this anthology film carries every single element that people have enjoyed from the Coens. Each short story was shot very well and I enjoyed just looking at how great the film looks due to how the Coens were able to capture the feel of a western using different styles that they have incorporated into their films. You see everything from from the comedic side of ""Raising Arizona"" to the seriousness of ""No Country for Old Men.""Not everything was a hit, so I'll go over in order from the best to the worst. Starting from the best, ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,"" is a musical that blends well with the absurd humor. Being a great way to start off the anthology, I enjoyed all of the songs and laughed quite a bit as we go on this goofy journey with this outlaw. It's silly and has a great sense of humor that the Coens were able to deliver very well. The other story I thought was the best was ""The Gal Who Got Rattled."" As it's a more serious tale with a bit of romance sprinkled onto it, you go on this journey with the protagonist and you see the romance that has blossomed. The story is very linear and I did buy the romance that you are witnessing here. However, this story brings such an impact to where when things do go bad, it will hit you hard. I cried at this part and this wouldn't happen if it weren't for the great performances and a well structured story from the Coens.The ones that were decent were ""Meal Ticket, ""All Gold Canyon"" and ""The Mortal Remains.""
""Meal Ticket"" is a very grim and bleak tale that works very well when you see what happens at the end, but the whole story was a little slow and had such a slow pace, compared to the others, to where I had myself wondering what the Coens wanted to do here. I did like how there is very little dialogue here and you can tell what is going on in the mind of the characters based on the expressions from the actors. This goes along with ""All Gold Canyon."" It was shot very well and the tension that does pop up during the story does give life to the story. However, despite that, there was nothing really going on until the climax and you are just simply watching a man looking for gold, wondering what will happen. With ""The Mortal Remains,"" it does lack the punch that mirrors what was introduced in the first short, especially as it is the last story of this film. I did, however, liked the ambiguity of what was happening and allowed us to speculate what was going on. The tone worked well and the interactions between these characters was mostly nice to watch. The humor didn't hit home for me, but the overall plot worked.The weakest one was ""Near Algodones."" It started strong, but lead to an ending that fell flat on its face with a punchline that I thought that didn't work. Also, I thought that James Franco just wasn't able to deliver and felt that he gave the weakest performance of them all.I'm glad that this film was made and despite some of the hiccups, it's still a great anthology film and I do consider this as one of the Coens best films in their filmography.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

278,jerryp65,Expected a bit more,6,2 December 2018,"When you hear that the Coen brothers have done it again one may get curious to see what the fuss is about. I did as I am a lover of their work as it's mostly entertaining and out of the box. I enjoy watching unusual stuff with a weird edge. Initially I thought this flick was going to be entirely about Buster Scruggs, which to me was good and bad. Good as I thought that his fast gunslinging and accent were funny, and not so good because I simply do not like musicals which I thought I was going to end up watching. Perhaps a different title would have been more suitable for this collection of western stories? I liked how they opened each story ""by the book"" to give the viewer the feeling it was based on a real book.As for the stories themselves, I must conclude some where funny and exciting and others were too long and a tad boring. They should've perhaps cut it down to about an hour and a half. Now I am a big fan of Tom Waits so I could be biast but I thought that particular part was good. By the way, I wish he would act more as he's good at that too. The story with the robber trying to kill that 'panhandler' was interesting as well. The one about Alice Longabaugh, the crippled actor and the story about the ride in the stagecoach dragged on too long. Sometimes I thought, yes I get the point, let's crack on..Nevertheless, to conclude, it was different in a positive way, and although it was long and sometimes long trek, I did enjoy it, possible because I know the Coen Brothers always come up with something that's worth a view...",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

284,mshackletonchavez,My First Anthology Film.,7,21 December 2018,"Certainly among the most unique of features that I have ever seen. This film has a lot of threads, some better than others, but overall a rather engaging experience.The Coen brothers have brought their class, wit and mastery of the western genre to this film. I genuinely believe they are the best director(s) that can do Westerns in this day and age. The style of this picture is most intriguing, for this is an anthology of much shorter stories. Which I shall go through, one at a time.The stories are not connected, other than their in the same picture and belong in one book. But have separate casts, styles and plots. But all are set in the same rough period. They are in order: The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, Near Algodones, Meal Ticket, All Gold Canyon, The Gal Who Got Rattled and finally The Mortal Remains. I found for the fifth (The Gal Who Got Rattled) to be the strongest and for Meal Ticket to be the weakest.Our opening is, 'The Ballad of Buster Scruggs'. This is a lawdy cowboy of mr Buster Scruggs, portrayed with finesse by Tim Blake Nelson. He is a very caricatured fellow of the old west. The cartoon cowboy, nice clothes, all the same colour, good with a gun, a fine speaker. And Tim Blake Nelson has brought his own rendition, helped by the Coen brothers directorial prowess. The ballad itself is fairly fun, simply being a note of characterisation before a surprise demise. The colours are fairly fair, dare I say unpronounced (However this is the Coen brothers first venture into digital photography), but overall a fun opening.The second is, 'Near Algodones' - This one has received the most outside attention, mot notably for its witty lead character 'Cowboy' portrayed by James Franco. This one is quite the shift from the previous, this one is more quiet although it has character, but is also equally over the top. But is inherent comedy is stronger than the previous instalment, and I may ay more enjoyable, although the lead character is somewhat weaker.In the third ballad comes: 'Meal Ticket', this one I felt was the weakest of the six. Although Liam Neeson and Harry Melling were well matched, and compliment each others performances well. However I felt that the emotion it was attempting to evoke was not present, for I had little reason to care. I felt for the characterisation to be strong, but the release to be weak. Thus I felt that it was rather weak, although the performances were it's strongpoint, it dragged a little and may I even say became boring. I also felt that the colour of this one was rather boring, all night times, not particularly vibrant other than in the brothel and makeup. although the cinematography was rather inventive and certainly more unique than the other ballads of this anthology. I just personally wasn't sold by it.The Gold Canyon was certainly the most inventive of the six, as well as a close first for being the most visually beautiful. It may have less than a couple pages of script, bit in its silence brings a tonally magnificent, visually stunning, and quite heartwarming tale. For Tom Waits as the Prospector is quite a subdued performance, he says but a little, but his love for gold and love of solitude is most evident in his mannerisms. The cinematography in this ballad is simply gorgeous, it is consistent, touching and extremely vibrant, truly best that digital recording can do (although I still believe it to be inferior to film). Overall this is perhaps the second best of the ballads, only behind...The Gal Who Got Rattled is the title of my favourite of the ballads, for I believe it to have the most emotional weight, the most explored and has the greatest characterisation. Although throughout all the ballads, its strength of characterisation is great, I believe for this ballad to have taken the lead. The Coen brothers have delivered a piece of great strength, though this is their first venture into digital photography, here they surpass most others in pure quality, the hues of brown and the vast blue sky dominate this feature. Along with the strengths of digital photography during the night, it plays to the strengths of the medium and not against it. In addition to this, while the set design is fairly standard of a western, one did feel immersed in the atmosphere, despite being five ballads into the feature. This ballad feels the most emotional of the five, I believe for it to have the most fleshed out characters, the most superior set and costume design and the best screenplay. It also has a fully fledged three act narrative, along with it being on the longer side of the ballads, it feels the most developed. As if it could be an entire feature on its own, but does not feel rushed or cramped, it is tonally extremely consistent and strong, balancing the adventure spirit, with fear, comedy and drama to a higher degree than the other ballads. Zoe Kazan as Alice Longabaugh and Bill Heck as William Knapp had a great dynamic, and played off each others presence very well. Their performances, particularly Kazan were among the strongest of the film as a whole. Grainger Hines as Mr. Arthur was a surprise at the end, though I had thought he would pass on without any moments, for what time he had at the end, he was a very strong performance. The ballad felt not cliche nor forced, a real achievement as a whole within the entire western genre. Overall this was my favourite of the ballads, and in particular due to Kazan and Hines' performances and the mastery displayed by the Coen brothers from multiple aspects within it.The sixth and final of the anthology is: 'The Mortal Remains', this was certainly a peculiar feature, although more on the standard side within this film. It follows a group of five travellers in a stagecoach, portrayed by: Tyne Daly as Mrs. Betjeman, Brendan Gleeson as Clarence, Jonjo O'Neill as Thigpen, Saul Rubinek as René and Chelcie Ross as the trapper. They all have differing opinions, and somewhat gang up on the elderly lady. There is nothing particularly special about this ballad, other than the swashbuckling dialogue and faint stylistic colouration. It was somewhat a disappointing ending to what was a rather enjoyable motion picture as a whole.I would give each one out of a possible five:
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, 3.5Near Algodones, 3Meal Ticket, 2All Gold Canyon, 3.5The Gal Who Got Rattled, 4The Mortal Remains, 3This was most certainly a unique and interesting film, it has six very different stories, but overall is an enjoyable experience. In particular its strengths lay in its strong hand of direction, and the vast array of fun, touching and class levels of acting from its entire cast. And its clever use of digital photography that plays to its strengths and throughly avoids its weaknesses, displaying the Coen brothers adept and adaptability in filmmaking.The music of this feature was fairly acceptable, it was unremarkable but since there are six distinct ballads, very little musical development or attachment could have been developed either way. In addition to this I felt that the idea of connecting all these narrative by a book, is while a fairly common, but reliable idea. It feels like a quiet story around a campfire, and sells the old western theme more strongly.Although my rating overall would average this film to a 3.16. I care not for mathematics in this artistic context and give this film a 3.5 (7/10, as I was rating out of 5 stars the whole way through) overall.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

286,gmaileatsyourlunch,A collection of Coen Bros. B-Sides,5,25 June 2021,"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs was produced for Netflix at a time when Netflix was throwing money at every big name actor, director, comedian and producer to ""make something"". The result of which are efforts often far below what some of these names are capable of and a reminder that money and carte blanche are no guarantee of great results. That unfortunately might be the case here. And no, I'm certainly not blaming Netflix' strategy to dominate the streaming world as the reason this film falls short - it stands on its own - I'm just not surprised.Conceptually, it feels rushed. It feels like when Netflix showed up with the wheelbarrow full of cash, the Coens knew they didn't have a year or more to put together a film from start to finish so they opened their decades'-old idea drawer, blew off the dust and looked for ""something"".What we get are six stories which aren't connected in any way except their common old west setting, but that aside, it's a themeless buffet. They range from the comedically absurd to coal-black dark, and that would be fine except you're never given enough in each one to know where it's going until it's over.And it would also be fine if these shorts stood on their own. One or two do, the rest do not. They begin to elucidate interest and emotion and then they're over. They hint at something more, but there is none.This random assortment of trinkets is elevated by amazing cinematography, lighting, sound and occasionally dialog. You could probably watch paint dry if the Coens tuned their amazing powers on it. In the end, it's still just drying paint, though. That such amazing care and technical prowess are put to bear just adds to the confusion. Why all the fuss to put dollar store ideas so skillfully on the screen?Unlike other Coen films, when the credits rolled I didn't have that slight bit of confusion mixed with a sense of being oddly entertained and wanting more. Yes, I'm confused, but in place of entertainment (or anything else), I just feel a little cheated.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

As a boy I thought they were so boring and slow and old, I was more captivated by the future and Terminators and martians. Now in my old age, I'm captured by the wild west. This especially reigned true after my last screening of The Sisters Brothers, perhaps my favorite film of 2018 and maybe my favorite western.The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a series of vignettes told literally from a story book, each story usually accompanied by a musical number and at times shockingly brutal violence, but it's handled with such humor and insanity we barely notice it, it's so over the top for a genre that is usually downplayed, the characters play like those found in a Red Dead Redemption (don't get me started) side mission not necessarily the strong silent type we're used to.After falling asleep in the Coen Brothers last outing (and in my humble opinion massive misstep) 2016's ""Hail, Caesar!"" This felt like a welcome return for the duo. Still trying new things, kicking up the absurdity, with a well written and cinematically beautiful film (shot brilliantly and digitally by Bruno Delbonnel), I can't recommend The Ballad of Buster Scruggs enough.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
294,pixfarina,A Coan brothers,8,23 November 2020,"A very enjoyable mix of short stories, but it is an oddly mixed bag. The title story sets a funny tone which is carried through in the next story. In the middle ""meal ticket"" is a surreal story of pathos (featuring Liam Neeson) and ""The Golden Valley"" is a sublimely beautiful piece. The tone returned to hope and sadness with ""The Gal who got rattled"" before the set ends with its weakest story, ""The mortal remains"". But to be fair the stories of start and middle would be hard to match. Even so the last disappointing story is so unimpressive I have to dock this films a couple of stars, which is a pity because it welcomes some familiar faces back to the screen.What all the stories have in common is the Coen brothers skewed take on story telling, which fans of theirs will enjoy. Those who are not fans may find themselves converts. Aside from that all the stories are told in a 'day in the life' sort of way, some with arcs that continue beyond the narrative that concerns the viewer. For the most part these stories are well told, very well produced and thoroughly unforgettable.The duration of each short and the effort put into them makes the ""Ballad of Buster Scruggs an enjoyable, thoughtful and rewarding watch. From the outright hilarious, through thoughtful and even touching, there is something here for everyone.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
295,sjo-15,I wanted to like it - but too uneven,6,29 November 2018,"I really wanted to like this.
There are so many actors in it I like, and I quite fancied an off-beat western.
The first story is fantastic - one of the most amusing setups I have seen in years, well acted and just the right tone.
Near Algodones - dull.
Meal ticket is touching - but ultimately predictable, though done well.
All Gold Canyon - starts off well, nice twist.
Gal who got rattled - by now the viewer has figured out theres always a twist after drawing you in. This story is tragic and touching but very slow.
Mortal remains - didn't hold my attention.If this was shorter, perhaps lose Algodones and Mortal remains, would have been a better watch.I like the style, the stunning visuals, but a couple of the stories dragged for me.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
296,akg1249,How to Live Joyously Ever After,9,1 September 2019,"Everyone dies. You will. I will. And so will all those that we have come to know and love. To die, one doesn't need to be of certain age or even infirm. The only precondition that death demands is that the subject be alive and present at an appropriate place and time. 'Tis also true that, while every dead person's world perishes with him, that of others continues to evolve and flourish. Like it or not, but after you and I are gone, life will continue to wither and manifest in one form and another at an opportune place and time. And that, folks, is the recurrent theme in the six masterfully told Western short stories that constitute this film. Each story, however, will stir a differing emotion and strum a differing nerve in you.Without going gaga over each element of the production, let me just quickly sum things up by saying that this title, right here, is top-tier level film-making, with excellent writing; stunning photography that easily belittles any previous work accomplished by Coens, including ""No Country For Old Men""; engrossing characters that you'll want to acquaint; superb dialog that you'll want to go on for a little while longer; and twists in the tales that will flatten your emotions and leave you quietly stirred. Mind you, there are no ready-to-serve chills and thrills here; so, don't expect racy pulses and pounding hearts. All stories softly and beautifully grind their way to a sobering ends that have the potential to quietly add another awakening to your life.Sadly, short works of literature are not appreciated as much as full-length ones, even when shorter works are tougher to write (since there is less time to build characters and generate looming themes). I don't know why that is, but that is so. I'm saying this to encourage you to ignore any negative critic reviews and go on to watch the movie.And even if you're not a short-story lover, I still highly recommend you watch this. There's much to be loved here and reminisced. This is a work of art that deserves a memory cell in your brain.VERDICT: 9/10 (CANDIDATE FOR ALL-TIME BEST)",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
297,Nhirscher,Subtext for Days,8,23 December 2018,"Buster Scruggs is the six episode anthology of the humorous and tragic lives of those exploring the West. The Coen's use this story as a means to explore the role of entertainment in our world, the futility of life, and the eternal optimism that must drive us all.Despite being one of the silliest movies of 2018, it is also the most disturbing. Laughs will be had when Buster Scruggs kicks a table upward to his enemy's gun, prompting an overtly humorous accidental suicide; but, brows will be furrowed in realizational sadness at Liam Neeson's boulder tossing.I wholeheartedly recommend The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. Every storyline will end unpredictably with pragmatic optimism up to the brim. The performances are never explosive, but they serve the purposes demanded of them. The dialogue is sharp, indicative of deeper truth, and witty. The cryptic nature of each episode will have you guessing, decoding, and analyzing whatever it is the Coens are getting at.8.5/10",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

The first story, about the namesake Buster Scruggs, is by far the best. Fast, clever dialog, funny and pays homage to classic Westerns. It easily could have been expanded into a full movie. The second story, which is very short, is full of irony and quite good. The next three stories take a bleak and depressing turn, lose the humor and go on much too long.

303,joshuamarriott-56826,Unique and Fun,8,4 April 2019,"The latest Coen brothers film is extremely entertaining and may just be my favourite film of 2018 so far.The directing is pretty phenomenal in this film, as it is in nearly ever film Joel and Ethan Coen make. The dialogue was probably my favourite part of the film, they really managed to capture the Wild West theme in a way that I haven't seen for a long time. The acting was fine, though nothing special, though Tim Blake Nelson was hilarious. The whole concept behind this film is pretty unique and it's nice to see a movie that goes against the formula for once.The first segement, ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" was easily the best and hammers down early on to not take this movie too seriously. The second segement was also very funny and entertaining. These first two really reminded me how brutal the Wild West used to be and it was quite surprising to see some very unsatisfying endings to both of these stories. Segement three is much slower and darker and I think that they maybe could have put this one 4th, because it felt like the tone changed way too quickly from the 2nd segement to the third. If they maybe put the 4th segement there instead which is very much in the middle in terms on tone it would have felt much more natural and wouldn't have felt like the tone switched so quickly. I like that the movie included different tones though, I just wish it was handled a bit better. The 4th segement is also great, and so is the 5th segement despite it being the longest one. The 6th segement of the film is interesting, to say the least. It's pretty much a dialogue based section with a very dark and underlying theme to it, and it's an interesting concept although I felt it didn't grasp me as much as it could have.Overall, what really brought this film life and character was it's phenomenal screenplay, which is so well written and yet simple at the same time.

306,BobCanter7,(Mostly) Brilliant and Spellbinding -- A MUST if You are a True Fan of Westerns!,10,5 February 2019,"Anyone who has a good feel for Western movies -- or knows anything about the history of the Old West -- will absolutely love The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. How this collection of six beautifully-crafted and superbly acted stories escaped me when it was released, I'll never know.The first segment, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, is absolutely hilarious, and intentionally so. It is a no-holds-barred spoof on the Hollywood Grade B Western of decades past, complete with the singing cowboy wandering aimlessly through the desert, happily singing and strumming his guitar. Played brilliantly by Tim Blake Nelson, this segment is by far the funniest of the six and is a total spoof on Old West movies from the 1940's-1950's.The second story, Near Aldgones, starring James Franco as a down-on-his-luck bank robber, is just plain weird with a big dose of humor thrown in. It's the shortest segment of the six, but the story moves quickly and is completely enjoyable.The third segment, The Meal Ticket, is touching and beautifully written and acted. It stars Liam Neeson as a traveling impressario and captures the harshness of life in the Old West as he travels from town to town, eking out a living with an unusual entertainment, and ends with a painfully tragic, ironic twist.All Golds Canyon is of interest as much for the story as it is for an almost tutorial on gold prospecting and how prospectors worked to find the mother lode. It's as much an education as it is a dramatic story.The fifth segment, The Gal Who Got Rattled, was my personal favorite of the six stories and could almost stand on its own as a short movie. It captures the dangers and difficulties of pioneers traveling by wagon train through the Great Plains, and is told against the backdrop of the budding relationship between Alice Longabaugh, who is traveling to Oregon after her brother dies on the trail, and Billy Knapp, one of the wagon masters. Their growing relationship is conveyed with sensitivity and comes across as completely believable. I still relive the surprise, tragic ending over and over again after watching this twice.The sixth and last story, the Mortal Remains, is, in my opinion, the weakest of the lot. Although superbly acted, it rambles, and the ending does not nearly have the drama, humor or pathos of the first five stories.The cinematography is absolutely beautiful and captures much of the unspoiled natural beauty of the Western U.S.Overall, this compilation is an outstanding example of film making and is 100% worthwhile. It's clear that the Coen brothers are not only masterful storytellers, but they know their Westerns. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is their homage to Hollywood Westerns of the 1940'-1950's, and to the legacy of the American West itself.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

313,laszlo-05700,"70% Coens, 30% Classic",7,23 December 2018,"Despite what the name suggests, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is only partially a ballad of Buster Scruggs. It's a movie of 6 varying length segments, each based around the 19th century wild west - and only the first one really qualifies as a ballad, the rest are simply novels. That's not an issue, since the tone of storytelling adjusts really well between the episodes.
However I'd recommend drawing a line between the four parts written by the Coen brothers themselves, and the two others that are based on original Western stories by Jack London and Steward Edward White. The first 3 stories are all Coen originals, the first one being Buster's. It's simply an introduction to catch the viewer's attention with a bright cowboy-gangster like figure who sings and seems to be a general satire of all the '50s and early '60s American Western movies. The story with James Franco in lead doesn't goes too deep in terms of character development either, but the cinematic tools seem to be switched up to resemble the spaghetti western era. It's cool, but they still didn't invent anything revolutionary. With the 3rd episode comes a remarkable switch - and the simple explanation is that Liam Neeson and Harry Melling nails it. The movie starts to take a dive into becoming a sociography and the first steps are a success.
Yet, my favourite parts - the 4th and 5th chapters - are the height of the movie. Here, the Coens semeed to have thrown everything they know into the trash bin and adapt these stories á la natur. For anyone who read Karl May or similar author's books they will find these tales very familiar. Yet they are so alien from the regular Western movies, that it's easy to tell the difference.
The finale is once again a Coen-written screenplay, which I think doesn't really fits into the movie, especially not as a closure. It tries to analyze a few social classes associated to that era, but seems to leave a mess with the dialogues. Maybe they were thinking too much about writing a regular screenplay instead of focusing on what they did best in the previous 5 chapters and throughout their careers.
All in all, it delivers as an interesting project movie - I would definitely give 9/10 or 10/10 to the middle of the film, but they just don't mix well with the parodizing start and the unfinished last chapter.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

The haters seem to think it started good and then got worse and worse. Actually it started brilliant, but kind of lightly sardonically dark and then got more ponderous and serious and continually more and more darkly humorous. And MORE interesting, unless all you wanted was a stereotypical ""yee haw, cowboy movie."" For any TRUE fan of dark comedy, this might end up being your favorite western of all time. A great (but for the most part understated) cast, fantastic score, flawless and beautiful cinematography, I can't think of a single flaw. Some have criticized its pacing, but any fan of the genre realizes that anthology films are just paced differently than other films.

So, how do you rate and review them together as one? The thing is - you can't. I mean you can try, but you are most likely going do glorify one tale while you do another no justice at all. The same goes for ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs""; I had to give it an eight, because while ""Meal Ticket"" was a nine, ""The Gal Who Got Rattled"" was a seven, in my opinion.So, I'm just going to focus on my favourite tale of the six, and the most emotionally striking tale of them all was ""Meal Ticket"". First of all, brilliantly casting Harry Melling as the ""Artist"", an absolutely marvellously fitting character. Second, what an exceptionally eerie atmosphere we are subjected to! The very existence of the ""Artist"" and his companion, ""Impresario"" (Liam Neeson), is drenched in the contrast between the first one's silent optimism and the other one's increasing, although also silent, dejection.

""the ballad of buster scruggs"" is a fantastic, violent romp with cowboys and ballads. ""near algodones"" was less impressionable for me, but still offered a good story filled with irony and fate and humour. i really enjoyed ""meal ticket"" as well - poe-esque, gothic, shakespearean; FASCINATING. ""all gold canyon"" was another good one, especially for the atmosphere and a view of the sublimity of nature intertwined with the human. ""the gal who got rattled"" wasn't quite up my alley, and i was a little taken aback by the slightly uncomfortable presentation of the ""natives"". i did, however, enjoy the sense of unease it built around all of the characters. i personally loved ""the mortal remains,"" although i understand why some people may not. this last short is more or less made up of just dialogue, plus a backdrop, imbued with a sense of the horror story (also humour); a tiny tiny bit trite, but the acting contrasted with the backdrop made for an excellent mixture of reflective meditation and gallows humour.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

The Coen brothers have eloquently laid before us the essential elements of stories that are revealed in our expectations and reactions to the stories they have reconjured.

It is not a masterpiece, but it is a fine movie and quite unique as well. It follows six different non-related stories from the Wild West, all with their own interesting characters and atmospheres. Perhaps that is why I found it as enjoyable as I did, due to the screenplay ? Anyhow ...The acting is very good, and the notable standouts are Tim Blake Nelson, Liam Neeson and my personal favorite performance from this movie; Tom Waits. You simply cannot help but laugh watching Nelson perform his absurd antics. Neeson plays is a man which you shouldn't feel compassion for, but do. It is hard to explain here, one must watch the movie to understand what I am talking about. Tom Waits is simply a pleasure to see out in the wild hunting gold, mumbling and talking to himself (or ""Mr. Pocket"", to quote him), running into all kinds of different problems.It has got fantastic camera work and set design, featuring many beautiful expansive shots of the American Frontier, tight crammed horse wagons and rusty old saloons. These contribute to an very interesting atmosphere. To explain further; The Ballad of Buster Scruggs may at first glance seem like a light-hearted comedy, but it is in fact surprisingly dark (and by this I do not mean 'dark humor' as some would believe, I mean that it is actually dark) and even moving, watching each of the characters go through the struggles of the Old West. This I believe is especially true for the chapters 'Meal Ticket' and 'The Girl Who Got Rattled'.To conclude; The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is no masterpiece, but it is quite well-made and highly enjoyable. It features great acting and is very visually pleasing, and it has a rather different atmosphere compared to many other movies which I have seen, and said atmosphere could only be described as a comedy disguised as a rather dark and moving tale.70/100",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

330,VardAntinyan,"Old times, cruel times.",10,16 April 2020,"It looks like Coen brothers capture most of the wild west in six stories. I am sure there will be a lot of interpretations by reviewers on what means what in the movie. Here is the simple reflection in my mind: Six stories are capturing the entire spectrum of western life of the time. It's both realistic and epic at the same time. We can't count on what will happen to an average person in west. The most likely things are that they will suffer and die, cause it's damn difficult. And of course there are different epic condensations of characters, every character representing an entire class of people. Take the gunslinger, or bank robber, or the old tough cowboy fighting to the Indians, or the French bourgeois, or the maiden. Most of them will be hurt and suffer, because that's what people encountered in wild west.And all of these punctuated with superb shot by Coen brothers.

Not hard to figure out why it's a Netflix film...can't imagine a studio willing to bankroll a series of film shorts. Yes, it's beautiful to look at, although I suspected much of it was CGI scenery, but the short films are generally not able to involve me as a viewer. I admired the humor of the series of final monologues in the final episode (although it also was anticlimactic) and the absurd violence in counterpoint to the insipid music of the first episode, but only wagon train segment engaged my interest as it had the makings of an interesting full-length film. However, that full-length film wouldn't have been a Coen brothers film full of antic characters engaged in fruitless activity in a world of random violence--which is how this episode disappointingly concludes.

Where is Barack Obama regulating Netflix from us and this kind of charade? Right, he's half white too. This ""collection"" isn't disappointing in the way you learned that Jack ""Nasty"" Twist is killed in a road side ditch, but it is disappointing in that it is the same old retelling of how the ""West was won"" especially as short stories go. Do you know why ""Dances with Wolves"" remains the relevant and critically acclaimed feather in the storytelling cap of the west? Because DwW remains honest to the story that the west was filled with other people before the ""official"" pioneers crossed to Oregon. And this is a real plea to the AMPAS, to leave these tired portrayals where they belong... in black and white 50s shows.
Yes; it is a sad sad story 'the American West' at times, but the Ballads were filled with one dramatic tale after another - as absurd as traveling circuses were even then - as to why the west had to be won, and not from the Native American Indians perspective either. Sure, it would take the ""Revenant"" for Leo deCaprio to take Oscar home, but what the details in the story ""Revenant"" attempted to fix, the Coens carried on in the ""Cowboy myth of one valiantly shooting 18 Indians with two bullets on foot in the height of a hurricane at the behest of a pale faced virgin (a totally otherwise incapable white woman screaming on the other side of a dead horse). The Ballads, for all its fantastic beauty of seismic set dressing and wagon train teams of sewing machines only a 1840s horse caravan outfitter could dream of, still reeks of rank of a misogynist bygone mindset. Or is it bygone for Democrats?Or Perhaps maybe the story of the Indian warriors was left out by the financiers' hands?! The tale left absent from the Coens' so-called amazing work, is that of wives and of daughters who learned that their sons and fathers were lost to the invaders, lost whilst protecting their homes from the US Army. But enough about Politics and Revenant, even Johnny Deep attempted to capture, and succeeded in making visceral for audiences of one Lone Ranger. But delicate history is never easy, and the Coens' work passes on what could otherwise be a beautiful yet stark picture of what the west would look like, already home to the 562 tribes the Coen brothers took no shame in ""killing in the name of.""Do you know why Tribes were called ""savage"" (because the Coens don't; never send a Hollywood type to pass a history test)? Indians were called savage for gay politics, and not just the Democrat LGBTQ politics circa 2019 either. For all of Hollywood's love of illegal aliens, brown people and democracy, there is not one spec of Native American diversity in this Coen travesty. So just like Congress, we heard all about the Palestinians whose land Israel invaded, but not an ounce of respect to the ""Savage"" who paid so dearly, for their failed ""migration policy"". Otherwise, the photography was astounding, and the dark dark tales really did capture a little truth... And that is what makes the Indian perspective so disappointing here. All we saw were blurs of redskin, scalping a white man, when it was the French and the Germans of Leo deCaprio's Revenant who taught the warriors to scalp in the first place.Such a disappointment of creative scale the Ballards are.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

The performances are all very good, especially from Tim Blake-Nelson who steals the show and hooks the viewer in the first chapter of the film. The only flaw of the film in my opinion is that none of the stories told connect in any way. I think that it was a missed opportunity to make the movie even more unique and interesting.

355,csbob447,Underwhelming Coen Bros film,7,16 November 2018,"It is hard to talk about a Coen Brothers movie, because often they feel like a movie you have to think about over and over again to fully understand them. That is certainly how I felt about many of their films, like Burn After Reading, Fargo, the Big Lebowski, even No Country for Old Men. That certainly is something to respect about filmmakers as beloved as the brothers. And that might be something I can say too about the Ballad of Buster Scruggs... I think. What I mean is that while I wouldn't say this movie is as cryptic as some of their films, I will say that for an anthology film from the Coens it is very much accessible, I'm not sure that I fully ""get"" it, if that does make sense. Or maybe I do?Look I love the Coens, but I'm not going to lie this was a bit of a mix bag for me. I didn't hate it, I enjoyed myself, but knowing that this was originally going to be a miniseries on Netflix it makes a whole lot of sense as to the shortcomings! Now for an anthology film, it has the usual shortcomings of one in that there are more weaker films than highlights. However unlike most anthology films, there are reoccurring thematic elements that ties them all together. Mainly the usual Coens themes of nihilism, judgement, good vs. evil, unjust punishment, quirks, etc. However the movie feels repetitive in terms of thematic cohesion. While each film are different in terms of their respective plots, it feels like you are watching the same thing over and over again when the themes are the same thing. I mean sure you can say that for every Coen Brothers films, but the Coens are pretty good varying their films and spicing things up. Raising Arizona may be similar to Fargo, but they are both feel like different films.The other major problem with this film is that each films, with maybe two exceptions, feel rather short. Sure each films do have a cohesive plot with a beginning, middle, and end, but they often feel like cliff note versions of each film, almost like a summary to a longer story. Again it would have benefited if the movie was just a mini-series, because each one will be fleshed out properly.Like I said, I enjoyed it, as there are a ton to really love about this film! The performances all around are great and there are no bad performances. Highlights for me are Tim Blake Nelson, Harry Melling, and Tom Waits. The sets are fantastic, as each one are beautiful to look at and makes you feel like you are in the wild west! Although the movie does lack grit and would have benefited if they were shot on film instead of digital (this is a Netflix movie after all), the cinematography is pretty damn good too, with some absolutely beautiful shots too, all done by Inside Llewyn Davis DP Bruno Delbonnel. The music is also great, with a fantastic old-timey score by Carter Burwell, along with some great musical numbers in a style of cowboy musicals!Overall, it's pretty disappointing for a Coens film, at least for me. I can see why people love this film, but there are too many shortcomings for me personally to really love it. Like I said it's not bad, and maybe I'll have to let it sit with me and revisit it in the future to truly love it, but it could have been a really good mini-series than a movie.Ranking each segment would be Meal Ticket (4/5), The Mortal Remains (3.5/5), The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (3.5/5), All Gold Canyon (3.5/5), The Gal Who Got Rattled (3/5), and Near Algodones (2/5).",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

The movie exists out of six short story's each dealing with a typical aspect from the life in the wild west. From finding gold to robbing banks to being an outlaw, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs has it all.The first and final part are more like a musical. These segments really draw your attention by good acting and well written scenario's. The movie has a lot of creative shots and is filled with stunning scenery. During the movie the conversations switch between monologues and dialogues. This ensures you to keep wondering what will happen.
The fourth segment might be the best acted and most beautiful of this movie. The effort it takes to find gold, and which methods gold diggers used these days are well portrayed.
Some segments are much longer and less powerful which cause a more difficult time to keep your attention. This doesn't mean that these segments are bad, the end always makes them worth watching.Overall the movie succeeds to show you the aspects of the wild west and sometimes even wants you to go back there. The acting was good, and music is well done. This is a movie that makes you enjoy the wild west but also makes you feel that life wasn't that easy back then.

359,Return_of_the_Porg,Netflix Finally Makes a Good Movie,8,26 November 2018,"It's no secret that Netflix movies are really, really, really bad. Whether it's Mute or Bright, these are just a couple of examples of the dumpster-fire films that Netflix has produced over the years. There's no denying that Netflix shows are great, for the most part, but their movies are almost universally viewed as bad films. Yet Netflix has doubled their efforts in their pursuit of creating higher quality films and boy was I delighted by this film.
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is as quirky as a film as the Coen brothers film can be. The film is split into six distinct and unrelated stories. Each individual tale is about twenty minutes in length so the film is divided into chunks for those of you who would rather see the film in several intervals. As I mentioned before, some stories are better than others. The first story gets you out of the gate running, its strange, funny and has a certain uniqueness to it that makes it stand out. It's pretty much a western musical and I loved it entirely.
The second story dials down the comedy just a bit but it's almost as ridiculous as the first. James Franco is good in it yet I found his delivery very off-putting as I kept listening to his Tommy Wiseau accent for some reason. The third story is the darkest of the six in my opinion as it stars a very silent but worried Liam Neeson. The shift in tone is understandable but it never fully commits to its darker tone or themes as it eventually plugs in some hilarious absurdities towards the end. The fourth story was excellent, maybe the best out of the six. It was tonally consistent throughout which helped the storytelling immensely. I won't say anything else about it because I absolutely want you to watch it. The fifth tale in this collection is tied for my favorite. It's got some great action and character interactions. The cinematography here was stunning, long takes, wide shots, everything, it's a treat. The story is a bit conventional however, although I did find it to be effective and I liked the characters in this one way more than in any of the other stories. Finally we have the last tale of the pack and it's quite forgettable. The performances are great and the dialogue too but it never seems to live up to the rest of the tales that the movie offers. It's also hurt by being located after arguably the two best segments of the anthology.
In the end the Coen brothers succeeded in creating a great western anthology series. I believe it to be up there as the best Netflix movie available now on the service. We'll have to see how good Scorsese's next effort is, but knowing him it will be great. The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a great anthology that works incredibly well. My only issues with it are the tone in a single story, because I do agree that tone can vary from one story to the next but not necessarily in the same tale. Other than that, I found the last story to be rather dull, tamed and quite honestly, forgettable at best. The other tales offered here are much better in every way. I would highly recommend you watch this film. A western, a comedy, a drama and a musical all in one. You don't see that everyday.

I found the ""Ballad.."" closer to some of the Coens most cryptic stuff like ""Barton Fink"" or ""A Serious Man"".
Here a bouncy light-hearted opening sequences slowly gives way to an uneasy feelings of impending doom.The first episode ""THE BALLAD OF BUSTER SCRUGGS"", A singing lonesome cowboy (Tim Blake Nelson) rides into town. it's pure Coen: cartooneque and unpredictable. Tex Avery would have loved it.""NEAR ALGODONES"" Starts with another lonesome cowboy (James Franco) about to enter a bank. You can guess the rest but there are few surprise encounters and a brilliant action scene that is as good as those in Innaritu's ""The Revenant"".""MEAL TICKET"" is the most haunting and gloomy episode. Harry Melling plays a young actor in an itinerant one man show managed by an unrecognisable Liam Neeson.
Here the Coens abandon their usual zany camerawork and eccentricities as the story is straight forward and there is nothing to add.ALL GOLD CANYON follows another lonesome figure, this time an old gold prospector (Tom Waits) wandering into a beautiful valley.THE GALL WHO GOT RATTLED
Set in the epic of the Oregon trail we follow the journey of a young girl (Zoe Kazan) her brother and their pet dog. Compared to the other Segments it's more of a short novel which for its barren landscapes, gritty characters and effective action scenes could have easily been renamed as "" No Country for
Young Women"".The last chapter, ""THE MORTAL REMAINS"" deals with another Western classic the stagecoach.

I'd heard positive things about it and kept seeing it popping up on Netflix, but never really gave it much thought. I decided to watch it out of curiosity one night and I was incredibly surprised. The film is an anthology of six short stories that follow different people in the post-Civil War era and the irony of death in their lives as they encounter death, along with a little bit of history here and there. We see people traveling along the Oregon Trail, the aftermath of the gold rush, etc. It mixes humor with great imagery and metaphors that make the storytelling more intriguing and keeps you interested. I was excited to learn that the Coen Brothers directed this because I'd recently watched another film of theirs, Inside Llewyn Davis, which became one of my favorite movies. There were lots of big names in Buster Scruggs, like Liam Neeson, James Franco, Tom Waits, etc. that made the film for fun to watch for me. I especially enjoyed how the last story was shot, where the story basically happened all in the space of the carriage, but you could tell what was really happening from the dialogue and visuals around them.

This movie took a few days for me to finish because I was so completely shattered by "" Meal Ticket"" And ""The Girl Who Got Rattled"". I was so worried about the dog dying, my brain wondered away from the obvious Coen ending and I should have known better. So I turned it off and waited to finish the remainder of the film.
The cinematography was so incredibly beautiful.
The acting superb by everyone but especially Tom Waits, James Franco, Harry Melling (Hello, Dudley.), Bull Heck & Zoe Kazan. My love for westerns and the Coens couldn't keep me away. I shouldn't rate it based on how depressing it was for me, but it seriously made it so hard to enjoy.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

Some of the best westerns ever made - in my opinion - have been made since then (Dances with Wolves, Unforgiven, and Deadwood immediately come to mind). Buster Scruggs just shows that all it takes to make a good Western, or any genre, for that matter, is a well-written, entertaining story with actors who have the talent to make it work.

Its very quirky and Buster is a larger than life gunslinging maestro who is in for a surprise - this character would be great in a feature length movie. I wasn't so keen on Meal Ticket (the third installment) it was a little too bleak, but all the other tales were more enjoyable and engaging - what an eclectic!Great performances all round.

377,daendil,Watch trolololo for 2 hours...,5,4 February 2019,"I feel tricked. My brother recommended this and usually he recommends movies that are worth watching. But this one? I was waiting the whole time for some overarching plot to emerge that'd somehow connect these small fragments of rather anticlimactic stories but it just never came.Interestingly the illustrious cast, the rather qualitative execution of screenplay, scenery, music and costume only add to the disappointment. Even the setups are promising. All of them. Then the plot is just dropped dully and we move to the next unfulfilled promise till I can't help but wonder: is this intentional? Did they really just film this for trolling?Spoilers from here.So we have this singing gunslinger with a (for me) peculiar accent and manners. I'm slowly getting curious: what is his story? What are his motives? Why he refuses to play the hand of the leaving gambler - even though those are pretty good cards for as little as I know about poker. Then he gets shot. Ah well. (Well ok, now that I think of it there is a very pale connection to the last story regarding how you're supposed to play your own cards, but still, that's not enough for me.)The next guy attempts to rob a rather odd banker, then he almost gets hanged. Later he gets hanged for real. Ta da! (Again, a hint of Zen here as he appreciates the beauty of a random girl at the last minute. Again, not enough.)Guy without legs and arms makes a living reciting an incoherent lengthy speech as a traveling performer. Well my English is far from perfect and I could only make out that there are excerpts from the Bible and maybe the American Constitution? He always seems to tell the same story and he never speaks outside the performances. Then he gets dumped into a chasm when his partner? employer? buys a chicken instead that seems to be able to count numbers. We never learn if he was scammed? Or is he taught the trick to make the chicken seem to be able to count? Or can somehow that chicken really count? Nothing. End of story. (Scent of very meh analogy of how ""important thoughts"" get dumped for easy entertainment. Meh. Pffff.)The old gold digger finds a big chunk of gold. Actually his quest, his struggle is pretty well executed. Again, I get interested. He's old. What are his plans? What would he do with all that gold? He seems too old to gain anything else than a peaceful last few years. Then he gets shot - but he doesn't die, instead he defeats the other guy then he walks away. And we learn nothing more about him.A settler girl is in a downward spiral of events then everything seems to turn good, but during an indian attack she kills herself not to fall captive. Though it later turns out that she shouldn't have.Last is a lengthy scene with a bunch of people traveling in a cart. It's a rather straightforward analogy of the transition to the afterlife. Still two of them are bounty hunters and there is a corpse at the top of the wagon. Why is he a corpse? Why are these other people alive? I don't get it.And that's it, movie is over.

And talk too much.",3,11 April 2021,"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is perfect in its way: visually remarkable, assassinations as funny as slapstick, impeccable editing, great actors, and a convincing owl.But for me, it's a miss by a mile. 6 unrelated stories that manage to be depressing and boring, sometimes at the same time. The tone varies from story to story. The first story is about a pointlessly murderous gun slinger -- told as a surreal musical. Other stories are darker and without the attempt at laffs. I skipped parts of it.Pointless violence, pathos I don't need to see, everyone a March Hare unsympathetic and bizarre -- with no good or normal character to hold on to, or cheer. There's no Alice in this Wonderland, and all the Tweedledums are stupid, vicious, 2-bit caricatures, or all three. And talk too much.Except for the owl, played by itself (or by a computer). There's some good fiddle music too.The Coen Brothers have achieved greatness many times -- and always a strange greatness -- mixtures of darkness and humor never see before or elsewhere. They walk a miraculous and narrow line: at their best the comedy is the sugar pill for pathos - about people dysfunctional and doomed, but in movies that are fun.But this time the line fails.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is an entertaining, inventive, and insightful anthology film featuring six creative western stories connected by common themes of mortality and identity. They vary greatly in tone but are all fantastic. The first segment is a hilarious and absurd musical black comedy. The second one is a short but entertaining story of a bank robber's troubles. The third is a very sad and moving tale about self-worth and meaning. The fourth is a simple story of the search for gold, and the only one with a happy ending. The fifth is a straightforward story of a woman's struggles in life with a very intense ending. And the sixth is a creepy, dialogue-filled scene that ties everything in a very poignant way. All segments put an effective spin on Western stereotypes. Some of the segments, especially 4 and 5, definitely drag and the film as a whole feels a bit uneven.

Joel and Ethan come off as a little bit out of touch here. The ambivalent, arbitrary and humorous violence doesn't really do or say nearly enough to resonate with viewers actively participating or paying attention to the political climate in the US and around the world. In fact, the signature Coen-esque gruesome violence can be quite a turnoff at times.This begs the question: Does art have to be political in order to be good? I believe it's contextual. Ultimately, these comedic and tragic shorts don't really dig deep enough nor reflect enough on our times to place the Coen brothers in any different position as artists than that which they have been for quite a while now.Some gorgeous cinematography, a few laughs, but the final feeling is mostly that of ambivalence.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

Where were some chuckles thrown in here and there, but didn't really match the first part of the film or the advertisements... in my opinion.
However, overall, it was a good watch. Good quality acting and some surprise appearances.There were no real crying moments and there's warning for harsh violence, but it's no worse than anything on television, and there was no outstanding vulgar or explicit language which is a nice change from other Netflix movies.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

Only the one about panning for gold, with Tom Waits as the main character, can truly be said to end happily.

It was interesting and funny.""Near Algodones"" kept me interested, and I enjoyed the characters, but there was no take away, so it kind of fell flat.""Meal Ticket"" was worthless and should have been cut altogether. It was extremely boring and sad.""All Gold Canyon"" and ""The Gal Who Got Rattled"" were enjoyable and interesting. Good characters and beautiful cinematography. Both segments kept my interest.""The Mortal Remains"" had some interesting dialogue but it fell off and didn't seem to have a point.So one segment was fantastic, three others were pretty good, and two were completely forgettable.

386,francpsantos,Definitely an inconsistent bunch of stories. But some are just that good that make up for it,8,7 December 2018,"After reading other reviews, I feel like I have a completely different opinion from most people. I feel like it started quite flat and developed into some very intriguing stories. Obviously, as the movie demands, I will split his review in its respective short stories.""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" was funny and Buster is definitely an interesting character. But, overall, it just felt like a guy going around singing and shooting people. Yes, he is not the typical outlaw because of the straight moral values and the uplifted mood. And don't get me wrong, it is a nice piece of cinema. But when I read so many people saying it should be made into a standalone movie, I couldn't help to feel disappointed. The ending felt right, though. It was only fitting for a man like that do die by the hands of an equal. But damn, was that ascension to heaven unnecessary. I am, of course, not implying that this story is objectively bad, or anything of the sorts. It's just not to my taste.""Near Algodones"" was by far the worst part. There is one good joke, but the story doesn't really go anywhere. I was not very engaged at this point and must confess this one almost made me give up.""Meal Ticket"" got my attention back. It is a piece of a melancholic tone only comparable to the harshness of life. In the first scene, it's beautiful to see the artist mumbling words of a distant past, with a poignancy that contrasts deeply with the roughness of his spectators. I could not help to be, just like his first audience, fascinated. When you see the tall man feed him so carefully, it just seems like there like such a caring relationship. Until it slowly disintegrates and falls apart into the real world of hardships, drunkenness and whores, where you have to do what it takes. Then that beautifully crude end. We don't see it, but we don't really need to. It hits even harder this way.""All Gold Canyon"" was the clear winner for me. As a fan of the music of Tom Waits it is good to see him delivering such an interesting performance. As some who grew up close to nature, this one also hits close to home. It is heart-warming to see such respect to the environment in a person who will stop at nothing to achieve his goal. It is not a story of Man conquering nature, but rather Man conquering himself. In my opinion, everything was great. The performance, the music, the cinematography and the simple but effective story. Except, of course, the CGI deer. That was weird.""The Gal Who Got Rattled"" was certainly the most visually beautiful of the bunch. It is not so much about the story but rather about the characters. Great touch on the way how two seemingly awkward individuals come together and work so well. A man that always seems to go through a tremendous amount of work to dig up the words he says and a girl which seems to, at the same time, have a good awareness of the happenings around her and still accept everything diligently. No wonder it was her demise. Oh, and the music was beautiful as well.""The Mortal Remains"" was also one of my favorites. While not appreciated by a lot of people, it felt good to me to see such a metaphorical story in a movie where all the stories are, while far-fetched, still realistic. Even better was the way how the purpose is not immediately given away and the true purpose of the stagecoach is given away slowly. Both to its passengers and to the viewer. Clearly a dialogue focused piece, it is masterfully done and the characters are so heterogenous that their ideological collision is unavoidable. The singing by Brendan Gleeson is surprisingly striking and the best part, for me, was seeing the three passengers struggling to finally accept their common circumstance, each in their own way.To wrap it up, this movie did not start with the right food for me, but redeemed itself with the course of its runtime. The creativity does not disappoint and, just like the Coens got us used to, it is a good alternative if you are tired of the so called 'mainstream' cinema.'How would I know?

Each is a mini masterpiece on its own... the writing, acting, vusuals and narrative construction are all genius. They connect then perfectly through a shared theme of hardship and death in the old west. Picture an oral history of western experiences, shared, told and retold around many a campfire. Each has been colored and shaped through the retelling and the story teller with some becoming more fanciful over time and others becoming almost like ghost stories.

Bleak and bold in it's ability to look the truth of the human condition square in the eye, but not despairing. Reminded me of ""Waiting For Godot"" by the incomparable Samuel Beckett. In fact the Coen's connection in spirit and outlook to the great playwrite was never more obvious than in this film.

I've heard other people say that he should've had his own film but honestly I feel like I would've gotten sick of his character if there was much more of him.Near Algodones 3.5/5: This one really wasn't that bad but I honestly don't have much to say because of how short it is and how little plot there is to it.Meal Ticket 3/5: I didn't hate this one like most other people on here but it's so different tonally that it sort of sticks out like a sore thumb.All Gold Canyon 4.5/5: Probably my personal favorite of all of these. Everything about this is great besides the absurd amount of establishing shots.The Gal Who Got Rattled 2/5: All of the acting is pretty great and the ending is pretty awesome but on god I almost died from boredom during most of this and it's absurdly long runtime.The Mortal Remains 3/5: Overall a solid ending to this film but it's 100% dialogue and I kept zoning out.

My only problems with it are the constant switches in tone in all the short stories. I got used to it later on, but at the beginning I was kind of wandering what the movie was trying to be and was thinking, ""kind of a weird comedy"" or, "" very odd drama"" and it threw me off a little bit.

Another shows that serendipity can quickly place the ""shoe on the other foot"" when a gold miner is able to persevere over his foe- who ends up paying the ultimate price for his treachery.

403,rorymarsh00,Return to the West,7,13 October 2018,"The Coen Brothers have a catalogue spanning multiple genres and time periods, the vast majority of which considered landmarks in the cinematic landscape of the 1990's and 2000's. With the release of the enjoyable yet troubled 'Hail, Ceaser', however, they hit a speedbump. Whilst this anthology film is definitely a step above their 2016 effort, it shares many of the pitfalls which, for all its credit, remain as noticeable as ever. Being an anthology film, each segment is isolated in it's own narrative, with no overarching plot or recurring characters, granting a certain creative freedom, but also significantly weakening lesser sections which, when not completely immersing the audience, appear more an unnecessary dampener than a valid contribution to this jamboree. The titular section, 'The Ballad of Buster Scruggs', opens the picture, presenting a jovial incarnation of the Wild West complete with musical numbers, a metatheatrical performance from the infallible Tim Blake Nelson, and a surrealist edge absent from the remaining episodes. This proves more of a fantastical approach, with creative action sequences and a charming lead. Whilst it features the most Coenesque feel, it serves more as a breezy opener, than the real meat of the piece - a welcome introduction back to the Coen-dictated West. The shortest sequence is the James Franco starring 'Near Algodones', which serves as the action-packed counterpart to the aforementioned fantasy-musical of Buster Scruggs. The comedic moments here are pitch-perfect, with engrossing sequences to boot, however, our time with these characters is all too brief to make it anything more. Following close suit is by far the weakest portion of the film, Liam Neeson's 'Meal Ticket'. Here, the Brothers take an almost non-dialogic approach, instead utilising visual storytelling to comprehensive, oft-comedic, but ultimately repetitive effect. There's little to say of the narrative, featuring recurring Coen quirk, but little more. The final three portions are the strongest additions to this anthology, each gaining a longer runtime and for good reason. The characters appear far more engrossing and the tone more serious, which is no bad thing. 'All Gold Canyon' is gorgeously shot, providing a vastly different colour pallet and an expose on the harsher sides to living in the West, with Tom Waits perhaps proving the best addition to the cast. 'The Gal Who Got Rattled' likely shares the most with Westerns of old, blending character-centred drama with beautifully executed and tense action sequences, and featuring a warm turn from Bill Heck. Finally, 'The Mortal Remains' proves the most ambitious and starkly unique segment, crafting an almost Beckettian atmosphere with infinite metaphorical value and an assortment of expertly acted characters that finely blend a concoction of tension and side-splitting humour. It stands out like a sore thumb from its predecessors, but may be the freshest addition to the anthology, ending the film on a melancholic yet intriguing note. 'The Ballad of Buster Scruggs' accurately portrays the Coen's love for the Western genre, allowing them to create a series of vignettes exploring areas of the genre that otherwise remained untouched. Blending a musical, an action film, black comedy, drama, epic and existential think-piece together in an incoherent yet delightful feature, this may not be a whole they are remembered for, but certainly features parts that will remain evergreen in their catalogue. If only the opening three segments were stronger, this could have been a standout. Furthermore, they incite excitement for the Coen's to develop another serious feature, a la 'No Country for Old Men', as it affirms that this is where they excel.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

Each story is distinct, told in a different tone, and I was totally transfixed the entire time. This is the type of film which could have easily gone wrong in other hands, but I can truly find no fault in this film. As with their other work, it is both careful and thoughtful; there is tremendous attention to detail - not merely in the production itself (the covered wagons appear to legitimately be authentic, as though you can feel yourself a part of the wagon train), but also in the depth and delivery of the dialogue (the trapper's monologue in the final vignette; every word that's spoken between Alice and Billy on the westward journey, etc.), and in the actual sequence of the vignettes as well. (Would this have worked as well if the stories had been presented in a different order? I don't think so). Above all, the casting and acting is superb. It is extraordinarily rare to be able to pull together so many sympathetic characters in one film - I found myself invested in and rooting for all of them.

424,Scott-344,"Well, they took the lens cap off, but not a film for the suicidal",3,25 January 2019,"The Coen brothers occasionally come off as teenage boys ripping the wings off of flies for the sheer... humor of it. ""Buster Scruggs"" is one of those occasions.If your point is the pointlessness of human relations, then your film might very well be pointless. C'mon, Coens. We get it. Everybody dies. And you two are frequently amused by the pain and suffering that precedes the deaths of other human beings. Fine. I guess there's nothing objectively wrong about that approach to storytelling. The writing instructor John Gardner once counseled his students to be aware that some of their readers might be contemplating suicide, and to proceed with humanity, empathy, and, perhaps, a point. But that was just the opinion of someone with humanity, empathy, and a point. The Coen brothers are free to make their brand of ironic film school-like drivel all they want. You see, greed is a thing (news flash), and people kill because of greed -- and our clever Coen brothers can even fashion a punchline when those killings happen. At least two of the episodes in ""BS"" are literally just set-ups to a punchline. (I just saved you two hours and 13 minutes.)The Coen brothers have avoided the sociopath path a few times in their career. ""Fargo"" with its wonderful female protagonist had some humanity along with the funny deaths. ""No Country for Old Men"" explored the burden of violence on the decent. I think that was more Cormac McCarthy than Coen brothers. ""The Big Lebowski"" was a romp, and original. ""Hail, Caesar!"" was a romp, but unoriginal.More frequently in the Coens' career it's been a matter of finding the funny last image seen by a dying human being. A leaky sink in ""Blood Simple."" A bullet wound in one's body in ""Buster Scruggs."" Funny stuff. If you're a clever prepubescent boy with a movie camera but no conscience.I will credit the film for not mucking up its look. Of course, it is hard to make some of the most beautiful locations on earth look ugly, but to their credit the Coens avoided the temptation to do so (because... irony). Three stars for that.Orson Welles once told a film school class that every film is a political statement. That seemed a bit pretentious to me at first, but I think at heart he was right. Comedies and musicals provide sheer joy -- something for the political order to protect. Mysteries and thrillers warn against the dark side of human nature -- something for the political order to protect against. Dramas explore our humanity -- again something else for the political order to protect. But with the Coens nothing is worth anything. You may think that the one life you have is at least worth living, but nope -- to the Coens anything that might give life meaning, even if for only a moment or two, is fodder for cackling derision. And when everything is meaningless there's really nothing for anyone, whether an individual or the political order, to protect. In Coen World, you're nothing more than a punchline.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

Highlights are Tom Wait's prospector in ""All Gold Canyon"", Tim Blake Nelson as the cowboy crooner Buster Scruggs in the films opening chapter, and also Harry Melling as the limbless and tragic side show character Harrison in ""Meal Ticket"". Simply brilliant Netflix.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
426,benjaminbuss,Riveting anthology of the old west,8,9 April 2021,"These set of endearingly dark tales piece together to form a highly enjoyable feature chronicling life on the frontier in post-civil war America.Many of the common hallmarks of writer/directors the Cohen brothers works are clearly evident throughout the picture...Quirky dark humour, old school violence, bleak interludes and stunning cinematography with a Wild West backdrop. Each of the stories within the anthology make for intriguing viewing, without relating to each other or providing an overall consistency to the picture on a whole. But this unevenness doesn't detract from the solidity of the artefact with the commonality of period and setting binding everything together coherently.The opening three tales of the anthology set an intriguingly quirky tone. Goofy gunslinging, failed bank robbery's, public executions and travelling freak shows all themes concluding in an unhappy manner. There is a sense that this feature is to be a throwing together of less than serious 'off-cuts' of ideas which the Cohen's needed to release from their extensive vault of inspiration.The two extracts of the anthology that follow change the dynamic of the picture in a tremendously positive way, adding weight to the preceding fragments. Tom Waits excellently portrays a vagabond camping out in a utopian green valley, who decides to seek for gold beneath the surrounding soils. This tale is immense visually, with glorious warm tones and paradisiacal scenery. Despite its potentially sad and violent conclusion, this story leaves a heightened sense of warmth to the feeling of the picture.The next vignette follows the movements of an unprosperous young woman, played by Zoe Kazan, travelling the prairie on a wagon train to seek a new life in a new town. Her life unravels with the beautiful landscapes culminating in her untimely demise. This brilliantly compressed section of emotion and violence on the frontier has the foundations for a feature length picture of its own. The anthology draws to its end with a less memorable but intriguing dark tale, following the stage coach journey of six characters with underlying secrets, and sinister motives.The structure of this film will never make this a classic of the ages, but nevertheless this is a brilliantly entertaining feature with glorious visuals, and sound score, superb character portrayals and a finely balanced level of pleasure and pain.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
427,jnk71155,Some Obvious Continuity Goofs Spoil an Overall Excellent Film,8,19 January 2020,"While I'm usually not one to get ""picky"" over the details, some of the goofs in continuity with this movie were hard to ignore. The main thing I noticed is that the horses kept changing color. As an example, when the Bank Robber (James Franco) rides up to the bank, he's riding a white horse. Later, when the posse goes to hang him, he's on a brown horse and members of the posse are asking him to give it to them. Later in the movie the Prospector has a brown mule; however, as he leaves his claim at the end of the segment, the mule is white.Overall though I thought this was the best Netflix Original movie I've seen. I also wonder, because the movie was so tongue in cheek, whether the changes in horse color weren't done purposely and I'm missing some deeper meaning.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

429,Gary-ks,A film comprising Coens,8,18 November 2018,"Coens work spectrum ranges from black crime comedies to eccentric black comedies with farce elements. The leitmotiv in most of their work is ones believe his own almightyness undermined by unpredictiveness of his fate.
This anthology has it all and therefor ironically, less accessible for most of the viewers.
Some of the self defined Coens fans are mostly action/crime movie consumers who can easily relate to movies like 'Fargo' or 'No country for an old man' but appalled by philological journey into unappealing characters soul(les) existence.
It's not that this two movies are inferior to their other works (they are not). It's just they can be viewed with much less attention and thinking and still be enjoyable to most.
The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is different. It's the kind of movie that will get low scores by one who expect violence and fast passed story development and therefor less recommended for the broad public. It's not that the violence is not there, it is, but there is much more than that to each story and each one of them is brutal and, although stylistically made as a classical western, is far too realistic in it's depiction of life in the cruel wild west.
First story is about Buster Scrugg himself, a man matching into Coens pattern of an overconfident fella who find his end unpredictably for him and for us the viewers as well.
Second story is about an unfortunate clumsy bank robber and is the least compelling one. The first frame of Franco standing in front of the bank he is about to rob made me think what is this Hollywood brat doing in the wild west.
Franco completely unfitted to play the role and look like a bright red spot in a black and white movie.
Next story is about grim impresario and a disabled, dependent actor performing over and over again classical pieces in front of an ignorant public. Their silent coexistence depicted magnificently by Liam Neeson and Harry Melling. This two humans tied by circumstances have nothing in common and although the impresario emits some humanity toward the poet he doesn't considers him as a 'whole' human being and disregard his feeling and his existence as appears at the end.
Next one, 'All Gold Canyon' is my favorite. It's very classic and exceptionally well played solo by Tom Waits. It's 'The old man and the sea' in the way it portraits an old man doing what he knows best and survives despite the odds.
Next one has it all - loss, love, battle and sudden unneeded death. It's the only story that could become a full movie and as a short story felt undeveloped to me.
Last one reminded me some of Tarantino movies and consisted almost entirely of a dialog between random characters representing different sides of the west world. It might have lots of meaning, which I may discover as I re-watch the movie in the future but I prefer characters to express their filling and ideas by their actions and their body and facial expressions instead of spitting them out for us to hear.
The movie is not flawless but along with that it is a masterpiece with a huge potential for rewatchability like most of the Coens movies.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

437,komradekontroll,A Million Ways to Be Bored in the West,7,28 November 2018,"The Coen brothers have hit it big in the past with a seemingly boring, slow plot in movies like No Country for Old Men. They've shown us that they can do westerns, comedies, dramas, and movies with fantastical elements.All of these things are present in Scruggs, but the overall package fails to achieve what the Coen Bros have done in the past.However, Scruggs manages to have a few short stories that are very good. The title story in question to start was very tongue in cheek, fast paced, fun, and lighthearted. The fourth wall breaking was even done just the right amount. The problem is that this level of effort doesn't seem to carry over until the fourth story with the prospector.The dark humor is present in every story, but some are better than others at winking to the audience. This can create a feeling of tonal inconsistency.By the second story the movie has already turned away from the lighthearted nature of Scruggs and has focused more on irony. It does well enough, and the ""panshot"" character brings some needed levity.The third story seems fairly divisive. Some see it as the slice of dark comedy that it is, while others simply see it as depressing. Well, it's both. The biggest issue is the sheer lack of winking to the audience. The lighthearted nature of the movie is now gone and the comedy is told through very subtly placed shots. No doubt it is very depressing though.After the story of the curator I was convinced that the tone wouldn't shift back at all, but then Tom Waits appeared on my screen. Waits has consistently shown how terrific of an actor he is, and this might be my favorite performance of his. This segment is beautifully shot and the story very simple. Waits' performance packs enough raw and real humor to make his gold obsession seem hilarious. The twist towards the end does a great job of displaying how harsh the world was then, while adding a fat layer of dark humor to it.Honestly after the fourth segment I would suggest turning the movie off. The next two segments are as well shot, as well acted, and as well executed as the rest, but they (mainly the fifth segment) are really trying your patience. You could watch them if you're curious, or at least skip number five, but that's the beauty of an anthology movie, you don't have to watch the whole thing. There's some dark humor to be had, but make no mistake that the incredibly dry tone, reserved performances, and overall length of the fifth segment make it a drag, and naturally, ends on a low note that doesn't feel earned.If you made it to the end you'll be greeted with a shorter story set in one location with dialogue that is rather mundane, though the performances themselves are at least a little witty. It's a pretty weak way to end the movie and it's why I say shut it off after the Tom Waits segment.Scruggs was really enjoyable at its best, and mediocre or boring at its worst. Recommended for the first four segments, but after that, click off.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

When someone tells me they like this movie, my first question is, ""why?""...it is totally unfocused, none of the stories line up, the first segment is a sappy singing cowboy sharpshooter so folksy he becomes a foolish parody, the end of the segment an obvious attempt at subversion. The following stories become more and more boring, ending with a tale of 5 coach travelers that seem to be characters in search of a story, and ending in a non-sensical way so obtuse the viewer actually wonders if they missed something. Like Tarantino, the Coen fans will never admit their directors cannot make a bad movie, if you took out the long boring sequences, this movie would be about 40 minutes long and that means something we call ""padding"". The worst part is that if they had simply stuck with the buster story, they may have been able to turn it into a comedy with some cartoonish violence and a few songs but the opportunity is wasted and we are left with some depressing stuff....the almost non-vocal story of a paraplegic entertainer was just awful, like a bad joke, and another story of a pan miner in the wilderness I had to fast-forward through, more padding....in short, the only people that will enjoy this are Coen brother fans, but the film is much too uneven to enjoy on its own for viewers that just want some good stories; telling a boring story is not ""subversion"", it is just a boring story, offered up by people that think they know what the fans, Coen brothers fans, Tarantino fans, etc., want; the end result is a sloppy mess that will be praised by a group claiming it is a great film, the rest of us are left scratching our heads and being labeled as stupid and unimaginative because we don't agree.

It contains both long soliloquies, and long periods of silence. Some dialogue is absurd, some dialogue is profound, yet it all works.It's also a history of the American Western, in a sense.

452,deedee965,Depressing Black Humor,3,21 November 2018,"I would like to start off by saying that I am a Coen Brothers fan, for the most part. ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" is one of my favorite movies. So, needless to say, when I saw the trailer for this movie I didn't hesitate to want to see it thinking I would enjoy another Coen Brothers comedy. It turns out I was sadly disappointed. I should add that I am probably not in the best frame of mind to review this movie as I am currently suffering from depression and anxiety. However, here goes. Given my present state of mind I found the black humor in this film to just exacerbate my current feelings of depression and anxiety. I do believe that one's current mood when viewing a movie affects one's perception of said movie. Maybe, if I were in a different frame of mind I would have a more favorable opinion of this film. But it is what it is. I mainly wanted to point out a glaring mistake that appears in this film. All you biologists out there please correct me if I'm wrong but is it not true that in nature birds' eggs, for the most part, contain a chick embryo? Therefore in the scene where Tom Wait's character steals an egg from an owl's nest and then when it is shown frying in a pan it looks like any chicken egg you would pick up at the grocery store. That is it has a yolk. In reality, would it not contain a bird embryo instead? Something that I personally would not find to be very appetizing.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

At several points I almost turned it off but I stuck with it. Really wishing I would have turned it off after the second story. The first story was okay but not really sure if it was meant to be funny or not? Interesting character but it felt incomplete. The second story with Franco started out really good but then just abruptly ended with no real point. The third story with the quadriplegic just confused me. Maybe I missed something but nothing ever really happened, pointless. The rest doesn't even deserve a mention. Two stars for the pretty photography at times, other than that, horribly boring to me.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

465,arlosanchezofficial,What Movie Did You Guys Watch?,3,23 November 2018,"I have loved the Coen Brothers since I was thirteen years old and have appreciated and admired their craft and style. Every film they make is wildly different from the other, while maintaining that same Coen Brothers feel. When I saw their last outing, 'Hail Caesar,' I felt a pit in my stomach. After so many years of making wholly original and engaging films, have they lost their luster? After watching 'The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,' I feel like I'm witnessing a slow but steady descent for the Coens.This movie had my full interest with its first story; the unpredictability of the Buster Scruggs character had me wondering what he was going to do next. I expected him to be a recurring character that tied the stories together, but no such luck. Then came James Franco's story, which had a promising setup, a hilarious bank telling side character, and an abrupt ending that brought the story nowhere. Okay, I'm still interested. Then I was subjected to four horrifically boring segments that all went absolutely nowhere with no satisfying payoffs or memorable moments. I would have described the rest, but I struggle to remember anything about them.I don't know what the Coen Brothers are doing anymore. What was the point of this movie? Was it to relay that all stories of the Wild West don't have satisfactory payoffs or actual endings? Was this movie a metaphor for greed? I mean, a majority of the characters get into their predicaments over greediness, but again, there's no payoff. The movie doesn't even end on a high note; the final story is just confusing, uneventful and yet presents itself like a revelatory thing. To see this movie get such high praise is baffling. There is no way anyone who enjoys an actual cinematic experience can claim they were interested the entire time. In fact, I'm sure the Coens dumped this film on Netflix because they knew people could fast forward the slower scenes, the sometimes overbearing dialogue and the many, many musical numbers that drag on for much too long and bear little importance to the stories being told. Take off your blinders and chill out-- This is not one of the Coens' best films, and it's most certainly not even close to being one of the best movies of the year.I hope their next film is a good one.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
466,stefanknezovic,The end saves it,7,2 April 2020,"All I could think of was that this is Hollywood trying to play the youthful passionate fresh out of college filmmaker. It is painfully obvious that the directors have outgrown the specific type of magic that youth provides and should stick to what they do. Halfway through the movie I took out my phone and gave it a 6. The last few stories were good, very good actually, so now it is a 7, simply due to the fact that I cannot forgive the surgicalness of the first half. This movie was made to be adored by critics, and they've eaten it up. One cup visually appealing scenes and generally delightfully odd cinematography, one half cup comically absurd characters, a cup and a half of superb weird musical score and a dash of ""out of the ordinary"". On paper, perfection, however a movie is not a sum of its parts, perhaps the temperature was a bit too high, or one of the fans in the oven was broken while baking this film, either way, something is off.

Tim Blake Nelson brings an Oscar nominated song to a fairly ridiculous collapse of a infamous showdown cowboy. 8/10Near Algodones changes to the atmosphere from a comical showdown to a suspenseful robbery and bloody interactions with the natives. 5/10Meal Ticket. This one definitely takes the cake for its oddity. A story of a quadriplegic showman who is carried thoughout the west by Liam Nissen performing shows. 9/10All Gold Canyons. Probably my favorite of the films. This film shows the lawless west mixed with the hope of the new world. The riches go to those who take advantage of others. 10/10The Gal who Got Rattled. The film really slows down during this part of the film. I compare it to a shorter version of Meeks Cutoff. it is definetely a crucial piece of Western life. 6/10The Mortal Remains. A decent closer to the film. Somehow the Coen Brothers still manage to leave us a tiny cliffhanger and leave the glory of the Wild West to us to decipher. 6/10",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
470,Rebul21,Just sit back and enjoy,10,3 September 2020,"Unlike most films from Joel and Ethan Coen, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs doesn't demand a certain focused mindset to watch, digest, and enjoy every aspect of the film in great detail; it instead is a great spectacle to sit back and simply enjoy.The ever-interesting Brothers present us with a great look at the Wild West in an almost raw and gritty way, and the film distances itself entirely from the usual Hollywood type. It consists of six completely independent short stories; although they all seem to have the theme of showing the Wild West as what it really was. The film doesn't fall into any tropes or clichés and doesn't play by, really any, rules. It portrays a wide range of individuals and their stories, and does so extremely well. Each story is interesting in its own way with some very touching and real moments, especially Liam Neeson committing a certain act and showing what humans are really like - selfish and really only looking out for themselves (especially in the Wild West). The script is very well crafted, the dialogue just feels right and doesn't over do it, and even when no words are spoken it is entirely appropriate and helps create part of a great atmosphere and story. With the great script comes superb acting. From Tim Blake Nelson's overtly over-the-top, hilarious acting as the title character to Tom Waits as a quite wholesome and determined gold digger, in every single one of these shorts the acting is on point and although each character has such short screen-time and a virtually non-existent backstory, the acting paired with the script somehow quickly immerses us with each character and makes each of them interesting in different ways.
Although the Coen's did not team up with their usual cinematographer in Roger Deakins, they did team up with Bruno Delbonnel who did a fantastic job capturing the stunning and appropriate landscapes that help make this film shine. The score also fits very nicely with the overall atmosphere and pace of the film.While the Ballad of Buster Scruggs is not a must-watch, it is a very refreshing, entertaining and new take on the Wild West genre, and even in film in general. It is a great film for the Coen Brothers to add to their filmography.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

472,devolute,A review wherein every comment is a spoiler,7,18 November 2018,"With a genre that remained popular in America for almost a century, the Coen Brothers had a lot of sub-genres to draw from. The first three stories all end with hero-dies-end-of story. By the time the fourth story of the gold prospector looks like more of the same, it then provided much need relief. However looking back on The Gal Got Rattled, it was clear this started out as an ending like all the others that needed a set up. Somewhere along the way, this went way beyond the other stories. Unlike everything else, there was actual character development and three distinct acts. I thought perhaps this one would be the feature and the preceding stories were like the serials of old westerns in the 30s and 40s, but in the end it was just hero-dies-end-of-story. I understand that the premise was to use the characters of old Westerns and I don't want to be accused of trying to be so PC I'm spoiling everyone's fun. However, when all of the characters are very, very white, and all of the men are rugged, resolute and mostly grizzled and all of the women are not too bright and dependent, and every Native American is a blood thirsty savage where is the interest or surprise really? How do you make a farce or reinvent a genre while ignoring it's most obvious (at least to us now) faults? The last story brought three old western tropes face to face with the random cruelty of death for the convenience and even pleasure of others. After five stories, hitting us with the theme once again like a bullet to the forehead adds nothing. BTW I never liked Tyne Daly much before this, so that was a plus. I was certainly entertained enough while I watched the whole movie, but these faults just bothered me enough that in the end all I felt was disappointment.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

I enjoyed the signature quirkiness and characterisation for about a third in to the storytelling. After that, I found it hard to be invested in the characters - they all share a similar arc.
The camerawork and setting is awesome but I got mindnumbingly bored rather quickly because the episodic storytelling doesn't work and the segments are highly irregular in quality.

Of course, you can provoke your own death because you think things are desperate ... but you might be wrong (""The Girl Who Got Rattled""). Anyway... in the end, there are only two kind of people : dead or alive (The Mortal Remains).I only gave 9 stars as I found ""Meal Ticket"" to be a bit lengthy at times.

487,frankparnell,The Coen Brothers deliver a brilliant and unique return to form for the western genre,8,18 July 2019,"At the point of writing this review the superhero genre is in full swing, with the MCU leading the pack of the franchise movie craze which began with Iron Man (2008). Back in the 1950's to 1970's however the movie genre most popular would be ones revolving around the western era, titles in this era include The Magnificent Seven (1960) and Sergio Leone's 'Man With No Name Trilogy' (1964-1966). The genre made a return in the early 2010's with Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained (2012) yet since then it has returned to falling by the wayside of popular film genres. In my opinion however, 2018's answer to the dying film craze and the saving grace for the genre is Netflix's and the the Coen Brothers' The Ballad Of Buster Scruggs.The film follows completely contrasting characters living in the old west in six separate anthology stories ranging from the violent lawlessness to the insane and bizarre. As directors however, the Coen Brothers aren't strangers to the western genre of film with their 2010 remake of the 1969 John Wayne original True Grit being one of the biggest surprise hits of that year, I do however feel The Ballad Of Buster Scruggs excels their first attempt and here creates a far better film.What this film should pride itself the most on its writing, and its ability to form compelling, complex and interesting characters and stories that I personally found interesting and wanted to see how they played out and concluded. Although some stories dip in quality/interest, each one has contrasting and individual characters, keeping the film fresh and feeling original, a credit that not many big budget motion pictures can confidently attain. Being introduced to the story of Buster Scruggs at the beginning of the film was an ideal and exciting way to introduce the audience to the narrative, seeing the world through the eyes of the smart taking, witty and singing outlaw was a charming and exciting way to begin the film.Tim Blake Nelson stars as the title character of Buster Scruggs, and brings to life a character of contrasting qualities with his obscene level of charm, humour and elegance to an outlaw character, unlike anything from the genre and creating someone unlike anyone else I've seen from a big budget film. All performances across the board are superb and is dripping with characters. James Franco, Liam Neeson, Harry Melling, Johnjo O'Neill and Brandon Gleeson all deliver spellbinding performances for their individual story segments. Each performance elevating the overall quality of the film and is by far the best take away from the film as a finished product.As for negatives for the film, pacing does become a bit of an issue during the mid point of the film. After the stories 'The Ballad Of Buster Scruggs' and 'Near Algodones' are concluded each proceeding story has a much longer duration, and unfortunately in my opinion both of the above are the most interesting stories overall and I personally would've been happy to stay with these characters for as long as we do with characters in later stories. The Liam Neeson and Harry Melling starting 'Meal Ticket' continues to be able to keep my interest, perhaps due to the pairs tragic performances. After this however came the stories 'All Gold Canyon' and 'The Gal Who Got Rattled' and for me personally didn't capture the same character as it's counterparts, however entertaining, these two take up most of the films 133 minute runtime, which slows the films pace after its brilliant, exciting and eccentric beginning.As for the negatives for the film that is it for me, the film does end on a high with 'The Mortal Remains' with a mesmerising performance from Johnjo O'Neill and definitely recaptured what made the first few segments so great. This is by far a brilliant effort by the Coen Brothers and a return to form for the western genre and for me a must see for anyone with a Netflix subscription. Perhaps a shortened runtime to make each story feel concise and each character is given equal and reasonable screen time would make the overall qualitly of the film feel more satisfying.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

496,marcospenajr,The soul and its variations,9,26 November 2018,"The Coen brothers (known, among others, for ""Fargo"", ""The Ladykillers"", ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""Burn After Reading"") sign the script and are responsible for directing ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"". No wonder, the movie looks like a collection of short stories. By the way, this is the way the work is presented, it is something like if the viewer were reading a book of short stories (this way, in the first person). Summarizing and anticipating: the film is very, very good.It begins with the story of the criminal Buster Scruggs, a lively gunslinger from the old American West, who is always dressed in white, and is all the time smiling and singing. This first story begins in a dazzling location, a desert full of rock formations. Although there is apparently some digital processing for the images, there is already a great delivery of the work. Scruggs gets into a dispute when he arrives in a typical American West saloon. In attempting to refuse to have a previous played hand in a poker table, his opponent tells him, ""You see'em, you play'em!"" (Something like: ""You saw the cards, so you play with them""). This is the moment when Scruggs leaves everyone stunned with his action and his ability. ""I do not have a bad nature, but when you are disarmed your tactics must be Archimedes"". What exactly Scruggs meant by Archimedes' tactics is a point to be discovered. The movie is full of such references.Only 12'45"" of the movie passed and you just to find it sensational!!! Five bullets, five fingers, and the last one upside down, on its back and through the mirror!!! It's more than fun and creativity, it's pure animation for any afternoon!! But ""you can not be the best forever"", and the forever lasts less than an eighth of the total of all the stories to be told. Exceptional! Killers-singers in the old western. The strongest, the best survive, goes on ... until finds the next ""stronger and best"".James Franco entering a bank in the middle of nowhere and vying with a small, half-crazy old man. A performance to be remembered, though short. The desire to see this story in a long with Franco acting in this way becomes enormous. Money bags to the Coen brothers!! They deserve it. Four Judgments! Four! ""First time""??? Fine, hilarious irony, comedy in the midst of lawless savagery. Joel and Ethan Coen do not need to think about robbing a bank, they deserve to receive bags of money.Can all tragedy, all drama, all humiliation and pain be concentrated in one life? Is Liam Neeson incapable of being a different character? Can a human being be less valuable than a chicken? Some men are content to use others as instruments. If their morality allows them, they are able to use another life as a means to reach a small goal. In the same way, they are able to get rid of such a life, easily, without costing them much. ""... government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth""; the Coen brothers' message in this direct quote from the Gettysburg Address - from then-US President Abraham Lincoln, who delivered it during the American Civil War on November 19, 1863 (is turning 155 on this 19) - could not be more clear.Can human being be a force that frightens all nature? It seems certain that the force that drives human beings to conquest, to the will to possess, leads him to overcome what he must overcome. Tom Waits has an excellent performance, makes to get life from the screen the message of how much man's drive to work as a means to conquests is intense, and as intense as the possibility of gain. The work can be sweaty, painful and moral; or amoral, dirty and treacherous (in fact, non-work). Often, ""Only footprints in the field and the earth shaken have been left by the turbulent life that had interrupted the peace of the place and moved on"". What really matters if the earning potential is high?!And life can pirouette, and make everything that seemed solid and sure turn into quicksand. Only the despair remains. Just lack and absence. And even in absence is the cooperation that moves us ahead. The history of man is not a story of brave, strong, intelligent, cunning solitary conquerors. The lonely, brave and strong, died without spreading their genes. Humans who cooperated with each other went further, lived longer, built more, overcame more challenges, achieved more offspring, and left history to the spread of their genes.Where does the human being finally come to? Try to understand who we are? Understanding what, in the end, does differ from one another ... Each of us seems to believe that have the answers, no matter how broad or narrow our experiences, each individual insists to have (and to be) the right measure. You can see this in the most crowded crowd in a big ""arena"" or in the strictest group in the smallest of cubicles. Each individual is taking his life, judging others, being repulsive, gradually drifting away from futile motives of one another, entertained with nonsense, failing to do, to be, wasting much of life. When the journey is over, when the end of the line arrives, it is not uncommon the traveler has thrown away the opportunity to enjoy the trip without ever having really understood what has happened and what is happening around him.To the Coen brothers, it remains to be thanked for the excellent doses of comedy, drama, tragedy, suspense and reasons to reflect. The six stories in the film have an incredible sequel and logic between them, although they are subtle and hard to perceive - they are not in the ""field of the script itself"", but in that of human nature. Joel and Ethan deserve every success they have ever achieved. A success that must still increase in their lives and to which ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" is already taking them. The film has gained much recognition, received nominations in the festivals of Venice, Adelaide and Camerimage, having won the award for best screenplay in the first. Admittedly, the film's name will be read a few times at the upcoming Oscar's ceremony.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

498,jackbecker007,The Coens deliver a solid anthology film,7,4 March 2019,"This is a really good anthology film. Of course, the six vignettes are not created equally, but they really don't feel uneven. There is an exceptional ebb and flow in this film. Tonally, these stories fit together quite nicely.Personally, I really enjoyed the stories ""All Gold Canyon"" and ""The Gal Who Got Rattled."" I don't have any major complaints with any of the stories, they were all well written. Even ""The Mortal Remains"", which wasn't as strong of a story, was fitting for the Coens aesthetic (though it was a bit anti-climactic to use as the final story).The cinematography is beautiful. This was the Coen Bros.' first film shot digitally, and it was magnificently realized. The West never looked so good!The acting was fine. It was what it needed to be, the actors were well cast. The one standout for me was Tom Waits in ""All Gold Canyon"". His character was transcendent.All in all, I really liked this movie.

502,rnys22,Satisfyingly Dissatisfying!,8,27 April 2020,"I've always come out of movies entertained but a bit dismayed that the films are routinely geared towards tales of the heroic or have some tragedy overcome. That's so often the point of going - to hear a story worth being told, but it's not usually reflected in our world no matter how hard one works.In reality, one decision or character flaw or - as the Coen Brothers often reference, blind luck - could terminate the entire story is over in the snap of your fingers before you even know anything about the subject. I came away from ""No Country for Old Men"" thinking the most about the story of the man killed at the traffic stop rather than any of the major players (and similarly in ""Fargo"" with the roles reversed). If you ever wanted to know more about them and why that wasn't their movie, I felt like I got the answers here.I think this cutesy project tells us why it's so difficult to have them as the subject of a film, but this was done better than nearly anyone else could have done. I blindly went into this expecting each of the six stories to connectI'm not sure I would have ordered the chapters in the same way. The first and last could almost be reversed, but there is some art to this. If reversed, you are left with more of a cliffhanger in the first and end on a slightly happier note rather than killing off the title character at the 20 minute mark! But I know that's just another one of their tricks to get their nihilistic message across.Overall, The Girl Who Got Rattled was easily the best at getting the main message across and was so deeply and perfectly dissatisfying. A half hour on monotony like paying bills and dogs barking too much and the happiness of plotting a spontaneous family homestead thanks to a heroic stranger only for all the plans to mean nothing for no good reason.Tom Waits also gives a splendid performance in All Gold Canyon, which was a real highlight for me as the only positive outcome. I'm glad there is still a one-in-six chance of a true hero getting what he deserves for all the work he put in, but it would have been easiest to see them write his demise - given the amount of hard work he put in and the karma he built with the owl eggs. All of that really should have no correlation to his success, but for once, I am relieved it did, and I hope he can keep quiet about his loot and keep his vital organs intact!Meal Ticket rounds out the top half of the stories for me. Even though you can see where that is going from the get-go, it's a great tale to tell, especially with regard to the American West. In this country, you only have value so much as 'what are you doing for me lately', you only get to keep a small amount of the value you create and are prohibited from any excess as that is kept for the ruling class, which disposes of you when you no longer produce. A great microcosm of how we treat people who have harnessed special gifts that have more value than what people are willing to pay for them.The title sketch was extremely humorous, and I adored the song and the poker scene. The ending was incredibly satisfying for all those with skepticism and 'what-if's about split second shootouts that change the course of a film, and I've come to understand why they start like that. Not everything can end with a (for some reason, beloved) murderer floating up to heaven.The only one I didn't terribly care for was the last sketch. I guess someone has something to worry about. But they probably deserve whatever is coming. Ends on a bit of a dull note. But this was a very ambitious and difficult project that was done quite successfully like no one else could do it. 8.3 stars",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
503,OKAK,Another Coen Bothers classic for the Netflex massis.,9,2 April 2019,"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a new Coen brother film on Netflix. It dose everything you expect a Coen brother film to be like ,Honesty , they prove their talents and much more with this film. It tells 6 short story with the only commonalty that there all in the western genre.
I want to stress how perfect the concept on this film is. The brother are in there 60s they style of film in not much in demand these days ,(for example :the big labousky understanding comes into mind after sitting on it and thinking about it a bit after the film ended, Nowadays people don't have the time to digest films like that anymore) the slice of life film genre feels slow in today's pacing usually. I was expecting the Coen's to show there age as much as other great directors after the hay-days BUT
This film being in tight short story really brings out the best quality in every department.
Each story has a different but familiar western vibe written in a way to keep you guessing with most of its. The star studded cast all performed well. The set design ,costume, cinematography and sound are all great as well. This film struggles to show any flaw would recommend going in blind to this film its dark humour is worth a crowd what better way to
relive in the wester genre and who better then the dialog nailing ,character building, Amirian Coen Brothers. 9\10P.S why not a 10/10 for a film to get that rating I think it has to be one cohesive story.

I generally love Coen Bros stories/movies, but I feel like they are messing with us; like the Emperor 's New Clothes. How far can they push the line before viewers call them on it? Nothing good ever happens; after the first two stories the viewer knows to expect the worst to happen, and it does. If you like depressing, weird and ugly human nature this is the movie for you.

Perhaps the Coens have not ever heard of this work. Irrespective, this film, like the book, brilliantly employs entertaining vignettes, all darkly humorous by varying shades, to remind the viewer that Death is ever-present and will leisurely stalk and claim its prey in the end. Death's dart is often times depicted as striking in an absurdly comical manner. And who Death takes and how is, as in life, at times bizarely unpredictable and a quite unjust. The portrayal of Death in such scenarios is disturbingly amusing, if only because the viewer witnesses events at a safe distance. For those who enjoy and admire Combe and Rowlandson's literary masterpiece, ""The Tale of Buster Scrugs"" is a superb re-telling of the age-old theme of Danse Macabre via a modern medium for contemporary audiences. Were ""The English Dance of Death"" ever to be made into a film, it is doubtful that such a work could better the mood and intent of ""Buster Scrugs"".",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

There were only 2 stories that really fulfilled my expectation for this movie: ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" with a hilarious role played by Tim Blake Nelson (Buster Scruggs) and ""Near Algodones"" with James Franco ""Cowboy"", that made me laugh genuinely.
Talking about the other 3, they were just tolerable, with simple stories, nothing memorable.
The last segment was a ""slow burn"" path that ends the movie with some (more) dark humor, but nothing extraordinary.

WHAT THE GENRE NEEDS IS A SHOT IN THE ARM OF REALITY.A reality of fascinating and cruel military campaigns during this rapid expansion, an era of slaves and free men (look up Bass Reeves and ask yourself ""where is his movie?""), an era of Chinese laborers, an era started by mexican bucaros to become American Buckeroos: My point is that it is so much bigger and rich with conflict and humanity............. that few ever touch upon in fear that reality limits the fantasy.Have we made so many Westerns that we can't leave the wagon train and a few protestants with guns and recognize the territory and the century that made and ended it as a place of possibilities?NOPE, this movie seems to say, lock yourself in the kitchen and use only the ingredients we have used and not one spice or new meat. It has to be always about a white guy walking somewhere to get his future whether by farm or theft.Never about a boxer fighting for pennies in a gambling ring on a sunken riverboat in the Mississipi.Never a child raised with voodoo as a religion pretending to be a christian to hide in a wagon train, but feeling heart broken and alone to keep the secret.Not a Chinese railway worker trying to read and write poetry without speaking english, thus he is treated like a particular idiot and punching bag by his overseers.Not a Native American.

I think the prospector (guy looking for gold) is the one people are questioning - but I think he died with that bullet in the back... however his respect for the owl (signifying a higher being) meant he got a second chance. He lived an honest hard working life. There was reference to God, born again Christians and worship to a higher being in the film too across many stories. Some may say his surviving was luck (just like when he hit gold), but he was simply blessed.The other scene being questioned is the last one. The rider is the grim reaper, and all those in the scene are dead - on there way to the afterlife. The lady refers to her husband in the past tense, whom she is going to meet. They had no luggage to take in the 'hotel' - the last and only stop of the journey. You never see the reapers face. As always its open to interpretation.I have only watched it once but will be watching it again to pick up on more clever layers of messaging.On first watch, what i took away from this film is the wonderful variety of people, perspectives and stories in the film, which is reflected in reality and nature. We are all just letters etched in the pages of a very large book, the book of time... Individually, we don't mean much - but when we work together and contribute to a wider goal - we can tell interesting stories and perhaps even shape the future for those that follow.Peace.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

No one else on here has commented on it, is that just because it's the norm for all Westerns? I understand that obviously it's appropriate for the time period and place for white characters to be racist but considering it was an anthology of multiple films maybe at least one of them could've depicted a racial minority in a good light or at the very least in a speaking role!!",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

551,timbarnden,Sadly misunderstood it seems,10,3 December 2018,"I'm confused as to what films have been watched by those reviewers who claim to be life long Coen brothers fans yet dislike this one. For me this is a superb return to form after the mediocre silliness of recent offerings. Here are six short stories- all entirely unrelated aside from period and location. It is almost necessary to review six different films as all the stories are very different in scope and feel.
The abruptness and change in feel with which one story ends and another begins might be jarring if you were not expecting it, but if you're aware from the start that these are short stories it all works nicely.
All stories feature the Coens' trademark character driven plots, deeply dark but sparkling humour and ambiguous morality. Again this total lack of reaching some moral conclusion will leave some people uncomfortable but to me it is a reflecion of real life: This is what happened- impose your own judgement if you wish. For me this is one of the most refreshing aspects of all their films.
Each story seems to be a microcosm reflection of the wider world, exploring what it is that makes us humans seem so different, and what brings us together.
A contender for my favourite Coen brothers film ever, and that's really saying something!",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
552,ronaldhoffman,"Averages out at ""brilliant""",8,4 March 2019,"When a movie takes the format of an anthology, the result is bound to be a mixed bag. This is certainly the case for The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, the latest work to come from the esteemed Joel and Ethan Coen - the six component stories, all set in the Old West, range from ""I chuckled"" to ""damn near perfect.""The movie works best when the Coens play to their strengths. There are two cinematic elements, for instance, of which they are the undisputed masters. The first, like in Fargo or Inside Llewyn Davis is dialogue, which the Coens use to inject a dose of humour and uniqueness into everyday life. So much of the humour in Coen Brothers films is premised on the characters navigating minor issues, but in a way that is so authentic and relatable that you can't help but laugh. The second is the kind of overwhelming, haunting, bigness of the world which we see in A Serious Man -- a sense that our world is so baffling and incomprehensible that we can only truly understand a small piece of it (if that). This is why their characters end up in over their heads so quickly.There's the winning formula, and the key to understanding The Ballad of Buster Scruggs - when the characters have a chance to converse, or when the supernatural begins to creep in along the edges, you get brilliance.
Perhaps the Coen Brothers also have a sense of this, because they certainly saved the best stories for last. ""The Gal Who Got Rattled"" is exquisitely scripted, and Zoe Kazan, Bill Heck and Grainger Hines all give realistic, compelling performances. Kazan and Heck have perfect chemistry, enough to make a complete love story blossom in a scant half-hour. After keeping Grainger's character, Mr. Arthur, virtually silent for the entire vignette, the Coen Brothers treat us to a satisfying and heart-wrenching conclusion by sweeping the sheet off his character, revealing a steady hand and a touching dedication to his friend. ""The Mortal Remains"" is also beautifully scripted, and the conversation of the motley crew riding in a carriage through Colorado would have been a joy to watch even without the eeriness that slowly works its way to the surface. The terror creeps up so slowly and smoothly that you barely realize the light-hearted, sunset Western you started watching has transmogrified into a dark and dimly lit Gothic.The first two vignettes don't quite come together like the final two - likely due to their short length. ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" relies heavily on slapstick and bursts of violence; and ""Beyond Algodones"" on a compelling, twisting plot. Plot twists and visual gags both work best when the audience is caught off guard, but the few minutes devoted to each short aren't quite enough to lull the audience into a false sense of security. As a result, these stories looked like the most climactic moments of Fargo or Burn After Reading - but lacked the punchiness they needed.That's not to say that the early vignettes were unredeemed disasters - indeed, all the stories had a lot to praise. Every short came with gorgeous scenery; a lively, rousing soundtrack; moments of dark humour; and unique characters. The first two vignettes had the right ingredients; they just didn't get the cooking times quite right; and the middle stories, ""Meal Ticket"" and ""All Gold Canyon,"" even while lacking the utter transcendence of the closers, were compelling, solidly acted and beautifully shot.You can see what you get when you average out the movie: a well-crafted anthology with great work throughout and some truly sublime moments. The varying stories gave the Coen Brothers a chance to experiment with various techniques and styles, and while some were more successful than others, I hope they lead to many more movies like The Ballad of Buster Scruggs.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

This anthology film is one of the most compelling, fun, and thought provoking I have seen in a very long time. The individual stories each have their own style, some being campy and funny while others are deadly serious. But it's always a very thoughtful yet sometimes brutal movie that kept me interested throughout.It's worth nothing that the 5th story is probably twice as long as the rest. It's more of a love story that can only end one way (and if you've seen their previous work, you can probably guess how). It serves as a sort of key to understanding everything before it, as well as the final story after it.Great performances are expected and yet easily appreciated. Overall, this is both a comforting format for this material and yet leaves us moved and slightly traumatized.

562,imperioaustrohungaro,Flawless,10,27 November 2018,"Watched on Netflix, then watched again, immediately. First time I've ever done that, but there's so much in this film, you can come back to it again and again and it'll never disappoint. An absolute masterpiece.The conceit of the book with colour plates complete with glassine interleaves works perfectly: the initial illustration and caption gives the viewer a handle on each story, pointing towards its theme, sometimes forcing the viewer to do a double.take (think of the caption to the plate for ""All Gold Canyon""), as do the fleeting shots of first and last pages of each story, stylishly written in a manner presumably intended as reminiscent of old Penny Westerns - but with a literary pedigree going back to Jack London and beyond (I thought of Maupassant several times). The mathematical chicken left alone in the rattling carriage ""dimly surmising"" what its future might be in the closing text was an especially nice touch. For those of us who grew up devouring story books with captioned plates or illustrations, the movie will strike a nostalgic chord: intentionally or not, I don't know.The difference in style and tone between the six stories is not quite enough to undermine the pretension of a single-.volume collection, but certainly enough to make the movie pleasingly unpredictable - all the time you have the impression that the Coens know what you are thinking and expecting at each moment, and are determined to dash those expectations. Others have commented that the depiction of Native Americans in the movie is scarcely an affirming one, but to me that's a little beside the point given that the movie still manages to puncture the stereotypes - e.g. in Near Algodones, the main character's heart quickens when he's approached by a very grave looking Indian chief, and you think ""Aha! the Indian will show his humanity by rescuing the outlaw"". In fact he is neither the noble rescuer nor the stereotypical savage butcher: he's a rather puerile joker who frightens the horse and then heads off with a cackle of childish glee. Who saw that coming? No one, I'll bet. So no, you can hardly accuse the Coens of pandering to stereotypes.I could go on for ages about the joys of this movie, but just to mention a few things at random:The intelligent, highly literate use of dialogue is simply magnificent. The writers lovingly provide each character with an idiolect, but over all, what we hear is an extremely funny pastiche of a somewhat unsteadily baroque, expansive style of speech where an evident delight in rhetoric and learned vocabulary is regularly punctured with solecism and bathos. An example of this delight in the language of the semi-educated is Scruggs' pretension to render ""Surly"" with a c cedilla: one of the many bellylaughs I found in the first half hour. Talking of bellylaughs, seeing as others haven't mentioned it: for my money Tyne Daly's facial expressions in the last story, as she mutely manifests a steady crescendo of shock and disapproval at the Trapper's frank confidences, are a tour de force of character acting and had me rolling in helpless mirth on at least three occasions.I have to take issue with the view that the last story ""doesn't go anywhere"" or ""ends on an anticlimax"". The anticlimax is kind of the point, since all the stories are about death, and the last is clearly a variation of the legend of Charon ferrying dead souls across the Styx (one of the characters even sings a song telling us he died of syphilis). Likewise, I agree that Buster is a strong enough character to deserve a whole 90m+ film to himself, but the hand he turned up and didn't want to play was the Dead Man's Hand (Uncle Wiki is of use here), and once you've seen it, you play it, like it or not, as the bank robber in the second story also found out (this story plays out like the Appointment in Samarra). The worldview presented is bleak but, I think, not nihilistic (the gold prospector, if no one else. gets what he wants in life from Mr Pocket, and seems sensible enough not to want too much: what a magnificent bit of acting from Waits, by the way).I dunno... I honestly don't get how anyone could not be mesmerized by this film, with its great acting, its brilliant script, its narrative riches, its impressive literary pedigree. There is absolutely nothing I can fault it on.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

They struggle to compel given that they are each handed a small hourglass to build their necessary ties to the audience.

593,hughhargreaves,Just as expected,10,1 December 2018,"Long time fan of the Coen brothers! This doesn't give you the satisfaction of one film, or two or even three! It has six! Each with a humbly and tragic ending or just downright depressing, but each with its own great thoughts! Not to give too much away, 6 great minisodes of insight into the wild west, which I am a keen fan. Bits of everything!",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
594,VitoZombie,"""I'm the distractor, with a little story""",10,7 January 2019,"I always get the butterflies before a new Coens film gets released, good butterflies though. My mind just whirs with what it could possibly be like and even after 18 films over nearly 35 years, they still impress with their unique ideas and stories. Their new film was a career first with a 6 part anthology movie set in the Wild West of America, which immediately grabbed my attention.I was lucky enough to see a screening of the movie a month before it's Netflix release at the London Film Festival in October '18, with a Q&A afterwards with Joel & Ethan Coen themselves and select group of the cast.Each of the six parts I see as an ode to a variety of western subgenres, with Tim Blake Nelson's segment is a call-back to light westerns from the 50's featuring singing and dancing to old-time cowboy tunes, a sweeping John Huston style western in Zoe Kazan's segment and the more psychological drama westerns in Liam Neeson's segment, to name a few examples.After some thought, I'm now glad they made the decision to release it as a feature film instead of an episodic series. Because even though none of the six segments are connected in any way, depending on how you look it you can piece them together should you so wish, that's how I like to look at it anyway.
I like to imagine while James Franco is barely hanging on top of his horse, you can imagine Zoe Kazan's stage coach posse passing in the background. Or during Liam Neeson's segment, you can almost hear Tom Wait's singing being carried through the night air. Hell, maybe one of the stagecoach passengers in the final segment could've been in the bar during Buster Scrugg's singing and dancing routine.For a Coens film, it has everything you could want. The stories feature elements we've seen throughout all their movies: their style of comedy, the sudden violence, colourful and stylish characters, sweeping landscapes, the songs, the ambiguity and the clashing of the dark and the light.
So really, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a combination of all of their films in one. And for a fan of the brothers, it's an absolute treat.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

The first 2 are without a doubt the best with the exception of the last story dragging on and overstaying its welcome.The coen brothers deliver a unique take on the western genre with a completely different theme for every story and each has its own tragic element.Apart from the last story not living up to the rest the soundtrack and visuals throughout all 6 stories are some of the best aspects of the movie.Some viewers may find it boring after the first 2 stories as its not always action and humour, particularly the third can be depressing to watch.Overall this is another good movie by the coen brothers and its definately worth watching by amy western or coen brothers fan.

For some of them this is clear; All Golds Canyon is a heartfelt, wonderful tale of rising over adversity, with a perfectly pitched twist and a delicate yet amusing performance by Tom Waits. It is certainly the highlight of the 6. Elsewhere. Near Aldgones is darkly witty and effectively subversive, whilst Mortal Remains contains some solid dialogue and enough moments of nail-biting tension to forgive the somewhat caricaturish lead and bathetic ending.The problem with this film, however, as is the problem with many anthologies, is that, predictably there are duds. The Gal who got rattled is somewhat tedious and predictable, whilst Meal Ticket is bizarre, dark and uncomfortable without offering any of the comedic or emotional respite other episodes provide.Technically the film is, for the most part, impressive. Some of the set design seems unintentionally artificial, however the cinematography is impressive, the acting compelling and the music unintrusive.

It had absolutely no connection to the previous two chapters.The last three chapters were more of the same.Overall, the acting was good and each chapter was entertaining (barring Meal Ticket).

618,EnterFilmReviews,Wacky and Unique from the Coens,9,12 January 2019,"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a Western Anthology written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, with 6 interesting and unique tales of the Old West. Now before I even watched this, I was excited as hell. One of the main reasons being, that True Grit another western Coen brothers movie, happens to be my personal favourite.We begin with Tim Blake Nelson starring as the cheerful, singing Buster Scruggs riding horseback through the Wild West. This was without a doubt my favourite story of the movie, I found it absolutely hilarious with an incredibly entertaining and satirical character that is Buster Scruggs was just perfect. The story is full of dark comedy and I knew at this moment the Coen Brothers were at it again, and I was in for a treat.The second story 'New Algodones', stars James Franco as a lone cowboy who arrives at an isolated bank on the prairie with Stephen Root as a lone bank teller. Which was my favourite performance of the movie, I thought Root was fantastic.Damn did they change, we move on to a rather grim and much darker tale 'Meal Ticket' starring Liam Neeson as a not so talkative impresario and Henry Melling as a quadruple amputee orator. The pair moving from town to town with the orator performing poetry, books and speeches from the back of their horse-drawn wagon. This one was so impossibly different from the two previous tales.All Gold Canyon (filmed in the beautiful Colorado) is a visually stunning story which is a drastic change from what we just watched in the last story. Tom Waits absolutely smashes it as and old gold prospector trying to hunting for the find of a lifetime.
This was quite a long story and isn't very action packed but honestly, I really liked it.Followed by 'The Gal Who Got Ratted', with Zoe Kazan as a young women joining the Oregon Trail and Bill Heck as one of the trail operators. This for me started out a bit slow, but as the story progressed as did my enjoyment.We end with 'The Mortal Remains', 5 very different characters on their rather claustrophobic stagecoach journey. Filled with rich dialogue, and a singing number by a pair of bounty hunters played by Brendan Gleeson and Jonjo O'Neill. Characters trading insults, stories, philosophies and questioning morals.I found the changes in mood and tone between each tale to be rather interesting keeping my pleasantly surprised. And I am certainly all for the Coen Brothers trying more funky stuff like this.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

The photography was gorgeous. And, I loved the idea of a western musical. Just loved it -- right up to the end. Why do Hollywood writer/directors do this? It could have been a very popular film. Americans want happy endings, where the hero destroys the bad guys. The Coen's obviously believe that the American hero myth needs to be destroyed.Save yourself some time and watch a French film.

Very watchable black comedy homage to the Western musical. Fantastic lead (Tim Blake Nelson). Coen brother's might have made a very successful feature length film on this premise; and I am not one who goes in for musicals, let alone musical westerns! So good that I think it should have been the final segment.Segment 2:
Bank robber James Franco features in an out of the frying pan, into the fire black comedy. Not at all a hit, for me.Segment 3:
When a short feels like a soaring epic and is so heart wrenchingly sad, it's a great achievement. Wouldn't really call it a Western, despite the theme of a travelling impresario and his act in hill country. Harry Melling is superb.Segment 4:
You'll find yourself rooting for the old prospector breaking his back, seeking his fortune; almost blissfully mad from his isolation in the untouched and idyllic wilds of gold country. The valley is beautifully shot to give a lurid and dream like quality as you wait with bated breath for something earth shattering.Segment 5:
Pretty much told in 3 acts, a bittersweet story of a humble and courageous young woman; her honest, well-meaning suitor; and his rather stoic old-timer partner; as they take the wagon trail across the plains toward Oregon. Well acted piece which builds the tension to a crescendo.Segment 6:
Two business partners share their carriage to a hotel with three passengers. Like a play, this pits the views of three classic old West characters together; a simple-minded and garrulous trapper; a self-righteous, God-fearing woman; and a tactless and pompous intellectual (great acting by Saul Rubinek). The business partners reveal to the passengers their chilling trade as the coach makes it way across the stygian landscape.

The cinematography; the scenery; the costume; all of which aspects that thrust the viewer into a scenario where even the comfort of their sofas isn't adequate to ward off the fear of their own demise.
To appreciate action one must enjoy the silence beforehand, the calm before the storm. Ethan & Joel have a special talent for timing, whether it be comedic or thrilling. To be held on a facial expression, or a gorgeous landscape, and to be undeniably fixated on a story that is yet to be told is art in its highest form.

The movie consists of 6 short western stories. The film has many top actors such as, Tim Blake Nelson who plays Buster, Liam Neeson, James Franco, Brendon Gleeson just to name a few. The opening story is on Buster Scruggs this the only one that the directors really give you any background information. You are led into believing he is a slick talking fast gun in the west and is being tracked down for a bounty. His charter is made to be a trusting genuine happy guy that loves to sing and avoids violence. Then he takes some gruesome action that I for one was not expecting. It feels as is the Coen brothers took some notes from director Quinton Tarantino on directing this film.
Throughout the movie the directors drop the viewer into the middle of a story and one can quickly pick up on the story line and excitement. The different camera angles and lighting make it seem as if the viewer is the character with arrows whizzing by and Indians shooting at the viewer. The theme throughout the film seems to be that, one should not feel overconfident and that they can be replaced in an instant. Most of the stories circle around death or end with death.

Five stories of people cut down in their prime in in ironic ways. The sixth story ties it all together themetically (though not in a plot sense at all). My least favorite segment was the first, as it had too much of a Mel Brooks Blazing Saddles feel to it (perhaps in homage), though it had it's moments. The final segment gets a little wordy and preachy until you realize that there is more going on than a stage coach ride.

666,blueycrter,I would say so,8,16 November 2018,"Echoing the others, I found the stories were a little hit and miss. There were dry spots, and deeply emotional spots.
However for myself, I found that the dry spots, which are very much typical of the coen brothers went to exaggerate the more shocking, or impactful scenes. And if you do find yourself growing bored of the dry, the backdrops are incredible, as is the cinematography.
While everyone seems to be mentioning the gold mining one. I do feel that the first two scenes were my favourites perhaps that is because I have a strange sense of humour.
This film has something for everyone: romance, action, humour, Maccabee, shock. I think that's pretty much what they went for: a cocktail of emotions.
I know I shouldn't compare it to other modern westerns but I can't help it. This is most definitely what a million ways to die, should have attempted. In tone it seems a lot like slow west (with the exception of the first short), it has a sort of numbing effect.
One of its few faults is the last tale. Which has arguably the best leadup, it does feel rather anti climactic. Perhaps that is the point, it is dramatised to such a point that nothing can happen. I will expand because that doesn't seem to make much sense. In all of these stories bad things happen, people die, suddenly and without build up, on a repeated basis. There is never a build up. So when at the last there is, and it builds up and up and up, your expectations can't rightly be met and so it's left for your mind to wander.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
667,doccole-ec,"Well written, and an essential break from the norm",10,11 December 2018,"To begin: DON'T write this film off just because of the trailer. The trailers to me seemed to focus on one particular story - 'The Ballad of Buster Scruggs' - which is only one of the six stories, and the nature of which is hugely different to the rest - it is a bit absurd (perhaps even silly) yet still reasonably realistic. The rest of the stories fall into entirely different categoriesI've seen people reviewing this poorly because it wasn't as funny as they wanted it to be (one person person even said they didn't like it because a bunch of the stories were darker than they wanted). News flash: not all stories have to be funny, and the realities of the old west were far from funny for most who lived them. Reviewing something poorly simply because you didn't enjoy the genre, is a sign of a very poor quality reviewer.Another person has told me she thought these stories didn't really have a point. My reply was that not all stories need a point - sometimes a story can just be a series of key events that outline the reality for the protagonists.Much like Black Mirror, each of these six stories come with an underlying message - in this case mostly of inevitability. While writing this message, most of these stories add a relatable 'human' quality to the characters in them, which differs to lot of westerns that write people into just three categories: vulnerable, heroic, or dangerous. Also unlike other westerns, the characters within DON'T have all the answers. There is NOT a magic formula where ""if these two characters would just share their information, the good guys win and everyone is happy"". The stories are just occurrences that range from depressing and unfortunate, to happy and relieving.With six completely different stories, it is unlikely you won't find one you enjoy. So watch it!As a side note, my favourites were 'The Gal Who Got Rattled', 'All Gold Canyon', and 'Near Algodones' (in that order). The rest are all brilliant as well.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

Cynical, melancholic, tender, funny, surreal, bitter, rough, this six-part film entails six different stories, more or less representative of the Coens' universe as a whole. An eerie trip, every moment of which is so weird, and yet so true and unique, that you can't help but take your hat off to their amazing talent and skill to closely follow and at the same time undermine the very foundations of the genre, masterfully crafting each story down to the smallest detail. The style ranges from gloomy to goth to romantic to outrageously farcical, the narration generates conflicting emotions in almost every single scene. Each one of the stories could well stand as a short film on its own; joined in a movie, they add up to a work of art reminiscent of tales once told around the hearth, haunting melodies of old folk tunes.

This blew me out of the water. You need to realize what your getting yourself into. This is a heady movie
that is ahead of its time. The stories are beautifully written. And the backdrop of the old west makes it over the top. I can't remember the last time I hung on every word in a movie. The last story dialogue was out of this world. Pure gold.
I love Tom waits. And his role was PERFECT.
They nailed it on the head
Probably my favorite story.
We all should thank Netflix. Without them this film
would not be possible.
We all should realize we are in a golden age of entertainment. All you people who complain. Or say
""It was so boring"" are taking actual good movies for granted. There has never been a better time to be alive for movies. This should be in theaters allll over.

During their introduction they mentioned how they wrote each chapter as a series of shorts over 25 years, and it certainly felt like this both in good ways and bad. Each story was completely different from the one either side of it and none were short of originality. Stories unfolded in the way only a Coen brother's film could - a style that I have always admired.What was slightly disappointing was its lack of continuity. Each of the stories are completely contained and the final short was one of the most disappointing for me ending in quite an anticlimax. I understand these shorts are independent of one another but had they intersected in some way I think there could have been a much more satisfying conclusion. But the subversion of that expectation I also admire, my brain was just full of the interesting situations that could have unfolded had these characters come into contact with each other - as per a Tarantino film. It could also have ended with a different short as the 5th story for me (and the gold panning segment) was arguably the best.Aside from the story itself the film has great visuals, some amazing one liners and incredible acting performances - especially considering the lengths actors went to in order to get into character for just a 20 minutes segment of a film.

Oh how the jewel shines in the dark forest!. Use whatever analogy you wish, it was a joy to watch a production that was pitched to an audience with intelligence. The top cast gave an extra sparkle and the characters they played were interesting. At times I began to compare the dialogue with the way Tarantino glories in the spoken word with extensive and intense monologues.

In every segment, one of the main characters dies (or nearly so) at the end of the story. You keep waiting for a laugh, like the jokes told in the first two stories, and become upset when it never comes. The movie quickly turns depressing and dark and predictable, and became a chore to get through. The last (and worst) story was devoid of originality, as you can quickly figure out how the segment will end within several minutes.

I believe those who rated this movie poorly expected a movie they could turn on and escape through, but were, very much so, wrong.This movie is engaging and fascinating in a way few other movies can compare. As one of the last monologues tells us, we see ourselves in the stories, yet not ourselves, and we are frightened and excited and happy and sad for the characters, because we, in part, are like them. The only problem is the storytelling is so well done and so suspenseful we often feel that WE are the ones in danger, or the fools in a self-induced predicament, or the hot-head who is now over his head, or whatever other situation the Coen brothers decide to put us in through their storytelling.

A nod to Tarantino perhaps (or maybe only me who thought that?).Then just when it starts getting even more daft, Finchy from The Office shows up!It's beautifully filmed and I love the way that the appearance of some characters in the Coen brothers movies seems more exaggerated, almost cartoon like.Buster Scruggs' 'Water' echoing from the canyon walls at the very start...it's stuck in my head now! I love the little touches like that in films.Right, I'm off now to watch old episodes of The Office...",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

717,katemcameron,Aesthetically beautiful with (I thought) a clear narrative,8,18 October 2018,"As always from the Coen Brothers, a cleverly written film where the script alone is pure entertainment, and every scene is visually stunningI also thought there WAS a clear narrative linking each story that became apparent almost immediately, due to what a surprise it was in the first instance, which (SPOILERS) was that the main character dies in every story. Now, I admit that that was not quite the case in ""All Gold Canyon"" and ""The Mortal Remains"", but in both instances I thought that pretence was put to good use- When the prospector steels the eggs, you imagine the owl will kill him, when he is then shot by 'mister pocket' you are sure that he must really be dead. In ""The Mortal Remains"", I felt that it left you hanging deliberately, because any one of the three coach riders could be next.Once this theme is established, it elevated the suspense as you begin to ask yourself ""who will it be?"", ""Can I get attached to this character?"" ""How will it happen?""Ok, well he got out of the last noose, he must be about to get out of this one too.Will the angelic looking boy somehow overcome his disability and kill his father? Because I really don't want him to die...This prospector is surely going to the grave, but how?The happy life these two have the possibility of creating is too lovely for one to die, which makes the love story all the more bitter sweet and beautiful.Is she going to kill the frenchman? Is the mad trapper going to get them all, like he does ferrets? Is the driver even human? Will a highwayman get them? Ah! Those two are murderers, so how is this going to happen?It added an extra layer of suspense and more possibilty for twists and turns in the plot, as well as weaving in little lines and details that give the audience slivers of information while making you want to ask even more questions.Am I the only one who saw this death theme? Or am I completely making it up in my head?!A very enjoyable film either way.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

720,tiki_chik,Completely Unexpected,10,16 November 2018,"I went into this collection with no way of knowing what I was getting into. I laughed so hard at certain points I thought I was going to pee my pants. Not too long after, I found myself sob out loud, once, in total heartbreak. I can't say I'm surprised that one or two critiques have lolled over their lazy brains to call this 'slow'...unless someone is having gratuitous sex and fouling up their ears with unnecessary explicates, few people can find entertainment in the quiet intensity between people when nothing is spoken. There is beauty in these vignettes. Realization and laughter and a myriad of emotional wealth if people would slow down for a half a minute and allow themselves to FEEL.

721,MHyw,A Dark Allegory Set in the Iconic West,9,17 November 2018,"Just as the Coen Brothers wildly reimagined ""The Odyssey"" in ""O Brother Where For Art Thou?"", ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" emerges like a wildly dark Americanized version of Chaucer's ""The Canterbury Tales"". The characters in the anthology are unsettled, seeking treasure or a vague promise at the end of a trail. Manifest Destiny optimism gives way to corruption and violence, sometimes comical, sometimes brutish and sad. Art itself is a victim in a viciously bleak vignette in what seems to be a comment on current taste. The stunning cinematography, the deft characterization and comic touches- especially in the final story- and a poignant love story make this an intriguing, layered and worthwhile film.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
722,MbeckMovies,a simple review for those who have already seen it MAJOR SPOILERS,7,17 November 2018,"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. I gave it 7 stars, although I feel a second viewing will likely lead to me wishing I had given it 8. It seems that a lot of the reviews here, even the ones that give it high marks, might still be missing the thread of it all. The stories ARE all related, and they are all about death. Every story uniquely captures the moments of a persons life just before their death. What makes all this interesting is the gold miner story and the final story. I think these two episodes really and subliminally distract you from that fact. I don't know, I guess I'm not bringing anything new to the table, I just keep seeing the same comments about how people wished the stories were connected, and that the last two stories were reversed in order. I think once you make the connection, you will see that the stories are connected and the last scene has to be last. It's the only one that takes the viewer to the other side. either that, or I'm seeing things that aren't there...",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
723,bunkbr,Decent,9,18 November 2018,First one was great. 2nd ok. 3rd better than 2nd. Didn't watch 4th or beyond. Movie of Scruggs with the gold miner as a heavy character would be real good.,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
724,ricardodavila-80088,Troubling trend,5,19 November 2018,"I have been a faithful fan of the Coen brothers since Blood Simple. But I have grown more and more troubled by their continued refusal to include or even cast black actors in their movies. To my best recollection, their only movie with black actors was The Ladykillers that starred Tom Hanks.This is a serious concern when one considers that for many years in early Hollywood film and television productions, black people didn't even exist. The Coens seem fascinated with this period of Hollywood history.They seem to go out of their way to make movies that would not or could not have black cast members. They make westerns (Buster Scruggs, True Grit), nostalgic Hollywood (Hudsucker Proxy, Hail Caesar), 1940's (Miller's Crossing, Barton Fink, O Brother) where they could plausibly explain the casting choices.But they make movies in modern day Los Angeles (Lebowski) and DC (Burn After Reading) where they make no effort to resolve the issue. And for some reason they can't imagine any black people living in Texas (No Country, Blood Simple)!Their willingness to ignore and erase a large part of America is not coincidental, flippant, or inconsequential.I love their movies but this has been troubling me for quite some time.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs

728,eugenepdem,Cohen Quailty with Major Missed Opportunity,2,21 November 2018,"I love Cohen bros movies and regard much of there work as some of the best experiences in cinema. While I do believe every film is an expression through art, and I can definitely recognize the artistry in this series, experience is a top priority when I rate a movie.First I'll give my perspective then get into the meat of the reveiw (keep in mind I love so many movies and the artistry in them, but I had to create am IMDB account to give the only online movie review I've ever given, and express the immense passion in my experience from this series.):I have a general rule that I dont watch trailers or detailed reviews before I see a movie for the first time, and I'll only accept hearing general feelings if anything. I do this because I truly believe every cinematic experience should be able to best express itself on it's own from the time the reel starts through the time it stops, without trailers, reviews or synopsis.SPOILERS MAY BEGIN HERE.....I did not know this was a series of short films, nor do I believe that the title suggests that, nor does the title suggest that the other stories have nothing to do with Buster Scruggs.I went into this movie expecting a whole movie about that character, and by the time Buster has his second run in with an enemy, I'm in love with the concept and can't believe how amazing and original this character was going to be. I was expecting the to see one of the best western stories ever made as a fresh, unique and amazingly crafted masterpiece.Instead, about 5 minutes later Buster is singing away into the sky never to be seen again.I thought, just maybe, it was going to get way more interesting as I began learning about new characters and a different storyline, on the edge of my seat waiting for Buster to cross their paths somehow, but no.By the beginning of the 3rd story I realize that the film is split into multiple storylines, and was so excited to see how they would all tie together, after all they all take place in the same era.By the 4th story I realised my excitement began to feel like a false hope, but I would hang on for the chance at something amazing. I was hoping that by the middle of the movie, or at least by 3/4 some of these characters may have begun to cross paths, but nothing like that ever happened.Overjoyed, to anxiously optimistic, to confusion, to a feeling of false hope, to hunger for meaning and connection, to annoyance, boredom and ultimately feeling like I was bamboozled, like I wasted my time. I felt like I was given a taste of something amazing then told that I had the last there ever was and none of it was left nor would it ever exist again.Yes, I've considered how I may have felt knowing they were short stories, but I would still expect something more connected, more grandiose, and would still feel like ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"" would have a lot more Buster Scruggs in it.As for a fair review of the movie for what it is. Each story was different, fairly entertaining is their own right, every aspect was expertly crafted and presented, and if you want to say you've seen some Cohen bros short films, this has you covered. However, none of them match the potential for the story of Buster Scruggs and the whole experience left me wanting so much more that we will never get, and I'm so disappointed in this missed opportunity.I gave this a 2 out of 10 because 10 divided by 6 (each short film) is less than two, and while the other films were very nicely made, they barely make up for the overall dissapointing experience.I recommend going into this fully knowing that they are 6 completely separate short films, with little meaning, mild entertainment, and that you may find any one of them leaving you with wanting more, and more likely than not it will be the first one about Scruggs himself. Also know that even going in with that mindset may not help. Have low expectations and know what you are getting into if you really was to have something good to say, but in my opinion anyone should be able to go into any cinematic experience unbiased, learn about the movie through the movie, and be able to have a good time. I really feel the Cohen bros missed the mark with this.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
729,samuelbancroft,Won't Leave You Hanging (Unlike the Sheriff),9,24 November 2018,"I opened Netflix, was flicking through (pun intended) the latest choices and up popped this. Now I was playing Red Dead Redemption 2 at the time, so though ""what the heck, a cowboy film to go with a cowboy game."" Thank goodness I did.
Within 30 seconds, the game was forgotten and this film had my full attention.
The opening story is utterly glorious in its portrayal of the dichotomy facing those in Wild West America. I cried a little - I really did.

Well, this movie will make you forget all the wasted hours because it is like watching 10 perfect movies at once! It takes your soul out on the screen so you can see yourself, while you are experiencing visual pleasure. It has everything - humour, theatre, tragedy, intuition, message and meaning, depth, beauty, action, wit, well... really, it has pretty much everything except a bad moment. The only thing it doesn't have is the build up to the ""musical"" genre, given for it in the description.

737,roastanatomy,A Commentary on the Western Genre,9,5 December 2018,"The Coen Brothers have crafted a fascinating commentary in the form of an anthology. Each of the six stories represents a different sub-genre: the Ridiculous comedy, the Ironic comedy, the Lone Hero, the Tragic Victim, the Western Romance and the Western Morality Play.
Unlike the way that these tropes normally play out, though, the Coens present each story in a far more realistic way while keeping to the tropes associated with each. Some characters are emphatically ridiculous, while others are remarkably empathetic.
The movie contains violence which ranges from off-screen suggestion to graphic depiction. Sexual situations are discussed but never shown. Strong language is used throughout the movie, but not quite gratuitously.
The viewer may find themselves repeatedly wishing that things had worked out differently or unexpectedly cheering on characters. Those who are unfamiliar with the Western movie genre will not recognize some of the subtle homages and criticisms depicted; they may even find them to be offensive, although the very tropes from which the offense derives are being ridiculed in their depiction.
If you love Westerns then you will recognize many of the characters, settings and situations; overall, an enjoyably realistic depiction of common Western stories, as if the Coen Brothers have made a movie which shows what many people say after watching a Western.
This movie is not for children: the movie contains murder, suicide, discussions of rape and the death of animals.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
738,jgponds,Impressed,9,13 December 2018,"I really liked this. I love short stories because they have to tell a complete story in a short timeframe. These stories do exactly that. I would LOVE to see another movie like this one, or maybe a series.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
739,corderemilio,Glad to see another gem from the Coen Brothers,9,25 December 2018,"Very charming anthology film by the Coen's, that has a bit of everything: Action, comedy, drama, romance,...

742,dicemaxxx,Mixed bag,7,29 December 2018,"In this days and age every review is ether 1 or 10. If it's not a masterpiece, then it's a complete garbage!
This is not a strong movie but that doesn't mean you should call it a ""Bad"" movie ether. Generally speaking, this movie looks and feels great. Everything from landscapes to tiny visual details, look and feels real.Sound tracks are just perfect for that ""post war"" vibe.
So what is the problem? First of all, this is an episodic/ completion of short stories jammed into a movie so in order to write a review about this, we need to look at each segment separately.First chapter: The best part of this movie hands down! Coen brothers obviously didn't save the best for the last. It's shocking, thoughtful, and beautiful. I'm just blown away by how can you show a character on screen for like 10 minutes and make the audience feel like they know that person for so long. amazing story telling. this is how it should have been trough the whole thing. but sadly it's not.Second chapter: Cool scenery. Certainly not what you think you get after that strong start. James Franko is completely wasted in this role and i feel like the directors could have made a solid movie based on this character. but sadly we don't get to see that. instead we get the following.Third chapter: There is a lot of controversy about this one. unless the first two chapter that almost everyone admits to be fine, this is the part that separates the audience. I personally think that it was so sad and pointless. It's not like i don't appreciate moving stories or a meaningful ending, but the thing is i don't get the idea behind this. What is the meaning of this story?Forth chapter: Good promise but fail to capture what it wanted to present. To be honest i liked this chapter a lot more than following ones. I just love how beautifully breath taking the vista was. Stunning shots that will stuck for sure. but then again, all wasted for nothing. But at least it got some meaning to it. I didn't expect more after the third one anyway.Fifth chapter: This was one of the most boring, pointless and blank part of the whole thing. It's interesting how the same people behind the first chapter made this. What where they thinking about? No story at all. It just wants to be everything. Love story, Mystery, comedy, action... and after all, it fails to be anything! whit bunch of uninteresting characters who no one cares about. And then the weak acting doesn't help that at all. To be fair the setting was on point. Weakest part IMOSixth chapter: Long story short, some class acting, forgettable and you guessed it...Pointless!I admire the brothers leaving their comfort zone to make a risky project.I do... but
It was just way better to do a complete oldscool motion picture that merged the the first two chapters together.
Right now as it is , I mean as a miniseries, It wasted a lot of potential and a solid 7/10 is more than what it deserves.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
743,aidanod-34357,"Beginning was great, became lacking of substance",8,1 January 2019,"The film started out great, with lots of life and energy, but it sadly becomes progressively more boring as the movie goes on.

The first story i loved, if they made a movie on just him i would've loved it 9/10 for sure. Second part. Again good, not as good as the first one but with james franco as the lead on it i found it entertaining. 7/10. Then. The meal ticket. What in the hell was that. The most useless and boring minutes of my life. I had to stop myself from turning it off. 1/10. In my opinion this film would've probably been a 6/10 if it werent for the sour taste this one left in my mouth. We move on to the next. This one recovering a bit more and regained some intrest. The 2 other parts were pretty much the same as the 4th story at around a 5 or 6/10. Overall not sure what the hype was about.

I was only hoping there was some rhyme or reason to finishing. Spoiler alert, there isn't.If you start watching and get distracted, stay distracted because it's not worth your attention. So little effort was put in to make the content worth your time.The Coen brothers, as always, deliver excellent shots and scenes, but the content and format of this film was inexcusably poor. There is a reason why six 20 minute featurettes compiled into a film isn't a popular genre, it's difficult to do right and unfortunately The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is an example of precisely this failure.I would love to be convinced how I am wrong, or how badly I missed the point.

In my best assumption, I feel that the Coen brothers were trying to pay homage to very different authors and cultures in this film, but failed to make this into a cohesive set of short stories that made sense. It was like they were trying to combine Stephen King, Stanley Kubrick, Tim Burton, Quinton Tarantino, Seth McFarlane; all be it very little, with traditional Greek tragedy, and expecting it to be a hit without making sure it did. I don't know if they were hoping the audience would get the underlying mythical theme, or they just lost focus on it simply because most people wouldn't. For me, I will let Kharon decide.",The Ballad of Buster Scruggs
