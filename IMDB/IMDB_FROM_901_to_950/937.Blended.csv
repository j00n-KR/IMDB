0,SnoopyStyle,still a bit of chemistry but all wasted,5,11 December 2014,"Jim Friedman (Adam Sandler) and Lauren Reynolds (Drew Barrymore) are on a horrible blind date. It's her first date since divorcing the cheating Mark (Joel McHale) and he brought her to Hooters. He's a widower and it's his first date in 20 years. She's a closet organizer with her friend Jen (Wendi McLendon-Covey). She has two boys Tyler and Brendan. Jim manages a Dick's sporting goods store. He has a boyish girl Hilary (Bella Thorne) whom he calls Larry, Espn (Emma Fuhrmann) who talks to her dead mother and the smallest Lou (Alyvia Alyn Lind). When Jen breaks up with Dick and cancel their African safari, both Jim and Lauren take advantage unbeknownst to each other.They're trying very hard to be funny without really getting there. This could be a good rom-com if Sandler and Barrymore can recapture the magic. Sandler is too much of a downer at the beginning. He needs to pick up some energy. They just need more time together. I like the drug store section but the section at Lauren's home feels EXTREMELY forced. It's a shame because there is still some chemistry between them. They could make a charming rom-com about two single parents but this is not that. These pairing had better days.",Blended
1,mark.waltz,Only Adam Sandler can get away with comedy like this.,6,27 April 2016,"Surprisingly sweet if a bit overlong, ""Blended"" is a film I recall getting wretched reviews when it first came out, threatening to end one of my favorite modern day screen teams, Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. He's a widow with three daughters; She's a divorcée with two sons. Opposites, it seems, in every way, and in the very first scene, she's complaining to business partner Wendi McLendon-Covey that on their first date, Sandler took her to Hooters. But behind every assumption, there's truth, and it takes almost two hours for her to learn what a sweet guy he really is underneath, and it takes him that long to realize that she's a perfect match, not only as a mom to his motherless children (one of whom keeps a seat available for her mother's ""spirit"") but for his zany antics and zest for living life to the fullest.Drew and Wendi run a business called ""Closet Queens"" (organizing closets for busy wealthy matrons) and when Wendi's widowed boyfriend cancels their trip to Africa after they break up, Drew takes Wendi's ticket, and Adam ends up with the ex's ticket who just happens to be his boss. It's gruff at first sight for not only Drew and Adam when they run into each other, but for their children as well. Drew's two sons are quite neurotic due to their selfish father's absence in their life; The youngest son has tantrums because he can't hit a baseball, and the oldest son has a fetish for his nerdy looking baby sitter. Sandler's three daughters are rather strange cookies as well. The oldest is a seemingly tomboy whom people either assume is a boy or a lesbian, the middle is obsessed with dead mom, and the youngest has a fascination with making her voice sound like Mercedes McCambridge in ""The Exorcist"". So it's going to be an interesting trip to say the least, accompanied by a very vivacious African resort host who sings of their latest trials and tribulations as he witnesses Sandler and Barrymore's issues unfold.The beautiful African setting provides glimpses of the very Anglo guests mixing with nature and even gives a shot of two hippo's mating. Friendly elephants, a group of monkeys who know how to play musical instruments and two lions who appear to be mothering an orphaned hippo are among the few of the wild creatures who make appearances, as well as some very affectionate giraffes who show their love for human visitors to their habitat. This has only minimal amounts of the innocently crass comedy that Sandler has become well known for, but for the most part, those scenes are outrageously funny. Mary Pat Gleason scores in a cameo as a pharmacy cashier who makes funny observations about the tampons that Sandler is buying for his daughter and the girlie magazine that Barrymore has to replace for her neurotic son.As stated in my opening, my only real issue is that this goes on a bit too long, and the ending back in the states is a very traditional Hollywood style crowd-pleasing cliché. McLendon-Covey is rather balsy as Barrymore's friend, and at first. she's a little hard to take, but like most human beings, she shows multiple dimensions as you get to know her even though she's still more than just a little rough around the edges. ""SNL"" veteran Kevin Nealon is very funny as a middle aged dad with a much younger second wife who has no qualms about displaying his sexual energy around his rather insecure son (Zak Henri). Abdoulaye NGom also scores as the singing host whose comments are a welcome intrusion into the zany situations which occur.",Blended
2,nogodnomasters,WHAT HAPPENS IN AFRICA,8,14 December 2018,"Jim (Adam Sandler) is a widower who is a manager for Dick's Sporting Goods. He is raising three daughters as tomboys. Lauren (Drew Barrymore) organizes closets and is divorced struggling with two sons. They meet on a blind date at Hooters that for some reason did not go well. What is clear is that the daughters need a mom and the boys need a father.Through a series of improbable circumstances the two families are thrust together on an African adventure with predictable results.The film had a feeling of ""Just Go With It."" Sandler and Barrymore create great on screen chemistry again. It is immaterial that you know what is going to happen, because you want it to happen. The kids were great on screen too.Heart warming and fun film.Parental Guidance: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Adult themes.",Blended
3,kosmasp,Vacation time,5,19 January 2015,"Why not blend them once again? Drew and Adam have worked together and you cannot deny the chemistry those two have. This is one of the better Adam Sandler comedies and yet still it often dives into territories that drag the movie down (racial, tonal and gender wise). But you can say that they don't make exception when they discriminate or bad jokes on behalf of someone. They do it to anyone (old, young, animals and so on).The beginning is supposed to be a trick, showing us both characters together. Obviously we (they) are not there yet. The jokes that come are hit and miss (one including beer, the other 4 women and another a cell phone call). If you lower the bar, you can laugh at all of them, if not there will be some you may laugh at. This meeting is being referenced again later on for better or worse. I know people do not look for something essential with this movies (most of the time), so it does what the cover says. Nothing more and nothing less (which is an accomplishment if you think of some other recent outputs from Mr. Sandler).",Blended
4,paul_haakonsen,"Generic storyline, but actually a nice movie...",6,12 August 2014,"Despite being every bit possible of a 'how-to-make-a-romantic-comedy', then ""Blended"" was actually a nice surprise of a movie.The story is about Jim (played by Adam Sandler) who is on a blind date with Lauren (played by Drew Barrymore). The date is, of course, abysmal and they part ways never wanting to see one another again. But as fate would have it, they end up together at an African resort along with their children, and the magic of Africa plants a seed that quickly starts to grow into something special.Yeah, fairly generic storyline. But there was just something great about this movie that made it stand out from others of the same genre. Perhaps it was the chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore that had been seriously increased since their last movie together.The movie has everything that a movie of this genre needs; comedy, romance, offbeat love, and of course a great amount of sugar coating. But wait, it gets better, add the fabulous dance moves of Mr. Terry Crewe, and you are all set.""Blended"" is a nice movie that turned out to be surprisingly nice, and I must admit that it is well worth a way, despite being generic and predictable to the core.",Blended
5,studioAT,Blended,3,15 July 2021,"Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore team up again, and sadly it doesn't to be 3rd time lucky, as this film never really works out what type of comedy it wants to be, so ends up trying to be everything and falling short.",Blended
6,utgard14,"""Like Weird Al starring in Weird Science.""",7,18 October 2014,"Wow, this movie doesn't seem to get a lot of love. I happened to like it a lot. Yeah it's a little schmaltzy and cheesy and pretty contrived, but it's also upbeat and fun. The basic plot of the widowed dad and divorced mom getting together and forming their own little Brady Bunch is hardly new. The movie makes the weird choice to move the setting to a resort in Africa, presumably to make the plot appear fresh. But, while the story is not particularly special, the wonderful cast is. Drew and Adam still have their perfect chemistry and that's always worth the price of admission. The kid actors are all good, especially Adam's girls. Comic greats Kevin Nealon, Joel McHale, and the very underrated Wendi McLendon-Covey are excellent. Surprisingly funny parts for Terry Crews and, of all people, Shaquille O'Neal. But probably the scene stealer of the movie is Jessica Lowe as Nealon's busty blonde bride. A clichéd part, for sure, but Lowe is adorably enjoyable. Despite what you may have heard, this is a funny movie. I'll sacrifice originality if it means I can be entertained for a couple of hours. See it if you are a fan of Sandler and Barrymore's previous movies. This one's not quite as good as those but still a keeper. Oh, and look out for all the product placement.",Blended
7,Calicodreamin,Cute Rom Com,7,3 March 2021,"Another win for the duo of Sandler and Barrymore, the perfect mix of cute and funny moments. Blended is a fun storyline that is perfectly predictable. Love the Easter egg cast members from 50 first dates and the wedding singer.",Blended
8,oscaralbert,This flick may be a little gross . . .,8,3 June 2014,". . . but the preview contained the two worst avert-your-eyes moments, so that frequent movie-goers would know when to put on the ""blinkers"" so as not to spoil the other 99.9% of BLENDED. Does BLENDED promote stealing from your employer? Absolutely, but that did not deter some people from snickering at my showing. Is BLENDED racist, sexist, and homophobic? Sure, but it's all in good fun, as audience chuckles prove. Since BLENDED is NOT rated ""R,"" would a public school teacher STILL get fired for screening it at a school function? No doubt, because some students would die laughing. Does BLENDED meld Adam Sandler's LITTLE NICKY with Drew Barrymore's WHIP IT? Not exactly, as BLENDED has more humor than those two features combined. Which film has MORE baseball action--MILLION DOLLAR ARM or BLENDED? Sandler's ""family-moon"" flick, as South Africa has millions more diamonds than India. If you want to see a film that pleases crowds despite themselves, cram yourself into the blender with Adam and Drew.",Blended
9,view_and_review,A Step in the Right Direction,6,2 September 2019,"I had given up on Adam Sandler movies. To me his movies had become empty husks with a Happy Madison tag. I watched this movie because it was on Comedy Central and I didn't bother to change it.I was pleasantly surprised. It was a lot funnier than I expected.Jim (Sandler) and Lauren (Barrymore) are two single parents. They had a blind date and it failed miserably, but through fate they ended going on an African vacation together. It's clear that Lauren could use some help and advice raising her two boys and Jim could definitely use help raising his three girls.As they stumbled in aiding on another a romance budded (naturally). It wasn't a passionate thing just a small spark like, ""You're not that bad.""Sandler stayed away from his yelling for the most part. He broke it out once or twice but it seems he realized that wasn't funny anymore. It was a cute and funny movie. A step in the right direction for Sandler.",Blended
10,neil-476,"Funny, and with heart",8,30 May 2014,"Two single parents have a disastrous blind date. Jim (Adam Sandler) manages a sports good store and has 3 daughters, Lauren (Drew Barrymore), with business partner and pal Jen, runs a business organising closets for people (best not to ask, really) and has 2 sons. It turns out Jen is going out with Jim's boss: when they bust up and can no longer take their booked holiday in Africa, Jim and Lauren (and their kids) end up taking the holiday instead, and their initial distaste for each other extends to their kids. However, this being a romcom, rom and com both ensue.I approach a new Adam Sandler film with great trepidation: he has been responsible for some horrific misfires in recent years. This is the third film where he works with Barrymore, and they have not so much chemistry as a relaxed amiability on screen. The movie follows all the romcom rules, so the question is whether it is any good. The answer is ""Yes."" It is not screamingly funny, but it is gently amusing throughout (mildly rude at times which will not suit the strait-laced, but tolerable family fare if parents are broad minded): the chuckle ratio is high, with the occasional belly laugh. Importantly, the characters are likable (so often not the case with Sandler). They come across as real people, particularly the kids. It is pleasing that each of the kids is given the opportunity to be a character cut from whole cloth: each has issues, the issues are credible, and the young actors do well with them, being both funny and real.I thoroughly enjoyed this, and I recommend it.",Blended
11,FlashCallahan,Shave your neck......,8,14 June 2014,"After a blind date goes badly, and is cut short due to an unforeseen avalanche, Jim and Lauren agree they never want to see each other again. That all changes when the two find themselves and their respective families all stuck together in one suite at a Safari vacation spot, they both booked due to mutual friends cancelling....Lots of people strongly dislike Adam Sandler, for one reason or another. Maybe they are jealous of his success, or don't like the style of his movies, but at the end of the day, if it's not broke, don't try to fix it.Here, he reunites with Barrymore, and the chemistry is still there after almost twenty years, and it's wonderful to see them together on screen again.Sandler doesn't try to be cutting edge with his humour, his material is immature and he is proud of it. He doesn't try to do anything different, so people who have followed Sandler since movies like Billy Madison will know what to expect, and here there is nothing different, nothing new, and i'm absolutely fine with it, because I knew what to expect.The thing is with Sandlers movies, is that there is always something just so out there, just so ridiculous, that you cannot help but laugh at it.With Jack and Jill you had the silly Dunkaccino ad with Pacino dancing.With That's My Boy, you had the reverend say something abhorrently offensive.And with this, it's the inclusion of an R.E.M. song as a reaction. But when it gets repeated, something else happens, and it brings the house down.His films are easy going, and a great tonic to other films veering for success.If you don't like his films fair enough, but I like his films, because they do exactly what they say on the tin.",Blended
12,mm-39,Blended is blanded.,5,26 July 2014,"A bland movie! My wife and I drove out of town to one of the last drive- ins in our area. The Drive-In gets the B movies. Sandler makes many B movies. Sandler's funny days of Happy Gilmore are far behind him. The last good movie Sandler made was Anger Management. Blended is an example of Sandler's stalled career. The material is dated, and stale. Whatonce was shocking or over the top for Sandler is now redundant material! Embarrassed, overly stupid, and weird situations is all of Sandler's comic delivery. Blended is a cutesy love story with a few laughs. Watchable movie, but noting special. Blended would be the second feature in the Drive Inn after the main feature is shown. If the out of town drive-in had a double feature. Five stars out of ten.",Blended
13,namashi_1,A Fun Watch...,6,27 July 2014,"'Blended' is A Fun Watch, that needs to be viewed with expectations of being entertained. A few good laughs & sincere performances take 'Blended' to the safe zone, despite some bumps.'Blended' Synopsis: After a bad blind date, a man and woman find themselves stuck together at a resort for families, where their attraction grows as their respective kids benefit from the burgeoning relationship.'Blended' has its share of pros and cons. Fortunately, the pacing is nicely handled. The jokes, especially in the first-hour, are funny & raise a few genuine chuckles. The second-hour, too maintains the speed to an extent, but 'Blended' overstays its welcome by 15-minutes, at least. The film needed to be trimmed & even the climax is very ordinary. Clare Sera & Ivan Menchell's Screenplay is pretty decent, but drags itself in the second-hour. Frank Coraci's Direction is fine. Cinematography is average. Editing lacks crispness. Performance-Wise: Adam Sandler & Drew Barrymore are charming. Sandler, especially, is perfect & gets his comic-timing spot-on. The Kids are convincing. Terry Crews entertains. But its Kevin Nealon, who stands out. He is outrageous, but extremely funny too. On the whole, 'Blended' works as a Rom-Com!",Blended
14,Hellmant,The humor is actually a little more intelligent in this movie.,5,12 November 2014,"'BLENDED': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The third romantic comedy flick to star Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore (following 'THE WEDDING SINGER' and '50 FIRST DATES'). It was directed by Frank Coraci (who also directed 'THE WEDDING SINGER', as well as the Sandler vehicles 'THE WATERBOY' and 'CLICK') and written by first time feature film writers Ivan Menchell and Clare Sera. The film tells the story of two single parents that have an awful blind date together and then end up sharing the same African Safari vacation suite, with their children. It costars Bella Thorne, Emma Fuhrmann, Kevin Nealon, Terry Crews, Shaquille O'Neal, Wendi McLendon-Covey and Joel McHale. The movie is by no means good but it is better than the recent crop of Adam Sandler comedy flicks.Jim (Sandler) is a recently widowed father, with three young daughters. Lauren (Barrymore) is a recently single mother, with two sons. The two have a blind date together and it goes horribly wrong. They end up hating each other but, through a crazy coincidence, they also end up sharing the same African Safari vacation suite; with their families. Of course they like each other more than they first realized and are able to help each other's kids out, with their problems.The movie is pretty predictable and full of racist and sexist clichéd jokes, and situations. It's not full of the outrageously crude, and lame, dick and fart jokes; that most Adam Sandler movies are though. The humor is actually a little more intelligent in this movie, than most recent Sandler films; despite the sexism and racism. It also surprisingly has some heart and a little bit of emotion. It's not nearly as good as 'THE WEDDING SINGER' or '50 FIRST DATES' but it is better than I was expecting.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/RGEBSjKSuEk",Blended
15,thesar-2,Why Couldn't They Get Ebola?,2,31 January 2015,"Continuing my self-torment of watching recommended, albeit bad movies, I endured yet another terrible Sandler feature in a long, long list of god-awful attempts at humor. But, strangely, as his movies have progressively gotten worse, this one was probably the least painful experience I've had with his films since The Wedding Singer.The reason Blended wasn't as tough to watch, were the 3 or so actually touching moments and one single laugh from me thanks to one of my favorite on screen funny ladies, Reno911!'s Wendi McLendon-Covey. That all might sound like a praise for this bomb, until you realize this is just about two hours, or a half-hour too long, and I was only referring to the scenes I enjoyed that took up approximately 2% overall. You'll have almost unbearable torture for the remaining 98% to put up with.In an extremely long setup to an extremely old plot, two blind date victims literally get forced together by very bad writing and holiday in Africa. That's the meat and selling point of the story and where it sinks to record lows for a Sandler flick due to all the jokes from what feels like six decades ago. What's worse than that, these ""writers"" actually thought they were funny enough to repeat the same types of jokes over and over and no, they never once were funny.It's sad, really, because that 2% I really liked looked like it could've been developed, or, ah-hem, Blended, into a much better, more original and actually funny movie. This movie had the ending from the beginning for anyone who's ever seen a single other movie before and they expect us to waste two hours while trenching through real sh|t before what we know is going to happen to finally happen. No, it's not so bad, it's good. For the most part, and I am not exaggerating here, it's jaw-dropping terrible. I literally dropped my jaw in disgust at what these folks found both hilarious and acceptable to show the public. But, in a world where people like to take pictures of what's in the toilet after they used it and make that viral, I guess some like to do the same in movie theatres. * * *Final thoughts: I am sad, though. I have loved Wendi McLendon-Covey since Reno911! and she's never given a shot. Heck, when she is in a movie, she's reduced to a third or fourth tier character. Luckily, she was part of the 2% I liked that caused my half star from the one star rating it probably deserved. That said, if someone on YouTube would kindly compile all her scenes into one vid, I would be most grateful.",Blended
16,FeastMode,my notes,3,25 June 2019,"Had some funny parts (mostly Terry Crews) and a decent story. but tons of parts that were not funny at all, lots of super corny and cheesy parts, and boring overall. lots of girl humor. (1 viewing)",Blended
17,Robert_duder,A near perfect genre specific experience,9,14 June 2014,"Now before all the hatred begins hear me out. Will this win awards? Nope. Is it a genius, ""classic"" movie? Nope. Is it artistic gold? Definitely not. But its not trying not to be any of that. This is Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore together for their third time and every single expectation of what you'd want from that pairing and from a romantic comedy is fulfilled in Blended. This is Adam Sandler's best film in literally years because he has done some horrendous drivel in the last little while. Blended was fun, romantic, hilarious at times, sweet and touching and full of emotion. Yes it is absolutely predictable and completely by the book and why the hell not!! They knew exactly what the fans would want and expected and delivered it. I'm not ashamed to say that I was absolutely floored by this and it was just sheer entertainment that my wife and I thought was fantastic. It had some genuinely memorable scenes and terrific chemistry. You rarely get classic ""Hollywood"" pairings anymore and Barrymore and Sandler have an undeniable ""cute"" chemistry that just works so well for this type of film. No stupid voices, no plethora of disgusting toilet humour and fart jokes...just a sweet, fun story with just a tiny little bit of dirty but not enough to not make it watchable by older teenagers and a really nice message to boot. Blended is honestly one of the best movies I have seen this year so far...period.I have loved Adam Sandler (Click, The Wedding Singer, Spanglish) and I have despised his very existence (Jack and Jill, That's My Boy...many, many, MANY others of his stupid comedies.) This was Sandler the way I wish he would continue as a comedian. He is far too old to be doing stupid voices and acting like a child. He can be wacky and lovable and this proves it. He is best when he is balancing emotion with comedy and showing a serious side too and being just a down to earth guy. Drew Barrymore is still an absolutely adorable sweetheart. I don't think she is an amazing actress, and lord knows neither is Sandler but they are so good at just being charismatic in this type of role. I loved the love/hate relationship between them in this and they have nearly perfect comedic timing. This is a twosome that truly brings out the best in each other. I wouldn't call them passionate together but just believable and undeniably cute. The supporting cast is a whose who of silly, ridiculous but not quite irritating characters. Kevin Nealon, Joel McHale (perfect as always as the love-to-hate bad guy), Abdoulaye NGom (almost overused but just used enough to make him annoyingly lovable), Shaquille O'Neal (hardly in it and stupid when he is but sparingly so its okay) and Terry Crews. Crews is the one question mark because I felt like he was overused and he was definitely a one trick pony so I do remember thinking ""enough already"" at one point. The kids in the film steal the show!! Hopefully I don't miss any of them. Emma Fuhrmann, Bella Thorne (exceptional!), Braxton Beckham, Alyvia Alyn Lind, Kyle Red Silverstein and Jessica Lowe. These kids steal every scene their in and Sandler has a talent for finding the funny in kids. They are the perfect blend (pardon the pun) of funny and emotional. Saving the best for last in the supporting cast...Wendi McLendon-Covey is Barrymore's obligatory ""best friend."" She's wildly neurotic and absolutely perfect for her scenes. I'm already head over heels for her as the over-bearing and delightfully doting mother on ""The Goldbergs"" and her performance in this is just as good. She is comedy gold.Sandler is a lot of things but if he stopped and thought through his projects a little more, he knows what works. One of the best things he could have done for this film was to put Frank Coraci at the helm. The man knows this type of film inside and out. Some of the best genre specific comedies I've seen in the last few years have been by him. The Wedding Singer (arguably Sandler's best film ever), Click, Here Comes The Boom and now this. If you've stuck reading this to this point then I want to re-iterate that I am not a fool and I know this is not a perfect piece of cinema. It is one of those movies that is simply perfectly entertaining. I went in with certain expectations for a romantic comedy, featuring two stars that have been together twice before and I expected certain things. Blended delivered over and over again in that respect. You won't find a more fun and entertaining movie out there. Please check this out!! 9/10",Blended

19,g-bodyl,Sweet Adam Sandler Is Back!,9,8 April 2015,"It seems like I am in the minority of people who are Adam Sandler fans. I am proud to be a fan of Adam Sandler even if he creates junk time to time such as ""Jack and Jill."" But his latest, Blended, is definitely not junk. I found it to be a sweet, funny comedy about love in unexpected places. The sweetness that makes Adam so lovable once again is at full display in this movie. The film isn't perfect of course and there are some annoying scenes, but I was pleasantly surprised about this film. Frank Coraci's film is about a man named Jim who goes on a blind date with this woman named Lauren. The date was a disaster and each of them make clear that they dislike each other. However, fate reunites them on a bonding trip in Africa where they and their children are forced to stick around with each other.As mentioned before, I thought Adam Sandler was great in this movie. Not his best role, but certainly one of his sweetest. The movie is better just by the fact this is his third pairing with Drew Barrymore. Barrymore as Lauren does a great job and shows great chemistry with Adam. An actress to keep an eye on is Bella Thorne as Jim's eldest daughter. She has the chops to be a star one day. I didn't like Terry Crews as I thought his constant singing routine was so much to bear. Overall, Blended is a very good movie and a much better film than people suggest. Granted, I am biased since I am a Sandler fan, but even so it's quite a good movie that have some funny moments. I loved the pop culture references as they even somehow made fun of Twilight. The price of admission is just worth it to see Adam and Drew back together for an African adventure. My Grade: A-",Blended
20,cosmo_tiger,If you like Adam Sandler comedies you will love this. He knows his strengths & his audience and he sticks with them.,7,24 August 2014,"""No more dating for me.

When they see each other in Africa plans begin to change. I have to admit I was a little worried about this movie going in. I do like Adam Sandler but when his movies are funny they are really funny (Happy Gilmore) and when they are bad they are un-watchable (Jack and Jill). Even from the preview you can pretty much tell exactly that will happen in the movie and without trying to spoil anything...you're right with your prediction. All that said the movie is very funny and me and my family laughed all the way through. Even though this is very close to Just Go With It it is different enough to feel somewhat fresh. There really isn't much else to say about this. If you like Adam Sandler comedies you will love this. If you think he is a little annoying then don't watch it. He knows his strengths and his audience and he sticks with them. This movie is no different. Overall, a very funny movie that I liked and Adam Sandler fans will too. I give this a B+.",Blended
21,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,3,10 August 2014,"BlendedWhen combining two families into one you may find redundancies amongst the children.However the blended family in this comedy is keeping their brood intact.Lauren (Drew Barrymore), a single-mother of two, goes out with Jim (Adam Sandler), widowed father of three girls, and it ends terribly.However happenstance reunites them at the pharmacy then again at Lauren's home, and lastly in Africa, where their families are amalgamated and sent on a ""familymoon"".Forced into couple's activities, Lauren and Jim soften towards each other, if only until they return stateside. While this third pairing of Barrymore and Sandler endeavors to deal with weightier issues, like children losing a parent and the complications involved in moving on, but any hope of sincerity is lost in a sea of trivial humour and offensive stereotypes.And as always, the best way for new families to break the ice is to get shitfaced together.

22,vincentlynch-moonoi,Enjoyable Adam Sandler film with less crass and more class,7,20 January 2015,"I have a rule. I no longer ever pay money at the box office to see an Adam Sandler movie. I wait for it to come to cable television and watch the first 15 or so minutes to see if it is a.)another lowest-common-denominator film of farting, burping, and groping oneself, or b.)is a film with a little class and a little emotional involvement in a story line. It seems that most of time Sandler's films are of the lowest-common-denominator variety, which just don't interest me. In that way, he reminds me of Jerry Lewis in the late 1950s through the 1960s, a movie character who never grew up, did the same old characterizations in virtually film, and of whom the public grew tired. But, every once in a while, Adam Sandler surprises me and makes a movie with at least some class and some ""heart"", which still manages to be funny. That kind of movie I like. We've seen the slightly more mature variety of Sandler films in movies such as ""Fifty First Dates"", ""Spanglish"" (more of a drama), and here in ""Blended"".Although unsure of the quality of the movie throughout the first third of the story, I rather liked this film. Very little crass (we did have to listen to Sandler's character urinating), and a little class. The plot is nothing unique -- a man and a woman sort of thrown together by fate, at first disliking each other intensely, but both slowly learning about the other's baggage and strong points, and finally realizing they have fallen in love.Sandler becomes quite an endearing character here...as the movie develops. Frankly, it's him at his best. Drew Barrymore again proves to be a good balance to Sandler, although I found myself saying, ""You can do better"".Bella Thorne as Sandler's oldest daughter does rather nicely here. I found some of the other children annoying at first, but their characters grew on me after a while and, as with the father character, we learned that they, too, had their good points. Shaquille O'Neal is along in sort of a cameo appearance. I found Abdoulaye N'Gom quite entertaining as a ""theme park"" docent.But that brings me to the thing I disliked most in this film -- the performance of Terry Crews. Now Crews is pretty good at light acting, such in his role as the father on ""Everybody Hates Chris"". He's likable enough, and is a decent actor. But frankly, here, as a singer at the ""theme park"", he pretty much makes a fool of himself. Terry -- you're talented enough for better roles! Much of the movie was filmed in South Africa because of its premise that the man and woman who dislike each other after a first date, coincidentally find themselves in an African theme park, where they slowly fall in love. Although no one else seemed to have mentioned it, the film didn't seem to put Africans in the best light, or maybe I'm just being overly sensitive.So, the bottom line is that Adam Sandler does pretty well here and produced a decent movie. I actually liked it. And there's no denying that the $80 million dollar profit shows that once again the general public likes much of what Adam Sandler does. Please, Adam, more like this!",Blended
23,ironhorse_iv,"This romantic comedy movie was a mess. It felt like it was being rip apart in a blender. It wasn't that bad of a movie, but it's far from being good.",5,1 June 2014,"Being a fan of both 1998's Wedding Singer and 2004's 50 First Dates. I have to say, this movie was disappointing, but nearly watchable. I have to say, the crude potty humor jokes were mostly a miss than hit in the funny bone. The movie was only save by the charm of seeing Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler in a movie, again. You have to know what you're coming into when entering into a new Adam Sandler movie. It's because Sandler is always trying to flog the same old comedy routine. The movie directed by Frank Coraci is about two simple parents whom blind date between them, go badly. Driven, by fate, the two people, Jim Friedman (Adam Sandler) and Lauren Reynolds (Drew Barrymore), find themselves sharing an Africa vacation together, when Jim's boss and Lauren's friend gave their combined tickets to both of them. The lazy plot is pretty predictable and tiresome. The movie really follows some really old romantic comedy clichés. Honestly, how often do opposites attract in these films? While I see the movie went into great care to explain how Jim & Lauren are indeed caring parents, the movie really doesn't explore their on screen chemistry besides how the other sees each other through how they handle their own children and the children of the other family. I really hate the title of the film as it sound like a spy film or movie about cocktails. Why didn't Warner Bros. kept the 'The Family moon' title? Drew Barrymore was fine in her role as the overbearing mother of wild boys. She really had got beautiful in aged. Adam Sandler, I have to say, was watchable. He wasn't playing an annoying dumb jerk man-child with a weird voice. He was blended enough to care about his struggles when raising a family of girls. Sandler had aged, but his humor hasn't. There were a lot of awkward disturbing things passing as jokes. Horrible dark moments trying to be pass as light moments. Honestly, all the children have mental disorders and annoying as hell. It was really uncomfortable to sit through. I felt like it was a horror movie at times. It really felt like a disturbing Bradley Bunch pilot. If only Adam Sandler play it straight, and this movie was played as realistic dramatic-comedy, this movie might be better. Instead, you get a movie that movie trying to act real, only to pause with jokes about others' expense, quirky cultural references, slapstick humor, and offensive inherently sexist humor that slow the movie pace to nearly 2 hour run time. It was really distracting. There is no reason for this movie to be that long, as it could be cut to less than 90 minutes. It took the script nearly 30 minutes into the film to establish Africa. The movie really got annoying with repeating sayings and running jokes that got run into the ground. Like example, 'What Happen in Africa, stay in Africa', and how often the word 'Blended' was used to replace another word. It's also sucks that they use a running gag from 1998's Godzilla, with people can't say, a certain last name. One thing that was also awkward, were the cameos of Adam Sandler's stock films characters. The cameo actors didn't really match with the scenes, they were given. What is George Stitzer (Alexis Arquette) doing at a baseball game? Also, who let Ten-Second Tom (Allen Convert) out in the world? Another thing, people might hate is all the product placement, from Dick's Sporting Goods to Hooters. What is with Adam Sandler and Hooters? Unlike the other two movies with Drew Barrymore & Adam Sandler, this movie was missing a great music moment to set the feel of the movie. You felt like you were in the 1980s with the Wedding Singer soundtrack. You felt like you were in Hawaii in 50 First Dates with the Beach Boys and Hawaiian theme songs. You don't feel like you're in Africa in this movie with its soundtrack. Yes, you got Terry Crews playing in the background as Greek like Chorus, but it came off as a parody than helping set the mood. I do have to say Drew Barrymore singing ""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" is a great homage to 50 First Dates. There is a few smart jokes, like using different music to describe what they were thinking, during certain scenes, but for the most part, it was just morass of sub-mediocrity. Overall: Blended is just forgettable and nearly unwatchable. It's not the worst movie that Adam Sandler put out, but it's not the best. Sorry, I would re-watch 50 First Dates and Wedding Singer before seeing this movie, again.",Blended

The movie can be enjoyed for its comedy, not for anyone's performance. The location (South Africa) was good, but not exposed well, instead make fun out of it which was expected.In earlier days I used laugh out loud for Sandler's jokes, he's not the same guy anymore, I barely smile now. And for Barrymore, she was one of my actresses (I believe still she's), but her recent movies are disappointing, or barely in entertainment business. Kind of attractive Bella Thorne in a tomboyish getup, hope to see her in many future projects.I heard that Dale Steyn does a cameo for a Hollywood and I did not know it was this movie until I saw him. He's a rock-star on the pitch, but when Sandler made fun out of him that irked me and then let it go as it just a silly movie. Like the old days' animation shorts for the TV, this film had collective pieces of comedic scenes. Individually very entertaining, but as a movie fails to assemble.

25,Floated2,A Step Up From Sandler's Previous,7,2 February 2015,"Blended is the third and most recent film collaboration between Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. The movie starts dismally with a blind date between single parents Barrymore and Sandler. The scene is so lacking in humor and originality that it made both me and my guest want to bolt, thinking we were in for two hours of clumsy dialogue and attempts at humor lowlighted by Barrymore spitting her food all over Sandler. It was at this point that I told my guest that she could leave if she so desired.Almost immediately, however, came a scene among Barrymore, Sandler, and Barrymore's best friend, Wendi McLendon-Covey (who set up the blind date. From that point on writers Ivan Menchell and Clare Sera get it in gear and produce a film that's funny and full of good family values.It's not just happy and carefree, however. There are some touching scenes. Hard as it may be for some to believe, Sandler and Barrymore do fine jobs of acting.

26,eddie_baggins,A charmless and largely laugh free affair,2,18 November 2014,"We've all known it for quite a few years now but if you were under any illusions that Adam Sandler had given up the acting ghost and agreed to himself that he would do anything as long as the money is good and material lame and predictable, then you need to watch Blended. Blended is a movie so devoid of any reason for existing other than to prove a point (and give Sandler another paid holiday) that in the past was not fact, as much as Sandler has given in to the lowest common denominator, it's safe to say now also that audiences have given up on him.Blended was one of Sandler's lowest grossing movies in years (barring his smaller ""dramatic"" movies like Reign Over Me and Punch Drunk Love) and it showcases that his once ardent following has tapered off, no doubt drained of seeing him play the exact same character over and over again and seemingly look to make sure he gets a nice vacation as the movie films. It's actually in a weird way sad that Sandler has become who he has as an actor, the oddball charm he once possessed in unquestionably immature comedies like Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy etc etc is virtually non-existent now and even teaming up with his lucky charm Drew Barrymore and Wedding Singer director Frank Coraci does nothing to change this.Where the Wedding Singer was a charming delight and 50 First Dates funny and heartfelt, Blended is cold, uninspired and forced from beginning to drawn out end. Barrymore has fine comedic timing and she has small moments to showcase that here but her chemistry that was so good between herself and Sandler previously is devoid of personality here. Jokes in Blended feel signposted throughout, the growing relationship between Barrymore's Lauren and Sandler's Jim takes forever to get going and once it does it feels rushed and uninteresting and all other many varied side plots the film throws into the mix are typical Sandler fluff from playing baseball, riding ostriches and Shaq cameos, nothing that happens here feels fresh, even the films adventure to Africa is just a total by-line – there is seemingly no point in even being there. Oh but I can see giraffes! Too long, to lame, too predictable and well too Sandler, Blended is a dire comedy that is saved only by a few cheap laughs that are all types of random (rowdy Indian lady anyone?). Sandler has lost his mojo and he needs to get it back fast but with material similar to this so called romantic comedy, that mojo is going to be mightily hard to find.1 shimmy out of 5",Blended

Some of Adam Sandlers latest movies have been pretty terrible, but this one was sweat and pretty funny in places. The African singers/dancers really made me laugh and the chemistry between the kids and the adults was sweat. The storyline was a bit corny but it's light hearted comedy for the whole family. Judging by the films box office success, it's obvious that the Sandler/Barrymore team up really works so I'm sure that we'll be seeing them together again in the near future. Enjoyable!Round-Up: After the terrible movies from Sandler, like the Grown Up movies, Jack &  Jill and That's My Boy, it's good to see him come back with a decent movie which has something for the kids and the adults. The little girl is really cute and the whole African cast were really amusing. I also thought that the Blended songs throughout the movie were REALLY funny but the ending was predictable and extremely corny. Basically, it's what you expect from a movie in this genre and from Adam Sandler.Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $127millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there romantic comedies about a man and a woman who go to South Africa with there kids and end up falling in love with each other. 6/10",Blended

This is an Adam Sandler movie. Some people like him and some people don't. I fall somewhere in between. I like some of his movies but some are just plain dumb, and this one leans toward the dumb side. This is the third time that Adam and Drew have worked together, with The Wedding Singer being the first and 50 First Dates being the second. In this one, Adam is the widowed father of 3 girls and Drew is the divorced mother of 2 boys. Friends set the two of them up on a blind date, which does not go very well-Adam takes Drew to Hooters and things go downhill from there. Wendi is Drew's best friend and gives her some tickets for a vacation trip to Africa. When Drew and sons arrive, guess who also got tickets to Africa? Yep, Adam and his girls. Of course there are lots of rough patches to work through before Adam and Drew discover what everyone in the audience already knew at the beginning of the movie; that they would end up liking each other. It is pretty predictable and not too funny at times but there are a few moments. Oh yeah, Kevin plays another person at the African Safari vacation spot that becomes friends with Adam and Drew. FYI: the title of the movie- Blended-refers to families blending. It's rated ""PG-13"" for language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 57 minutes.

34,estebangonzalez10,At least it's a watchable Sandler movie,6,8 January 2016,"""Even in nature, there are blended families.""It's been a while since I can remember enjoying an Adam Sandler film. Does that mean this film is great? No, but at least it surpassed my expectations. Looking back at Sandler's career, there is no doubt that the person he's had the greatest chemistry with is Drew Barrymore. This is their third collaboration together and I have enjoyed all their films. The Wedding Singer is by far the best, but 50 First Dates also had its moments. Blended does have a lot of unwelcoming jokes that don't work and plenty of dead air, but there is enough heart to keep the family engaged. It is a family film more than anything else. Director Frank Coraci has probably directed some of Sandler's best films (The Wedding Singer and The Waterboy), but he has also delivered some terrible films like The Zookeeper and Here Comes the Boom so you never know what to expect from him. Blended couldn't have begun in a more clichéd way, but twenty minutes into the film the story does pick up and once we arrive in Africa the adventure truly begins. The kids deliver the authentic charm the film needed and once Sandler and Barrymore stop hating on each other the film does become sweet. The film banks on their chemistry and it is what works best in this otherwise formulaic family film. Unlike most of Sandler's recent films, Blended is very watchable and I didn't find myself hating him. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Blended
35,r96sk,This... this surprised me,8,6 May 2020,"This... this surprised me. 'Blended' is exceptionally very good, something I did not expect to be saying in this review.Any synopsis for this would make you fear the worst, as you'd expect it to be one of those average Adam Sandler films with low quality humour and extremely lazy characters played by a poor cast. However, this film somewhat incredibly manages to make everything work; it even has heart to it.Sandler, first of all, is actually pretty amusing as Jim. Across the opening few scenes it looks like another cliché, crappy character but as the production goes on we surprisingly get a bit more depth with him. Likewise with the rest, I feel we get enough of an understanding to go alongside the humour.Drew Barrymore is enjoyable as Lauren, she and Sandler have very good chemistry. The child actors are nicely chosen too, with Bella Thorne (Hilary), Emma Fuhrmann (Espn - yes, really) and Braxton Beckham (Brendan) all earning their stripes - I wasn't cringed out by any of them once, which is impressive. Even the side characters here are fun, Terry Crews and Abdoulaye N'Gom are likeable in their respective roles of Nickens and Mfana.I did not see this one coming, I was ready to dislike it.

I could not stand Shaquille O'neille in this movie, that's a big reason why the rating isn't higher, he was just bad and frankly stupid in the film. I enjoyed the child actors, they did well. I thought drew Barrymore helping out Sandlers daughter and giving her a makeover and everything was cool and sweet, a nice touch. Also I loved Wendi (Bridesmaids) in the movie, she was as funny as ever.

37,3xHCCH,Sandler and Barrymore Does It Again!,6,13 June 2014,"Adam Sandler has been in a lot of film disasters of late like ""Jack and Jill"" and ""Grown-Ups 2"". He desperately needs a good one to recover, and what better idea than to reunite with Drew Barrymore, his co-star in two of his biggest and most beloved hits of his career, ""The Wedding Singer"" and ""50 First Dates.""Sandler plays Jim, a widow with three girls. Barrymore plays Lauren, a divorcée with two boys. After a disastrous blind date, by some contrived plot manipulation, Jim and Lauren and all their kids were forced by circumstances to spend time together on a luxurious South African resort vacation! Of course, as most rom-coms go, after bonding over the ostrich rides, the jungle safari, the jeep para-gliding and couples massage, these two mortal enemies get to know each other and their kids more and more. Will they fall in love and live happily ever after? What do you think?Adam Sandler seems to be the same guy in all of his films, only he is much older now. He still has that signature lazy smart-ass vibe his loyal fans love. This is benign stuff for him, not as memorable as his breakthrough parts in Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore.I confess I am a sucker for the charms of Drew Barrymore in most of her films. She retains her classy beauty and genuine kind-hearted image even as she goes for the laughs. She is the perfect foil to Sandler's crassness. My favorite Drew moment in this film is that scene where she sings a lullaby for the kids.The five kids, who have distinct problems of their own, mostly borne out growing up with a single parent, mostly do well without being too annoying. Standing out among the kids is Bella Thorne, who plays Jim's eldest daughter Hilary, who often gets mistaken for a boy because of her pageboy haircut and basketball skills. The supporting actors bask in the glow of the Sandler-Barrymore charisma. Jessica Lowe delightfully plays a kooky blonde bombshell who is the second wife of a much older man. Zak Henry manages to be funny as an Edward Cullen clone who makes Hilary want to shed her tomboy image. It was fun to see Shaquille O'Neal as Jim's co-worker at the sports store. Muscle-bound Terry Crews steals scenes as the sleazy lead singer of a Greek Chorus of sorts at the African resort.Overall, this film gets by mainly by the comedic chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore. The jokes may not really be so original or smashing but somehow we smile and chuckle because they are the ones delivering those jokes. Though ""Blended"" does not exactly match their first two films together, but this is definitely a major step-up from Sandler's last two outputs, thanks to Barrymore.",Blended
38,peterp-450-298716,Just another romantic comedy with nothing to laugh about ....,2,2 September 2014,"""I got a girl for you. A blond girl from my dance class. Slightly chubby. But when you start to move, all that is worth it. That big woman can make you move like a hurricane""Are you a sucker for romantic comedies? Or movies where everything goes wrong and in the end the whole situation miraculously recovers ? Or a film in which a rather geeky-looking daughter suddenly transforms into a fairy-like lady, after which some sad sack who at first didn't have any interest, suddenly starts chasing her with his slobbering tongue to the floor? Or such a nonsense comedy with really lame jokes ? Even summarized they barely manage to conjure a smile on your face. Or are you looking forward to that particular film where again there's someone in it with the name Dick, and you already know in advance what roguish jokes are about to be made? Hallelujah! Then ""Blended"" really is a movie that fits you because it includes all these features and you'll save some time. No need to look for all the specific movies and see them all, because they (the geniuses) put everything in this movie. Briljant.Adam Sandler. Yes, popular in America. However, he's not on my list of favorite comedians. I always feel as if he is reluctant to act and then makes up some insipid one-liners to satisfy everyone. A little smile here and there happens occasionally. But tears from laughing while watching a Sandler's movie is nonexistent. I even think that a night of watching Sandler-movies could have a disastrous medical affect on me. Chronic diarrhea or an acute swoon ...""Blended"" is such a predictable feel-good movie where two single people meet each other, can't stand each other and find each other in the end, so everybody can fall in each other's arms. A happy ending with a capital ""H"". The chemistry between the two is absent at the beginning. Of course this is caused by a series of misunderstandings as you'll notice after wards. By a twist of fate (Dick turns out to have a lot of kids. Did you notice the subtle association between this fact and his first name ?) they both go on a trip to South Africa for a restful holiday with the whole family. That's the first positive thing I can say about this movie. The images of this adventurous and primitive Africa are gorgeous. The African Savannah with its wildlife and its beautiful sunsets. But for such images I can turn on the TV and watch something like National Geographics.To their surprise they bump into each other of course. They are required to share the same suite and also have diner together at the same table. Obviously at that table sits a typical couple that always appears in this type of film: one, probably divorced, noisy guy of mature age accompanied by a young wench with a bosom where there's enough space for a few flower pots and therefore the need of a balcony is superfluous at the apartment. Of course these two attachments shake around a lot and is a joy for one of the two sons who's in the ""nude-magazines-under-the-bed"" phase. And then we are ready for a series of embarrassing situations, childish fart jokes, endearing cuddles with cute teenage girls, the required human emotional bonding that develop gradually and a happy ending where everything falls into the fold.The most annoying item in this film: the appearance of the African crooner Nickens all the time. Especially the one during the basketball game was really an embarrassment. They look like a bunch of Muppets, who pop up whether relevant or not and start singing a song related to the situation. I would have tied them to an elephant, cram a huge rocket in the butt of the elephant, light it real fast so it'll disappear soon into the bush with that tricked orchestra.Most positive thing in the whole movie: the appearance of Drew Barrymore. She acts as if it's self-evident and looks so charming all the time. Not everybody is blessed with those qualities. She still has that sweet face like she had in ""ET"". And I have to admit that Sandler and her make a cute couple.I can be brief about Sandler. He's an imitation of himself. He plays the same character role in all his films over and over again : a clumsy pathetic guy who sounds sometimes boorish, but ultimately his dry humor and his seemingly fragile personality manages to please members of the female sex. A repetition in other words. And that's something that is invariably misused in this film: endlessly repeating the same lame joke (bumping an innocent head, mispronouncing Sandler's name ...) until you want to scream to the screen ""Yeaaaaah, we get it ... !

39,AudioFileZ,Landing In Africa...With A Big Thud!,4,31 May 2014,"I guess you could say Adam Sandler's Blended has a heart as opposed to Will Farrell's Anchorman 2 which doesn't? That postulated, for this viewer anyway, Anchorman 2 kept me in constant laughter while Blended hardly manages an occasional snicker. It's good to see Drew Barrymore and Sandler back together as they've had, I think, two previous pairings that, perhaps, had a modicum of chemistry. Here that pairing seems strained, perhaps because of Sandler's character needing to be actually funny since that is what Blended is obviously trying for. The laughs are truly spaced out which is to say way too many fall flat.As the story progresses a forced blending of Sandler's and Barrymore's families get thrown together. The premise which this springs from is abysmal. To make it more picturesque the blending is an African romantic getaway of which Sandler's boss was to take with Barrymore's business (Closet Queens, ha ha) partner. The African thing seems, mostly, bizarre as well as well as heavy handedly plied; poking fun at quite likely every possible tasteless stereotypical way. That forced nature comes off as a total nonsense (i.e., not funny). How hilarious is Adam Sandler riding an ostrich? A real kneeslapper...Not.One gets the feeling Sandler has lost his way, if not his best comedic center; kind of like someone who knows he needs to get back in the game while he's throwing something on the proverbial wall with a Hail Mary to hope it sticks. It slides off with a splat constantly.As you can gather this is not a particularly good Adam Sandler movie. Looking back, maybe those were, in fact, rarer than one realized. Still, the man had that post Saturday Night Live ""next big thing"" talent at one time. Personally, I don't believe you just lose that for good. Times do change, but talent adapts and with Sandler there needs to be a big ""tune-up"" which requires the right vehicle of which this movie is, mostly, a polar opposite. These two are capable of so much better it just has to be said. They're not the Tracy and Hepburn of comedy, but this is purely a wasted effort. Sandler's deadpan, dour if you will, comedy needs something that fits and if he doesn't find it his time may have passed is the most serious takeaway though.",Blended

41,Seraphion,A good come back from Sandler and Barrymore,6,31 May 2014,"Blended tells us about two single parents Jim and Lauren who first met on a flunked out blind date. Through mutual friends from each of their sides, that quite failed in building a relationship, they make use of a failed vacation to a family resort in Africa, that has already been booked. Without they realizing it, a relationship starts to build between Jim and Lauren through sheer functional needs, Jim's all daughter kids needs a mom while on the other hand Lauren's boys needs a father. When they get back home, the two then seal their attractions into a relationship.Personally the target of being a family comedy doesn't oblige this movie to have a complicated story. But the base story element of using an African resort and set is freshly new. This is great because it gives movies using Africa as the set, especially the comedies, a new breath beside the ones that overly focused on the deserts and sands and animals. Blended doesn't leave out those elements of Africa, but it doesn't oversaturate the movie with it, and still keeps the focus on the family drama comedy nicely well.Although I don't think this movie is a good family targeted flick, due to it having so much scenes not appropriate for the younger viewers, even when under parental supervision. I don't only focus on the abundant kissing scenes, which for me are not romantic at all but tend to look gross, but also the mild violent scenes like when Lauren carry her boy to bed and accidentally, but repeatedly, ran his head on walls. This looks funny at first, but it overstayed its funny element by being to long. Also the scene is repeated again on a later moment, one thing that really doesn't show a good example for a family.The comedic moments and jokes are quite nice. They are served in a neat flow, not forcing you to laugh all the time and loose some of it along the way, and also not so distant in between that you get to fell the movie as a drama. They're served steadily with good Laugh Per Minute count. They get to be funny just about right form the movie's start. The jokes are funny. And I really mean they're funny universally, unlike some Hollywood comedies nowadays that focus only on American culture, making the jokes only national jokes. I personally like the early Sandler's line ""I don't see anything"" to her daughter. That was insanely hilarious.The acting is just as expectedly splendid by Sandler and Barrymore. This makes it a good come back for the both of them. But the others really get shadowed behind them. At first I thought that this is still okay considering that the story is focusing on their characters, but then again, the kids are really shadowed especially when they are in one frame with them.From me this movie deserve a 6 out of 10 score and a recommendation to go and see. But again I warn the families, especially those who concern about setting an example for their younger kids.",Blended
42,rgkarim,Blended comedy with a simplistic story,7,25 May 2014,"Adam Sandler movies, you either love them or you hate them. Over the last few years, the crazy comedian has given us plenty of comedies, some great and some not so great. Yet like many stars, Sandler has found his niche and does not seem to veer out of his comfort zone of  comedy. This weekend the latest film in Happy-Madison productions has been released titled Blended, which may raise the question, was this movie worth watching? I'll do my best to answer that question. The plot of Blended is simple, two families led by Sandler and Drew Barrymore go on vacation together, by accident, and bring their families along. Coincidentally genetics has chosen to give the single parents kids all of the opposite sex, which sets the stage for the repetitive, predictable plot elements. Although stale, the delivery is very cute, showing that happiness can still be achieved despite being thrown a bum rap, (i.e. divorce and death of a spouse). Both characters being single parents have issues with their kids, especially coming to terms with teenage problems that range from simple boy drama, to coping with alone time and some ""interesting images"". And as you might guess, the predictable transformation into the perfect parent starts to take place, with each family head fulfilling a role the other can't. It's heartwarming, and it gave me goose bumps at seeing true family bonding, but it is done in the same, over dramatized way that borders the line of cheesiness. Of course in an Adam Sandler movie, the ""plot"" is not really what many go for, but more for what laughs Sandler and his crew can bring out. Well Blended manages to do just that, blend lots of comedy topics into a formula that was very entertaining. We can start with Sandler himself; the giant kid at heart does the same style he's known for years. He still screams like he's got something in his throat, often falling into what I call his Billy Madison voice to make fans scream with laughter. Other times he is actually delivering some well written quips, emphasizing key words or putting just the right spin to get the point across, like Chandler from friends. And of course what would an Adam Sandler movie be without a funny face or two to keep things even kiddier. All of these qualities are in the mix for this movie that will entertain loyal fans for the entire two hours. Sandler alone isn't the only thing funny about this movie though, he is merely the medium of a choice to bring a lot of the comedy to life. For me, the funniest aspect of the movie is the writing. Unlike other Sandler movies, and comedy films in general, Blended has decided to spread out the comedy styles and mix them together in a script full of fun and laughter. Awkward conversations about periods, analogies comparing overprotective behavior with that of a prison warden, jabs at character flaws that blow back up in their faces, and well-timed sarcasm. Each of these qualities is seen throughout the movie, integrated into the sentimental plot to keep the mood fun, without taking away from the compassion within the scene. The writing team did a nice job actually using the comedy as relief; instead of just throwing out a storm of comedic gibberish that loses it's edge over time. We all know that Sandler's latest projects lack a certain balance either being insanely kiddy (Bedtime Stories), uncomfortably focused on inappropriate sexual things (That's my boy), or just a mish mash of stupidity (Grown ups 2). Not the case for Blended, I felt they didn't overdo most of the jokes and found a way to keep me laughing throughout the entire film. Even repeats of jokes retained their humor, except for the head-bashing thing, because they added just a little unexpected extra that kept it fresh. Having the rest of the cast also participate also helped with the humor. I said that Sandler did a lot of the jokes, but the rest of the cast got to put their two cents in for making us laugh. Hearing mispronounced biological processes from an 8 year old's mouth, or seeing the name of lingerie misunderstood as candy are just some of the examples that had me nearly in tears. While some things do go a little over the line for the younger audience members, most of the mature jokes are masked well enough, but still exercise caution before bringing your family. Despite the balance in comedy though, Blended is something we've already seen. It's a plot line that has been done a million times with a comedy style we've known quite well for years. Haters of Sandler's comedy style, or super predictable endings should stay away from Blended, even though it is one of the better comedies he's put out in a while. It is cute, and while incredibly silly and juvenile, it's a feel good movie that is meant for family outings. Such simplistic films are good to have OCCASIONALLY. So if you are looking for a comedy that will truly entertain you, I recommend this film, otherwise skip the theaters this weekend and get prepped for next weekend. My scores are: Comedy: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0-6.5 Sandler movie: 8.0",Blended
43,Movie-ManDan,Sandler's Best Movie In Years.,6,19 January 2015,"It is clear that Adam Sandler has lost his touch. He went from doing hilarious and heartfelt comedies that only he can do, to stupid and meaningless comedies and second grader can do better. Deep within Adam Sandler is a gifted actor that can light up the screen, if given a good script and a good director. Watch his 2007 drama, Reign Over Me. It is his only movie where he does not deliver any ounce of comedy. By the looks of Blended, he is moving back in that serious direction.Click was Sandler's last truly great film. I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry (I found) was his last truly hilarious film. Funny People wasn't quite at the level of others, but I thought it would help his career. He buried Funny People and his other classics with bad movies like Jack & Jill, Grown Ups 2 and That's My Boy. I had my doubts for Blended, (you can't really blame me) but I can comfortably say that this is his best movie in years. Best since Funny People. He teams up with Drew Barrymore for a third time in a splendid and delightful flick. Although this is not as good as their previous collaborations, it is a step up for Sandler's recent string.I will start by saying that Blended has some parallels to Sandler's recent string of movies. Those are: bad acting and no hilarity. The acting is a step up, since you can get used to it, whereas you couldn't in his others. I remember reading about Free Willy and saying over 1000 kids auditioned for the role of Jesse before settling on Jason James Richter. Adam Sandler probably did 10 or 20 before deciding on some of his cast members. That leads into there being nothing funny. Sandler tries his darndest to incorporate as much laughter as he possibly can, but fails at every angle. There were some parts the somewhat tickled me and did grin at, but none of them were truly funny.Sandler has lost his touch in making funny movies, but he has proved that Blended does not need true comedy, just warmth and delight. If he didn't try so hard to make a gut-busting romantic-comedy, the result would have been better. The comedy fails, but the drama portion succeeds in ways I thought Sandler could never do. This is his best serious flick he has done since Click back in 2006. When I said the acting is bad but not that bad, it is because it subsides and becomes good in the serious bits. Only during the comedy bits does the acting become bad.Sandler and Barrymore go on a disastrous blind date with each other then wind-up on an African vacation together. The African bits are a joy to see. They have kids of the opposite genders, so they help out each other's kids as they need an adult figure of their same sex. They do so in touching ways. We all know that Sandler and Barrymore end up together at the end, but it is worth seeing how they do so. In 2011's Just Go With It, everything was so predictable it was boring. Blended leaves for some intrigue and wanting to sit through it. There actually is a point in the movie where the comedy seems to literally disappear and the movie becomes all-around better. I am proud of Adam Sandler for doing a movie where the seriousness is a true winner.2.5/4",Blended
44,raulfaust,Together so whatever it takes...,7,29 October 2014,"""Blended"" is a film that everyone talked about when it came out on theaters, so I surely felt like giving it a chance, even if that would mean watching a Sandler's picture. From the get go, we're given well built scenes, which fun are due to the embarrassing situations characters get into. The 'excuse for leaving date' idea felt really funny, considering everyone must have been through similar situation at least once in their lives. Terry Crews is another time a festive guy, delivering a nice character, even if repeating everything he has done in past. The story varies from being funny to touching, in a way that spectator doesn't get bored with ease. Unfortunately, in the conclusion, it appeals to the classic Hollywood happy ending, so we surely remember that it's just another blockbuster, but the relatively original story makes up for this.",Blended
45,Screen_Blitz,Blended bogs down on tiresome rom-com formula with little to offer beyond a mediocre script,4,22 February 2017,"This romantic comedy reunites Adam Sandler with director Frank Coraci after their previous collaborations (The Wedding Singer, Click), and continues Sandler's endless series of schlocky comedies that have often ranged from mediocre to unbearable. Unlike most of Sandler's films from recent years, this one leans more towards the former category as it marks a slightly different direction than portraying Sandler as a phony man-child that has become his typical typecasting. That, however, doesn't mean this film is good. It is formulaic, it is rarely funny, and too often bogs down on the same dimwitted humor that tainted many of Sandler's previous entries. And when it comes to its more touching moments and tackling on family values, it occasionally works but does little to make up for how shallow this comedy is. This film stars Adam Sandler as Jim, a single father of three daughters: Hilary (played by Bella Thorne), Espn (played by Emma Fuhrmann), and Loud (played by Alyvia Alyn Lind). After a botched a blind date with a cute blondie named Lauren (played by Drew Barrymore), single mother of two sons Brendan and Tyler, Jim plans a family trip to South Africa in effort to bond with his children. Upon arriving however, he crashes into Lauren and her two son who happen to be vacationing there as well. With the two families forced to share a hotel room together against their will, a series of wild adventures ensues and an unexpected romance between Jim and Lauren slowly blossoms.Adam Sandler is no stranger to being subject to dumb, unengaging comedic vehicles that have tainted in his career in recent years. This film however, not only boasts surprisingly just a little bit more substance than the usual Sandler fare, but renders Sandler to someone with more likability to the immature man-child characters he's often seen playing. Collaborating with Drew Barrymore for the third time after 'The Wedding Singer' and '50 First Dates', Sandler manages to come up with a just a few okay laughs that sadly come far in between. But the film spends the majority of the time stuck in the shackles of tiresome slapstick humor and a redundant barrage of sexist jokes that either fail to land or just plain stale. At best, most of the dialogue that shoots out of the characters' mouths evoke nothing quick chuckles, if any. And it certainly does not help that the story is overly reliant on typical romantic comedy clichés to the point where it comes almost entirely predictable from start to finish. The best thing that manages to make its out is a surprisingly competent chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore which adds just a slight bit of energy to the story. And when the film is not trying unsuccessfully to throw a slew of flat jokes at you, there are a few attempts at more heart-touching moments with the girls coping with the absence of their late mother. At best, there is one dramatic scene towards the end that works somewhat well, the rest of the attempts come off as rather dull. By the end, it all transpires to a near two-hour runtime of unengaging, uninspiring comedic fare that left me checking my watch more often than laughing. Blended is derivative romantic comedy that too often bogs down on tiresome rom-com clichés and offers not enough wit or clever humor to qualify for a charming comedic vehicle. Although it may not plummet to the bottom of the barrel of Sandler's more unbearable comedies, it's still pretty forgettable and fails to provide a redeeming point to Sandler's career.",Blended

47,areatw,Another generic comedy we could have done without,4,11 April 2017,"'Blended' is a generic, stale comedy that is almost identical to every other generic, stale comedy that Sandler has done. The plot might be different but it's still the same dumb humour and jokes that we've seen umpteen times before. You would have thought that an African safari trip would have made 'Blended' more appealing, but somehow it still manages to be totally uninspiring, verging on boring, despite the huge amount of potential with such a storyline. There are dumb jokes aplenty, most aren't funny, but they will probably keep the average viewer entertained.Unless you're Adam Sandler's biggest fan, there's little point watching 'Blended'.

54,bryank-04844,"Do you need to rush out to see 'Blended'? No, not necessarily.",4,17 August 2015,"If twenty years ago, I were to tell you that when I mentioned the name Adam Sandler, you would have turned your nose up and scoffed, you probably wouldn't believe me. There was a time when Adam Sandler's name was the first thing you thought about when the subject of comedy came up. With his unforgettable characters on 'SNL' to his hilarious comedy albums to his early films like 'Billy Madison' and 'Happy Gilmore', we all laughed our collective asses off at these films at some point in time with Sandler's unique brand of humor.Sandler even turned to do some dramatic work, which played very well and showed that Sandler has more than just silly acting chops. But over the past decade or so, Sandler has become very lazy with his films. It seems like he mostly says yes to heading to a nice set location with his acting friends, and making a silly family friendly comedy time and time again that has no ounce of quality writing or story. Instead, it just drags from set up to set up with poor toilet humor at every corner that we have seen countless times before.Of course there are a couple of exceptions, but nine times out of ten, you have come to expect a terrible time when watching an Adam Sandler movie. But over the years, Sandler has developed excellent chemistry with several different actors. One of them being Drew Barrymore. We fell in love with them in 'The Wedding Singer', and loved their chemistry in '50 First Dates'. Now, the duo is back with a family comedy called 'Blended' that his two single parents who bring their kids on a week long trip to Africa.Surprisingly, this Sandler comedy was a bit better than I expected it to be. I was expecting something as awful as 'Jack and Jill' or either one of the 'Grown Ups' films, but I was pleasantly surprised by just how much heart and soul this movie had. There were a few instances of that played out Sandler schtick that plagues his recent movies still, but as a whole, the film played well. Sandler plays a single dad named Jim who has three daughters and Barrymore plays Lauren, a single mom with two boys. The two are set up on a blind date at Hooters (Does Sandler own stock with this restaurant?) that doesn't go well.A few days later after a mix up at a local drugstore, Jim is on Lauren's doorstep returning her credit card. The two seem to have mutual people they know in common and under certain circumstances that don't make much sense, the two single families arrive in Africa on somebody else's dime. And as we've seen before, these two polar opposite people end up falling for each other by the end of the week. I wouldn't go as far as saying this was a great film, but it is definitely more tolerable than some Sandler's past films.One of the highlights of the movie is Terry Crews, who plays Nickens, the frontman for the hotel band who seems to be everywhere with his back up singers at in- opportune times. His over-the-top delivery is spectacular. But what makes 'Blended' better than some of the recent comedies that Sandler has said yes to is that there is enough time to devote to each character to focus on their flaws and strengths, as this movie is a solid two hours long.There are some genuine moments throughout that warm the heart even if it comes off as cheesy. But there is always that silly toilet humor following that. Do you need to rush out to see 'Blended'? No, not necessarily, but it is a solid one to watch when it comes out on home video. And thank you movie-gods for not allowing Sandler to do a ridiculous funny voice this time around.",Blended
55,witster18,"Sandler and Barrymore are fine, now for the rest of the casting decisions.",5,24 September 2014,"THere's a lot to like here, but wow this film drops the ball.I love a lot of the ideas. Just about everything between the two leads works, BUT everything around them doesn't. It's all the usual suspects from all of Sandlers' other films that ruin this. Well, that and some really stupid scenes. Don't get me wrong, I like many of Sandlers films, but this sometimes comes off as an odd mixture of 'Zohan and Grown Up' ridiculousness, and ""Big Daddy"" charm. The scenery is great, but there are many roll-your-eyes ridiculous, dumb moments in terms of this adventure. From the stupid music, to the terrible casting AND acting amongst some of the children..omg the crying.. I mean do they not even care? At least find a kid that can actually TRY to make it look, or at the very least SOUND like he's trying to cry.In the end this predictable, on-and-off comedy succeeds in some of the romantic themes, and fails miserably in most of the comedic themes. It is sometimes charming, but more often ridiculous. The charm underminded by those periodical moments of terror.Hey, it was easily better than Grown Ups 1 and 2. Dead on par with '50 first Dates' and 'That's my boy', which is, again, average at best. Too bad, this one had some great chemistry between the leads. Everything outside of those one-on-one moments is an absolute mess. A lot of films are predictable, but there's absolutely NOTHING in this film that you won't see coming.I'd pass. I guess it looks good next to Zohan and Grown Up(S), but Im going with 52/100. Sorry, I agree it was sometimes charming, but it was mostly stupid. Drop the singing ensemble, drop some of the cheese of the African adventure themes, drop the bad crying scenes(excuse me awful crying scenes), focus more on relationships, add some actual humor, and you might have something here.",Blended
56,RevRonster,Completely unfunny...but far more bearable than most Sandler films.,2,8 December 2014,"Adam Sandler movies have a tradition of being terrible and painfully unfunnyalso, a tradition of making a ton of money at the Box Office because we all secretly hate ourselves and feel the need to punish ourselves for a number of things we've done in our lifetime. However, surprisingly, ""Blended"" isn't as bad as his latest filmsbut it's still not good.The film has a pretty stupid premise that feels like either a bad sitcom setting or a reboot to ""The Brady Bunch,"" Drew Barrymore is just plain unbearable in the movie and looks like she is on some sort of drug trip that is preventing her from acting like a normal human being, all the scenes begin with one of several jokes the film uses over and over again and ends with a hack punchline that is more head-shaking that gut giggling, and a lot of the acting is bad or just forgettable.

58,estreet-eva,Another Sandler vacation movie,4,23 February 2016,"Adam Sandler thanks you for picking up the tab for his vacation to ""Africa"". Here's the story of a single Dad who works a job in retail, has 3 children and yet lives very well. Following the time- tested rom-com formula he meets a woman he initially despises and later falls for during a surreptitious vacation to ""Africa"". A few points: 1) You can tell this is an American film since most references to the trip name only the entire continent rather than one of the sixty-three countries and countless cities within it. Do fictional families in African films travel to ""North America?"" On a related topic, North and South America kind of all one connected land mass, why two continents? 2) Hollywood's anti-Dad agenda pervades the film. Sandler's single dad finds himself alone because of a sainted deal wife (Walt Disney's legacy endures) while Drew Barrymore's single mom is the result of the antics of her ex-husband (played convincingly by Joel McHale). Sandler's father has no parenting skills and generally lives up to the Homer Simpson-ian Hollywood ideal. 3) The attraction between these lovably opposite main characters is based on mutual need. Drew Barrymore's closet organizer character need is to loosen up. Yet each time she lets her guard down something bad actually does actually happen to her. As far as the film goes, it's the normal Sandlerian outing - he pees against a tent wall, makes some crude jokes but is careful given the number of African extras used in the badground, and pulls the regular guy driven nuts slow burn we all can now recognize from 1000 paces off. While slow at times particularly when the cast are clearly just out doing touristy sightseeing on the audience's dime, the film has at least one great joke - the rotating changing of the song playing on the soundtrack depending on whose point of view is watching an event play out; both clever and original. In short, if you enjoy the whole Sandler-on-vacation comedy series, you'll get a kick out of this but you might be disappointed if you'd rather your comedy leads to work for a living.",Blended

61,LloydBayer,"As a satirical take on 40-something parenting issues, Blended is occasionally funny but never original.",5,11 June 2014,"Nothing you say or do will deter Adam Sandler from making no-brainer Adam Sandler films. Blended follows suit after a string of lowbrow films from Sandler's lineup of Happy Madison titles. While the premise is still a no-brainer that is a fraction of what a romantic-comedy should be, it is more than tolerable with quite a few slapstick surprises aimed at young parents with stress levels going through the roof. Paired for the third time, Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore hit it off again, while regenerating that mushy charm from their previous outings in The Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates. Times have changed since those two films, so it is only fitting that they are now cast as single parents during the most crucial years of parenting. Sandler plays Jim, a widower with three young girls, while Barrymore plays Lauren, a single mother with two notorious boys. After a disastrous blind date, Jim and Lauren vow never to see each other again but a mix-up in holiday reservations bring them together at the beautiful Sun City resort in South Africa. What happens next is anyone's guess but the farce that ensues offers a few laughs even if these gags lack an iota of originality. Comprising of 70 percent Adam Sandler goofiness, 20 percent marketing for Sun City, and 10 percent romantic comedy, Blended turns out to be 100 percent family fun as long as kids don't take this film too seriously. That being said, I suspect kids these days are smarter than those characterised in this film. And they should be. Despite several jabs at early parenting (or bad parenting, in this case), the central message reiterates the fact that kids are growing up faster and smarter than they used to a generation ago. The repeated joke, of course, is aimed at parents who find themselves in awkward situations; typically, when kids reach puberty. For all other situations, Sandler's Jim has a remedial quip – ""You have to give 99 percent of your life to your kids and keep just 1 percent for yourself"". Easier said than done? Allow Jim to show you how it's done.Having first worked with Barrymore and Sandler in The Wedding Singer and the latter's top hit The Waterboy, director Frank Coraci opens another can of lampoon mayhem with Blended. Only this can is open on both ends. Out the top end is the aforementioned satirical take on 40-something parenting issues. Out the bottom end is a date-night movie for parents who have forgotten what it was like to go for a date-night movie. Lining that can is a high level of crude humour that has become a standard in Happy Madison films, but in a million ways more effective than allowing Seth McFarlane to be Seth McFarlane. What works here is the contribution from everyone including Wendi McLendon-Covey as Lauren's rubber-mouth business partner, Bella Thorn as Jim's eldest daughter who looks like a boy, Alyvia Alyn Lind as Lauren's toddler (with an uncanny resemblance to Barrymore in E.T the Extra-Terrestrial) and the show stealing Terry Crews in Sun City. For a film that I feared would be another Happy Madison wrecking ball, Blended is neither pulsating nor a flat liner. Even if the story is pretty lame, everyone just seems to be having fun and part of that fun radiates into the audience. And if you still find some of the jokes bland, take it with a pinch of salt and just blend in. Pun intended.",Blended
62,shawneofthedead,A technically bad film made tolerable and effective by its characters and the surprising depth of its emotional power.,6,8 June 2014,"Let's get one thing perfectly clear: Blended isn't a great movie. One would even be hard-pressed to call it a good one, given that it's largely constructed out of uneven gags, faintly sexist ideas and plain dumb comedy. If anything, it's a guilty pleasure: one of those films that are so bad that they end up being, perversely, enjoyable. But here's the really odd thing about Blended: it possesses a deep, truthful core of emotion, one so powerful that it not only elevates the entire film, but will hit you squarely in the heart if you let it.Jim (Adam Sandler) and Lauren (Drew Barrymore) first meet on a catastrophic blind date. He annoys her, she offends him, and they seem very much like a match made in hell rather than heaven. But, through a (rather contrived) narrative twist, the pair end up spending a week at an African resort with their families in tow - Jim with his three daughters, and Lauren with her two sons. As they ride ostriches and go para-sailing, they take care of each other's kids and slowly, surely fall in love.There are plenty of reasons to be put off by Blended. Its humour is frequently of the puerile, almost infantile variety - Barrymore is required to dribble French onion soup down her front, Sandler is pitched head-long into a wooden trough. The number of pratfalls and dumb stunts the lead actors must execute throughout the film can surely be construed as cruel and unusual punishment. There's even a kind of Greek (African, in this context) chorus led by Terry Crews (TV's Brooklyn Nine-Nine), popping up to sing about what's going on in the film - it starts out funny, but starts to grate after a while.The script also has an unmistakably sexist slant to it: Lauren doesn't know how to connect with her boys because she's not a dude, and Jim treats his blossoming princesses as guys because... well, he is a dude. Of course Lauren helps Jim's obviously not-ugly-at-all tomboy daughter Hilary (Bella Thorne) transform into a complete knockout, while Jim teaches Tyler (Kyle Red Silverstein) how to actually hit a baseball. It's a simplistic and reductive view of parenting, to say the least.But, if you're willing to go with the flow on the (many) weaker parts of the film, Blended might very well end up taking you on an unexpectedly emotional journey. The dynamics within both families, such as they are, are very well-developed: Jim's daughters, in particular, come across as very real young people. Jim's youngest daughter, the adorable, precocious Lou (Alyvia Alyn Lind), can't remember her mother at all, and so just yearns to have one - a reaction that stands in stark contrast to that of her middle sister Espn (Emma Fuhrmann), who tries her very hardest to keep her mother alive as an invisible friend. It's a touch manipulative, sure, but nevertheless touches on the devastating truth of grief and how it affects children born just a few years apart.There's something to be said, too, for the way in which Jim and Lauren wind up falling in love. It's nice that the typical romantic-comedy clichés of sex, farce and misunderstanding don't apply. Instead, they gain respect for each other as parents, first and foremost - which feels more realistic and credible, given where they both are in their lives. Children do change the dating game for their parents, and it's nice to see that factor into this budding relationship in the way it does.Of course, there's no denying the chemistry that exists between Sandler and Barrymore. It's served them well in their two previous collaborations - The Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates - and is present in full force throughout Blended. It's nice to see them back together again, building a relationship with unexpected maturity and depth. There's a little wish fulfilment going on by the end, sure, but the inevitable happy ending feels more hard-won and genuine than before.In short: don't go into Blended expecting a good film, much less a masterpiece. The script is too broad, too silly, and too predictable for that. But don't close your heart off to it, either. Because there's a lot of truth and a surprising reservoir of deep, powerful emotion lurking within its very flawed story.",Blended
63,jawneyfloros,a different type of rom com,10,12 November 2018,Review: I loved this movie because it shows that love can happen over time especially when it comes to meeting and bonding with future step children. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also.

64,troyputland,Best Sandler movie since Click?,7,1 August 2015,"Many years and many rubbish films later and Adam Sandler finally pulls an ace from the deck. Blended is the third time he's collaborated with Drew Barrymore. It's not as meaningful and poignant as 50 First Dates, but it is funny, no matter how stupid it gets. Sandler and Barrymore gel finely together. Their single-parent characters detest each other after a blind-date. Circumstances place them and their kids at the same holiday resort in South Africa, where they no choice but to mingle. Their kids are highly dysfunctional from the lack of a father/mother. Sandler's girls have boyish hair cuts and one of Barrymore's sons needs a heavy dose of Ritalin. They keep the cogs churning, adding strength to the plot: two families coming together. Sandler hasn't been this funny since 2006's Click. Bend that with Barrymore's sass and you've got yourselves a sweet, belly-aching treat. Unfortunately Terry Crews is wasted in a long, drawn-out gag that sparks tedium after the third round. On the plus side, this is the only negative spot.",Blended

Adam plays Jim a father of three who lost his wife to cancer and raising his girls the best he can despite dressing them like Boys. Drew Barrymore plays Lauren a mother of two boys who is getting back into the dating game after her husband mark cheated on her. I will admit that one of the things that I loved about the film was the beautiful African scenery which looked like a rather exotic paradise. Supporting roles include include terry crews in a rather hilarious African accent and hairstyle, Wendi mccloven as Gail.

67,nicolechan916,"A pretty standard romcom, but had a lot of funny moments.",6,19 June 2014,"The overall storyline for this film was pretty standard for a romantic comedy, with many predictable parts. It also followed standard Adam Sandler films, in that there were weird elements and his acting was pretty much the same throughout. I mean, if you've seen his other films it seems like his characters are all the same. And he usually makes a lot of sick jokes in his other films too, but he didn't in this so that's a plus (maybe because he didn't direct/write this film).What really saved this film was the fresh comedy. There were still a lot of cliché moments, but there were numerous scenes in which had the audience laughing really loud. This one scene just made the whole movie for me. I was slapping my knees and was doubled over with laughter.The acting was also not half bad. Honestly though, it seemed to me that the children were better actors than the main couple. Bella Thorne was hilarious in that one scene, I think I almost had tears from laughing too hard. Drew Barrymore was pretty all right until it got to the end where she was para-sailing and while up there her voice sounded pretty irritating, in the 'damsel in distress' way. I mean she was a strong independent woman before, why did she have to suddenly turn into this Hollywood type of woman who depends on the man for everything?That scene just peeved me off. Plus, quite a lot of scenes made me hang my head and go 'oh god' and kind of cringe from the cheesiness. And the ending was predictable so, no surprise there.To find out which scene made me laugh so hard, and to read the full review, go to: championangels.wordpress.com",Blended

They meet and hate each other, until they come across 7 tickets to Africa. They then spend their vacation bonding as antics ensue.-As far as Sandler goes, it is not his worst film. Doesn't make it good though.-The story is eh with a side of cliché and predictability.-The film does have a good, but predictable pace to it.-The acting is somewhat below par. Sandler was not terrible though. Terry whatisface from the Old Spice commercials is in it. He's pretty funny.-As far as the characters go, they are mostly cheesy and over-the-top.-The music is pretty fun and fitting.-The film itself is not that funny though. It did pull out some entertainment value and got better as it went along, it was not that good.-It is rated PG-13 for some language and adult humor.-So Blended was not terrible and did have some redeeming elements, but overall its characters, humor, story, and the presence Adam Sandler make it not worth watching. 6/10.",Blended

This is not a comedy in any way. It is silly, boring and overall a complete waste of time and why anyone would cast Drew Barrymore in anything is completely beyond me. I remember seeing her in ""Music and Lyrics"" where she completely ruined the comedy part as well. Adam Sandler did not in any way manage to help this so called comedy.

72,cnycitylady,A solid movie for Sandler,6,1 June 2014,"Barrymore and Sandler are back! Their new movie Blended puts them at odds as two single parents who detest each other after a blind date gone horribly wrong. Now this sounds like it can be just as sweet as the couple's previous romps on screen, but instead this one goes more for comedy than romance, and I'm not sure the balance was there.You see throughout the movie tidbits of the flare that made their pairing so successful in the first place; a perfectly timed laugh, a glance at just the right moment held for just the proper amount of time. But right when you smile at the easy chemistry and funny banter something stupid-- in the way that only an Adam Sandler comedy can-- happens. The moments are always interrupted by some kind of African chorus, or a blatant joke by some minor character that takes away from the humor of the situation. The script and story distracts you from itself and you miss a lot of sweet moments that are ruined or could have happened. It's like the film slaps you in the face right as you're about to settle into falling in love with them all over again.But on the positive side you will be rolling in the aisles at the film's best scenes. Sandler wasn't always bad at comedy, and re-teamed with Barrymore he has his shining moments. The very familial tone that this movie takes is warm and mightily Brady Bunch (in the least cheesy way possible.) 'Blended' is for fans of Drew and Adam because if you're not then you won't get some subtle homages and easter eggs to their previous two movies.So this movie isn't 'The Wedding Singer' wonderful, but at least it's not 'Jack and Jill' terrible.

Sure, but the chemistry between Sandler and Berrymore is kind of undeniable.The opening scene sets the tone with a blind date going terribly badly for the main characters. As fate would have it they end up in Africa together and the story goes. I personally find the little one line jokes of Sandler to be the most entertaining. Berrymore has some OK ones that I chuckled at as well, and the 5 kids all do there part and add intrigue to the story.It won't win awards and it won't be liked by a few, but I thought it was a decent rom-com that had enough laughs to keep me interested and recommend it.",Blended

76,eve_dolluk,Sligjtly contrived but fun and cute lightweight romcom,6,3 February 2015,Well I wasn't expecting much from this film but on the whole it was a decent enough watch. The premise is slightly contrived but hey it could happen....After a bad blind date Sandler and Barrymore find themselves sharing a hotel room on an African safari holiday with their kids Iin tow. Barrymore has 2 boys and Sandler has 3 girls. The dynamics of the film deal with being a single parent and in this case the gender difference between parent and sibling... like I said its all a bit contrived and stereotypical !! The good news is the nice African scenery and if you like Adam Sandler then it has all the Happy Madison cameos and humour although this film has far less toilet humour than other Sandler films. Terry Crews has a fun little part also which provides a disconnect from something that could mean the film takes itself too seriously. Also kudos to the child actors here as they are actually pretty good and don't leave you squirming at a poor performance. Overall its a nice Blend ( no pun intended ) of Sandler humour and romance with a message of family values so as long as you like something sugar coated and a little bit sickly then you should enjoy this. Im in the middle on this but they clearly made a decent effort all round and shot in Africa so ill give it an above average 6. Those that love this sort of genre would probably give it an 8 or so !!,Blended

79,YJLcool,"An enjoyable, entertaining, fun, relaxing, heartwarming romantic comedy",7,22 June 2014,"After recent flops like Grown Ups 2, That's My Boy or Jack and Jill, I'm not actually looking forward to watch Sandler's new romantic comedy film, Blended. His previous films were awful, annoying and dumb. But I was surprised. Blended turned out to be a fun, entertaining, exciting, happy and relaxing film for family, friends or even couples to enjoy.Once again, Sandler pairs himself with Barrymore after 50 First Dates or The Wedding Singer. The story is about a widowed dad of three girls, who's still trying to move on after the loss of his beloved wife and a divorced mother of two boys, who's still trying to cope with her divorce with a cheating, irresponsible husband, swore not to see each other again after a disastrous blind date. However, they both ended up together in a trip to a luxurious African resort with a jungle safari. Their holiday 'just happens' to be during the resort's annual 'familymoon' event, which is aimed for building romantic opportunities for grown-ups while keeping their kids occupied. Before saying anything further, I believe that we all know how the story goes and how it's going to end. This is another one of those clearly formulaic plots in the romantic comedy genre. Then why we should watch this, you ask? Because I think there's always something comforting about watching these formulaic romantic comedies. It's not the destination, but the journey that matters in the end. The film starts by taking time to let the audience learn to get to know the characters well, by showing their own personal issues. It touches on the emotional core of the characters and makes the characters relatable through the bond they share in the film. Sandler and Barrymore are a likable, charming couple which convinces the audience to be emotionally invested in them. It is immensely appealing and engaging to see how their relationship eventually develops and trust each other, relate to each other's kids and solve their kids' personal issues.As usual with many Sandler films, the crude humour still present and certainly capable of generating a few laughs here and there with its jokes and occasional silliness. Terry Crews (the black muscle guy who just loves to move his muscle pecs) steals the show as the leading lounge singer at the African resort. The African holiday resort in this film is simply fantastic as well. While I do agree it's not one of the greatest film ever made, but it certainly succeeds as a simple, enjoyable, fun romantic comedy that's filled with sweet heartwarming moments.http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/06/ Rating:7.5/10",Blended

But it is not a CGI fest, for 'Jack and Jill'.It really helps they filmed in South Africa with REAL animals. What I also like was the fact that neither Jim (Adam Sandler), nor Lauren ( Drew Barrymore) were either stupid nor perfect. A key point was when Jim told Lauren that the kids take up 99% of the time, leaving 1% for you."" Another nice twist was he had 3 girls and she had two boys, (he was a widower and she was a divorcée), and to be honest, neither one really understood how to best raise children of the opposite sex ( especially Jim with the oldest daughter ( had no idea how to dress and even wear hair). Of the two of them, I think it is Lauren who had the bigger issues, because she had an ex who was acted like a child and did not face up to responsibilities with the boys. She also did not allow herself to have any fun in life. She was basically too organized in life. The vacation allowed her to have fun and laugh. Spoilers Ahead my favorite scene was the scene where she is hand gliding and she sees the giraffes and elephants from the air, and where she is singling to his youngest daughter. I also liked the final scene where her son who is awful @ baseball, gets a hit, because Jim ( who was teaching him), shows up with the girls ( something his own father would not do). Of course, Jim and Lauren kiss and will be together at the end. What I really like is neither one are better then the other ( She cleans carpets he works @ Dick's Sporting Goods), but together, they will be be happy and more successful couple, he can handle boys, and she can handle girls, and they will even have a little extra time for each other.

Factor in a horrible blind date and a set of circumstances that sees both of them and their families on vacation in South Africa and you've got some really funny, touching, cute and hilarious moments.I have an 8 year old and it's suitable for her, any sexual innuendo type jokes go right over her head anyway.This is a return to some A grade comedy from Sandler and is easily going to be in profit just from a couple of weeks of its USA release, so it's going to be a money maker overseas.But again, if you have never liked an Adam Sandler movie then I really don't understand why you would bother to review this because it's likely you're going to hate this movie.If you're on the fence because of Grown Ups 2, please reserve judgment and go see this movie - it's a cute date night movie because it's not so romantic that you'll be uncomfortable on a blind date yourself!

ANY parent, single or not can relate to a lot of the situations that arise.The comedy is just right, without being slapstick or over the top. The touching moments come sometimes when you least expect them, and while sure to bring a tear, the movie doesn't milk the drama. The scenery is gorgeous. The one-liners and timing are perfect. For me, the film never dragged, and while it has an optimistic ending, everything isn't all sewn up in a happily-ever-after-scenario. We know that, if these were real families, there would be more bumps in the road, more laughs and more lessons to be learned.This is a good family movie--not much to cover your kids' ears over--and a great movie for anyone who has been a parent, and especially anyone who has tried to enter the dating/new relationship stage after the death or divorce of a spouse.Go see it!!",Blended

Here is Blended. It is a fun movie and forgettable movie, Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore work up a good chemistry and prove they are nothing short of veterans for genres like this.
It is just that the over usage of feel goodness and non reality moments which just brought down the overall quality of content this movie could deliver.
Just another romcom with some scenes probably shot in Africa where most of the comic relief happens. 10/10 I will forget the movie name the next month.

94,Remy_Azhary,Perfect family movie in a long whileand a wonderful vacation movie!,9,9 December 2015,"I must admit that I'm not really into family movies but more of adult-oriented ones. By that, I meant dramas, thrillers, etc; not the x-rated ones.Anyway, it's been a long while since I saw any of those family movies. A very long time indeed. It's primarily because maybe it's my own foolish sensibility that told me by watching those movies would make me less of an adult. And that goes without saying that I'd avoid all types of family-oriented movies like animations or cartoons or ""kids' stuff"" as I'd call them.But BLENDED looked and felt accessible enough that I love it so much. It was shown on cable TV and there was nothing else interesting that was within my ""constricted interest"" that was any good. And so I decided, BLENDED it was then; on HBO Family no less.And I love it.Even the African vacation that both Barrymore's and Sadler's families went to felt really genuinely good. Even better than the 2009 COUPLE'S RETREAT. I was utterly disappointed by that one.For a long time I'd been wanting to see a movie about people going on vacations to some exotic locales but most of them usually were bad, even the 1986 CLUB PARADISE was somewhat a let-down. But Sadler somehow had this magical touch to family vacation films, and comedies at that too. Just like his 2011 JUST GO WITH IT. That, too, was accessible and I actually watched it in the theater. And I loved it.So ultimately I suppose I'd become a believer in family films once more. I just had to wisely choose which ones are more suited to my taste and go lightly with them first.And BLENDED is a perfect movie that I don't mind watching again and again. Even the characters were fun-loving too.",Blended

Again, Adam and Drew work well together and have good chemistry.Having said all of that, this is predictable from the start. You know how it's going to unfold from the start, through every bit of the story, right through to the finish.If you can get past that and it doesn't bother you, then watch it- it's an OK movie.I should add, the scenery is amazing, especially during the South Africa scenes....",Blended

I have now watched BLENDED for the umpteenth time with my wife
Whith each viewing we have grown to love this show more and more
There is a AWESOME magic watching these two actors working together
It's like honey and cream blended together to make each movie they appear in together a genuinely wonderful show
The Wedding Singer
50 First Dates
Love them all
They both have great talents and bring to life all the shows they appear in
There are one or two that are duds but overall all the shows have seen them ether together or separately have been good but then I do have my favourites
Ever after
Click
Mr Deeds

50 first dates
The water boy
Never been kissed
All great performances
Contrary to what the critics say BLENDED is a movie that has charm and grace to it One can relate very much to the characters and the situation It is comparable with LIAR LIAR and CLICK dealing with family relationships and the effect it has on children The electrifying connection between Sandler and Barrymore still is there This is their third bout together and in all three films they are brilliant We all love this show Drew Barrymore has this innocent personality about her that is enchanting and can be found in all her movies and Sandler who is well know for his crass and crude comments and actions comes through as a real gentleman this time It is a fun movie and although some of the scenes are more adult related it is still within the bounds of family fun",Blended

I'm an adult and was really elevated after seeing his film. There's a laugh on every page and all of the acting was great. It doesn't matter that a lot of his films have a similar structure. He delivers most of the time.Movies are a vehicle to escape the real world. Who wound't want to be part of that family and have it resolve the way it did? It really gave me a nice break from my reality. Drew Barrymore and Sandler always have great chemistry. The music was perfect. The cinematography made me want to travel to Africa! It's always nice to see Sandler cast his friend of many years in movie after movie. It's evident, he is a loyal guy. I didn't expect to like this film that much, but really enjoyed it. It's a simple premise, but Adam Sandler is a one of a kind. He is unique. Bravo.",Blended

100,Jac23443,Garbage... This is the last Straw!!,1,30 August 2014,"There is no possible way that this movie could have seriously been in Theaters or actually even consider calling itself a movie. This was a joke, not a single character played a convincing or necessary role in the movie, Drew Barrymore's performance looked like a little girl trying to keep herself from laughing, all of the children were incredibly annoying, I would much rather this have been a horror movie, where each person would eventually get picked off, at least then I would have something to look forward to (Harsh I know but this movie was that bad, if not worse). Adam Sandler is a washed up has-been who keeps ending up on the big screen for who knows what reason? The only actress that gave a decent performance in this ridiculously jumbled mess was the mother from the well acted Goldbergs television series. I could not finish this Youtube skit, because of how terribly it was acted, shot, scripted, scored, and executed. This had to have been written by children, no possible way this came from the minds of adults. The story seemed to have no direction except to put these two ineptly AWKWARD main leads in similar situations to have them spit on each other's past sorrows before making them realize how similar they truly are. This is poor directing in my opinion, and a complete waste of time and money. I wouldn't recommend this painful movie to anyone. This was a joke and I hope one day people start realizing just how much money they spend on garbage like this, wake up, walk out on the movie, and have the balls to ask for their money back. Money is hard enough to make to be spending $14 for a ticket for something like this... you wouldn't throw money away to watch your garbage get incinerated, would you? So why would you waste money to watch this?????",Blended

Two families, both reeling from the loss of their significant others. Both single parents struggling to give their children a good life, despite it all.I lost it with the silliness after they went abroad. Really, a band that follows you throughout your vacation? A concierge that is with you at all times as well?? Ridiculous! If they had left all that out, the movie would have been wonderful.

The story was great considering there are only so many outcomes to these types of romantic comedies, even though I knew where it was going I had a wonderful time getting there. It's the journey that counts and this movie has it all. More Sandler and Barrymore! They complement each other so well. Must see 9/10. The music was sprinkled in just right, and the punchlines kept catching me off guard, leaving my funny bone exposed the whole time. I am really hoping for a part 2 for this movie. Grown-ups 2 was: ehh-funny. How about 50 First weddings or just 50 first dates 2? Anyway, they need to give this story another go! There's only so much I can say without including spoilers. I've always loved Sandlers movies but I was truly skeptical about this one, not sure why. I gave it a shot and I am beyond pleased and satisfied.

The boy Tyler has good character development too with him improving as a hitter. The movie had good drama. And Drew is still a great actress
Now the bad, it was supposed to have humor, but I think i laughed ONCE!!! And it was of course at something Espn did, MVP of the movie in my book. Shaq was dreadful here. He was really bad at fake crying and I joked that he should think about missing a game losing free throw in the last game of the NBA finals to teach him about crying. The older boy's whole character was not at funny, just creepy and finally Adam isn't funny either.So due to the drama and Espn's Character I give it a 5.",Blended

Very funny movie with a great exotic setting in South Africa! The movie is basically about ""Jim"" played by Sandler who lost his wife to cancer and has three daughters, while ""Lauren"" played by Barrymore has two sons and is going though a bitter break-up with her husband ""Mark"" played by Joel McHale.Both ""Jim"" and ""Lauren"" are having difficult times moving on from their past relationships and hesitate to give their love a chance to blossom. ""Doug"" played by Shaquille O' Neal who is ""Jim's"" (Sandler) co-worker at Dick's Sporting Goods tries to encourage him to go on a few dates to try and help him get over the tragic loss of his wife. ""Jim"" and ""Lauren"" go on a blind date to Hooters which ends-up backfiring at first but makes for a great two-family much needed vacation to South Africa after ""Jim's"" (Sandler) Boss and ""Lauren's friend ""Jen"" played by Wendi McLendon-Covey can't make the trip! Very exotic, wouldn't you say? The families have a hard time getting along at first, but after a while on their exotic trip decide to forget war and ""make love!""

I guess they didnt see each other on the airline, where they would have been seated next to each other, or the 2 hours at the airport. Lets not forget that both parents and all 5 kids would have needed counterfeit ID and passports to pull off the identify switch.A ton of unnecessary wildlife footage is inserted, but it does save us from the the script.Terry crews keeps making appearances as a singing hotel staff member, but speaks with a jamaican accent. Maybe hes hurting for money, and needed the work.Theres the ""out of gas scene"", and appearance of exhusband, and a bunch more i could complain about, but ill spare you.Glad i picked up at the library for free.

It's like the magazines that women can't resist on the checkout counter at the grocery store, Sandler is my kryptonite. Cheesy, predictable, romantic, funny - it sucks me in. This movie had even more gravity in my current circumstance, it is probably not a movie I would have ever picked up before 2018. Now going on eight months post-divorce, the realities of life and the day-to-day seem to be catching up with me. Single again with three kids in tow half of the time, you have to find things to do with the rest of the time.Goofy jokes and unlikely coincidences aside, there were some redeeming parts of the movie that I connected with. As a single parent, the idea that now my kids got 100% of my time resonated with me. Having them half of the time, I want to spend every possible moment with them making memories, being there for them, being a good dad. In the movie, Lauren and Jim correct the statement that the kids need 99% of your time, and as a parent we are allowed to have 1% for ourselves.""Blended"" as a movie was not very good, but the sappiness, the relationships, the escapism, and ultimately, the message made up for its flaws.

Was it Adam Sandlers most comedic movie. No, but haters will be haters. It is so easy to look and highlight all the negative components, but this was an incredible movie that highlighted the fact that for life to be great, there must be two sides to the coin, a positive and negative, the yin and the Yan. What a great movie and a clever named show of blended. Harmony comes from the blending of our goals, thoughts and live rather than the preconceived ideas we are taught or are in grown by society. Adam and Drew created that perfect harmony that shows that we believe we need, or we think our kids need is not real. That we must learn to give and create opportunities that allow us to be us.

Just like most comedies of more recent times, they try too hard to be funny and end up being cringeworthy instead. I only laughed out loud once and I can't even remember why now.

This ones awful, like the others, he'll do anything for a dime. Here's the story of the well known actress. She made a career out of having a famous name. But she's working with Adam Sandler, so you know its lame. A pile of crap, a pile of crap, that's hoooow they produce a pile of crap. Here's the story he has three daughters. She has two sons. (What a novel twist, its what makes the story telling fabulous!) They have a terrible first date because the Adam Sandler character is a jerk. (What a stretch for Sandler going entirely with type.) Then they meet up again on a vacation to Africa. (Why Africa? Because Sandler wants to take his family on vacation and he wants you to pay for it. Plus he did every fart and poop joke a thousand times, and now he's innovating. He's doing wild animal fart and poop jokes, Quite the creative genius, that Sandler.) The problem here is like every Sandler movie: Its only funny enough to entertain a Lemur (Oh another reason to film in Africa.) And Sandler's ego. His every expression all the time is ""Ain't I adorable and don't you just love me?"" ""I am just so cute!"" The problem is the studios only release so many ""comedies"" per year. If Sandler makes one of his ego trips, that's one less comedy that gets made. Then Seth Rogan makes two stoner comedies and you can see that there's not much room for comedy for adults. Then the studios make a half dozen ""romantic comedies"" that aren't really comedies at all, just romance novels put on the screen. Its sad for people who like good comedy. I blame the critics and the awards. No one gives an award for comedy. Good comedy is not recognized and rewarded.

A lot of people dislike Sandler, but I think he's the comedic genius of our generation. He's currently the only one that can blend hilarious comedy with tear jerking premises to give a nice blend of happiness and sadness. Sure, he has his slapstick comedies like Happy Gilmore, Waterboy, Billy Madison, etc; but he truly shines in these 'more than meets the eye' comedies like Big Daddy, Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates, etc. Reminds me of the beautiful comedies of yesteryear like Father of the Bride. 9/10 stars.

I saw the rating climb steadily and saw the movie first chance I had. I was entertained. Many funny scenes and that quirkiness Sandler can deliver so well. Not much boring formula romance thankfully. I want comedy and I got it. Sandler also has a gift for capturing authentic family relationships but doesn't leave me snoring with preachy predictable sappy long romantic interaction.

You could bypass the first half hour of the film with no real problem. Not to mention that the characters are really, really, badly written.

Nothing happens here that you haven't seen in a million other Sandler films. And moreover, it is near enough a carbon copy of Just Go With It, released only a few years ago.Plenty of the jokes are just re-runs of Sandler's normal toilet humour that was funny circa 1996, but it's just very tired and old now, and he can't expect the audience to be affected in the same way as they were in his earlier stuff like Happy Gilmore.That said, this never felt like a film where any of the actors, and indeed the director, cared whether they were producing a good film.

All of his trademark goofball gags are present, yet Sandler brings a stronger sense of maturity that works to his advantage in this heartfelt family flick. I can understand that wacky comedy isn't for everyone, but seriously, some people are obviously taking this movie way too seriously. Every joke in the film is in good taste and some of the gags could even be considered adorable. Maybe the critics just lost their sense of humor or couldn't appreciate Terry Crews' flamboyant musical dance numbers, because this movie's way better than the ratings suggest!Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore reunite for the third time, bringing out the best in each other and proving they're two names in comedy that shouldn't yet be forgotten. Their romantic chemistry couldn't feel more genuine and their comedic timing is always on key, bringing on the laughs like a drunken hyena. Combine this with their realistic dramatic approach to the beautiful and lonely life of single parenting and you've got yourself one heartfelt movie about family and adulthood.Blended might not be the most original or groundbreaking flick, but it includes just enough heartwarming moments and hilarious gags to make it a near-perfect outing for the entire family.

It's still a fantastic movie to watch even with silly, but clever lines.This movie, however, is absolute dreck because the writing is infantile. The actors did what they could but the characters were absolutely unlikeable. The young actors were awful as well.The entire trip to Sun City is so embarrassing, I switched the channel after the basketball court scene with the teen daughter and the African men singing or whatever onto the court.Thank goodness this was was broadcast on tv vs going to the theater so never spent a dime.Avoid.",Blended
129,nintendogs03,Adam & Drew did it again!,9,2 January 2015,"The Wedding Singer, 50 First Dates, how could you not love them? What makes a movie enjoyable is the chemistry costars have. Adam and Drew got that right! It starts out as a blind date gone wrong (i think many of us have gone through something similar) and somehow, they meet again. Again. This time, their characters brought kids! There were many moments where my family and I laughed for minutes straight and many that make us feel sympathetic for these characters. The point of this movie is to make viewers feel good and it has succeeded. Adam, Drew, and the rest of the cast seemed excited and dedicated to be a part of this movie and their performances show that they could do a kick-butt film.",Blended
130,bsbulldogs,Blended down the bottom of the barrel,1,27 November 2016,"After watching this movie, I thought any wonder Adam Sandler is stuck mostly doing Netflix films. He has given us some beauties in Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and The Waterboy but I think this one has to be among his worst. As soon as this film started, I could feel that it was going to be a doozy. A lot of people will just give up and not bother watching the rest of it. I am not one of those people but about 45 minutes into it, the thought did cross my mind. The film lacks a lot of things, such as no plot, hardly any humour, and forced acting. The humour in this is forced and I think at some stages, you could tell that the actors looked uncomfortable in delivering the lines. I'm looking at you, Drew Barrymore. One reason that the humour could be forced is that it seems to be aimed towards younger people. One thing this film did prove is third time is not the charm in the Sandler-Barrymore partnership, and after this, I am not looking forward to a fourth installment.Essentially, the film is about a guy who has kids and a girl who has kids and they have a chance meeting at an African resort and nothing much else seems to happen after that. Terry Crews and Shaquille O'Neal, who both cameo don't add anything to an already terrible excuse of a comedy. One more gripe I have is that the word ""Blended"" is used so much that the turkey is practically overcooked by the time that word is said more than twice. As if the viewing audience didn't already know the title of the movie, we have to get it shoved down our throats.",Blended
131,terrsgc,A good romantic comedy,8,21 June 2014,"This was a decent enough romantic comedy. I enjoyed it very much. And, while it was predictable enough that you could tell where it was going, it was fresh enough to make watching how it gets there enjoyable, with a few surprises. I prefer Adam Sandler in his later stuff like this one, Bedtime Stories, and Just Go With it over his earlier stuff.For parents: The target audience seems to be families. I see very little for any parents to find objectionable in this movie. It doesn't promote any values I find objectionable. Some parents might worry about one scene regarding a swimsuit model centerfold and a 12 year old boy, but I find it tame enough. Most of the sexual implications are fairly indirect.",Blended

To my horror, this one was even worse.Most international viewers will not know who Leon Schuster is, but many of his comedy films are actually filmed at the Sun City resort, and it was evident that the Sandler clan borrowed some of the toilet humor they displayed in this epic flop and made it even worse. People crashing into Rhino horns and farting in public is such typical slapstick South African humor, however this poor attempt did not even come remotely close to the sometimes funny Leon Schuster type slapstick. Sun City is a grotesque and Tacky place, a small version of Las Vegas in a rural part of South Africa. This film falls right into the trap. Tacky, grotesque and really boring. The only thing you get from a visit to Sun City is a hangover, and this film made me feel like I have been binging for two days in the tacky nightclubs of Sun City...Avoid it at all cost.",Blended

Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore work so well together. The humor of some of their scenes were classic. Like when they are vacationing in Africa and the hot air balloon ride. The type of humor that is ageless and what I've grown to expect some Sandler. I think this movie may be a slow riser. But will be one of those comedies that become classic to its genre. It seems to be aimed at a younger audience but all ages would enjoy the antics and humorous banter between Sandler and Barrymore's characters. But I have always been a fan of both. The name is definitely perfect, as you see these two families come together and help each other and their children. It's a nice to see.

Most of his last movies with the exception of that's my boy were horrible. Even Adam admitted he made this movie to be on vacation :) $40 million dollar budget and made exactly that back. No profit in almost a month. This movie had maybe 2 funny parts and not enough to laugh. Those of you saying you laughed so hard edge of your seat comedy were stoned and watching another movie.

Stubbornly suburban, vaguely sexist, more like sketch comedy lacking a finely crafted story arc, and definitely an unashamedly traditionalist pro-family view of ""boys need dads and girls need moms."" So that's Sandler's POV. You can go to the art house to see witty, urbane and progressive films (and we do) or to the multiplex to see the endless parade of horror, action, YA and/or comic book dumb dumb fare.

That is just what is achieved in Blended. The story is OK and provides the setting and situations for the laughs. Drew Barrymore is great, of course, and she and Adam Sandler make really good and comfortable leads together.The supporting actors were good too, Terry Crews is over the top but very funny, Wendi McLendon-Covey is great as Drew's friend, Jessica Lowe as Ginger is hilarious and likable, and as Sandler's oldest daughter, Bella Thorne is excellent and a beautiful young woman. I can see Bella being a big name in the next few years.There are a few stupid bits, but overall this is an enjoyable couple of hours with some good laughs and likable characters.

There are not too many twists and turns thrown to try and may the film something it's not - the direction stay focused on what the film is - a good solid ""rom com"".Kevin Nealon (Eddy) character is great and other good supporting roles from Terry Crews and Abdoulaye NGom.

149,thejasvi,Finally a good Sandler film!,8,15 August 2014,"So, I loved, repeat loved Happy Gilmore, Waterboy, The Wedding Singer, Big Daddy, Mr. Deeds, 50 First Dates and even Little Nicky, I watched them repeatedly.. I also love Punch Drunk Love, Reign Over Me and You Don't Mess With the Zohan, a politically charged melodrama for all times.. the fact is, I would watch Grandma's Boy over and over again, I felt this was a brand of comedy and drama that would never disappoint me.. and I would convince myself Jack and Jill was just a misstep and The Grown Up films were merely accidents amongst many others in recent times, but when I saw the trailer for Blended, I had had enough, I just didn't trust the Happy Madison ""brand"" anymore, despite it being Barrymore and Sandler back together again.. I didn't care. last night I saw a review similar to the one I'm about to post, and seeking a fun romantic comedy and having seen virtually every other kind of film available to VOD, I decided to give Blended a hesitant try, and thankfully I was not disappointed at all. Like the review I read, I agree, this film has been very poorly marketed, it went for the cheap gags rather than get across the sweet side of things and how it is a decent family film with a restrained adult cheeky side to it. This to me is the Grown Up side of Sandler more than those genuinely awful films with the same moniker. The production value of the film is completely amazing for $40million, I was kinda blown away, I don't know how much of that was to do with Julio Macat and his team for their stunning Cinematography or what, but the film looks and feels stunning. I can't lie, sometimes I just want to watch a film with amazing locations, good looking people, and a nice storyline with a good sense of humor. I love indie and experimental films, I love film full stop, but I genuinely feel sorry for people that can't watch a film like this and just let go for two hours. ""oh it's an Adam Sandler film, i'm going to be dumber by the end of it"" or ""this has a happy ending, it has no basis for the harsh reality that is life"" or probably the worst thing i've heard about this film ""it depicts Africa and African people as the typical stereotypes one would expect from such a crass film""..to all and any of those that shared these sentiments.. as I said I feel sorry that life is so serious for you.. how about you go watch some indie festival darling of a film that represents every other culture to be repressed and full of pathos.. there is nothing obscene about this film, it's a fantasy, it's a film.. two families go to another country outside of the trappings of their usual life, and only then are they able to discover each other and themselves.. simple as that.. I admit it's fairly simplistic in the view that a Father and Mother are only able to fulfill certain roles in parenthood.. there is absolutely no reason why a single father can't buy Tampons, and a single mother understand their son's desire to hide a centerfold.. but this is a comedy, it's not a documentary or some hard boiled drama that is meant to enlighten a human being that is unable to be enlightened enough through their own real life and expect as much through two hours of a piece of fiction. A really nice film, that to me meets the promise of what the Happy Madison brand aimed to deliver, silly humor that lets you laugh like a man child that doesn't know how to clean up after themselves, wrapped up in a nice warm clean blanket of happiness and joy. Blended has restored my faith in Sandler! Him and Barrymore have delivered once again.. and repeat praise for Julio Macat, this was one of the best looking films I've seen in ages.. people think it's easy to make a big budget film look good, I really don't believe it is, if anything I think Indie films are easy to DP and make look good/dramatic/moody, but this film just had such an awesome feel and tone to it, it genuinely blew me away, complete masterpiece of cinematography in my opinion! I just know people will pass it off, because it's not some epic drama, but every frame just sang to me.",Blended

I can only assume the few people that just claimed it was crap, have not seen it and are putting in bad ratings to bring the overall down.This movie will have any normal person laughing pretty much constantly for the first hour. While it does have the predictable ""RomCom"" feel to it, it's a fresh take on some of the humor, and a chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore that is classic since Wedding Singer.It's not an award winner, but the humor is plentiful, the kids are cute, and the ending is happy.

Most of the time I cringe at his films but I thought that Adam and Drew Barrymore had a good on screen chemistry, their good at playing the visual slapstick, exaggeratedly over the top/hyper single parents. I'd heard this was quite good, the 2nd film to feature Adam and Drew as the two main leads since '50 First Dates' which I also thought wasn't too bad.Its an easy watch, pretty basic comedy as you might expect. The comedy is pretty zany and there's definitely a, as I say, hyperactive element to it. Its hardly greatly memorable but as an easy piece of cheap entertainment, its not awful. I thought it was surprisingly watchable and so I'm going for a 4 star rate, although I realise that it won't appeal to everyone. If you like the sound of this film and are ok with somewhat zany, exaggerated characters, a bit of cheese and basic visual comedy then I'd recommend this.",Blended

It was funny, of course, but sweet to see their transition from hating each other and not really giving each other a chance to letting each other balance them out a little and start taking risks. It really sends a great message about parenting, and blended families, and giving people a chance. I love that their happy ending wasn't just the 1% for what they want but also the 99% for their kids as well.

Sadly you likely see a pattern emerging there and that is the problem this movie is simply decent. One reason could be that it is less centered on Sandler's charter Jim and rather the family as a whole allowing the comedy that made Sandler famous to come through rather than the toilet humor that is sinking him. Drew Barrymore while a good fit for Sandler is sadly not much better here she does the best whit what little she has to work with and keeps some cohesion in actually forming a narrative and heaving the family work as more than just a lot of disconnected people to make jokes about as does the rest of the cast. The kids are even pretty well directed and acted in this and made to look like... well actual kids rather than just an annoying setup or punchline of some joke.All in all if you catch this in theaters you are not likely to be raving about it or quoting it before it just fades from memory as something you wish you had just rented rather than pay $10 a head to see but at least you will not be running to get a refund 45 minutes in.",Blended

171,Kjvm5757,Adam Sandler does it again,1,14 September 2014,"I didn't have high expectations for this film since i knew Adam Sandler was one the WORST actors ever, but this movie still managed to shock me by how bad it is. First of all the bland, generic, interchangeable characters that contribute nothing to the ""plot"". No of the characters that get thrown at us have ANY redeeming qualities and get 0 character development. The movie just expects us to like the moronic characters even if there is nothing good about them. This movie uses a child hitting his head into a wall as ""comedy"" why is child abuse funny? Did one of the writers just suddenly think that a child in pain is funny? No one in the crowded theatre laughed once. This movie is abysmal and is just a lazy half assed performance by all of the actors. Especially Adam Sandler who is the most lazy and most overpaid actor. I seriously wish Adam would just retire from making crap movies like this one.",Blended
172,jackknife-63072,Really?,1,7 April 2019,I do genuinely like some of Sandler's films. But this is a new low. I'm convinced Sandler has it in his contract to only makes movies set in places he wants to vacation in. This is a by the numbers Sandler film and not in a good way. The premise of this movie is tenuous at best. Sandler feels like he's phoning in his performance and the jokes are really tired and lame. There is even a Steve Buscemi look a like in one scene probably because Steve read the script and did a hard pass. Terry Crews is the only bright spot in the film. Watch with your kids or if no kids don't even bother.,Blended

175,rainmanrey,This was NOT good,3,11 November 2014,"I like rom-coms. I know the stories don't change much, I really don't expect them to. Rom-coms require two parts, romantic and comedy. As far as romance, the chemistry between these two has been diluted; I just don't buy it anymore. It was a sweet enough idea with two single parents finding each other, making a Brady's Bunch. Really though? The comedy part... What was with EVERYONE calling Sandler's kid a boy?? She did not look anything like a boy and no one would have been making that mistake, least not everyone. The acceptance of the children and even the acceptance of the parents to parent the other's kids was unbelievable. The worst of it was cheap humor and one-liners; it was all poorly executed. This story could have been good; it had enough of an original idea to take us through the timeless tale, too bad it fell incredibly short.",Blended

179,nick-kohn1,Loved it. The best Adam Sandler film yet.,9,13 June 2014,"Going into the movie, I predicted that this was going to be another simple Adam Sandler movie where the jokes are OK and there's really nothing interesting throughout the whole movie. The trailer to this movie did not look very convincing. However, I was very surprised with the beautiful landscapes of the movie, the touching story and the absolute best jokes I've ever heard in any Adam Sandler movie. If you are a Happy Madisson fan, then this is really your movie. People argue, that Sandler plays the same role over and over. It can be true, and this movie showed sides of the typical character, but also a new side of him.The kids were a charm in the movie. They brought so much joy and for watchers, with a tendency to cry easily, this movie may bring a few tears. The children played absolutely superbly and although the little girl's character was a bit naughty for her age, she was still charming and always created smiles.The use of Africa whilst incorporating Terry Crew's absolutely hilarious acting, the movie had some beautiful scenes. This stretched a normal Adam Sandler movie as his involvement in Africa allowed potential for all new additions to the 'typical' Adam Sandler character.There are some that just plain hate Adam Sandler and it's understandable. If you are a fan looking for a serious physiological thriller, then by no means is this your movie. However, if you would like to sit down for two hours and completely enjoy yourself, then this is your movie. I have seen almost all of the Happy Maddison productions and I must say this is just about the best one behind Benchwarmers (in my opinion.) The style of comedy is similar, but the movies are completely different.Do watch this movie if you get the chance. It's one I would find hard to be disappointed by. Sandler does a great job and the whole cast works to together brilliantly. The film has my recommendation and chances are I might see this movie two more times before it goes off.A true shocker for the expectations and a charming storyline. The whole movie is great, and suitable for anyone who can laugh and deal with a couple of crude jokes.",Blended
180,owenscott2001,Enjoyable but predictable,7,3 June 2014,"I wanted to give this movie a 7.8 but thats not a choice.Even tho from the previews everybody knows whats going to happen. Once inside the movie everything is anticipated, calculable, certain, expected, foreseeable, foreseen, likely, prepared, sure, sure-fire, but yet it is still heart warming and funny :swoon:Out for a night with the guys find something else. But if as a boyfriend we have to see a chick flick this ones real good. Grab the low hanging fruit husbands and boyfriends.

I know you shouldn't have the best moments of the movie in the trailer but neither did the trailer have the second nor even third best scenes.This is definitely a family movie and sure, it had its sappy moments, but in we could all do with a little sappy. Love the snappy comebacks and witty script - I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard and this is really one of the best feel-good movies I've seen in recent times.

186,joshjmuir,I enjoyed it more than I thought I would,6,7 December 2014,"Despite the Hollywood rearing it's ugly head in this movie Blended had an undeniable charm as the cast seem to bring a energy to a predictable script. Barrymore and Sandler have a chemistry that is both charming and endearing even when they are arguing as they bring familiarity with them having starred in The Wedding Singer and 50 first dates together. The supporting cast deserve a lot of credit seemingly having the reigns to create some truly funny moments, especially the African band headed by Terry Crews who had me stitches every time he was on screen. He along with regulars Shaquille O'Neal, Kevin Neal and Co certainly added to the charm of movie. The Cinematography in Africa is naturally quite stunning and well filmed much like a tourist advertisement which made the location look quite inviting. The score had all the earmarks of a Summer comedy and was well used throughout the movie. I think the humour had the tendency to be a little too juvenile but even that worked at times and had a mixture for a wider demographic. Yeah it had the tendency to be a little stupid and I rolled my eyes a couple of times but between this and Grown Up's, this at least had some charm and plot. Even if it has the stench of Hollywood over it. Not a great original comedy but as these comedies go it served it's purpose being a family film that has some interesting character moments even if it is quite basic. Not as bad as I thought it would be and had me laughing quite a lot so it definitely gained some points in my book. Not the best but certainly not the worst in Sandler's back catalogue. At least worth a watch on TV if it's on.",Blended
187,awsomedustin,Loved it.,8,1 November 2014,"It's the right amount of romantic with the right amount of comedy. I'm a big Adam Sandler fan and a huge Drew Barrymore fan. 50 First Dates is a favorite of mine, naturally. If you're a fan of movies in that nature, you'll love this one. It's that awkwardly hilarious type of film from beginning to the end. It's exactly what I was expecting. Some people might find it tedious and average, but I really enjoyed it. It shocked me because I hadn't heard anything about this film until I saw it on this site. Since I hadn't seen it advertised or heard anything about it's production, I figured I would be disappointed and that it might be a movie that they were hoping wouldn't turn out to be a flop. But as far as I'm concerned, it's a great movie.",Blended
188,thesunsmellstooloud,"Nothing Extraordinary, but Good Fun",6,6 May 2015,"Blended achieves what it aims to be - a good, clean family comedy. There's nothing new about two characters not getting along initially but growing fond of each other as circumstances force them to spend time together. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler have once again proved that strong chemistry between two characters can go a long way in making a film engaging and enjoyable. It's true that the film relies on some pretty standard Hollywood clichés - such as, girls need a mother figure and boys need a father figure, women need to dress a certain way to attract men (this especially is not true in real life), women are pretty unhappy when single - but this is the kind of film that you really shouldn't read too much into. The kids were pretty funny too, especially Adam Sandler's kids. A friend recommended this film to me, and I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised. Anyone wanting to enjoy a funny and touching film with their family (while not having to use their brain too much) should definitely give this one a shot.",Blended
189,sfmdovey,Really Good,8,10 September 2018,This is my favourite film with Barrymore and Sandler together. I love the storyline and all the jokes.

190,bjknngbhh,This is easily the most overrated movie,3,22 September 2019,"How does this have a 6.5? The cinematography alone is horrendously ugly, and the script is a traditional Adam Sandler script that's silly and trash. I don't understand why this has a 6.5 and Jack and Jill is rated among the worst movies of all time. It's not THAT bad of a movie really, but it's definitely a pretty bad movie. People say it's one of the best recent Adam Sandler movies, but in my opinion it's trash. I still recommend it because I guess my opinion isn't universal, but I don't understand why people like it. The Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates are both great, and this one is easily horrible in comparison. I gave it a 3/10, which may be a little low. It may be able to pull a 4, but I lowballed it because it definitely doesn't deserve a higher rating :)",Blended
191,insanemoviecollector,I loved it,8,27 June 2014,"I truly loved this film. It was heart warming, fun and had me laughing several times. Yes, it's totally predictable but that can sometimes be OK. You know what you are going to get, the freaky children and the inevitable romance. I like these two when there together and I like Sandler despite what the critics say. He is someone you can relate to. A great movie to chill out, relax or just something to make you happy. The children's antics were annoying at times and the transformation from tomboy to beauty was slightly abrupt but I did like the the way that each parent dealt with the issues of teenage boys and girls, especially the constant 'self service' that the teenage boy was participating in while imagining his babysitter. After all, most blokes can remember that time in their life.",Blended
192,amitso,Solid family-friendly flick..,6,12 August 2014,"Blended stars Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore in a enjoyable and light-hearted rom-com which comes directly out of the same playbook as their previous hit together, ""50 first dates"", resulting in a feel-good movie delivering family-friendly entertainment.The movie is based around Adam and Drew's characters who are single parents devoted to raising their young children. After initially repulsing one another the pair begin to form a close bond during an impromptu African safari holiday. The movie touches on the emotional challenges single parents face with the added brilliance of Adam Sandler's comedic charm. The humour throughout the movie is mostly great although some jokes do miss the mark and fall flat. Nevertheless it didn't ruin the overall positive sense of the movie. The chemistry between the lead pair is brilliant and provides a solid foundation for the supporting cast members to add they own individual flair. Notable mention goes to Terry Crews who did a great job injecting himself into proceedings by playing a hilarious overenthusiastic MC.If you're looking for entertainment suitable for the whole family of all ages then this movie is a great option. Tourism South African do their part showcasing the countries gorgeous backdrop which will surely attract tourists in droves.",Blended
193,jamesdashberry,A return to form for Adam Sandler,9,17 September 2016,"When Adam Sandler first came on the scene, I was at university. I lost count of the times we watch Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison. The one liners became of feature of our daily lives!Over the next few years, Sandler had a string of hits - The Wedding Singer, Big Daddy and Little Nicky were all firm favourites. However, with the exception of Fifty First Dates where he teamed up with Drew Barrymore again, I found the humour to be a tame compared to the earlier films and at times a little predictable - certainly not laugh out loud like Happy Gilmore.When I saw Sandler had teamed up with Barrymore again, I decided to give it a watch - having loved both 50 First Dates and The Wedding Singer. From start to finish I found myself laughing out loud. With one liner after one liner, cameos by characters from Happy Gilmore, 50 First Dates and The Wedding Singer (and probably more that I missed) and the incredible on-screen chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore makes this a feelgood romcom that is a return to form for Adam Sandler.In reality, it's a predictable enough script, and at times you groan at the storyline, but it doesn't matter because it's funny, heart warming and feel good all at the same time.I loved this film. And I love that Sandler made me laugh again (even if Pixels and The Cobbler came after this!)Watch it!",Blended

The ridiculous and hilarious chemistry between Sandler's and Barrymore's characters was astounding; even more, Barrymore perfectly delivers the character of a troubled mother. Although the movie was fairly entertaining, it was unnecessarily inappropriate at times that almost ruins the hilarity of the situation that the two families are in. For example, the useless sexualisation of Ginger, unwanted hyper-sexuality of the elder son, and the rather crude sex-innuendo's in between scenes throughout the movie. It wasn't that they weren't funny, but that they were unnecessary considering the context and the concept of the movie. Some worth watching scenes are definitely in there: Thorne's attempt at a boyish muse (her basketball scene was a killer), amazing shots of the beautiful sceneries, the fantastic African dancer's being everyone's favourite, Barrymore's parachute trip, Nickens in general, etc. Overall, a good comedy by Frank Coraci!",Blended

Yes initially some jokes/puns come off a bit forced, and yes (of course) being an Adam Sandler movie many jokes/puns are on the cheesy side... but it's hilarious. A good set to stop taking life and all its issues so overly serious. We have watched this now probably 10 times, and quote a lot from the movie. And for all overly protective parents: Yes my 6 year old quotes cheesy lines from the movie, but no, he doesn't understand half of their true meaning.

Let's just say it had it all: bad acting, bad writing, predictable plot, unsympathetic characters - the works. Not one viewer in our group laughed a single time during this excruciatingly long, failed attempt at comedy. The South African bureau of tourism should probably sue Warner Brothers for lost revenue, based on how many people will never wish to visit the country after seeing the lame caricature of all things African portrayed in this movie.

This is actually a sweet comedy where two individuals who initially repel each other grow to like each other. The added touches are the children in this film, who are not only hilarious but also bring out the parental qualities in Drew and Sandler's characters. The holiday setting in this movie is also fantastic and adds a bit more quality to the film. The backing singers who appeared every now and then made me chuckle.

I actually hope for a sequel to this movie. - note: I am rating this as the movie it is. A lovely, touching comedy. Nothing more, nothing less. With this in mind it is worth a 10 from me. So if you don't like Adam Sandler maybe this movie isn't for you...otherwise I think you will enjoy it.Two families are ""blended"" as they - after a horrible first date- end up at the same holiday resort.

I liked the touching family moments, and the overall message behind the movie. When did movies have to be these C.G.I edited, over the top pieces of garbage, one after another.

This is not a twisted 4-hour Lars von Trier artwank which repulses and bores the viewer, it is Saturday evening entertainment.I think the main reason Adam Sandler irks the media is that he is just a 'normal guy' who doesn't give a sh*t about impressing reviewers and people love him for that.",Blended

I was disappointed that it didn't. I cringed a little when the lines were predictable and cheesy. This sounds harsh, but it's my honest opinion. BUT, yes there's a positive. I was moved by Emma Fuhrmann's emotional scene with Adam Sander near the end. It felt like it was a different movie for 1:56. I wanted more of that smart well placed dialog with two characters. Also the jokes could be updated beyond the 90's.I don't want to be a complete Debbie Downer and make this a pure negative review. Here are all the positives. The cast was pretty good. Moral and family values are placed in good spots. Overall, I was somewhat entertained. Hoped for more modern and smart jokes from the tradition Sander formula, but it's a Sander movie.",Blended

Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore show a side of themselves that truly shows the humanity of Hollywood. They endeavor to tell a story that modern Americans can really relate to on a primal level. The way they portray the modern struggle to find one's true love is a luxury that we all one day hope to enjoy. As a hopeless romantic myself, I like to think everyone in any situation can find love and be happy. Even though this movie has gotten some bad reviews, I think this is something every one of us in modern times can relate to. As someone who is optimistic about the future, I enjoy movies that give hope to people in any situation, and it gives me faith that everything will work out in the end.

217,escobar010181,Adam at his best,9,28 January 2015,"I can see a lot of expert reviewers leave such negative comments in regards to Adam Sandler films, but they must understand his style of films. He isn't the type to bow down to Hollywood types, he simply does his movies for the likes of the viewers. This movie was (once again) an epic Sandler film! It shows a lot of heart and comedy in the same sense. I've been a Sandler fan since Happy Gilmore. Sandler has that goofy comedy that will never get old! I honestly hope Adam Sandler ignores the so called ""negative reviews"" and keeps his fans satisfied with the comedy he does. It's unique and plays an important role in balance with today's film. Keep it up Adam! You are well deserved!",Blended
218,cozzyb,Actually very good,7,23 October 2014,"Many people instantly assume an Adam Sandler film will suck due to the odd bad film he makes (Jack and Jill). However this film really should be tried, I found myself engaged and laughing out loud at quite a few adult jokes clearly hidden to keep the folks happy when they take their kids to see this. The acting is good with no cheesy characters, even the cameos from Shaq and Terry Crews are funny. All around a great family comedy with a nice story. If you like Adam Sandler then prepare for another classic to go with the old classic, if you aren't a fan, try it for a genuinely funny family film. The film always has a good flow, feeling just the right length to not feel like it drags.",Blended

This is a pure example of what worldly entertainment continues to offer. There were so many ""cringe worthy"" moments in the 45 minutes we viewed of this movie that we had to turn it off. Sexually related jokes and situations do not belong in ""family movie."" What were the writers and producers thinking?! I saw both Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore in 50 First Dates and expected the same quality of acting and an interesting plot. I was so very disappointed! They did not deliver in the movie Blended. The jokes were quite bland. Skip this if you're looking to entertain your family with a CLEAN and funny movie.",Blended

222,nghiauchin,critic ratings are too harsh bruh,9,10 September 2016,"so i've just watched all 3 movies Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore have acted in together and they've pretty much won my liking. Their romantic comedies never fail to crack me up and the chemistry they have when they're filming is really * heart eyes *. I realllly enjoyed the wedding singer and 50 first dates therefore i may be a little biased when writing this cause they already won me over with those 2 movies but this movie was really amazing on it's own, funny ( we all have our own sense of humour alright, mine just happens to be the same as the scriptwriters ) and the script was pretty good. something i got really excited about in the movie was when allen covert appeared!! i remembered him from 50 first dates playing 10 seconds tom and the wedding singer playing sammy so when he appeared in blended, i totally freaked out. Also, Alexis Arquette who played George in the wedding singer appeared in blended so once again, i freaked out so much. I thought it was so nice that the directors included the actors which acted previously in adam and drew's movies so that viewers could experience this sense of nostalgia. i think the older folks who have watched the wedding singer and 50 first dates during the time when they were released would be overwhelmed with emotion when they come back for blended to see those actors and actresses once again. i really actually hope these two make more movies together y'know ( just keeping my fingers crossed ) cause they make a great pair and i'd love to see the two of them in more movies !! <3",Blended

This movie reminded me exactly why it is that I love Adam Sandler and never lost faith in his movies. It was funny, cheesy, cute. Ignore the negative comments if you're a true Adam Sandler fan. The movie is SUPPOSED to be cheesy and corny. That's what Adam Sandler is all about: the dumb humor. The chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler was just as it was in 51st dates.

And you know how you tell them to go to their husband or dad and tell the joke to HIM and they mess it up when they do?That was this movie. Only it wasn't a joke but rather an entire Happy Madison movie script.

Yet, this film had underlying messages that will hit home with anyone that has been through tough times in a relationship, is trying to raise kids or has lost their ""nuclear"" family. You see it touches on the male and female roles in a relationship. It's not a Saving Private Ryan or Transformers action or drama. This is healthy comedy. This is a good family oriented film about today's realities, but throws in well timed humorous. When it was over I wished it had been longer. I'd call it an Adam and Drew classic.

However, in the end they find a lot in common and fall in love. The movie is great for watching in a relaxed, soulful atmosphere with family or friends.

235,bencyca,Oddly touching - One of the best Sandler comedy so far,9,13 November 2014,"I can't say I am a huge fan of Adam Sandler and his work, since I always associated him with silly comedies full of clichés. His movies recycle each other and use the same lines, and first of all, they have nothing to do with the reality.Blended wasn't like this. Sandler didn't play the stupid but funny man that he usually acts. The movie brings up a story that can, and does happen in real life. Both Sandler and Barrymore came up with almost excellent acting, and although we can predict the happy end and even the plot twists(if there are real plot twists) in this movie everything else is just so perfect. The supporting cast is funny, NEVER too much. Terry Crews is funny in this unusual role, and the place where the movie plays is also exquisite, I personally think that it adds a certain plus to the movie experience.Children, kids, are a joker factor in this movie, and they are used well. Most of the rom-coms are about two single persons getting together in a movie, but this is about two families getting together in a not over-used way. Very good story, excellent acting a little bit too much stereotyping and sexism. 9/10",Blended

The jokes were funny, the kids were acting really good, musics were great. I saw the movie with my family and we all enjoyed (as Sandler fans) movie. His a few last attempts were really bad movies but this time he got it right again. And that's why I feel sad about all the bad reviews this movie has. Because some people are hating it just because they didn't like Adam Sandler's last movies, and they are ready to be automatic haters.

However, my goodness, the writers truly ruined it. The best part about a film is the unraveling of the characters but the writers just added in unnecessary comments or things that really didn't need to be in there to show character development. It's the old saying from high school English class, ""show don't tell."" All they did was tell. So many words, not enough showing, and let me remind you this is a movie. On top of that the kids in the movie unfortunately couldn't act. It's a shame, with a better/more writers, a little revising from producing, and a different cast of kids, the film could have been a hit.",Blended

Its a fixed message for all whether in a broken family or not it attends to a variety of issues about single parenting. The morals it brings across are very opposite to the acting, you watch and see Adam Sandler though a hilarious dude you get that he's super protective of his children and even very mindful of what his little girl can and can't do, Drue shows her versatility in playing an organised disciplined woman, she teaches her sons through her lifestyle and integrating so well with her new guys kids.

Unlike his previous movies, Adam Sandler has successfully blended good storyline, casts, and beautiful set of Africa in this movie that make it special to watch. Although in some part there are many weak and unimportant dialogs, but still Adam's unorthodox way of expressing humor makes this movie alive. Drew's performance has contributed a feminine touch in this movie. With her genuine look as mature and wise divorce lady, she nailed her role to bring this movie as real as it is. A good movie to watch with your family.",Blended

Everything seemed staged and that there wasn't a real flow between the characters and dialogue interaction. There wasn't much that was very funny about this movie. I did enjoy the cameos from people in other Sandler movies, and the premise seemed alright, but the delivery was awful. I expected more from Sandler and Barrymore after their chemistry in 50 First dates. I'm not sure what happened here, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. The jokes were predictable we were calling them out as the movie went on. I guess I could see it as a family movie for very young children, however I don't have kids, I'm strictly a fan of both actors.",Blended

To be honest the only thing i did not like about the movie was a single actor and the lack of role he really had to play. Otherwise the movie was great the plot was crude but effective the movie was long but it was not long winded. I think allot of people made the decision to rate this poorly because of 50 first dates and that's not a bad thing. because yes we all liked that movie allot and find it hard seeing these two in a different light. But if you grew up at anytime in the last 100 years and realized you had hair where it was not before or no hair where it was you would probably see passed that and just enjoy the movie.",Blended

But I'm sad to say that, except for ""Jack and Jill"", it's one of the worst movie's Adam Sandler has ever made. The movie just gives you the feeling that they are trying to hard. Sadly both Drew and Adam, in this movie, are'nt even funny. It's mostly the kids and Terry Crews that supply the comedy, and it's not a lot of it. Terry is funny the first time's you see him in the movie, but frankly, he get's old pretty quick. So, to sum up. The movie is'nt terrible, but it's not a movie i recommend either. The acting is kinda stale, and the jokes are so-so. So for me, it's a 3/10.Hope you like my review!",Blended

I would highly recommend this as Adam and Drew both portray what is a great display of family issues in the modern age with a feel good message. Hope there working relationship doesn't stop here. More of the same please. Also note there is nothing family sensitive or concerning i believe. They pulled off some great one liners in a way that made me cry with laughter throughout.

The one thing I didn't like and / or understand in Blended is the Terry Crews character. He serves no purpose and doesn't add to the film at all.

The comedy in this movie is all over the place, and if you don't find anything about this movie funny, you need a better sense of humor! The only thing I do wish is that the movie would move along a little quicker than it did, but that is still not enough to keep me from scoring it less than 10.

The film is filled with wonderful African music, old favorites, and a few new songs. Director Frank Coraci supplies a roaming Greek Chorus known as Thathoo, comprised of nine singers who harmonize behind infectious, captivating Terry Crews, who pops up throughout as the resort's jovial hip singing host.

Although Adam and Drew remain funny as always, the movie itself is very exhausting...too much melodrama, sticky, lacks originality and boring. I'm surprised Adam Sandler took place in such a boring movie. So, if you can't decide whether to buy a ticket for this movie, please don't.

The commercials built this up for me and as every scene unfolded the plots where predictable and not funny. It's almost as if they took every chance to satire 4 or so movie genres into 1. It just didn't work. I'm thinking the leads took the job for a quick pay day and trip to Africa. I thought White House Down was awful and this tied it.

Adam plays a widow, Drew a divorcée, just working and trying to raise their kids the best way they know how. Meeting for the first time on a blind date, they manage to say and do as much as they can to turn off the other, not that are bad people, but more that they are so unsure of themselves after being on their own so long. Yeah the logic is more pretzelian than real, they find themselves on the same African Safari vacation that Sandler's boss had set up for himself and Drew's business partner. Thrown together, the two adult characters put forth their best efforts to make the vacation work for their kids and end up making it work for each other.There is some mildly crude humor, but a lot of it is gentle fun, some of it predictable, some laugh out loud funny.My family agreed that that crazy fool Terry Crews stole the show! And the rest of the theater agreed, because as soon as his face flashed on the screen everyone started laughing before he had even started one of several hilarious routines, sort of playing like the Greek chorus.

The chemistry between Sandler and Drew is not gone, and this film is just as good as 50 first dates, if not, better in terms of laughs...It starts out with a pretty long, though entertaining set up which lands them in Africa, blah blah blah... whatever...

If you like Adam Sandler go see it, if you don't like him, then stay home.",Blended
261,kayster58,Great Romantic Comedy!,10,27 May 2014,"I NEVER pay attention to what critics say about a movie and I'm so glad I didn't with this one. It was an excellent family movie and how many of those are there really out there anymore? Went with other administrative assistant co-workers and we all loved it. I love Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler together. We all got a lot of good laughs from the movie. As someone else said, it won't win any awards but it is great light hearted comedy and if that is what you are looking for this is your movie. Many of us said we wanted to see it again. I loved this movie. It made you feel good and just lovely to get a lot of laughs from it. Some nice cameos in it too.",Blended
262,waywen-14-636454,So funny,10,30 May 2014,I really enjoyed watching this movie with my family .I don't think it is rated fairly I would have given it a much higher rating . I simply love Drew Barrymore and Sandler working together.In fact I loved the film so much that I have seen it more then once :)It is a nice family movie with beautiful location and a funny love story .Terry Crews is so funny he makes you laugh.The film also applies to young kids as it has a lot of things going on for them in this film.I will surly recommend it to everyone who enjoys Family romantic yet funny movies.I am not a person that usually enjoy watching comedy movies but this film is one of my favorites for sure.,Blended
263,Cn1177,Better than ratings suggest!,10,4 June 2014,"I give this rating 10.However only because it deserves more than shown on the IMDb rating,Even this movie ain't one of Adam Saddler's best movies it is still better than everybody has made it out to be. I think the chemistry between Saddler and Drew is really good which helps the movie.Still believe that anyone wanting to know should they go see this movie to go as I believe it is still worth the watch.It is an Adam Sandler movie at the day .",Blended
264,snd-23-582637,Drew me crazy about watching it again and again,8,9 June 2014,"This may contain some spoilers, but nothing to reveal the plot to you!This was a good movie! Despite all negative comments and review and blah-blahs, this was a good movie! Hi, I'm Tom. Why? That entirely depends on what kind of movies you like and what kind of movies you think you don't like. If you prepare yourself for a dumb Adam Sandler movie, that's what you will get.But, if you:1. put the not-so-good-and-very-very-predictable-and-boring acting of Adam Sandler (Jim) aside.Hi, I'm Tom.2. pay more and MORE attention to Drew's acting3. like little, adorable girls and how the director can make them even more adorable4. have a heart, not just for a blood pumpHi, I'm Tom.5. like family comedies6. watch this with a girl(boy)friend/husband/wife who match with all of the points aboveYou WILL like this movie! The plot is stupid, the way it was directed and performed IS NOT!Hi, I'm Tom.Adam Sandler could be replaced by somebody else, but Drew Barrymore can't, however, I realize that the duo has some chemistry and different actor for the main role (even if better than Sandler), wouldn't make the movie better.Hi, I'm Tom.Bottom line, don't spoil by the bad comments. Watch it and make your mind by yourself. It wasn't a lost time for me, no at all! I will watch it again, with proper company.-1 for Adam Sandler and -1 for the plot Everything else is great.",Blended
265,junhui998,Great movie!,10,14 June 2014,"Blended is such an awesome funny family comedy! Critics are way too harsh on this movie, and basically biased against Adam Sandler, u gotta watch this movie! Laughed so hard and enjoyed it! 10 stars! Cant find any faults in it and everyone should watch it, ignore negative reviews and treat this as any other movie you watch, it might not be the latest blockbuster of the year or have any hot actors or actresses but the story is there, thats the main point! Grew emotional at times but the overall experience was great but ending could have been better such as a wedding for Jim and Lauren etc. Love the partnership between Adam and Drew! :) Amazing movie worth watching ;) Blendddeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed rocks",Blended
266,tml_fan1,If you read the critical reviews,4,13 August 2014,"You would have saved yourself 2 hours. I rated it a 4/10 and yet I feel like I was too generous. The plot of the movie is stupid, the jokes are stupid and portrayal of characters is moronic.If you are a woman be ready to see how you are supposed to dress and act if you interested in attracting the opposite sex. I am a man and I felt offended for the women who sat through this movie. I don't have to tell you ladies out there that the film's message is incorrect. You do not have to dress ""sexy"" in order to get a man to pay attention to you.If you are an African, do not bother watching this one. Its amazing how the movie makes an entire race look like idiots and clowns. If it gives you any solace though, this movie is targeted towards the lowest denominator of intelligence.If someone recommended this movie to you because of the ""laughs"" then ask them which scenes did they find funny. I will guarantee you they won't even remember a single one. The jokes in the movie are cringe worthy.So please do not make the mistake I made and waste two good hours of your precious life watching this god awful movie.",Blended
267,vwlyfe,Sandler is back!,9,28 August 2014,"This was a great film despite what the critics said. My wife and I were laughing the entire movie! I have been a Sandler fan from the beginning and I have to say the ""old"" Sandler is back! This movie has the original comedy and style that is Adam Sandler. It reminded me of some of the classics such as Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and Big Daddy. This movie is family friendly but don't let that connotation fool you. This movie pulls out all the stops and does it right from start to finish.If you want to laugh your butt off and see some ""original"" Sandler then this is the movie for you.",Blended
268,RebeccaL650,Better then expected!,8,27 September 2014,"We rented it with some trepidation that it would be as bad as the critics claimed it to be, but we were pleasantly surprised. It may not be an epic drama, but it is a heartwarming and wholesome film that leaves you feeling optimistic about our world. If you are looking to have some laughs and feel good, this is the movie for you.The chemistry between Adam's character and Drew's character resonates as authentic. The real friendship between Adam and Drew is apparent and plays well in the film. I think critics may have judged harshly, in part because of its feel good and somewhat simplistic storyline. While this may not be the best film of the year, it continues in the same vein as the the fun-nature and comedic line of Adam Sandler films.",Blended
269,zhanna1963,Great film,10,8 October 2014,"I don't know why this film has had so many poor reviews. Myself and my husband loved it. We've loved all of Adam Sandlers films and this one delivered just as well as the rest. The chemistry between him and Drew Barrymore is as good as 50 First Dates, it was funny, we laughed all the way through, the storyline was fun and held gentle messages to any families in this situation therefore approaching potential sensitive subjects with tact and diplomatic wit.I watch and enjoy a range of film genres but in today's society where many things are far less censored and where daily we read in papers and see on our screens the horrible things people do in the name of whatever their intent and films that relay these and far worse depravities it's fun, refreshing and heartwarming to watch something like this.I read somewhere that Adam Sandler said making his films was like having one big vacation if that's true then why not? Who wouldn't like a job that felt like a holiday! When watching any of his films there's always the sense that the actors were having fun. I hope he keeps on making these fun feel good films for a long time. If you don't like them then don't watch them. There's still a solid place for his films and many people will continue to watch and enjoy them.",Blended
270,madelineleigh210,Good Movie?,5,16 October 2014,"I loved it.. I mean.. This is what it is about: Jim and Lauren are single parents who are set up on a blind date but it's a disaster. Jim has three daughters and is a widower who is still not quite over his dead wife. Lauren's divorced with two boys who are a handful because her ex is unreliable. They run into each other when they are buying things for their children. Jim goes to Lauren's when they got each other's credit card. While there, Lauren's friend, Jen shows up freaking out that her boyfriend wants her to be his children's step-mother. She decides not to go on the vacation to Africa they were suppose to go on. And it seems like Jim knows her boyfriend and asks him to sell him the trip and Jen wants Lauren to go and she thinks it would be a good way to make up for ex ditching her sons, again. When she goes there, she's shocked to see Jim and even more shocked to see they're all in a suite. They learn that they're part of a gathering for blended families. Lauren helps his daughters because he treats them like boys and they are going through some changes. And Jim helps her sons like one of them is having trouble with sports.",Blended

272,looksharp-gem,If I had seen this in the cinema I would have walked out,1,21 December 2014,"My god. This is the most awful offensive piece of crap America has produced in a long time. Drew Barrymore you should be ashamed I expect it from the Sandler clown, they obviously wanted a holiday in Africa. This is shameful and offensive to Africans Americans and Gender equality !! I was first excited when they went to South Africa I thought it might be at least interesting as I lived there but it was so unbelievably fake and offensive with 1950s stereotypes and bad terrible jokes ! I normally like Sandler's films and Drew Barrymore is even better but this is their worst mistake. It's cringeworthy !!! I started to watch what I thought would be a light hearted funny Sandler and Barrymore classic but was shocked and horrified - maybe I needed to be an American man with a very low IQ and extreme racist and chauvinist qualities to appreciate it !",Blended
273,Hopeske007,Laughed out loud,9,11 February 2015,"OK you have to know going in that Adam Sandler doesn't make R rated comedies and his films are super goofy and frequently ridiculous. That being said this film was absolutely worth watching for several reasons. First, the premise of blended families is a good subject for a comedy and it works well in this film- perfect with the cute dynamic between Sandler and Barrymore. Two, all cheese aside, there's several over the top moments that catch you off guard and had me laughing aloud which says a lot about this film. Third, Sandler in particular has really grown up over the years with his genuine acting ability and there are several touching moments, particularly between him and his kids in the film. Very well written and sweet. Take it for what it is and see this film. I was pleasantly surprised.",Blended

This film is fun, realistic and cute. Yes they tend to stick to some stereotypes but those in the world that think those stereotypes don't exist are kidding themselves? Ever been a stay at home mum? Women, do you wear makeup and dresses? Men, do you like sport? This is all that appears in this film. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are the perfect 'guy/girl next door' personalitys that we can all relate to. Their chemistry is great and they are both as funny as each other. The sweetness of the kids with the different parents is just right. The kids and the South African singers are hilarious and add the extra touch. Overall a great fun film, watched on many occasions by men, women and children and loved for the fun that it is :)",Blended
276,ajbaconmail,"Flat, lifeless and just not funny. What were they thinking",2,6 February 2016,"Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore should make a good romcom. But this is just without anything that might make it a comedy. No banter, no laughs, no irony. OK, it, perhaps, has a message that kids need mums and dads but, hey, I think we all know that. I don't think elephants would be at all comfortable on a quad bike course. Not seen the ending yet (writing the review at about 50 toe curling minutes in) but can guess. I am sure Sandler will help the boys improve and Barrymore will help the girls improve. If this had a good or sharp script it would work but it just looks very lazy. LIke both the leads a lot but, I think, this one is best forgotten",Blended

278,memeshitkid,A classic Adam Sandler film,1,27 December 2016,"When I say ""A classic Adam Sandler film"" in the summary I mean this movie is just as awful as any reasonable person may expect. The movie Blended has poorly crafted low-brow and sexual jokes ""blended"" throughout it's 1 hour and 57 minutes too long run time. Some people may call it heartfelt, but I call it predictable and irritating. The most heartfelt thing about this movie is how it makes me want to stab myself in the chest so that I don't have to watch it anymore.You would think that the inclusion of such hilarious and well versed stars like Terry Crews and Joel McHale would redeem some comedic value, but alas, the movie is as lame and flat with them as it would be without.Please, Don't watch this film.",Blended
