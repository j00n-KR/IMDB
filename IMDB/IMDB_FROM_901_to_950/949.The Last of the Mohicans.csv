0,MartinHafer,Exceptional.,9,5 November 2013,"In this 1992 version of ""The Last of the Mohicans"", Day-Lewis plays a long-haired version of the Deerslayer--a white man raised by Mohican tribesmen. He and his adopted father and brother are reluctantly pulled into the battle between the Brits and French during the French-Indian War (also called the Seven Years War). This is because the Brits have no idea what they were doing in the war and so it's up to these three men to save the day...or at least rescue a couple women from certain death.It is interesting to note that when the film began, it did NOT say it was based on the original James Fenimore Cooper story but on the 1936 version of ""The Last of the Mohicans"" (which starred Randolph Scott). Much as I hate to admit it, the original story is very difficult reading and the decision to 'spice it up' by changing the story around (such as killing off folks who survived in the original story) worked well--making for an exciting story. It also helped that the film was made on location in the Blueridge Mountains of North Carolina--providing nice scenery you couldn't get in the more stagy (but exceptional) 1936 version. And, to top it off, the musical score was quite rousing and complimented the story well. All in all, a very well done and enjoyable film.",The Last of the Mohicans
1,TheLittleSongbird,Spellbinding,9,11 May 2011,"I genuinely mean that when I say that Last of the Mohicans is spellbinding and that there is a lot to admire from it.Firstly, Michael Mann's direction is brilliant. Mann is a more than competent director seen with the likes of Manhunter and Heat, and while everything you expect in a Michael Mann film is here(not a bad thing, quite the contrary) it is all done in a professional way.The story is a sprawling one, but again that is not a bad thing in itself. Because while it is sprawling in nature, it is also a compelling story lifted by its sweeping action sequences(notably the climax), the love story that is kept in the background but remains prominent and emphatic characters.The pace helps too, as while the film clocks in at just under two hours, Last of the Mohicans flies by with no scene feeling too rushed. I also appreciated that the quieter and more subtler moments, as seen with Russell Means' character, didn't drag.That's not all. The cinematography is splendid and the settings are stunning that gives the film its epic, sweeping feel. Trevor Jones' score is outstanding, and probably his best since The Dark Crystal.Last of the Mohicans has fine acting. Daniel Day-Lewis is a commanding lead, and Madeline Stowe is both alluring and convincing, likewise with Jodhi May. Russell Means is suitably composed, wise and well-meaning, but for me Wes Studi's marvellous and quite malevolent performance is the standout.All in all, a spellbinding film. 9/10 Bethany Cox",The Last of the Mohicans
2,Leofwine_draca,"Enjoyable, but no classic",6,31 May 2011,"THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, based on an old novel by James Fenimore Cooper, is a mildly diverting historical adventure romp that benefits from a big budget, some splendid visuals and an exploration of a lesser known part of America's history. Unfortunately, I found I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd hoped, mainly thanks to the director's attempts at po-faced grandeur and the overlong running time that makes some parts feel repetitive despite the engaging characters.On the plus side we have a typically winning performance from Daniel Day-Lewis as the noble hero and a frightening Wes Studi (GERONIMO: AN American LEGEND) playing the vicious enemy. Madeleine Stowe looks fine in period gear, and the beautiful scenics are played to the hilt. There are a handful of great action sequences thrown in along the way, and the climax is as gripping as they come. But at other times the worthiness becomes dull, and this doesn't have the same kind of quality as something like THERE WILL BE BLOOD or even the star's GANGS OF NEW YORK.",The Last of the Mohicans
3,SnoopyStyle,Brutal Violent Epic,9,22 September 2013,"Maj Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) is bringing reinforcements to Ft. William Henry with Col Munro's daughters Cora (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice (Jodhi May) when they're betrayed by native guide Magua (Wes Studi). Only the timely arrival of Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his two companions saves their lives.Director Michael Mann brings violence, brutality, romance, and striking visuals to dusty old history. This is an old fashion epic infused with modern brutality and violence. I will not debate historical accuracy. That's beyond the point here. It's a romantic melodrama using some real events as backdrop. The action is powerfully done. The brutal violence is even more powerful due to the close quarters nature of the battles. There is no CG in this one. They're doing real physical stuff and it's great.",The Last of the Mohicans
4,Hitchcoc,Incredibly Violent Cooper,9,29 December 2016,"This is a contemporary version of an age old American classic. We have the standard James Fennimore Cooper novel with Hawkeye and Chingachgook. A group of pioneer women are kidnapped from a fort in upstate New York. The Mohicans are an incredibly violent tribe. The settlers are slowly being massacred because they pose a threat to the indigenous people. Hawkeye and his Indian partner are given the task of keeping people safe. They are wise to the way things operate. This is one of the most violent films I've seen. Daniel Day Lewis plays the famous woodsman. Over the edge interpretation of a signature book. However, not for the squeamish.",The Last of the Mohicans
5,Horst_In_Translation,"Alright, but had the potential for more",6,20 December 2017,"""The Last of the Mohicans"" is an American (mostly) English-language film from 1992, so this one has its 25th anniversary this year. It is most likely the most famous of many adaptations of the original novel by James Fenimore Cooper and this movie was directed by Michael Mann, who is also one of quite a few writers working on this project. The biggest reason why so many people still know and watch it is that the central character (though not the one in the title) is played by Daniel Day-Lewis briefly after his first of so far three Oscar wins and looking at him here and especially the romance story, nobody can say he wasn't a heart-throb in his younger years. He was in his early/mid-30s when this was made. And he sure does look the part as do most of the other actors here portraying Native Americans. The film won an Oscar for its sound, was nominated for a Golden Globe for its score and was really very much appreciated by the BAFTAs, won for cinematography and make-up there, so really a very colourful potpourri of awards recognition. One of the bigger awards players that year! You will find somewhat known actors in this one in smaller roles like Postlethwaite (he has a much more famous supporting performance next to DDL), but a great deal of the cast members really were entirely unknown to me, also those who played bigger supporting characters. And while the females in the audience (and in the movie) may like the Indian characters' looks, I must say that the females in here (Stowe and especially May) were really gorgeous. But that's just a side note.If we talk about the subject at hand, I would not call the film a western, but a historic war drama and even if these three genres are not exactly my very top favorites (especially war), I still mildly liked it. Fairly expected. There is not much wrong with it technically, even if I am a bit surprised by the awards attention. Costumes, make-up and sets are fine as well. The romance part was a bit meh, sometimes slightly cheesy, also with the exact way how early on we have her reject her suitor showing us what a modern independent woman she is. That was actually a bit close to Rosamunde Pilcher level there. So from the perspective of romance I think the film is not working too well and I would have liked a slightly better execution, even if the ""looking at her"" (with lust) scene is alright. Maybe if you have a bigger interest in war and history films, then you will genuinely enjoy this one taking place centuries back in the past, in the middle of the 18th century in fact. I know I am a great Daniel Day-Lewis fan, but this movie here is not on a level where he really shines in it. I don't know if it is his approach or if it is the way the character was written. Tough to say, maybe a mix of both. Not too surprised he did not get an Oscar nomination that time. The only memorable thing is really his hair. He is a far more gifted actor than he can show us here. And that he is nonetheless among the better aspects doesn't really say anything great about the film.The supporting cast was not bad, not superb either. Or they had the problem that there were just too many minor characters in here and almost all of them did not get the proper attention and character writing that justified their existence and could have made them memorable somehow. I struggled with May's character in particular. She was just there in the film doing almost nothing (did she have any lines?) and then there is her big emotional suicide that also felt a bit exaggerated for my liking. I must say at almost two hours the film had a tolerable amount of lengths. Could have been way worse. There were good moments as well without a doubt, but also those could have been more frequent. One I hated and liked at the same time was basically Waddington sacrificing himself. It came a bit too sudden as he was more of an antagonist before that. But especially with DDL's character's mercy shot it still became one of the most memorable scenes there. Of course, also for me as a translator because the ""me"" offered all kinds of ways to interpret this specific moment. Maybe he did not even plan on getting killed himself.Completely away from the story: The landscapes, especially mountain sides, were beautiful and the score was also a joy to listen to, even if it was not subtle at all. It worked very well though. One major problem I had was that the title character (not Day-Lewis slightly surprisingly, although only not by blood and one day he sort of will be it) just never got the significance he needed to make us care for him. Chingachgook is somewhat of a known name, so they definitely could have done a lot more with him, but maybe they were also scared he could take attention away from the man you see on the poster here on imdb. I mean he gets his big moment near the end, in which he kinda out of nowhere kills the bad guy (Studi did a good job playing Magua, also physically), who to me seemed much stronger, but that's it pretty much. This final shot also gives us a pretty memorable quote that justifies the title, but I still wondered why this character (sadly the actor is no longer with us) was not featured more prominently before. Let me finally say that I am writing this review as somebody who has not read the book. Maybe you need to in order to appreciate this film even more, to understand certain scenes better, but I don't think this should be the case ever. For any movie. So no idea if the writers here did not live up fully to the potential or if the base material already had occasional weaknesses. I can only say that story is king and that the film with regard to the plot was overall just good enough and that strengths in other fields that received awards attention slightly make up for the sometimes mediocre quality when it comes to writing. A cautious thumbs-up overall. Also thanks to the spectacular ending (a bit more on the happy than realistic side seeing how the good guys prevail, despite their numeric disadvantage, even if not without sacrifice) which maybe is just a bit too much with the bad guy killing one first, then the young sister dying, then the bad guy dying etc. But there are memorable moments before that too, like the lengthy fight sequence in which the female protagonist's father is killed. Also it is a violent movie here and there. On one occasion, a character gets scalped and on many occasions characters are killed, once even with the heart being cut out of a character's torso. As for the male lead, finally I want to say that DDL is just always one who makes the material better and more watchable. However, even if I am a huge fan of his, there is still no denying for me that here we have one of his weaker films. Maybe other than my fellow DDL fans, this is best to be seen by people with a great interest in history because the conflict between Britain and France may be interesting to follow here, even if it must be said that the French are almost non-existent here, definitely more talked-about than actually seen (and when they are seen once, they are actually pretty merciful with their leader's offer in contrast to the Brits who want to hang DDL's character although he helped them earlier), while the real battles happen between British forces and natives. The natives here are not the victims though (the way they are in many other films), frequently the violent aggressors instead, and Day-Lewis' character and his folks are the interface between the two sort-of. Okay, that would be all then. My suggestion is that you give the film a chance unless the genre really does not interest you. You will probably not be overwhelmed by the outcome, but i think it is good enough, especially if you get the chance to see it on the big screen at your local theater.",The Last of the Mohicans
6,classicsoncall,"""The whole world's on fire, isn't it?""",8,25 September 2021,"There are a number of film versions for ""The Last of the Mohicans""; my only encounter with one, oddly enough, was the 1920 silent version with Wallace Beery in the role of Magua. For it's time I thought it was incredibly violent with some incredible stunt work. It also followed the James Fenimore Cooper novel more closely than this one in which some of the character relationships have been shifted around. I find it fascinating that there were Native American tribes warring with each other much like the British and the French during colonial times. You have to wonder why the Mohawks sided with the British while the Hurons preferred the French; it could just as easily have been the other way around, though the back story of Magua (Wes Studi) provides some context here. For a relatively unvisited chapter in early American history, the movie does a fine job depicting the animosities involved. If I'm not mistaken, I believe this is the film that put Daniel Day-Lewis on the map in Hollywood, depicting Nathaniel Poe, adopted son of Mohawk Chief Chingachgook (Russell Means) and given the name Hawkeye. The image that remains with the viewer is that fateful decision made by Alice Munro (Jodhi May) at the end of the picture when she decides she will not be a captive of the Hurons. Her utterly sad departure is tempered by the understated romance between Hawkeye and Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe).",The Last of the Mohicans
7,gavin6942,Clearly I Missed Something,6,19 November 2012,"Three trappers protect a British Colonel's daughters in the midst of the French and Indian War.I must not have been paying attention or something while watching this film. I love Daniel Day-Lewis, and I think Michael Mann is certainly an above average director (if not top tier, at least within reach of it). But I really just found this film to be rather boring and without much to hold my interest.I also love historical films, and while I understand this is a fictional story, I appreciated the attempt to show the motivations of the British and British-Americans. I feel like the film needed more of that to really drive the context home.And I should be interested by Mohicans, since the last of the Mohicans (their descendants) live within an hour of me in Shawano, Wisconsin. But this film just did not sell that.",The Last of the Mohicans
8,lee_eisenberg,"maybe it's just another lavish historical epic, but very well done",8,1 June 2005,"Set during the French and Indian Wars (1754-63), ""The Last of the Mohicans"" tells the story of a love affair between Nathaniel ""Hawkeye"" Poe (Daniel Day-Lewis), a white man living with the Indians, and Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe), a colonist. The wars naturally interrupt their relationship.Among other things, the movie does a really neat job showing the vast landscape in upstate New York. I'll admit that I don't know how accurate the movie is, or how closely it follows James Fenimore Cooper's novel, but like ""Legends of the Fall"", this is what historical epics are all about. This movie, along with ""My Left Foot"", ""In the Name of the Father"" and ""Gangs of New York"", certainly shows Daniel Day-Lewis to be one of the greatest actors of our time.",The Last of the Mohicans
9,jboothmillard,The Last of the Mohicans,6,3 February 2008,"From writer, producer and director Michael Mann (Heat, Collateral) I was expecting a bit more, but it wasn't too bad. I must admit the first half an hour to me was pretty boring, and I only woke up (not literally) when the bigger battles started when the leading character escapes the death sentence of hanging, and continuing from there. Anyway, from what I gathered, colonial America is the setting of the battle between the British and French troops, and various native American war parties are joining in. In one of the parties, independent man reared as a Mohawk, Nathaniel Poe aka Hawkeye (BAFTA nominated Daniel Day-Lewis) starts a romance with the British officer's daughter Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe) complicates things. Hawkeye is somehow caught and as I said, sentenced to be hanged, but he escapes when another battle begins, and he takes Cora and some companions to hide under a waterfall, before a final battle, where all the Mohicans are killed, except one (that's obviously what the title relates to). Also starring Russell Means as Chingachgook, Eric Schweig as Uncas, Jodhi May as Alice Munro, Steven Waddington as Maj. Duncan Heyward, Wes Studi as Magua, Maurice Roëves as Col. Edmund Munro, Patrice Chéreau as Gen. Montcalm, Pete Postlethwaite as Capt. Beams, Colm Meaney as Maj. Ambrose, David Schofield as Sergeant Major and Dylan Baker as Capt. De Bougainville. The war/battle scenes are worth a look, particularly for some small violent moments, and the romance element is okay, this isn't a film I'd see that often, but worth watching. It won the Oscar for Best Sound, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography and Best Make Up Artist, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Original Film Score for Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman, Best Production Design and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. Daniel Day-Lewis was number 85 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 20 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 9 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 15 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 35 on The 100 Greatest War Films.

10,ccthemovieman-1,One Of The Greatest Adventure Films Ever,10,7 January 2006,"This was one of those movies I didn't expect that much when I first saw it so I was pleasantly surprised. Since then, it has skyrocketed to nearly the top on my list of all-time favorite films. I can't think of too many other adventure films that are better. Just a great, great movie.It boasts an interesting story filled with intense characters, beautiful scenery, a fantastic score, good action and a nice romance. So....there is a lot to like about this Michael Mann-directed film.The action scenes are quite realistic, and border on being almost too prevalent, to be fair. However, even if it may be a little too intense or frequent, the action is always interesting and varied, from all-out assaults to individual battles.The story takes place in Eastern New York State but, in reality, was filmed in beautiful Smokey Mountain areas in Asheville, N.C. This movie looks spectacular and with an epic, sweeping soundtrack is quite a feast for the eyes and ears.The eye candy includes a handsome leading couple: Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeline Stowe. Wes Studi is mesmerizing as the ""bad guy."" If you liked him in ""Geronimo: An American Legend,"" you'll like his work here.If you are fairly young and only know Michael Mann through his crime movies like ""Heat"" or ""Collateral,"" please check this earlier film out. It could be Mann's best, which is saying a lot.",The Last of the Mohicans
11,rmax304823,Defines Epic.,7,13 June 2016,"It's an exceptional rendering of Cooper's old tale about the so-called French and Indian Wars, which in Europe was called the Seven Years War. There's the merest hint of it here but this provided the springboard for the Revolutionary War. England was at war with France and was nearly broke, in part from defending its colonies in America. England imposed taxes on the colonies to help pay its debt. The taxes included taxes on tea, and the colonials saw it as ""taxation without representation."" I guess we know where that led.Back to the movie. Wow -- what scale! The photography by Dante Spinotti is just short of magnificent. He gets it just right without revealing how much effort he puts into each shot. He's easy going too, the DP on two movies I worked in. Michael Mann is in directorial control. Together they have committed to celluloid a memorable shot of Fort William Henry under siege by the French. The first we see of the fort is nothing but what looks like a distant fireworks display on the Fourth of July -- behind the tree line, some vermilion flashes of light reflected from clouds of smoke and seconds later the barely discernible pops of cannon fire.I won't go on about the plot. It's complicated. And it's not unfamiliar: the man of nature saving the innocents who represent civilization. Shane was such a figure. So were Hondo and Tarzan.French and English exchange cannon fire and occupy fortified positions. They march through the dank forests in step, wrapped in bright red jackets and topped by peculiar decorative hats. The Huron Indians who have sided with the French have no such encumbrances. They're half naked, they know the terrain, and they have the advantages that all irregulars have, whether Lawrence of Arabia's Bedouin or those now fighting an asymmetric war in the Middle East.Daniel Day Lewis is credible in the role of the white child adopted by the Mohican Indians. Madeleine Stowe is stunning. The battle scenes are staged well and are particularly brutal. Wes Studi, as the bitter Huron Magwah, rips open the chest of a British officer and raises the still beating heart in his fist.And Studi gives an impressive performance. With his top knot and war paint and pebbled complexion, he's compellingly ugly. His character is a Huron and the Hurons spoke an Iroquoian language, entirely different from the Alqonquian of the Mohicans. But nobody seems comfortable speaking any Indian language, and for good reason. Mohican is already extinct and all of the Iroquoian languages are either extinct or severely endangered. There were no living speakers of either language to coach the actors, and both languages are hard to speak. Iroquoian has a series of consonants that can be written as ""ktspyjam"" -- as in ""cat's pyjamas."" Well, it looks like that was a little off topic. I don't know why I do that. I guess it's because the voices tell me to.Michael Mann deserves credit if for no other reason that his directorial style is classic. No glitz, no shaky cameras, no instantaneous editing. Well, not much quick editing anyway, and only a few purposeful shots in slow motion.The writers and the crew have taken what could have been -- and has been, in previous versions -- a stiff and uninvolving action tale, and turned it into rather more than that. It's a good movie.",The Last of the Mohicans

14,hitchcockthelegend,"Death and honour are thought to be the same, but today I have learned that sometimes they are not.",9,17 November 2012,"The Last of the Mohicans is directed by Michael Mann who also co- adapts the screenplay with Christopher Crowe from James Fenimore Cooper's novel of the same name. It stars Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe, Russell Means, Eric Schweig, Jodhi May, Steven Waddington and Wes Studi. Music is scored by Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman and cinematography by Dante Spinotti.1757 during the French and Indian War, Hawkeye (Lewis), a white man who was adopted by the Mohicans, finds himself on a perilous journey to escort a couple of British sisters to their father's fort. This journey brings him, and his companions, into conflict with Magua (Studi), a sadistic Huron warrior seeking revenge on the girls' father.Inspired by the Randolph Scott film of the same name made in 1936, Michael Mann gives his all to create a stirring classical epic fit to sit in the company of the historical greats of old. Visually it's a treat of some magnitude, where aided by Spinotti, Mann frames his characters in the glorious vistas provided by the North Carolinas. For those with a bent for historical narratives, Mann's film also is not found wanting, in fact it's a cerebral delight. There's romantic strands that sit right in the colourful quilt, action expertly staged and handled by the talented director and the cast, led by a superbly athletic and serious Day-Lewis, are impressive and doing justice to the requisite characters written on the page, and the musical score enhances mood with swirling beauty coupling with primitive potency that wraps itself snugly around the story.Mann gets all the key ingredients right, but it's his ability to balance the human drama with the energised action that is most impressive. The film is also thankfully devoid of boorish filler, this is a troubled time in history, with much political activity and complex racial manoeuvres, but Mann doesn't need to fill the screen with political posturing and drawn out speeches. We know all we need to know about the period in question, but the story is kept intimate, the focus on a small group of people, of whose fate we most assuredly have interest in. While on the edges of the frame we know we are witnessing the death of an era, for better or worse on different sides of the coin. Also pays to note that Mann's well known penchant for the meticulous is evident as well, for he details the native characters with considerable care.It's not flawless, accents fluctuate, the odd fake look slips into the production design and the director does what many American directors do, they come dangerously close to caricaturing their British officers, but this is still great heroic escapism tinged with romanticism. Something for everyone who loves classical cinema in fact. 9/10",The Last of the Mohicans
15,Theo Robertson,Good Film That Suffers Slightly From Hollywood Nationalism,8,18 April 2013,"During The French Indian War Major Duncan Heyward is given the task of escorting Cora and Alice the two daughters of Colonal Munro to Fort William Henry . During there journey they are betrayed Magua but are saved from certain death by Hawkeye , an adopted Mohican warrior . Upon arriving at the fort they find it under siege by the French . Worse than that Hawkeye due to Major Heyward's jealousy finds himself guilty of sedition and faces a sentence of death When this movie was released in 1992 it seemed to stay at the top of the US box office for eternity and was my tip to absolutely dominate the Oscars the following year . As it turned it only picked up one nomination for sound which was an absolute travesty since both picture , costume design , original score and cinematography should have been automatic choices with Day Lewis and Studi being probables for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actors along with Michael Mann as director. Even today when watching it you're surprised that a beautiful and involving movie was ignored when the back slapping award ceremonies were dishing out awards . It remains a movie that shows Hollywood movie making at its best That said it does suffer slightly from Hollywood at its worst . Much of the blame might lie in the original source novel by James Fenimore Cooper but you can guarantee Hollywood will put the boot in to someone given half the chance and that is the slight vein of Anglophobia throughout the film . The British are foppish fools , untrustworthy and easily defeated by both Native Americans armed with nothing more than a tomahawk and the French . If Fenimore's novel was adapted by a French film company the British might have been portrayed more fairly . Looking on the bright side at least it's a million miles better than THE PATRIOT and umpteen other similar films I could name and LAST OF THE MOHICANS still remains a very impressive American film helped in no small part by a largely British cast",The Last of the Mohicans
16,LeonLouisRicci,Blending of Ethereal Imagination & Down to Earth Tribal Warfare,9,8 January 2016,"Historical Action/Romance with a powerful visual palette and a stirring soundtrack make this Michael Mann Film one of His Best. Neither completely Historically Accurate or faithful to the Literary Source Material, the Director nevertheless more than makes up for it with rousing Action Scenes, Poetic (ironically) non-verbal scenes, and tight pacing and editing.It's a complete Entertainment awash in the Natural Environment that gives it Gravitas and is so breathtakingly exciting to watch that it encompasses the Viewer and makes clear its Time and Place.Some may say that it is Ultra-Slick and therefore lacks a certain unscrubbed patina better suited for the Story. But Mann chooses to make it something like a Modern Storybook rather than a Hefty Gritty Novel or a visitation to an Historical Event.The Cast is superb and engaging on both sides of the issues employed in this Adventure set in Early America. All the Participants, English, French, Native Americans, and Militia are shown in equal light and it makes for an even handed account of the wide-open environment.Overall, the Cast lead by Daniel Day Lewis and Madeleine Stowe with support from Wes Studi as ""Magua"" are fine, but it is the Director's Film and He makes the locations come more than Alive and at times it is mesmerizing and surreal, befitting its ethereal ambiance of a Time long past, and blending it with Romantic Imagination and down to Earth Tribal Warfare.",The Last of the Mohicans
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"An epic about the spoils of war, the longevity of hate... and the power of love",8,9 July 2006,"I remember watching this film some years back... the only thing I could still recall today, before re-watching it, was a brutal fight at one point in it. Having just watched it again, I can say without doubt that it was the fault of the shoddy taste I possessed back then(that I could not remember more of it), and not the quality of this grand motion picture. Michael Mann is an impressive director, and he takes a huge step away from his typical path in creating this film. From a man who usually helms police dramas comes the story of Hawkeye... and this time, it's as huge as it should be(for the first time, from what I understand). The plot is well-written and gripping. It develops constantly... blink and you'll miss something. The pacing is intense... the film never stands still. The version I watched was just over an hour and 45 minutes, and there wasn't a single moment of boredom or distraction among them. As always with Mann, the action is spectacular, and the scope of it is simply stunning. The cinematography is breathtaking... as my father remarked near the end of watching the film, ""they found a lot of picturesque locations to shoot at"". The editing is effective. The acting is strong all-round. You truly believe that Daniel Day-Lewis grew up among Indians, that he is a master within all the abilities that the Indians were known to possess. The characters are well-written, and going by what my father recollects, quite true to the book, as is the story. A thoroughly entertaining(and seemingly authentic) story of the country that is now known as the United states of America.

And, against that scenery is played out a complex drama between the English, French, colonists, and native Americans, all of whom have their own agendas, as well as a number of intimate dramas of which the main ones are the romance between Hawkeye and Cora, and Magua's revenge.The action sequences are extremely well staged, with the ambush and the final chase and fight being outstanding set pieces.Daniel Day-Lewis is always utterly convincing as a very physical Hawkeye, but for me Wes Studi steals the picture - his Magua is a study in cold, dignified malevolence, the turmoil of the hate which drives him being buried beneath an exterior of steely self-discipline.I didn't care for the music: the otherwise effective main theme was over-used, and needed variation.",The Last of the Mohicans
19,phd_travel,Magnificent even after 20 years,10,12 October 2012,"This is one of the best historical adventure movies ever made. The ambush scene is still terrifying. Who needs special effects when you have a great story, perfect cast, stunning cinematography, a rousing score... the list goes on. The sweep of the story from the siege to the end never lags.Madeleine Stowe is at her loveliest. When this movie came out I remember how she was the hailed as the most beautiful actress in Hollywood. Daniel Day Lewis a most convincing hero. Where has the passion gone in movies today? It's so hard to find any grand romance with all the action going on. The actors playing the Native Americans are excellent and unforgettably menacing.

20,Wuchakk,"Incredible, Magnificent, Reverent, Beautiful, Tear-Inducing",10,14 March 2014,"Director Michael Mann's ""Last of the Mohicans"" is an incredible cinematic experience. I don't often go to the theater and I even rarer see films multiple times (at the theater, that is), but when ""Last of the Mohicans"" was released in 1992 I saw it twice. I then got my hands on the VHS as soon as I could.I recently watched the VHS again and was incredibly moved! The original VHS is, incidentally, the theatrical release of the film. I was reminded of all the numerous elements that make ""Last of the Mohicans"" the definitive reason why people make and watch motion pictures in the first place. I was so moved, in fact, that I was compelled to buy the ""Director's Expanded Edition,"" which many fans criticize, mainly due to the omission of the Clannad song (""I Will Find You"") and a smattering of supposedly hip lines by Nathaniel.I'll compare the theatrical release to the director's cut at the end of this review. Allow me to first point out the numerous highlights of the film: -- The casting is perfect: Daniel Day-Lewis as Nathaniel, Madeleine Stowe as Cora Munro, Wes Studi as Magua -- heck, everyone's fabulous. -- The score by Randy Edelman is one of the greatest in motion picture history. It's as good or better than any you can think of, including ""Conan the Barbarian,"" ""Where Eagles Dare,"" ""The Last Valley,"" ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" etc.-- The plot is simple and the film runs less than two hours, but there's a definite epic scope to the picture. More than that, the ambiance of the film is equal parts historic, realistic, pure, brutal, beautiful and reverent.-- This film contains one of the greatest non-soap operatic love stories in motion picture history. During the ""Look of Love"" sequence Nathaniel stops and turns to gaze at Cora. Cora looks up and asks, ""What are you looking at, Sir?"" Nathaniel simply responds, ""I'm looking at you, Miss."" Cora finally looks back at him; first hesitatingly, then fully, then finally with a knowing smile. They just look at each other and Nathaniel returns the smile, turns and departs. Without a word, we KNOW that Nathaniel and Cora are in profound awe and love of each other. Later, when they finally passionately embrace it's potent and moving. This simple scene blows away any overt love-making scene you can think of. -- The primal Magua is a great villain, compelled to hatred, bitterness and revenge for numerous understandable reasons.-- Magua's two pow-wow interludes with the French general (Patrice Chereau) are imaginative, surreal and powerful.-- The French and Indian War skirmishes and Fort battles are realistic, compelling and brutal.-- Cora's sister Alice (Jodhi May) is only 15 years old and the fierceness of the frontier is simply too overwhelming for her. She almost commits suicide but Uncas (Eric Schweig) saves her.-- After Nathaniel and his Indian stepfather and stepbrother barely escape the clutches of Magua by jumping from a waterfall there's an unexpected and powerful interlude featuring the magnificent Clannad song ""I Will Find You."" Unfortunately this song was inexplicably cut from the director's edition. Apparently Mann felt it was anachronistic; it's not, it perfectly fits the feel and era of the picture.-- Although Major Heyward comes off as a ultra pro-British dork, he ultimately proves his bravery and noble character.-- One of the most memorable scenes is Alice's ultimate response to the prospect of living the rest of her life as Magua's slave-squaw. I cannot describe how magnificent and moving this episode is! -- The picture was filmed in glorious Chimney Rock Park in Western North Carolina. One reviewer fittingly called the film an ""Eastern."" -- The entire 15-20 minute climax, which includes Chingachgook's final fight with Magua, is compelling, imaginative and flawless. Chingachgook is played by Russell Means, by the way.COMPARING THE THEATRICAL CUT TO THE DIRECTOR'S CUT: I feel Michael Mann's cut is superior to the theatrical cut of the film. He only adds about 3-4 minutes of extra footage and it all works, with the possible exception of Chingachgook's near cringe-inducing final rant at the climax. Mann cut every one of Nathaniel's silly ""hip"" statements, which was a good decision in my opinion (not that they were THAT bad, but they simply weren't very realistic; fun maybe, but not realistic). As already noted, Mann's biggest mistake was to cut out the perfectly-fitting Clannad song. In the new cut that sequence just plays out in an unimpressive, bland manner. All I can say is that I'm glad I have the VHS because I can still play the Clannad song-sequence when I get to that particular scene (of course, the theatrical release has been released on DVD as well).Anyway, don't listen to these people who rail against the director's cut mainly because of the omission of the Clannad song. They're right that Mann should never have cut the song but, other than that, his new cut is actually superior to the original (although I admit that I'd rather have the original cut WITH the Clannad song than the new cut WITHOUT it).BOTTOM LINE: ""The Last of the Mohicans"" is simply one of the greatest films ever made. Sometimes I'm guilty of being over-generous in my film ratings, but not with this one.GRADE: A+",The Last of the Mohicans
21,gradyharp,"Restoration of Dignity to Native Americans, Long Overdue",8,18 October 2005,"James Fenimore Cooper's trusty old nineteenth century novel 'The Last of the Mohicans' has provided a surprisingly sound springboard for a film that tries and succeeds in restoring a profound respect for the Native Americans. Yes, it is a story about the Indians and their culture desecrated by the arrival of European entrepreneurs and colonists all relating to Hawkeye/Nathaniel Poe (Daniel Day-Lewis), who as a child was taken by the Mohawk tribe and raised by wise Chingachgook (Russell Means) with the graceful skills and philosophy of the Native Americans. And it is through his eyes that we are brought into the universe through the eyes of the Indians.The story is well known and needn't be elaborated once again. Suffice it say that Hawkeye becomes the scout who leads British family Munro including Colonel (Maurice Roëves) and his daughters Cora (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice (Jodhi May) into upstate New York and along the way find altercations with the French and with the Huron Indians, especially one Magua (Wes Studi) whose loathing for Munro's devastation of his village drives him to vengeance against the entire Munro family. Hawkeye and his ally Uncas (Eric Schweig) protect their lieges while steadfastly holding to the honor of their heritage. And of course during the harrowing events Hawkeye and Cora fall in love and Hawkeye takes great risks against his own life to ultimately defend Cora and her family.Yes, there are many battle scenes, great reenactment of the scenery of the novel, and villains in all camps that provide the stormy progress of the novel. But it is in the quiet moments where Chingachgook speaks about the Great Spirit, the sanctity of nature, and his waiting to join the Great Council in the sky as the last of the Mohicans that the film's power is best communicated. The acting is very fine and the cinematography is splendid. This is a film worth seeing, one whose 117 minutes fly by leaving the viewer with a renewed respect for Native American philosophy.

23,JamesHitchcock,One of the best historical adventures of the nineties,8,17 September 2010,"For some reason, Hollywood has always taken more interest in the Old West than in the Even Older East. The opening up of the eastern half of the North American continent during the eighteenth and early nineteenth century has inspired comparatively few films compared with the vast number about ""how the West was won"". Even the War of Independence has not been a particularly popular subject, despite its central role in American history, and ""The Last of the Mohicans"" is one of the few films about the French and Indian War. (Others include another version of the same story from 1936, which I have not seen, and ""North-West Passage"" from the 1950s).Although it is an ""Eastern"" (ostensibly set in upstate New York but actually filmed in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina) the film has a similar epic grandeur to many Westerns; Kevin Costner's ""Dances with Wolves"" from two years earlier seems to have been an influence. (Both films have fine orchestral scores).It is set in 1757, with the British and the French, together with their respective colonists and Indian allies, battling for control of North America. The main characters are Colonel Munro, a British officer, his two daughters Cora and Alice, the frontiersman Hawkeye, another officer Major Duncan Heyward, the Mohican Indian Chingachgook and his son Uncas, and the Huron Indian Magua. Although Hawkeye is a white man by birth, he was raised as an Indian and regards Chingachgook as his adopted father. The plot is a complex one, revolving around the war itself, the rivalry between Hawkeye and Major Heyward for Cora's affections and Magua's obsessive hatred for Munro and the British.The film makes a few changes to James Fenimore Cooper's novel. In the book Hawkeye's real name was Natty Bumppo; here he becomes, more plausibly, Nathaniel Poe. Magua remains the villain of the piece, but here his villainy is more motivated; in the novel he was simply a bad character, but here his obsession with revenge stems from the deaths of his children, killed by soldiers under Munro's command. In the original Heyward was in love with Alice rather than Cora, who (interestingly enough for a novel written in the first half of the nineteenth century) was of racially mixed origins, Munro's first wife having been a mulatto. Nothing is made of Cora's racial heritage in the film, and we can assume that she is supposed to be white. (Even in recent decades Hollywood can be squeamish about the subject of inter-racial marriage).In the 1980s Daniel Day-Lewis made his name in more intellectual British and Irish films such as ""A Room with a View"" and ""My Left Foot"". ""The Last of the Mohicans"" showed that he could also star as an action hero in a major Hollywood production. (It was his first film since ""My Left Foot"" three years earlier, the first in a number of lengthy breaks in his cinema career). He brought to his role as Hawkeye his own idiosyncratic version of the Method and his normal obsessive preparation. He allegedly learned to hunt, shoot and fish like an eighteenth-century trapper, spent weeks camping out in the wilds and insisted on remaining in character off the set, even carrying his rifle with him at all times. Day-Lewis' methods have won him a reputation for eccentricity, yet I have to say that they work; I have never seen him give a bad performance, and only rarely one that is anything less than excellent.Day-Lewis is not the only excellent thing about this movie. Some of the other actors are also very good, especially Wes Studi as the vindictive Magua. The orchestral score is stirring and the photography of the wooded mountain landscapes is strikingly beautiful. There is a particularly moving ending to the film. In all, this is one of the best historical adventures of the nineties. 8/10",The Last of the Mohicans

25,sddavis63,A Good Period Piece With A Story That's Somewhat Lacking,4,26 May 2013,"Right off the top I have to say that there was a lot about this movie that I admired. As a period piece, it works very well. It has wonderful costumes, and there's a general air of air of authenticity to this.When I say it has an ""air of authenticity,"" I'm not suggesting that it's ""historical"" or ""based on real events,"" other than in a very loose sense. Obviously, it's based (loosely as I understand it) on the novel by James Fenimore Cooper, and it's set in the midst of a very real historical event. But, generally, it is fiction. But it has an air of authenticity because it seems to offer a believable enough taste of life in a very difficult era.""Last of the Mohicans"" is set in 1757, at the height of the war between England and France for control of North America. The English-French rivalry is very well portrayed, and I was intrigued toward the end of the movie with the portrayal of the dilemma of the native peoples. How far should they adapt themselves to European colonizers and co-operate with them? Or, should they maintain their sense of self and dignity? Obviously that is, in some ways, still a valid issue for North American natives.All those are good things. Good things - but basic problem is the story is not that interesting as far as I was concerned. The historical elements of the story are basically window dressing to - wait for it - a romance. Of course. The story revolves around Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) - a white man who has adopted Indian ways - helping lead a group of British soldiers to a Fort along with the daughters of the fort's commanders. I have to say that I wondered why - in a time of brutal warfare - the girls were travelling through the wilderness to a British fort. I realize that the fort's commander is their father, but I still found myself wondering. So what if he's their father. This would be a very hazardous journey under the best of conditions. During a time of war, with native war parties in the woods they're travelling through? This seemed unnecessarily risky to me.Setting that question aside, though, I simply found the basic story to be a bit of a yawn - although some of the battle scenes (and there aren't really that many) - were well done and moderately graphic. The acting was pretty good. For my tastes, this just needed something a little more compelling in the storyline to make it worthwhile. (4/10)",The Last of the Mohicans
26,Lejink,Hits the target,8,4 March 2008,"Exciting and invigorating dramatisation of the hoary old Fenimore Cooper classic novel, this was the feature with which both Michael Mann and Daniel Day-Lewis announced themselves to Hollywood as a director/auteur and charismatic leading actor respectively. And while there's much to admire besides, essentially it's these vital essential two components which make this film so compelling. Mann's direction is imaginative and sure of pace - some of the scene-setting shots are magnificent (I'm thinking in particular of an early shot of the English Army crossing a bridge, reflected in the water below). Whilst music is a strong and I'm not always sure a wholly congruous element in the drama, Mann is clever enough to eschew dialogue at key moments of the narrative (which is how I remember the book, heavy on plot and description, light on speech), from Day-Lewis's love scenes with Madeleine Stowe, the brutal slaying of Maurice Roeves' Colonel Munro and of course the climactic duels on the mountainside between firstly the villainous Magua and Chingachook's son Uncas, and the revenge killing of Magua by Chingachook himself, in a concise and yet still thrilling combat scene. The film ends satisfyingly with the eponymous title-giving speech by Chingachook to the valley below in a fittingly elegiac conclusion. Day-Lewis is terrific in his star-part, famously at ease with the technical and physical demands of the role (learning how to speak the authentic language of the Indians and how to handle the ancient weaponry of the colonials). His playing is of necessity very physical (he runs like the wind and it's difficult to notice scenes where he was doubled by stunt-men) but yet portrayed with intelligence and conviction from first to last. I have bemoaned before that Hollywood doesn't make great actioners anymore without reaching for the SFX button but here while the film is obviously expensively mounted (the credits list alone affirms this), the story rings true and rightly replaces fake glamour and wise-cracking cynicism in favour of convincing realism and involving story-telling, to make for a satisfying and rewarding movie experience.",The Last of the Mohicans

But, do to tragic circumstances, only three Mohicans remain, Hawkeye's adopted father and brother, Uncas. The father sent Nathaniel to live with the colonial settlers for a spell, so he is fluent in the ways and languages of both worlds. One day, as the trio of men are out hunting, they happen across three people in big trouble. Cora (Madeleine Stowe), her younger sister, Alice and a British soldier are on route to Fort McHenry when they are attacked by other Indian tribes. The ladies are traveling to the fort because their father (Pete Postelthwaite) is the commander and they believe he has sent for them. However, a disgruntled Indian, Magua (Wes Studi), whose own family was destroyed by the commander in battle, is out to take his revenge and arranged the ambush. Hawkeye and his family, however, jump in and fight for the colonists, killing and driving off the attackers. The Mohicans escort the three Britishers to the fort, at great peril. But, once there, the fort is besieged and the war rages fiercely. What will become of the English settlers, especially Hawkeye and Cora, who have fallen hard for each other? This is a superb movie, with great actors and more, but its depiction of the violent French and Indian War is very real and very potent. Therefore, be forewarned that there are some stomach-turning scenes that do make the film unsuitable for children. Some Native American tribes were quite fierce and their weapons of choice were tomahawks. Enough said. The cast is terrific, with Day Lewis very great as Hawkeye, Stowe most beautiful as Cora, and Studi totally frightening as the vengeful Indian. Other cast members are wonderful, too. The scope of the film is grand, with the finest of cinematography, staging, costuming, direction and writing. As they say, they don't make them like this anymore but the movie clearly shows that they DO. If you want to experience an historical tale of great merit, this is one you should not miss.

36,johnnyboyz,"Pulsating; harrowing and quite stupendous adventure film, with a pleasing eye on character and narrative in what is a thoroughly involving experience.",8,2 December 2010,"Michael Mann's The Last of the Mohicans will begin with an establishing shot of a patch of dense jungle shot through a wide angle lens so as to capture both the beauty and magnitude of it all. The camera lingers over the canopy layer of some pretty intense foliage, gently moving from right to left, encapsulating a good stretch of forestry and providing us with an angle informing us precisely where the following 120-odd minutes of pure, adrenaline fuelled action will take place. We cut to a shot deeper within, a man sprinting his way through with a number of others of his own ilk as they chase down an animal that they're hunting. The man is the lead the film will come to revolve around; a man who dominates this locale we're provided with intimidating initial shots of as he negotiates the fallen trees and wins his prize. Our lead is additionally a crack shot with his musket, a nimble specimen whom appears to be able to tackle all that nature and the world throws at him; someone whom, when it comes to the killing of the said animal, pauses to say a few brief words of prayer so as to acknowledge they have just killed a living beast but observe it's all for the sake of being at one with nature anyway.When the time comes for this man to escort a certain important someone across the fiery, hostile terrains of the front line of the French and Indian War of 1754 to 1763; the systematic avoiding of warring sides, raging natives to the land and everything else, we feel that he's more than up to the task. Mann's film is a gripping adventure running on adrenaline; self discovery and a nicely observed romance story, barely ever pausing to catch its breath and not afraid to shy away from some of the more brutal realities of the warfare of the respective era. It is Daniel Day Lewis playing the role of lead Nathaniel Poe, nicknamed Hawkeye, a humble enough local based in the north east of where Canada now meets the United States whom crash lands into a scenario of intense industrial warfare having survived this long on somewhat ancient, more traditionalist, methods of living.The aforementioned person Poe and his accomplices are charged with transporting for the early part is the daughter of a top British Colonel out on the front-line, a certain Edmund Munro (Roëves) who's in the midst of fighting the French at a secluded fort. The daughter is Madeleine Stowe's Cora Munro, the reoccurring element to a love triangle but much more than precisely that; a mere MacGuffin or a pretty face. She observes the worldly wilderness she's presently occupying as quite serene, even beautiful; her somewhat air-headed and bubbled demeanour suggesting a lack of exposure to what is truly unfolding within this place and much like the opening shots of the film, the cutting from something serene and easy on the eye into the object itself plus the revealing of the brutal manner in which this world functions coming to resemble how far along it is Cora goes in her own discovering of the nature of the land she's actually in. She is liked by a British major named Heyward (Waddington), a man whom is additionally on the trek with Poe and a handful of British soldiers charged with protecting her; but it is a connection that is not returned, thus paving the way for Day-Lewis' native whose clothing, characteristics and methods twinned with his rugged, handsome looks to win out over Heyward's physical traits of binary opposition. Poe himself even identifies his character as being ""a breed apart"" to that of the prim, sophisticated Cora, and their gradual romance amidst Heyward's admiration is well unfolded.Where Poe is perhaps the closest we have to a lead in a film which balances many person's tales from varying sides without really taking a definitive side with Wes Studi's Magua, a native to the lands, the closest to a stone-wall villain out to thwart those we predominantly cover. Magua is a ruthless and brutally effective machine-like character; clinical in combat and intelligent in his reasoning with allies. Mann paints dimensions to the man that keeps him from being the faceless, anonymous antagonistic force in the form of a savage out for blood and nothing more. The catalyst for his actions arrive in the form of the British doing what they did to his people, specifically to his family; his enemy effectively the British's imperialistic nature and a force we're meant to keep on a back burner of actually siding with. The scenes he shares with a French general with whom he is aligned due to said events carry a sense of purpose and meaningfulness, they outline his ideas and how he'll go about garnering his revenge thus rounding the character to an effective level. We feel a lesser film wouldn't go out of its way to include such scenes, and perhaps might've preferred a more anonymous, less complimentary portrait.Ultimately, the film works because of Mann's brilliant handling of a bunch of sub-plots and the relations characters have with one another plus the scenarios around them; the action made so much more involving and dramatic because of the manner in which Mann brings us to care so dearly for the people involved. Mann's refusing to shy away from the sort of violence on show gives off a heightened sense of danger or immediacy – as the film progresses, we fear similar fates of such extremities may happen to those we've come to quite like. The Last of the Mohicans is a quite gripping adventure film, the glue of which is Day-Lewis' composed and humanistic character whose homeland is in great strife and whose tale is told rather wonderfully in this impressive film.",The Last of the Mohicans
37,filipemanuelneto,An excellent film about Colonial America,7,2 June 2017,"I'm not an expert on US history, but I think I can say that this film, as far as historical accuracy is concerned, is one of the best I've seen. The uniforms, combat tactics, clothes, scenery, everything fits perfectly in the time and historical context that the film seeks to portray, and this is extraordinarily pleasing to people like me, who like to see a historically realistic film.The screenplay is based on an extremely famous novel by James Fenimore Cooper, although it did not faithfully follow the book. This may be good for dramatic effects, but it inevitably leads to choices and decisions that each viewer can judge good or bad. I, in particular, saw nothing that shocked me. Actors' work is very good, particularly Daniel Day Lewis, in the role of Hawkeye, a European who was adopted by a Mohican elder and grew up in Native American culture. We can consider this to be one of the most remarkable works of his career, opening the doors to a series of other projects where the actor would come to shine (""Gangs of New York"", ""There Will Be Blood"" etc.) Madeleine Stowe was equally well in the role of Cora. Finally, a note of praise for the soundtrack of the film, of excellent quality.",The Last of the Mohicans
38,digitalbeachbum,Could have been better but good,6,13 June 2020,"Daniel Day Lewis is a great actor. Period. He should be in the top ten list of all time best actors. I've not seen him a terrible movie, including this one.The reason why I didn't give a higher rating is that there are plenty of scenes which are fabricated and the original book had them too. Most likely James Cooper's attempt to make more drama. The movie magnifies this fabrication more for the visual pleasure of the viewer.While most of the story is true, the fabricated parts make me puke. I do not like when writers take creative liberty to change history, thus misinforming the viewers that these events are true to life.The supporting cast is very good, the production did a very good job on casting. All the actors did a wonderful job of presenting their characters with emotion and passion. The director did a good job of presenting the look and feel of the period. The setting and cinematography is good. The score/music is excellent and a worthy of your purchase.I have a few character flaws which bother me, namely the canoe chase, which is fabricated, but also the idea that the other canoes were not destroyed before leaving the shore. A simple knife through the buckskin would have rendered them useless and the characters would have know to do this so they would not be followed. It is scenes like this which are considered deus ex machina because the writer(s) force things to happen rather than using logic.",The Last of the Mohicans

40,Anonymous_Maxine,"A stunning war picture with amazing performances from all of the hundreds of actors involved, The Last of the Mohicans is a near flawless presentation of war-life in the 1700s.",10,3 February 2001,"The Last of the Mohicans is an epic portrayal of the conflicting interests of the French, the British, and the Native Americans in colonial America. The French and the Native Americans are allies, but the film throws in some completely unexpected and surprisingly effective plot twists toward the end, something that is relatively uncommon in period films. Mixed in with the adventurous atmosphere of war is a powerful romance that develops between Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe), who play two characters very unlikely to fall in love. Hawkeye was adopted by the Mohicans as an infant, and was raised by them for his entire life since then. Cora is the daughter of a British Colonel, and their romance is strikingly effective, and made even better by the settings. I think that the romance is especially notable here because usually, and especially in action or adventure films, whenever there is a significant romantic subplot, it usually seems to have been thrown in relatively clumsily and with the obvious objective of making the film appeal to a larger audience.  However, in The Last of the Mohicans, the romance is so well developed and so well acted that this is clearly not the case. Every part of the story in this film, including the romantic subplot, fit together flawlessly, resulting in a top-notch historical action drama.
Even better than the incredible performances and the fascinating story is the breathtaking cinematography and on-location settings. The film is literally packed full of amazing shots of the endless and stunningly beautiful colonial American countryside. This is one of the ways that the film is able to flawlessly bring the 1700s back to life with incredible reality. The film is beautifully shot by director Michael Mann, whose films seem to be getting better and better. Another thing that was done noticeably well in this film was the editing, particularly in the fast-paced and excellently executed battle scenes, which were brutal but rightfully so. I've always thought that the only excuse for excessive violence is if it's true, and this is the kind of thing that went on when this country was founded. The notable thing here is not how much violence there was, but how spectacular the presentation of history is, and in such a convincingly realistic way. (spoilers) The Last of the Mohicans is a look at a certain point in history as one point in a huge timeline. This is the revelation that makes the ending to the film one of the best endings in any film in years. The closing line, `Once, we were here,' is an acquiescent observation that no matter how hard they fight, the Mohicans will be gone someday, as will be the frontier itself, and a different people will someday inhabit the land. Such is the way that the world goes, things change, nothing lasts forever, but there are some who are willing to accept that and be proud of whatever mark they have made. THIS is how great films are made.",The Last of the Mohicans

Neither the French nor the English come out of ""The Last of the Mohicans"" with any credit.The settlers and the Indians were reaching a delicately balanced co - existence when the European Superpowers made it their business to present them with the dubious gift of ""civilisation"" whether they wanted it or not,and of course rape the country while they were at it. It was a situation that was never going to end well for the Native Americans,and nor did it.No wonder Magua(Mr W.Studi)was an angry man. In a marriage de convenance with the French he leads an attack on a column of defeated English soldiers led by the hated Grey Hair(Mr M Roeves)whose heart he cuts out and holds high in the air. A prisoner in this column is Hawkeye (Mr D.Day - Lewis) who rescues Grey Hair's daughters and takes to the hills. Hawkeye is seen in the opening sequence running speedily and gracefully with his long rifle through the woods and the overwhelming impression given by ""The Last of the Mohicans"" is one of breathless speed. Rarely does Hawkeye slow to walking pace except to play court to Cora(Miss M.Stowe) Grey Hair's elder daughter. Mr Day - Lewis is supremely athletic and devilishly handsome to boot,but it is Miss Stowe whose deceptively fragile beauty stays in my mind.She is exactly the type of woman who - in the coming years - will be needed to tame the continent. Magua remorselessly chases Hawkeye and his companions until he is despatched by Chingachkook the eponymous ""Last of the Mohicans"" .

43,dee.reid,"Fierce, bold, and beautiful - ""The Last of the Mohicans""",10,19 November 2004,"""The Last of the Mohicans"" was one of the most popular and acclaimed films of 1992. Its vision of early America, as it was during the French and Indian War, is captured in its utter brutality and beauty, complete with the many driving ambitions and clashing cultures of everyone involved.This movie has a bit of everything, including action, romance, war, and passionate drama. The director, Michael Mann, knows the story well and does all but completely discard James Fenimore Cooper's source material, which some have dubbed as being racist and totally unfair in its portrait of Native Americans.The story (and what a story) is all over the place, with three frontier scouts - Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis), Chingachgook (Russell Means), and Uncas (Eric Schweig) - escorting a British colonel's daughters - Cora and Alice Munro (Madeleine Stowe and Jodhi May respectively) - to safety at the besieged Fort William Henry. Major Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) rivals Hawkeye for Cora's affections and a vengeance-driven Huron named Magua (Wes Studi) seeks to have both daughters killed in retribution for the loss of his own children.This is by far Mann's best film yet (it ranks #15 on my all-time favorite movies list) and he uses the lush wilderness settings to great effect. He also makes good use of the editing, which actually comes in handy when showcasing the brutal violence that dominates much of the film's action sequences. The film's last 20 minutes are a definite stunner that can only be described as classic and vicious.This is a great movie that shows America in its infancy, complete with the rivalries, intrigue, and violence that I'm sure was an everyday part of life during this hectic time period.10/10",The Last of the Mohicans

45,smatysia,"What a superb film, wonderfully evocative of the colonial frontier.",8,14 December 1999,"What a superb film, wonderfully evocative of the colonial frontier. First the few quibbles: It seems that much of the plot came from Cooper's ""The Pathfinder"" rather than ""The Last of the Mohicans"". Also, as I recall, Natty Bumppo never showed the slightest romantic interest in Cora, or anyone else. He considered women an entanglement incompatible with his chosen lifestyle, i. e. a frontiersman. Also, I think no white woman would be attracted to an Indian then, no matter how good or heroic. I know it's the way of Hollywood to take interesting characters and invent new situations and adventures for them. Now, to what the film did especially well. Madeleine Stowe, beautiful as always, did a first-rate job here. Jodhi May favors her a bit, and thus is well-cast as her sister. The cinematography is breathtaking. One really ""gets"" the harshness of the frontier life, the sudden death from the forest, the smoke and confusion of colonial warfare. The portrayals of the Indians were more honest, I believe, than more politically correct films, such as ""Dances With Wolves"" where the sole focus was the nobility of the savages. Here you get a taste of the savagery, including scalping, mutilation of the dead, and the feeling that mercy is an unknown concept to Indians, the allied, as well as the enemy. Wes Studi should get particular credit for his portrayal of the Huron, Magua.",The Last of the Mohicans
46,jimbo-53-186511,"The subject matter's interesting, but the film itself was rather bland and uninvolving",4,18 February 2014,"Last of the Mohicans basically chronicles the French and Indian war in 1757 and is based on the book by James Fenimore Cooper. It follows 3 trappers who intercept an ambush by Native Americans on a small group of British Militia (which includes 2 of General Munro's daughters) who are being escorted to the General's fort. Love soon begins to blossom between Hawkeye (Day Lewis) who is an adopted son of the Mohicans and one of General Munro's daughters Cora Munro (Stowe). This angers one of the British Milita Major Duncan Heyward (Waddington) due to the fact that he too is in love with Cora.This film is dubbed as an 'Adventure' film, but for me there are certain things I expect when watching a film in this genre; excitement, interesting dialogue, funny/quirky/interesting characters (think Raiders of the Lost Ark). I know that this is a poor analogy as the 2 films are completely different, but the point I'm trying to make is that a really good adventure film will have all these things. A good adventure may have some of these things, but sadly for me Last of the Mohicans had none of these things. I found the characters to be rather dull, the dialogue for the most part was either corny or non descript. Aside from all this, the film was painfully slow and boring (particularly the first hour where very little happened).There were also problems from a technical aspect such as; some of the night time scenes - at one point where Cora and Hawkeye are being stalked by the Natives you can barely see anything because of how dark it was. This was meant to be a tense scene, but how can you feel any tension when you can't see anything? I swear that I was just staring at a blank screen for 10 minutes.There is a scene towards the end where Alice Munro (the General's other daughter)decides to jump off a cliff rather than be killed by Magua. I'm sure this scene will have been moving to a lot of people, but I wasn't particularly moved by her death because again her character was rather bland like most of the other characters in this film. This may sound cold, but I find it hard to get emotional at death scenes in films if characters are uninteresting or aren't well developed - sorry, but that's just me.Last of the Mohicans did get some things right; the score in this film was beautiful and is probably one of the film's greatest strengths so full credit goes to Randy Edelman & Trevor Jones. The battle sequences were well staged and exciting (although they came too infrequently for my liking). I also quite liked the way that Heyward sacrificed himself in order to let Cora and Hawkeye live. I thought his character was 'spineless' for the most part, but this was a nice plot twist and was a 'selfless' act by Heyward. I was also a bit moved when Hawkeye shot Heyward so that he would have a quick painless death rather than a slow painful death by being burned alive. The 2 men didn't get along throughout the film and both helped each other towards the end which was nice to see.The main problems with this film were that it was far too slow moving and the characters and dialogue were largely uninteresting and I was just never given much reason to care about anything that happened. That's a shame as with the interesting subject matter, the potential was most definitely there. Mann has made some great films in his time such as Manhunter Heat & Collateral, but Last of The Mohicans is not one of them.",The Last of the Mohicans

The three men lead the survivors to the English fort besieged by French forces and their Huron allies... The siege is a grand affair of roaring nighttime cannon and mortar attacks...Michael Mann's historical romance film gives a realistic picture of the frontier life, and a vivid impression of the horrors of warfare in the wilderness at the time where the combatants often had time for one shot before being overpowered and reduced to hand-to-hand fierce combat...

48,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Gorgeous masterwork,10,22 July 2015,"Before Terrence Malick lyrically explored the relationship between settlers, natives and nature in The New World, Michael Mann crafted the emotionally gripping, beautifully feral The Last Of The Mohicans, which to me me is the best film version of Cooper's book. Daniel Day Lewis is a force of nature as Nathaniel Hawkeye, the white man raised by his adoptive Native father (Russell Means) and living in the wild. Madeleine Stowe is a dark haired candle of radiance and fierce spirit as the lovely Cora Munro, brought from the prim, lacy traditions of England out to the wild, uncompromising new land, with her impressionable, naive sister (Jodi May). Wes Studi gives the bitter hearted warrior Magua a steady grace and brutal resolve. The film is lovingly made, and although it drags a tiny bit in the middle with a lengthy battle sequence that although is beautifully done, could have been streamlined a bit. But it's all worth it for those last twenty minutes, man. Holyyy hell does this movie have an ending. When the final, white knuckle climax happens atop the scenic yet unforgiving Promentory Vista, hearts, bones and dreams are broken as all the characters collide in a tragic, inevitable confrontation that leaves fire in your heart and tears in tour eyes. I still cry every time at this sequence, it's that stirring and memorable. James Newton Howard provides a legendary, soul stirring musical score that swells for this end sequence and carries it to transcendent heights. Mann directs with a compassionate, objective eye, never designating anyone as the good or bad guy, but simply showing us human beings, fighting for survival, love and revenge in a land only just being discovered.

49,questl-18592,Marvel Present: Hawkeye Origins,6,20 November 2020,"Expectations are a dangerous thing. I don't recall ever watching this before, given my upbringing I feel as though I must have seen it but I didn't remember it at all as I watched it. Still, it's hard not to hear about it, to develop an unspoken anticipation for it. Simply having DDL as a lead is enough to spark a sense of film greatness.All that to say I was a little disappointed that I didn't love this. It's good, it's all good. The acting is solid, it's beautiful. It did feel very early 90s Oscar-bait to me but I probably shouldn't knock it that hard for that. As I was watching it though, I wasn't disliking the experience but I kept waiting for something, anything to signal, ""This is it, this is what sets this one apart"" and it never really arrived for me. This may also seem blasphemous but I kept having these flashes of Mel Gibson's The Patriot as I watched this. Yes, I know LotM came first but I can't help which I saw first.This is more than likely a spectacular movie. I wish I'd had that experience with it but it seems as though it should check all the boxes but it just didn't resonate with me properly. It's absolutely worth watching for those who haven't seen it.

50,rbverhoef,Beautiful,9,3 January 2004,"Sometimes a movie looks very beautiful but that's about it, 'The Mission' comes to mind. Sometimes a movie looks and sounds great and it is already enough to like the movie and for me 'The Last of the Mohicans' is one of those movies. Fortunately there is so much more.The story is set in 1757 in a time where France and Britain are fighting over America. Three people do not want to join that war. Chingachgook (Russell Means), an Indian of the Mohican tribe, his son Uncas (Eric Schweig) and his white adopted son Nathaniel Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis). They do end up in that war because they help a British major named Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) who is escorting the two daughters of Col. Edmund Munro (Maurice Roëves). They were attacked by the Huron tribe and their leader Magua (Wes Studi) hates Munro and therefore his daughters as well. The daughters are named Alice (Jodhi May) and Cora (Madeleine Stowe). The three decide to escort the major and the daughters and once they have arrived at the fort where Munro is they are not allowed to leave.How the story develops is not for me to say, but you can understand there must be a love story between Hawkeye and Cora and that things must be settled with Magua. The story is interesting and actually pretty good, mainly because the clichés are made interested. A love story, the character the major is, a sacrifice, it is all there but done in a great way.Back to the beauty. The locations are great and beautiful and they are on the screen almost the entire movie. The cinematography is splendid. Another very good thing is the costumes and everything that comes with that. It is not only what we see but also what we hear. It won the Oscar for Best Sound and not without a reason. We also hear the music and it is one of the most beautiful scores I know. The song ""I Will Find You"", performed by Clannad, is beautiful as well.Daniel-Day Lewis is, as always, very good and probably the perfect actor for Hawkeye. Even better is Madeleine Stowe, who owns every scene she is in. Them together is what we want to see and that is what we get, and they make sure it is the way we want it. Lewis, Stowe, Wes Studi as the evil Magua and the others do a great job. Directed by Michael Mann, who made good movies like 'Manhunter' before this and great movies like 'Heat' and 'The Insider' after this, this is a great movie that I enjoy every time I see it.",The Last of the Mohicans

53,philip_vanderveken,This movie is so much better than what I first expected...,8,12 July 2005,"My first reaction when I heard that this movie was more or less a combination of a western with a costume drama: Please allow me to run away while screaming as loud as I can. I just couldn't think of any other combination that is worse, but as always I tried to keep an open mind towards it and I was willing to give it a try. After reading some reviews on this website and seeing that it got a very nice rating of 7.5/10, I was convinced that this movie might actually be different. And it was, no doubt about that...As the battle for colonial America goes on between the English and the French, both helped by various Indian war parties, the British troops enlist the help of local colonial and native American militia men. But these men are reluctant to leave their homes undefended and three of them, who all belong to a dying tribe called the Mohicans, refuse to enter the militia. Two of these men are original tribesman, the third one is a white man who was adopted by the Mohicans as a kid. When the three are on their way to Kentucky, they see how a small regiment of British soldiers, including the two daughters of an English Colonel, are attacked by an Indian war party on their way to a fort. The three men save them and lead the survivors to their destination. In the meantime, encouraged by the events and the presence of the three 'wild' men, the two women start to change from (for that time period) typical, obedient and silent women into independent and strong women with a will of their own...Now that I've seen this movie I can only come to the conclusion that I'm happy that I didn't follow my first opinion. This movie certainly isn't as bad as I feared it would be. This is without any doubt a very fine movie and there are many reasons for that. One of the reasons is the very nice story. It not only gives a good idea of how the colonial wars were fought at that time, but it also breaks some typical boundaries. Instead of showing the woman as silent, helpless and obedient toys for the obviously heroic men, this movie changes all that. The women get an important and strong role in the story and I really appreciated that. Also the fact that the Indians weren't automatically seen as one big bunch of blood thirsty, wild and crazy men, driving on the back of a horse without a saddle, over the vast Western prairie and shooting with bow and arrow, was a relief. But not only the story was more than OK, so was the direction and the acting. With a director like Michael Mann, you can't expect any less than a great movie of course. With movies like ""Heat"", ""The Insider"", ""Collateral""... he has more than once proved that he knows what he is doing. But what is a good director without a good cast to work with? Absolutely nothing. With people like Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe, Russell Means, Eric Schweig,... he had a cast that was a very nice mix of well-known and not so famous actors and they all did a very good job. Together with the story, they made this movie and its characters come to live. These people didn't feel like they were made out of cardboard, they felt genuine and that's something that you don't always get in a movie.Overall this is a very good movie with some very nice acting, good direction, a fine story and last but not least some very beautiful music. For some that may not be important, but for me it is. I prefer to hear no music at all, rather than an annoying tune in the background. The music needs to be good and has to support the movie and that's exactly what it does in this film. I must say that I liked everything about this movie and that's why I believe that it doesn't deserve a rating lower than 7.5/10. Even an 8/10 isn't exaggerated in my opinion.",The Last of the Mohicans
54,tomsview,Chivalry along the Mohawk Valley,9,29 January 2016,"This version of ""The Last of the Mohicans"" is unlikely to date all that much. Although made in the early 1990's, it is set in a time over 200 years before, and captures the era beautifully.I have always been fascinated by this period of history probably from seeing Spencer Tracy as Robert Rogers in ""Northwest Passage"" – I have read that James Fennimore Cooper partly modelled the character of Hawkeye on Rogers.In some ways Cooper's book has similarities with Sir Walter Scott's ""Ivanhoe"", which was published a few years before; outsider hero, women in need of rescue and a ferocious adversary with an eye on the same woman, all set against epic sieges and battles. But Cooper set his story six centuries later during the French and Indian Wars in North America with plumed helmets, chainmail and swords replaced with Mohawk haircuts, breechclouts and tomahawks.Cecil B DeMille's ""Unconquered"" is the other big movie set during the period, but it looks pretty clunky when compared to this visual feast – as do all the other versions of ""The Last of the Mohicans"".Michael Mann's film transports us to another era. It's comforting to know the filmmakers actually found enough wilderness to film in without encountering power towers, amenities blocks and 'Do Not Feed the Bears' signs.The cast is perfect: Daniel Day-Lewis makes a lean and athletic Hawkeye and Madeleine Stowe as Cora is a heroine you could believe the guys would go that extra yard to save. Wes Studi as Magua is suitably ferocious as just about everybody's enemy.Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman came up with a memorable, Celtic-flavoured score, which reflected the background of many of the settlers of the time. Celtic music was particularly popular around the 1990s, but I was fascinated to hear this soundtrack album played often by the young people in the office where I worked along with the usual alternative metal, industrial rock and g-funk.Although the film is obviously meticulously researched, the ear occasionally picks up on a too-modern piece of dialogue, but it's a minor point. The whole thing is such an intriguing, superbly crafted adventure that it just sweeps you along. It's hard to believe it's almost 25-years old. There really aren't too many films like it these days.",The Last of the Mohicans
55,jjnxn-1,Hard to imagine a better version,10,30 April 2013,"Stirring adventure with pitch perfect performances across the board. Mann's direction is masterful in grabbing you from the first moments and keeping you involved until the moving final scene. Many components go into making a film entertaining but one of the most important here is the music. It is fantastic at giving the picture a sweeping feeling of the period. Probably one of the best, most organically fitting film scores ever. How it was overlooked at awards time is a mystery.The details of the period are well thought out and even though I'm sure it was a gritter existence than portrayed an effort is made to give the viewer a feeling of the rigors of frontier life. All this would be for naught if you didn't care about the characters and that is where the film truly excels. Eric Schweig and Jodhi May make something memorable out of the secondary parts of Uncas and Alice. Wes Studi is a throughly deplorable Magua, Steven Waddington makes Duncan more than the officious martinet he so easily could have been and Russell Means is compelling as Chingachgook. The real power of the piece however rests in the central love story between Nathaniel and Cora, DDL and Stowe elevate that to something special. While Daniel Day-Lewis is a brilliant actor he is not always a romantic one but paired with Madeleine Stowe they share that lightening in a bottle thing called great chemistry. Whenever they share the screen it crackles with the spark between them and as with all great screen couples like Tracy & Hepburn or Myrna Loy & William Powell their mere presence makes an already superior film better.Action packed, occasionally very violent, and beautifully photographed with everyone working at the highest level this is a great consistently involving film.",The Last of the Mohicans
56,mstomaso,"Beautifully Envisioned, and Nicely Told... a Few Awkward Moments",7,2 May 2008,"Michael Mann's take on J. F. Cooper's famous novel stick to the original story and characters very nicely, and brings together a great cast for some great performances. Daniel Day Lewis, Russel Means and Madeleine Stowe get the leads, but I have to mention the stand-out performance from Wes Studi (as Magua) - stunning! The story takes place during the ""French and Indian War"" and centers around the ill-fated British Fort William Henry. It is about a young white man (Day-Lewis) who has been adopted into the Mohican tribe and is a member of the last Mohican family (headed by Means). Hawkeye, his father and brother, side with the English almost accidentally, and Lewis falls for a spirited daughter of the fort's pompous and authoritarian commander. The story is loaded with action, subtle and more powerful dialog, minor plot twists, and a penetrating analysis of cultural dissonance and conflict.The love story, at times, is over-dramatized and allowed to distract from the story, but this minor problem is overlooked in this fine film.The film features beautiful landscapes (many of which I recognize from hiking the Adirondacks), a strikingly interesting-looking and nicely talented cast, and a refreshingly Native American cast playing Native Americans. The cinematography is delicious, and aside from the minor directorial/editing issue mentioned above, this is one of the better directed versions of The Last of the Mohicans.

Outstanding performances by all the players too.

Lots of action all down to earth concerning men and women who live hard lives living off the land. Nothing back then was given away either. Helping one another if you could made sense. We get to see the worst in the French and the British while everyone else battles it out for land and goods.

60,hall895,A mixed bag,5,26 March 2008,"A historical epic, set during the French and Indian War, The Last of the Mohicans is a movie which has a lot going for it but it also has enough working against it to make the entire package less than satisfying. It's a movie with stunningly brilliant cinematography. Very few movies look as nice. There are some exceedingly well done battle scenes. There are some very good acting performances, most notably from Wes Studi as a truly memorable and menacing villain. Unfortunately there are many areas in which the film fails. Most importantly, the story fails to engage. Yes, there are the nice battle scenes but what happens in between those scenes does not measure up. The pace of the film is slow and plodding and all too often the story being presented simply isn't interesting. It's a movie about romance as much as it is about action. And the romance just doesn't work. The two lead performers, Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe, have little to no chemistry. And the fact that their characters, who come from very different backgrounds to say the least, fall in love seemingly at the drop of a hat strains credulity. As the movie progresses their ""epic"" romance really isn't very epic at all. The passion and drama in this relationship is sorely lacking. And with so much of the focus on this couple the film ends up being rather dull until another battle scene comes along to liven things up again.For a performer with as many notable credits as Day-Lewis, it must be said that his performance here is disappointing. Stiff, awkward, forced and unconvincing. And as it is his character of Hawkeye, adopted son of the last of the Mohicans of the film's title, who is very much the focus of the story the film never really has much of a chance to succeed. There are some nice pieces around Day-Lewis but his performance has to hold the movie together and he proves to be rather surprisingly not up to the task. If you can't buy into his character you can't buy into the movie. But even a truly brilliant performance would not have been able to hide all the flaws of the story. Much too often the film seems to be simply biding time, with nothing of any particular significance happening. The battle scenes may grab your attention but that's about it. As an action movie the film works. As a romantic drama it fails. And unfortunately the film is too much romance, too little action. It's a movie which leaves you much more impressed with the background scenery than with the story itself.",The Last of the Mohicans

I get a little sick of Daniel Day Lewis doing films that set out to make the English look B*****ds( he should look at some of his own Country's history!). This film was just a vehicle for Lewis to run about waving his Ladyboy hair around. I would love to go into what the film was about but i have forgot already!

62,KnightsofNi11,A fun and dramatic film,7,26 August 2012,"Michael Manne shows off his dedication and ambition in this large scale period piece set in the midst of the French Indian war. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Hawkeye, a white Native American who, along with his father and brother, protect a British Colonel's daughters from the dangerous Native American tribe threatening their safety. It's an explosive, dramatic, and grandiose story of adventure. It's definitely an exciting film to watch.The Last of the Mohicans doesn't tell an exceptional story and it doesn't have immaculate characters, but there's a certain element to the film that makes it good. Very good actually. It likely has to do with the grand production value that the film boasts at every corner with it's detailed costumes and sets, large sweeping locations, and a collection of fine actors giving it their all. The film also has a fantastic score that combines with the beautiful cinematography to make a very dramatic experience. Albeit over dramatic at points, but a sincerely well made film nonetheless.Some of these bigger and more ambitious films often times go right past me and I don't really remember them down the line. It's mostly just a matter of personal taste, but I can't deny the quality of The Last of the Mohicans. Michael Mann shows a lot of dedication to filmmaking through this film, as it notoriously went well over budget and time, and Mann allegedly would do about 20 takes for each shot. He's absolutely a determined filmmaker, and I would say it pays off when you see the production value of a film like The Last of the Mohicans. Despite it being a little cheesy, fairly straightforward, and a little too basic for my taste, the quality of the film can't be overlooked, and this is certainly a fun and exciting film overall.",The Last of the Mohicans

Fine performances by Daniel Day-Lewis, Madelaine Stowe (her best role, ever), Russell Means and Wes Studi capture the essence of the Cooper novel.  The perfect romantic adventure, and one of the best films of the 90s, if not the twentieth century.",The Last of the Mohicans
64,Holt344,"The Last of the Mohicans is an adventure film you won't forget, Daniel Day-Lewis is Hawkeye",10,29 January 2021,"The Last of the Mohicans is set in 1757 during the French and Indian War, it has Daniel Day-Lewis in the main role as Nathaniel ""Hawkeye"" Poe and Madeleine Stowe as Cora Munro, and Jodhi May, Russell Means, Wes Studi, Eric Schweig, and Steven Waddington in supporting roles. Daniel Day-Lewis is a superb and fascinating actor, he's on my list of best actors and seeing him again in this film makes me appreciate his performance even more, the language and everything he had to learn for the role. He went all in and it showed, one of the film's many highlights. He even lived in the wilderness for a few months before photography begun and hunted, fished and just lived off the land. That's dedication to the role, and he did a phenomenal job with the acting performance.
It was co-written and directed by Michael Mann, he's a fantastic in both of those things. His visual storytelling is superior, giving us information of characters without use of dialogue and other ways of visual storytelling.
The Last of the Mohicans is also a very well written film, it's based on a book which makes it stand out even more, all characters feel real, mostly thanks to the script but also the actors who play them.They did a incredible job at recreating accurate costumes and props for the film, everything feels so real and authentic to the era. Hair and makeup department was also amazing.
Dante Spinotti was the cinematographer and he continues with his extraordinary work, truly worth noting how beautiful the movie looks.The musical score is powerful and emotional, Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman did a phenomenal job with the soundtrack. It flows so well for every scene, probably thanks to how it is edited. How they used it for the fight sequences, just wow.
The sound mixing and design were also great, all the sounds feel real. Worthy of its Oscar.I watched this film maybe 8 or 9 years ago, but re-watching it now at an older age and with more knowledge of the Native American tribes and history, I found it much more interesting this time around on top of how well made and entertaining it was and still is. The realistic fight sequences, well choreographed and spectacular, that's what I remember the most, and the whole second half is clear to me as it has most iconic and memorable moments.
Nathaniel ""Hawkeye"" Poe is a great hero but a character I enjoyed more was Magua, on paper he's a villain but he's so well written and grey that you see past the horrible things he does. That is how a villain should be, and the writers delivered.",The Last of the Mohicans
65,tbills2,How is this all-timer not in the Top250?,10,14 July 2010,"This is definitely underrated. Last of the Mohicans just barely falls short of 4-star caliber, but recognizing that it is not quite perfect, I still hold this as one of my favorite 20 films, maybe even top 10 for me. The flaws are very minor. It has a very epic story, but it isn't presented on screen in the most epic manner. The scenes, cuts, and camera angles are just a little weak. I would of liked more widescreen, epic-type shots. The love story has to develop, and it sort of slows the pace of the film. But not too bad at all. That's almost nitpicking. The writing and dialogue is decent at times; it doesn't have enough impactful lines throughout. The characters do not have the greatest depth to them, but doesn't that sort of play to the ending, that the star of the final scene was a side character who barely spoke. I thought the ending was brilliant obviously. No one can argue that the final half-hour or so of this film isn't absolutely awesome. The score during the end is great. Daniel Day Lewis is phenomenal like in all of his roles. Madeleine Stowe is strong. There are 3 distinct scenes that make this movie for me, the waterfall scene, the ambush/battle scene, and the end. Those scenes are all A+ quality and the ending is one of the best ever. It's certain parts of other scenes that barely lessen the film. I agree that Last of the Mohicans just falls short of a masterpiece, but it should be well into the Top250; it is a shame that so many valuable flicks like this one get such low scores. Last of the Mohicans, Titanic, Apollo 13, among many others are getting seriously mistreated. To have a list of the best movies and leave out so many sure-fire classics almost spoils it all. But I can understand how the haters will hate for no reason on certain movies and hence destroy the rating, but Last of the Mohicans doesn't seem like the kind of film that would spawn many haters. That makes the 7.8 score even more confusing. This deserves higher ratings. If I was a film critic I would give this movie a 9/10, but just being a fan of cinema, I can forgive the minor flaws and appreciate the movie as a whole. Gets a perfect 10/10. I really loved this movie.",The Last of the Mohicans
66,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,An epic and compelling classic that touched me in my first viewing!,10,23 September 2012,"I have yet to read the book someday if I have the chance, although I did watch this movie on a channel in TV with my father and stepmother to see if it would not only thrill me, but actually touch me. A few minutes later, it did and I looked at the positive reviews on Rottentomatoes before I became shocked at the reception it had. I was like, ""A 97%? WOW! No wonder so many people like it"" and I apparently agreed with the audience who watched this movie when it first came out that it's one of the best ones out there next to Titanic, The Lord of the Rings, and Batman.The story is quite simple as an adaptation: About a dying tribe called the Mohicans in which only two are left as well as one adopted white man named Hawkeye. These three men refuse to enter the militia for Britain in 1757 for they want freedom. On their way to Kentucky, they intercept Indians attacking a small regiment of British including the two daughters of an British Colonel named Edmund Munroe and Cora and Alice, on their way to a fort. As the three men lead the survivors to the fort, the two love stories take place, but the French and Indian War continues.Like I said before, I haven't read the book yet, but the story in this movie, although sprawling, is a much more compelling one with some subtly and quiet moments and the love story between the two main characters is also compelling as well. The pacing moves under two hours and didn't manage to bore me at all. The scenery is breathtaking with beautiful mountains and rivers and the cinematography is magnificent. The strongest aspects goes to three more things aside from Michael Mann's solid direction.First, there's the acting and in terms of cinema, it's excellent here. Daniel Day-Lewis is excellent as the main role, Russell Means did great as Hawkeye's father, Maurice Roves did great as Colonel Edmund and Madeleine Stowe did great as the love interest for Hawkeye along with a malevolent performance from Wes Studi. Second, there's the action sequences and boy were they great. I liked every single part of them especially the ones with the Indians and the British troops, but the strongest aspect of the action is the climax with an emotional feel to it. And third, but not the least, is the music from Trevor Jones. It gives the movie a sweeping and epic feel and scope and is one of his best music scores in a film since The Dark Crystal.Overall, I do agree that it's one of the best movies ever made and even though I never read the book (which I will someday), this would always be recommended to every single movie lover out there like most movies are.

While there is no serious flaw with the picture's length, you could say the climax is a little rushed and underwhelming.

69,Igenlode Wordsmith,Over-indulgent and underwhelming,5,5 August 2006,"I missed my supper, spent two hours travelling in hot weather, and paid good money to see this film on the big screen; and I was disappointed at the result, to put it mildly. If I'd seen it on TV, I'd have written it off as a bad recommendation, but as it was I found myself resenting the waste of an entire evening on a film that both confused me and failed to hold my interest -- quite an achievement for an epic as bloody as this.The film left me emotionally unengaged apart from the last fifteen minutes or so, when it finally seemed to zoom in on the individual characters rather than getting lost in misty landscapes, massacre after massacre after slaughter, and poor oppressed Americans under the heel of faithless, cowardly Brits. (And then, I'm afraid, it lost me again in its final scene, a weepy New Age set-piece that seems to ignore the vast number of previous deaths in the film.) I thought I knew the story, but didn't recognise many scenes here until the final sequence; due to a paucity of dialogue I was often left at a loss as to what exactly was happening or had just taken place. The siege of the fort is a case in point -- until the Mohicans arrive and disclose that the confused inside-and-out montage we have just been shown represents French forces sapping parallels towards the English-held fort to bring the walls under direct fire, I honestly had very little idea of what I was watching... and if I hadn't happened to enjoy an extensive working knowledge of 18th-century siege warfare, I wonder how much wiser I'd have been after this explanation! Language-wise, there doesn't seem to be a great deal of rationale in the intermittent use of subtitles. Characters still adopt the cinematic custom of speaking English with heavy foreign accents even at moments when this is clearly inappropriate save for purposes of audience comprehension, e.g. Montcalm conversing with his allies in his own camp, Chingachgook's mourning speech for his people. Then at other moments we suddenly get launched into the ultra-realism of, for example, a three-way debate in English, French and Huron, with Duncan Heyward displaying hitherto unsuspected skills at UN-level simultaneous translation -- and it all comes across as a bit gratuitous.Romance doesn't seem to be the director's strong suit. The affair between Cora Munro and Hawkeye (referred to, confusingly, throughout as ""Nathaniel"" without any real elucidation) created for the purposes of the film is less than convincing, but the supposed love between Uncas and Alice is not so much subtle as non-existent: for all intents and purposes it's simply not there. How anyone who doesn't already know the story is supposed to interpret the sudden outburst of meaningful looks in the last scene, I'm not sure.To be honest, ""Last of the Mohicans"" is the sort of modern motion picture that reminds me why I prefer the older variety: bloody, sickening, short on dialogue and character (your average silent film does a far better job of conveying events clearly without words), long on scenery, and a sight keener on giving the impression of being 'meaningful' than on actually telling a story. The Mel-Gibson-style political anachronisms grate, too.Maybe I'd do better to stick to the films of an era in whose conventions I feel more at home -- I'll keep an eye out for the 1930s version! Meanwhile, despite some lush landscapes, I really can't recommend this to anyone who shares my tastes: it's amazing that any film with this much action can come across as tedious, but somehow it managed it...",The Last of the Mohicans
70,artzau,This film has it all! EXCELLENT!!!,10,18 July 2001,"Romance, action and hope.  Emotion without sentiment.  Love interest without explicit sex scenes.  An excellent film and one of my absolute favorites.  I had read all of James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking series as a kid and had seen the '36 version with Randolph Scott.  But, this film got me from the git-go.  I suppose reading those books, seeing that old film (it was old when I saw it as a kid, having been made and released a year before I was born) and reading everything else about Red Indians-- now appropriately called Native Americans-- I could get my hands on contributed to my becoming an anthropologist.  But, in spite of Mark Twain's scathing critiques of the Leatherstocking series (I don't think Twain liked JF Cooper's face), they were exciting to me as a kid. And, this film was exciting to me as an adult. The story here only conforms to the skeleton of the original but the presentation is convincing and authentic.  The performances of the Native American actors, the delightful Wes Studi, Russell Means, Eric Sweig and Dennis Banks are wonderful.  Small parts are also seen with character actors Pete Postelthwaite and Colm Meany and the rival Duncan Heyward is given a pompous twist by Brit Actor, Steven Waddington.  The Munro girls with Madeleine Stowe and Jodhi May are likewise delightful, with Stowe inserting a bit of early feminism into her role.  May's fawn-like big eyes suggesting a delicate vulnerability lends itself well.  The romantic interest with the handsome young Uncas is not as well developed as it was in the '36 version, but that's not a failing.  All in all, this film has become one of my all time favorites.  I've seen it at least 6 times and plan to see it at least that many times more-- this year.",The Last of the Mohicans
71,Blue-Grotto,Filmmakers improve upon book,10,17 August 2017,"There are worse things than being scalped in the wilderness of the North American frontier in 1757. There are those who poison hearts. Magua, a Huron warrior with a twisted heart full of greed and lust for revenge, is skilled at doing both. In a surprise attack on a company of woefully unprepared British troops in the forest, Magua nearly succeeds in killing a pair of sisters – Cora and Alice Munro - traveling with the unfortunate soldiers. The Munro sisters and their protector, Major Duncan Heyward, are rescued by a trio of Mohican trackers. Among the Mohicans is a pale skinned marksman named Hawkeye. In order to keep their scalps, the Brits stick with the roaming Mohicans. Cora and Hawkeye, both fiercely independent spirits, become infatuated with each other along the way. Duncan unravels at this. He wants Cora for himself. In anger and jealousy Duncan risks accomplishing the very evils that Magua, still-circling and keen for the kill, intends. Hearts are as lethal as hatchets.Filmmakers often do not do book authors any favors, yet this is one case where they do. James Fenimore Cooper's machismo manifesto is spiced up with added romance and without ruining the underlying narrative. Action lovers are not left hung out to dry. Hatchets shine red, warriors swagger, cannon balls thump on fort walls, bodies tumble from cliffs and scalps are snapped up like action figures at dragon-con.From the outset of the film, where Hawkeye runs adeptly and tirelessly through the forest in pursuit of prey, the intensity and dedication of actor Daniel Day-Lewis is highlighted. The film could be watched merely for the enjoyment of his acting skills. Hawkeye is one of the roles that Day-Lewis seems destined to portray and it is hard to imagine the two apart. Madeleine Stowe (Cora) and Day-Lewis provide fervent chemistry. We delight in the combining of these two generous and independent souls. Wes Studi is a natural as Magua. He wields heartlessness and hatchet with equally fearsome effectiveness.One of the wonders of the story, which combines real events and fiction, is that it reveals the roots and nature of the ideal American character. This character is exemplified by Hawkeye whose holds dear the wilderness and has an independent spirit, open heart, outdoor skills and moral courage. ""Whoever comes into the woods to deal with the natives,"" wrote Cooper ""must use native fashions, if they would wish to prosper in their undertakings."" Hawkeye intuitively understands and demonstrates this. He knows both worlds of natives and settlers alike, and is beholden to none. Educated under sky and forest canopy, he is fearless, generous and sympathetic. The American frontier may be shrinking along with the Mohicans, yet the spirit lives on. It is the fabric that ties Americans together and director Michael Mann brings it to life.On the 25th anniversary of the film release, one can look back from the sleep inducing dullness of the overly used computer animation era and appreciate amazing old-school thrills. Upstate New York is the setting of the story, yet the beautiful waterfalls, mountains and old growth forests of North Carolina serve as the backdrops for the film. The Celtic influenced soundtrack is so mesmerizing that you will find yourself humming it aloud and, if off-tune, irritating your neighbors.

The movie is directed by Michael Mann. The story is based off of the story The Last of the Mohicans by James Fenimore Cooper and The Last of the Mohicans by Philip Dunne. The movie stars Daniel Day-Lewis, and Madeleine Stowe. The movie uses the French and Indian War as a backdrop to tell a tale of romance and adventure.The Last of the Mohicans is a movie with a grand feeling. It has a large scope but dials it down to the small interactions between characters. It blends these two scopes to create a nice experience as the characters navigate a conflict larger than them. The main character of Daniel Day-Lewis as Hawkeye or Nathanial Poe is a great character. He is played magnificently by Daniel Day-Lewis. He delivers a great performance in this movie and is one of Daniel Day-Lewis' heroic roles.The Last of the Mohicans is one of the rare movies in the musket era of history. It captures the exploration and frontier combat incredibly well in this era. I enjoyed every aspect of this movie that had to deal with the frontier. This is a movie that does not focus at all on the war or even the civilian aspect of life during this era. This is very much a movie that is focused completely on the frontier and aspects of it.The movie is incredibly beautiful. There are many sweeping shots of the gorgeous frontier that the producers of this movie should be commended for.

The score to this film is amazing, Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman have really outdone themselves. The cast is exceptional and the cinematography is completely captivating. This is a great film.",The Last of the Mohicans
74,Bababooe,"Let me explain why this film deserves only 1 star. Better to name it ""The Adventures of a White Mohican""",1,2 June 2019,"The 1 star goes to the actors who did a fine job, and the music, but all involved are guilty bystanders and collaborators to the insulting screenplay and film.So, let's call the movie ""Last of the Mohicans"", but the story is about saving a couple of daughters of the commander of a British fort during the 1750s French and Indian War. The Mohicans are side characters. That's the insult. We witness the French surrounding a British fort, a romance between the white adopted Mohican and the older daughter, and the 2nd in command jealously. Soap Anyone? The commander sentencing the White Mohican to death for conspiring against his command. This is the guy who saved his daughters. Just plain contrived simpleton contrived nonsense for failed suspense. Now if the commander executed Lewis at this point, at least that would be something.Then, rather that fighting, the commander gives up the fort to the French, and they take off with their weapons. Highly unlikely. The British would probably fight to the last. I could just imagine what his superiors would say, ""you gave up the for without a fight? No problem. Here's your pension."" No. And if they surrendered, the French would either take prisoners and/or their weapons. Anyway, what follows is a true simpleton scene. These supposed professional soldiers just walk into an ambush by Indians allied with the French, and most are slaughtered. Completely ridiculous. Still nothing to do with the Mohicans. It's just a setup for Mr. White Mohican and his adopted father and brother to save the 2 daughters again. The British commander is killed by Mr. Bad Indian for some revenge against the white devil. In the heat of the battle Mr. Bad Indian has time to cut out the commander's heart out and hold it out for dramatic effect. This has to be bottom of the barrel stuff. A true low point in cinematic history.In the end, Mr. White Mohican saves the older sister, her sister commits suicide by jumping off the cliff rather than be with Mr. Bad Indian, his adopted brother (The true Last Mohican, with little screen time or dialogue, aka background character) is killed, his adopted father kills Mr. Bad Indian for revenge, and the 3 of them stand around at the end with words of The Last Mohican, and we see Mr. White Mohican and the British woman looking lovingly posing for the end credits, as I was looking around for an insulated barf bag.Everybody praises the cinematography. Nonsense. It's just plane safe boring point and shooting. The music was good. But was overused. The action was basic superhero stuff. You know the type. The story is garbage. I did not read the book. But I read tons of reviews on imdb, and those who read the book tear it apart, as they should. This is not about The Last Mohican. It's about a white man adopted by Mohicans and his implausible and contrived adventures in trying to save his love interest.",The Last of the Mohicans
75,WriterDave,An Overlooked Classic,9,19 March 2003,"Whenever I think back on the best films of the 1990's this one always seems to slip my mind. But then I'll see it again and be left wondering why this isn't more well regarded. It was relatively successful at the box office and well reviewed upon release but failed to gain attention at the end of the year awards season. This is probably Michael Mann's best film (although a valid argument could be made for his epic crime saga ""Heat""), a talented director who later became president of the ""running time be damned"" club of obsessive pretentious film makers. It is an excellent adaptation of James Fennimore Cooper's classic tale of the French and Indian War. It's got everything you would want in a historical epic: beautiful cinematography of mountain vistas and valleys, a pulse-pounding and wonderful musical score, taut direction, romance, solid battle scenes, some great hand to hand combat sequences (I love the edge of the mountain climax), and riveting performances from the two leads (the always excellent Daniel Day Lewis and the ravishing Madeleine Stowe). This is a great film, but unfortunately may only be known to future generations as one of those films they air on TNT or TBS every so often.",The Last of the Mohicans
76,chunkylefunga,Let down.,4,3 May 2021,"I was expecting this movie to be epic.Sadly what we get is a very outdate white american view of native americans.Coupled with one dimensional characters, a paper thin plot, and very butchered acting.I really didn't care about any of the characters.Can only imagine this was something different for the era it was released in because in the 20s this movie is very outdated.",The Last of the Mohicans
77,beresfordjd,Dreary,6,2 November 2012,"A well made and well meaning movie but I was surprised to find myself so unengaged in the story. Daniel Day Lewis looks great but can be seen to be acting rather than being his character. I really found the whole enterprise rather dreary and even boring at times. Dressing a set and costuming the participants is never a waste of time but if the actors are not convincing then you are onto a loser. Only the Native Americans were believable in this film. Magua was a terrific character and was easy to hate at first but then to sympathise with when you knew why he hated so much himself. Some of the action sequences were well directed and set up but I was disappointed that the musical score was not more stirring at these points. Perhaps it is my dislike for Day Lewis's hammy performances that spoil the films I have seen with him in them. This , I guess his least hammy performance but it is still unconvincing.",The Last of the Mohicans
78,AKS-6,One of my favourite films,8,6 July 2001,"[This comment contains SPOILERS!]The Last of the Mohicans is one of those films that I can watch over and over again without getting tired of it. While it may not be Michael Mann's best film, it is certainly his most entertaining. And that ending always makes me cry like a baby! This movie and e.g. Glory get to me in that way, no matter how many times I see the film, sure enough, by the end I'm blubbering.Nice performances by most of the cast, especially Daniel Day-Lewis and Eric Schweig (in a supporting role). Also, an absolutely brilliant score! The Last of the Mohicans is a very entertaining film, and I like it a lot. (7-8 out of 10)",The Last of the Mohicans
79,bat-5,Fiercely romantic.,8,17 October 1999,"From the opening elk hunt, you are grabbed and you can't tearyour eyes away until the very end.  Michael Mann's adaptation ofthe venerable James Fenimore Cooper story dusts off the storyand gives it a ferocity that the author probably never imagined. Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeline Stowe ignite the screen withstolen glances and firey eyes conveying their thoughts.  Noclunky dialouge needed here.  The battle scenes are fast andvicious, and they get your blood moving.  The ambush of theBritish army by the Huron war party is wonderfully shot andedited.  The climax of the film becomes a silent picture as Mannuses a graceful camera to capture the emotion and danger that abattle atop a mountain can offer.",The Last of the Mohicans
80,mOVIemAN56,Very Well Done,8,21 March 2005,"(Spoilers) Although The Last of the Mohicans is sometimes overlooked by movie buffs, it caught my eye. This film is solid all the way around. Set in 1750's New York State when this was America's frontier and the Native Americans ruled the land, the French and Indian War rages on. We begin the film with following a man named Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his two Indian friends Uncas and Chingachgook across the forests. We soon come upon Madeline Stowe's character of Cora Munro and of Maj. Heyward. After and ambush occurs in the forest and a British Company is slaughtered Hawkeye and his company become Ms. Munro and Maj. Heyward's scouts. After various encounters with the Huron and French Armies the movies climaxes with an unforgettable fight along the ledges while an excellent score plays in the background.The Last of the Mohicans is the kind of movie for any movie buff. I has love when it is needed. Drama, action and just a hint of comedy here and their. Daniel Day-Lewis does a superb job as Hawkeye and Russell Means as Chingachgook. The story stays mostly true to the book with a few changes here and there and the visualizations are great with excellent filming of upstate New York. 4 out of 5 Stars.",The Last of the Mohicans
81,OttoVonB,The Only Way to Experience This Story,10,7 October 2002,"Michael Mann is synonymous with a steely, urban kind of cool, perhaps because of the enduring influence of films like Heat and the Insider, or the seminal Miami Vice show. On paper, it's strange to find him at the helm of a romantic period adventure film, especially an adaptation of Cooper's classic story, but that would be missing a key ingredient to Mann's success: he is a method director, first and foremost.Last of the Mohicans is a perfect blend of old and new. In many ways it hearkens back not just to its written origins, but past film adaptations, tales of simple heroism, which it makes relevant and immediate in powerful ways - not just the scale and heartbreaking photography, but especially Trevor Jones' now legendary score. In other ways, it is a very modern animal, layered and avoiding easy allegiances beyond its idealistic main character, and it's in these small details that one sees what makes Mohicans such a superior film.There is a love story, and whether through casting, performance or his subtle conducting, Mann makes it not just immediately appealing, but believable. Same goes for another understated love among secondary characters, and the pathos and pain of villain Magua (Wes Studi), a creature that could have been a cardboard cutout in lesser hands. The same reasoning applies throughout, and though he provides ample spectacle - particularly a spectacular, near-wordless 15-minute closing chase - Michael Mann never does so at the expense of believability or the story he is serving. You will find none of Braveheart's cartoony romance or the Patriot's excess.In making his method historical epic, Michael Mann also found the ideal partner in Daniel Day-Lewis, someone you would sadly no longer consider as a romantic lead, but who is simply astonishing here. With one single foray into the genre, the great performer gives us the definitive word on it, proving his quality by disappearing once more into a character who would be impossible to look away from, were it not for the excellence on display in every other department.This is an epic with such intimacy, power and heart as you have rarely, if ever, seen.",The Last of the Mohicans
82,gary-444,Absolute Tour de Force,10,20 October 2007,"A ten rating is rare indeed for me.Even the greatest work might always have been tweaked just that little bit more. But with Michael Mann's masterpiece that would appear churlish, because the sum of its component parts is so overwhelming.Of course it helps that James Fennimore Cooper's story is a classic. A story that conjures up vast open spaces, heroic emotions, and rich colours in the mind of the reader.To so successfully translate those images onto the screen is a tremendous achievement.Daniel Day Lewis is superb as Hawkeye, understated, but decisive, sensitive but brave.The music is as lush and rich as the cinematography which itself has only been matched by ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and the Epic quality of the film is established from the opening frames to the closing credits.For a running time only eight minutes short of two hours, Mann keeps the narrative racing along with some set pieces which are quite simply astounding, The Mohawk ambush of the retreating surrendered garrison is as bloody and visceral as anything I have seen on screen, and a chase in the caves under a waterfall as beautiful as it is compelling.There is no bad language, there are no special effects. There is a nostalgic examination of vanity,pride, love, honour,duty,sacrifice, revenge and injustice. A Shakespearean task is taken on, and achieved by Mann in this regard. Rarely can a project as multi-layered in its ambitions have succeeded quite as triumphantly as this.",The Last of the Mohicans
83,gpeevers,Action/Romance with Pedigree,9,17 June 2009,"A retelling of the classic tale from James Fennimore Cooper, although it may be argued the story told here relates more closely to 1936 film adaptation than the original novel, the end result is an effective story.Prior to American Independence, Hawkeye (Daniel Day Lewis) a non-native raised by Chingachgook (Russell Means) who along with his son Uncas (Eric Schweig) are the last members of the Mohican tribe. The three are on good terms with local settlers, but less well disposed to the British Army when the French Indian War breaks out. While trying to remain independent and aid their friends they are drawn directly into the conflict when they encounter Magua (Wes Studi) a native guide fighting for the French. The three of them are successful in rescuing the two daughters (Madeline Stowe, Johdi May) of the local British commander from Magua, but their problems are far from over.While Daniel Day Lewis gives a strong compelling performance, he is effectively matched by Wes Studi who is a powerful screen presence throughout the film. Both Means and Shweig give effective low key performances but Stowe is for the most part underused. Both Steven Waddington and Maurice Roëves also give effective supporting performances.While this could readily be dismissed as essentially an action /romance, it's the films great production values, the impressive pedigree of its contributors and the historical setting that make it considerably more. The film is very impressive thanks likely both to the cinematographer Dante Spinotti, and the dynamic visual style one associates with director Michael Mann. The film also features an evocative and rousing score.While the film won only a single Oscar for Best Sound it was nominated for and won a number of other awards and boasts an impressive rating of 97% from Rotten Tomatoes.",The Last of the Mohicans
84,badajoz-1,Action Love Story that just about works,8,22 January 2010,"There's a lot to like about this film. A western about the eighteenth century, with sweeping epic pretensions, action, romance, music, locations, fine acting etc, but it loses itself at times in overegging the Colonial freedom-loving set against the cold-hearted British soldiers defending them. Actually the American revolution was set in train by the UK trying to recoup some of the expense of defending the ungrateful colonialists against the French, and the French monarchy went up in flames because of its financial support of the Patriots in the actual Revolution! But Americans love simplicity, and here they get it in plenty. I read the novel before this umpteenth rewatching on video, and it's okay, but hardly the great US novel it is made out to be. Quite rightly the plot has been speeded up, but the fort sequence is stretching credulity too far, while Hawkeye's love for Cora tears down the great White individual's total incorruptability matching the purity of the wilderness - a model that had stood Hollywood in good stead till the revisionist Seventies. As in the book, the red Indian is portrayed as good and bad, and it works well, except the usual Hollywood failing of redcoats can do down in hundreds before tomahawks because they are not sympathetic to US tastes. How did the British win the French and Colonial Wars (Seven Years War to us Brits!)? But the magic works, dashing through the forest to save the innocent, firing flintlocks (but no reference to 'Kill-Deer) as if they were breech loaders, hacking scalps and hearts, Indian versus Indian as if in a danse macabre, lovers parting with the real fear of a'fate worse than death (this fear apparently set up the red Indian as the savage for the next hundred or so years!) and a beautiful background location (even if it is North Carolina, and the Indian camp is the setting for 'Dirty Dancing!). Go on immerse yourself in some great escapism, even if Hawkeye does not get to use his 'longue carabine' to kill Magua!",The Last of the Mohicans

The battle scenes are tense, brutal and spectacular.Photography and cinematography are spectacular, the film is fully experienced only when viewed on the big screen. The sound is really fascinating, it completes the film and makes it really impressive.It is really rare to see such a complete film that gets better with each viewing.The Last of the Mohicans is a cinematographic work that deserves every praise and certainly takes its place in the history of film art.",The Last of the Mohicans

87,stills-6,Beautiful but flat,5,16 October 1999,"The cinematography is amazing in this movie. The shots are well-thought out and almost every scene has its own beauty, especially the waterfall scenes. This isn't enough to save it, but it's nice.The main problem is that there is no chemistry between Lewis and Stowe. Lewis seems so intent on creating an inner world for his character that he forgets there are other people around him. Stowe was OK, Studi was good, Steven Waddington was very good and may be the best thing about it. But all of the characters are flat and uninteresting.It's a good story, and I'm saddened to see it mangled by this attempt. It's as if the makers of this movie wanted us to know this was LITERATURE and must be taken SERIOUSLY, and therefore everything is BIG and DRAMATIC and STENTORIAN. There is precious little subtlety, which is odd for an adaptation of a classic novel. I always cringe when a good battle scene is placed in an inferior movie, because all the work that went into that scene to make it look so good could have been put into the rest of the movie.",The Last of the Mohicans
88,jacksflicks,Beautiful Production of a Neglected Genre,9,10 May 1999,"I must admit that I'm always hungry for a frontier epic.  I think the theme of confronting the American (or Russian, as in ""Dersu Uzala"") wilderness for the first time can never be overtold.And just how do I define a ""frontier"" movie?  Any story of people in a land before its settlement.  In the case of America, before 1860 or, better yet, before 1776.""Northwest Passage,"" ""The Black Robe,"" and now ""Last of the Mohicans"" . . .Wonderful production values here - spectacular scenery, authentic props, convincing warfare - and, contrary to the impression given by other reviewers, the romance element doesn't overwhelm the other plot elements.

89,kyle-cruse,"Not a perfect film, but still good",8,30 June 2009,"""The Last of the Mohicans"" had the potential to be a great film. It had a good, intense storyline and well-made action sequences. However, what brings the film down in quality is the overall slow pace. For a majority of the movie, it's difficult to stay interested and engaged. Also, the film lacks some character development as a whole. We really do not get to know most of the characters very well, even the main characters, which leaves us with less reason to stay interested. Nevertheless, I will say a few good things about this film. This film, in my opinion, gives Daniel Day-Lewis his finest on-screen moment, during the scene at the waterfall in which he tells his beloved ""You stay alive! Whatever happens, I will find you."" That is one of the most memorable movie moments I've ever seen, and had the film been more like this overall, it would have been an all-time masterpiece. Still recommended, but I cannot rate it too high.*** out of ****",The Last of the Mohicans
90,NewEnglandPat,Colonial conflict has scenic grandeur and beautiful music,8,13 February 2010,"The French and Indian War, circa 1757, is the setting for this entertaining slice of American history, replete with bravery, sacrifice, romance and treachery. James Fenimore Cooper's novel, a difficult and ponderous work, flows on screen here with simplicity and great beauty, and is enhanced by fine direction, acting and a beautiful, sweeping music score. Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe headline a solid cast that brings to life this early American work that Cooper himself failed to do. The British, in dire straits for military support, enlist the colonial militia to fight the French and their Indian allies at the risk of leaving their families defenseless in the face of their dangerous foe. The battle scenes are violent, drawn-out affairs, especially the Fort William Henry debacle that commander Marquis de Montcalm couldn't prevent. A major underlying theme of the picture is a Huron's blood vengeance quest against a British colonel which sets in motion the ambushes and animosity that define the movie's narrative. Russell Means and Eric Schweig along with Day-Lewis are the story's heroes and essay the bravery, loyalty and courage of the noble red man.",The Last of the Mohicans

The cast is perfection, with Daniel Day-Lewis an extremely masculine and rugged Hawkeye, Madeline Stowe so beautiful and stunning as Cora Munro, Jodhi May is the beautiful, Alice Munro and gives a wonderful touch of sadness to her doomed character, Russell Means is brilliant as Chingachcook, Eric Schweig handsome and stoic as Uncas does much with very few lines, the terrific Wes Studi as the vengeful Magua is cunning and evil, yet sympathetic, Maurice Roeves as Munro created an interesting British officer as did Steven Waddington as the rival lover of Cora. To fully enjoy this film in all its glory I would suggest seeing it on blu-ray to experience the sounds and lush colors of this masterpiece. I was quite surprised at Russell Means' performance. It was a very physical and emotional role and he pulled it off magnificently for a non-professional actor. Dennis Banks appeared in a small role as Ongewasgone and he too nailed it.

Cooper), great scenery, and an epic feel. Enough action and scenery and sensible revenge to make it watchable. Magua was a good character that you disliked, but could identify with his motivations and sympathize with his reasons.The Bad= Underdeveloped characters, who get little time to explain anything about their relations with other characters or how they feel about anything. Some boring parts of the script, and lackluster moments or additions to the storyline that didn't further the plot or your interest. Also, the sound seems too quiet for the whispering dialogue in places when I watch on a DVD player. Oh, and the intimate dynamic of the relationships between Alice and Uncas, and Hawkeye and Cora, seem edited out like something was missing. Really artificial story telling with gaps.The Ugly= One of the worst things about this movie was the sanitized violence. I don't enjoy torture porn or violence just to be over the top, but really??? So many tomahawk strikes, knife stabs, bullet wounds, etc. with no blood or gore. It would have really given the movie more realism and depth to hear a loud chop of a weapon and see more blood flowing like ""The Patriot"" or ""Braveheart"", and been more satisfying. Some of the fight choreography and realism seemed really sanitized. I also found Lewis(though a good actor) to possibly be a mismatch for this role, and too ""pretty"" for a white man living in the woods all day.",The Last of the Mohicans

I rate this movie in the Top 10 of the last decade, and each time it is viewed, my appreciation of all the factors above imcreases. The use of sub-titles was excellent, and not overdone, but helped significantly in getting into the full Huron culture and approach.

Well, with Last of the Mohicans, the screenwriters and director Michael Mann create a three-fer: one part romance, one part historical adventure, and one part political thriller. By political thriller I mean conveying exquisitely the rising idea of the natural Rights of Man challenging the Divine Right of Pontificating Royal Assholes. So many examples from the dialog show that the spirit of the border, of the frontier, was indeed the same American spirit that in the late 18th century animated the taverns of Virginia, the meeting halls of Philadelphia, and the streets of Boston....For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2009",The Last of the Mohicans

Most Hollywood made films that deal with Native North Americans always have the negative stereotypes that come with them..... with the exception of ""Dances with Wolves"".  It was great to see that most of the cast were all Natives anyway!! :D  So that was a bonus. But I loved that scene where Wes Studi was trying to save that white girl from falling off that cliff after chasing her.  She attempted suicide because she didn't want the warrior to take her life.

Although a war movie, set during the French and Indian Wars in upstate New York in the mid 1700's, it is primarily a relationship movie. Relationships between father and son; sisters and father; general and troops; suitor and the object of his desire; Native American tribes and European colonists; and between the tribes themselves.What I most like about this film is its focus on the tribes. They are not just window dressing like with other, similar movies. They are the story, the main characters, the center around which the plot revolves.Sadly it does depend on the stereotypical ""white adopted son of a chief"", but fortunately Daniel Day-Lewis plays it on the up-and-up. It's a pretty good performance.The movie is well photographed and scored, and is set in some beautiful scenery.There are a few problems, a few slow spots, and a few plot holes.

Scenes such as the final ambush and the mountain top show down really stand out and will impress film lovers. The Last Of The Mohicans is more than likely remembered as a classic because of this second half that really makes up for the first. To start off with, this film has some great performances. It seems that everyone gives it their all, stand outs being Daniel Day-Lewis and Wes Studi. Everyone is believable and really works. The visuals are also pretty great. Lots of beautiful foliage and rivers that are appealing to the eye. There's also a great deal of work put into the costumes and what not, giving the whole film a very ""Barry Lyndon"" feeling, where you start to feel like your actually seeing people from that time period as opposed to people in costumes on set, which is a huge compliment. The soundtrack is also really great, and enhances every scene that it's used in. My main issue with the film is that the first half can be slightly slow and boring. Yes, there is character development, which is needed to make the second half better, but I just found myself in and out of interest with the first half. I wish the whole film could have been as strong as the second half was, but oh well.Overall, this is a historical film that is quite well done.

The Last of the Mohicans places us into the center of this conflict as a white man, raised by Indians, named Hawkeye/Nathaniel (Daniel Day-Lewis) guides a British group through corybantic rivers and the unpredictable wilderness to their ultimate destination. First of all—to begin on a positive note —the elaborate, fitting production design is certainly appreciated, as well as some satisfyingly epic battle sequences that wondrously visualize my imaginings of the grandiose battles within the book. Now, I'm going to approach my criticism of this film from the perspective of a literature fan who has recently read the actual 19th- century work. With that in mind, I can say that monumental disappointment struck me not only because of the failed text-to-film adaptation itself but also because it was directed by an otherwise incredibly talented filmmaker (Michael Mann) who has proved time and time again he's leagues above this; I sense this was a director-for-hire sort of project though. What the audience gets is essentially a classic, important, and spectacular story that's boggled down by safe Hollywood conventions. The depth and sheer intricacy of the source material is completely lost on this unfortunate Mann production that is so conspicuously influenced by studio restraints. Considering that this is a nearly 25-year-old film, the remainder of my review will feature major, major spoilers. So, let's look at my first example of the movie's insufficiency: the Huron ambush after the surrender in the novel sees men, women, and children as a part of the English evacuation. The writing brutally illustrates the initiation of the massacre by a Huron bashing a mother's baby against a rock and then driving a tomahawk into the woman's skull. Since Hollywood decided to censor this horrific scene from your oh-so- innocent eyes, allow me to rebel and inform you of its existence myself. Where are all the women and children here? Why wasn't this prized British fort housing anyone other than the male soldiers? Obviously, killing a multitude of armed, fully competent men lessens the impact of the ambush and understates the unfair brutality and utter hostility that came with the French and Indian War. In addition, we get—of course—a forced romance subplot that drastically alters relationships and makes very little sense, forcing me to question its exact necessity other than stereotypically pairing the lead with a romantic interest. Duncan (portrayed by Steven Waddington in this rendition) was involved with the two young women (Cora and Alice) in the novel, establishing an interesting dynamic between the three—an interconnection of confused love. Duncan in the book was also actually a crucial character who bridged the cultural gap between the Native Americans and white folk—certainly a significant theme of the story. In this case, that type of complex thematic material is lazily substituted with archetypal white folk who merely desire their land and act with vapidity. Another one of considerable flaws is the motion picture's abhorrently short runtime (under two hours) for such a grandly-scaled tale that not only initially consisted of far more complex relationships and characters but also a superior build-up in the various one-on-one Indian combats and general clashes. The utter potential is immediately squandered by such a brief duration that cuts plenty of the bulk out, leaving in its stead the Hollywood conventions (of an action film) heretofore mentioned. Aside from cutting out copious pivotal segments, the film also daringly alters some events and puts a new twist on the narrative such as killing off different characters, filling the viewers with intrigue in regards to how this particular cinematic adaptation can pan out differently. Alas, the deaths don't exactly lead into a brand- new direction for the story-- no consequences whatsoever—therefore deeming the disparate decisions a little pointless.The last act takes a surprisingly dark turn, killing off even more significant characters than James Fenimore Cooper did. However, the difference is that the impact of theses deaths isn't genuinely felt, regardless of the body count, since barely anyone in this film is adequately developed in the first place. Uncas (Eric Schweig) is an absolutely major presence in the book as we see his deliberate evolution from a submissive, diffident son to an intrepid warrior who manages to rescue the daughters and formidably face off against Magua (Wes Studi). In this case—on the other hand—we rarely hear so much as an utterance from him, and the camera is only occasionally placed on his whereabouts. This fascinating growth of a character is painfully sacrificed for the sake of a climax that's translated through an indolent montage—little to no dialogue; simply following every plot point from the last part of the book to its definitive finish as quickly as the filmmakers possibly can. A sweeping score plays as apparently principal people are abruptly (or rather anti-climactically) killed. Duncan—the vital cultural bridge in the original story, without so much as a discernible personality here—is burned at the stake very quickly. Alice (Jodhi May)—with very little to do throughout the picture—suicidally leaps off a cliff with a strangely calm demeanor. Even if this adaptation is substantially unfaithful, it could've at least found other compelling alternatives to explore the setting and relationships, but instead, this turns out to be an obviously rushed and poorly executed action flick that has so much thoughtful source material distantly behind it.",The Last of the Mohicans
104,nikitalinivenko,D.D.L. is notoriously selective about his projects...so why did he choose this one?,1,3 November 2019,"This is just Mel Gibson's ""The Patriot"" - the exact same movie; the sort of video you would put on for your class if you were a middle school history teacher. Coming on the heels of Dances with Wolves, it's no wonder this feels like a shameless capitalization (despite being based on a two-centuries old novel) on the prestige of that movie, much like what Tombstone is to Unforgiven. The notoriously selective Daniel Day-Lewis somehow bought into this project, playing the typical -adopted-by-natives, a discount New World Tarzan who becomes an Indian Braveheart. The Redcoats stomp around back country roads, Indians lead Guerilla hits against them, they still ceaselessly encroach, yaddayaddayadda, you know how it goes. Absolutely nothing new here. Basically you're just watching a taped history-enthusiasts re-enactment, a TV mini-series, or a Drunk History episode played dead straight.

I was a young voracious reader with no sophisticated thoughts about writing. All I knew was it sucked and Cooper has remained an undeserved successful hack in my mind ever since.
So for me, this is a movie that greatly improved on the novel, regardless of any deviations.I like good historical fiction but expecting 'good' at the movies was always crapshoot.
I remember being so skeptical as the lights went down. The French/Indian war is a wealth of action/adventure stories and I've never understood why there hadn't been anything good since Drums Along the Mohawk (1939) and Northwest Passage (1940).
When the carriage crossed the bridge in that gorgeous shot, I relaxed.
But when Magua stepped out of the shadows...oh boy. 
I still think he is one of film's greatest villains.""Magua understand the white man very well.""The care and attention to detail is astonishing.
This is one of the best blends of modern sensibilities and popular 18th century form of adventure/romance.

Since that time, I've come back to this many times, and it gets better with each viewing. From the grand opening showing the mountain range of New York, to the epic battles, and the interactions between the characters, most notably Daniel Day Lewis as Hawkeye, you know you're in for something beautiful to look at as well as a story to get involved in. As I said before, Daniel Day Lewis really gets into the character of Hawkeye and the way he works with both friends and enemies, you feel for him. I will admit the love part between him and Cora and can get a little corny, but that's a minor setback, as everything else is done so well. Wes Studi, a veteran Native American actor gives it his all as Magua, the cold Huron Indian villain who becomes twisted from his treatment from others. If you want a real treat, be sure to see this (if you can) on the big screen, as that's the best way to view this movie in all its majesty.",The Last of the Mohicans

108,jmvscotland,WHAT A WASTE OF TIME,5,21 June 2019,"It's no surprise that this movie should look, as when it was first released in 1992, like a boys' own adventure as that's exactly what Fenimore Cooper wrote.
I remember watching this back in around 2002 and not thinking much of it then apart from the soundtrack which was pretty good in places.
More recently, I bought a cheap DVD in KL for 2 Malaysian Ringit on the basis that I couldn't go far wrong for 50 cents and also because I wondered whether it might have improved a bit with age. Good wines improve with age; bad wine doesn't and this is definitely a bad wine.
Yes, certainly the scenes of fighting between the Redcoats and the Indians (Native Americans if you like) were impressively staged and also the scenes of the siege of the British fort by the French was well done. But, in my opinion, the rest of the movie and in particular the relationships between Hawkeye and the older sister and her disdain for Duncan were far from plausible. Just a cheap melodrama. And the script was chock full of cliches.
I decided to give this one a second chance after many years since I saw it first. I wasn't disappointed in my recollection and I most definitely will not come this way again.
If you like something pleasing to loot and don't mind cheap melodrama, then ""The Last Of The Mohicans"" might be OK for you. But really, don't expect too much if you want a real adventure movie with a plausible romantic thread.",The Last of the Mohicans

111,Willie-12,Michael Mann's Masterpiece,10,19 November 2010,"It's interesting. Michael Mann is probably best known for his film Heat. And it's not hard to see why. It is a grand epic in the cops and robbers genre that pits two of the greatest actors (Robert De Niro and Al Pacino) in the history of cinema against each other (and delivers their first on-screen appearance together in a classic scene...probably one of the best ever). It also has, possibly, the best and most intricately orchestrated shoot-out ever committed to film. Actually, to call it a shoot-out trivializes the beauty of it. It is an all-out gun battle. And yet, in my opinion, Heat is not Mann's best film. His best film came three years earlier. It is The Last Of The Mohicans, and is, I would contend, Mann's masterpiece. It is one of the best films I've ever seen, and is certainly in my top five of all time. It's difficult to try and even remotely convey just how close to perfect this movie is. First there is the acting. Every performance by every major player is utterly convincing. Especially from Daniel Day Lewis. I think this may be his best performance ever, and yet he didn't even get an Oscar nomination for it. In fact this movie was virtually ignored (save for the Sound) by the Academy. One of the most epic movies ever made, and the Academy only recognized it for its Sound (which was very good by the way). Almost criminal. This is a movie mind you, that is virtually impossible to nail down as far as genre is concerned. It literally has almost every element that one could think of. It's a powerful drama, and a beautiful love story. It's action-packed (and quite violent), and yet has much historical significance. It's one of the most beautifully filmed pieces of cinema I've ever laid my eyes on (North Carolina in its most glorious splendor), and the story is obviously strong. I remember the first time I ever saw The Last Of The Mohicans. I expected very little of it to be quite honest. Some good action and hopefully some great battle scenes. Well it delivered on that front. But it delivered in droves in so many other ways. Seldom have I ever underestimated a film as grossly as I did Mohicans. And seldom have I seen a film so grand. What I got, quite simply, was one of the greatest cinematic experiences of my life.",The Last of the Mohicans
112,JackCerf,A Great Bodice Ripper Date Flick,8,14 July 2006,"Balletic quality violence, good sex (although the spiciest bits are happening just outside the frame and left to the imagination), a smoldering hero of nearly superhuman skills, a heroine who rises to the occasion and discovers resources she didn't know she had, a sidekick with a (literally) killer backhand, a Brit whose stiff upper lip never fails him to the bitter end, a villain worthy of Paradise Lost, magnificent visuals, a lush score that clubs any lingering disbelief into submission, and, finally, one of the great romantic suicides in the movies.The climactic sequence is a classic of silent film. We've already been set up by the trilingual debate over the Munro sisters' fate between Magua, Hawkeye and the old Huron sachem. Once Hawkeye takes Cora and leaves the Huron camp, there is not a word of dialog until after Magua's death. It's all action and music, building tension during the pursuit with the same theme previously used for Hawkeye and Cora's lovemaking. The actors communicate by glance and gesture. The music and the editing pull you into a climax that breaks your heart, pause, pull you into another, completely unexpected one, pause again, and build to the murderous, but now bittersweet resolution we've been promised. Only a brief epilogue is spoken.",The Last of the Mohicans
113,TheNabOwnzz,A masterpiece of historical fiction,9,2 May 2018,"The Last of the Mohicans is an absolute grandiose display of cinematography, terrific acting, sound, romance & battle sequences. It is a many times beautiful film that relies on its exceptional mixing of musical pieces and romantic/battle scenes to create the best emotional experience possible.The movie has absolutely gorgeous cinematography. Many scenes take place at night ( Especially during their stay at the fort ) Yet these scenes are so artistically lit and filmed that even the night scenes are beautiful to look at. However, the daylight cinematography does still provide the greatest images, such as the meeting between Munro and Montcalm, the final showdown with Magua, or the opening and closing shots of the view of the mountains.It is a film with a couple of extended battle scenes but these scenes flow very naturally due to the great editing and the exceptional musical score that most of the time accompanies it by Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman, which is definitely one of the greatest musical themes in all of film. It is an emotional score which further builds up during the battle sequences and always seems to climb towards its climax just as the part of the film does. And ofcourse this score enhances the romance between Poe ( Daniel-Day Lewis ) and Cora ( Madeleine Stowe ) to a relatable degree.Particularly Daniel Day Lewis and Wes Studi steal the show in their respective acting roles in the film, with the latter acting as the villainous Magua, yet not portrayed as a brainless Huron psychopath but a man that is full of hatred due to his own children being murdered by the English, which has caused him to hate the 'greyhair' with a passion.Yet even though the entire film is great, the final twenty or twenty five minutes of the film transcends them all. The final twenty minutes are some of the greatest twenty minutes in cinema history. A lot of its quality is in the little things, such as Alice's silent look after seeing Uncas sacrifice himself in order to save her, unable to keep on living after seeing the man that has comforted her in a couple of past scenes killed by Magua due to her, followed by Magua's confused look because he cannot understand why she would take her own life because of this. It is just brilliant facial acting without needing any dialogue. We can also see the reactions of Poe and Chingachcook to his son's and Cora to her sister's death which involves us more emotionally in the moment. We understand that Magua was made into the man he is by the English, yet still feel that he needs to die because of what he has done. All the while the two other main characters are attempting to catch up to the Huron here while the musical score moves closer and closer to its climax, which finally arrives when Chingachcook avenges his son and kills Magua, with a beautiful shot of the mountains in the background just before he deals the final blow. After which the epic musical score ends after Magua hits the ground. Quite possibly one of the most dramatic, moving, epic and powerful ending to a movie you could ever think of.A movie that grabs you like no other from the start which rises up to an absolute incredible climax results in an absolute masterpiece that demands to be seen again and again.",The Last of the Mohicans
114,jckruize,Will make you forget that wimpy TV Hawkeye.,10,24 November 2003,"Policier specialist Michael Mann steps way off his usual beaten path with this adaptation of that hoary old James Fenimore Cooper tale of frontiersmen, Indians, Redcoats and the French -- the latter back when they knew how to fight.Chameleonic actor Daniel Day Lewis is totally convincing as Hawkeye, tracker, warrior, and adopted white son of Chingagchook, last of the Mohicans tribe. Along with adoptive brother, Uncas, the three are swept into the French and Indian war of 1757, treading lightly between the antagonists: French and Hurons on one side, British and colonials on the other, each faction potentially treacherous and deadly.Mann doesn't waste time on exposition or character development; he just hurls us into the fast-paced, brutal action and the effect is like snagging the tail of a galloping racehorse and trying to hang on to the finish line. Madeline Stowe and Jodhi May, as sisters of the British major Munro, provide love interest for Hawkeye and Uncas, respectively. Steven Waddington is another Redcoat officer infatuated with Stowe, and he too shines as a 'bad guy' who's more complex than he at first seems. But the movie's almost stolen by Wes Studi as Magua, a Huron warrior who's allied himself with the French solely as a means to avenge himself on the white man. He's as mesmerizing and lethal as a cobra.Technical qualities are exemplary, with special mention to the magnificent scenery of old-growth forestlands and mountains in North Carolina, and a superb score by Trevor Jones, with an assist by Randy Edelman.Mann might not be the first guy you'd think of to stage an 18th-century period action/adventure/romance. But after seeing what he does here, no one can fail to be impressed by his range and bravura. This is a must-own.",The Last of the Mohicans
115,TexasRedge,this is good.....this is very good,9,8 May 2002,"this movie ranks as in my opinion is one of the top 5 historical drama/epics ever made. This movie was filmed near the North Carolina/Tennessee border and I am from Tennessee and I remeber when the movie crews were filming this, because I wanted to go watch them film this movie, but the local authorities and the film producers had that area off limits to the public. I have never read the book ""Last of the Mohicans"" so if this movie differs from the book-I wouldn't know. I also remeber watcing an old Black and White version of this in my 8th grade class when I was a Kid growing up(seems like another lifetime ago now). ..Okay,I've strayed from the subject matter just a bit. However this 1992 version is splended in every way. I was completely taken by how beautiful the Appalatchain Mountian sceenery is in this film(because I live about 70 mile away from where this movie was filmed, I sometimes take it for granted that I live in the most beautiful part of the United State)This film captured the essence and beauty of this area(its suppossed to be upstate New York in the film). this movie has a powerful gripping story. Awesome costumes, A Superb music score, great Specail Effects. great battle scenes,good solid action scenes, and to top it off this film is well acted by a Great Cast. This movie has something in it for everyone. When the credits began to roll up the screen at the end of this film , I was saddened by the fact that it was over, I wanted this film to just keep going-I wanted more.

116,Ralpho,Disappointing,5,11 August 2002,"I'm in a small minority on this picture as I gave it a 5 when 77 percent of everyone else gave it a 7 or greater. My problem with ""Last of the Mohicans"" starts with the fact that director Michael Mann made it difficult to follow plot developments. I found myself guessing every 10 minutes about what had happened.Secondly, it wasn't clear until late in the movie that Hawkeye's Mohican companions were his step-father and step-brother. Since these characters weren't developed, one feels next to nothing when the step-brother is killed.Thirdly, the romance between Hawkeye and Cora seems to spring fully-grown from a five-minute conversation under the stars one night. When it was clear to me that the two were supposed to be in love, my reaction was, ""Gee, that was fast.""Fourthly, the director (and probably the writers, too) pretend that the smooth-bore muskets used at the time were as accurate as rifles. Hawkeye fires at moving targets and never misses. At one point he clearly takes a long range shot to put a man being tortured out of his misery. Even 50 years after the time the film is set muskets were next to useless beyond 100 yards. They also delivered a substantial kick when fired, and Hawkeye performs the impossible by firing two at once, from the hip, on the run. No way in hell that's possible.Lastly, I was surprised to find Daniel Day-Lewis' acting so wooden and unconvincing, considering his reputation.  The best thing about this movie is the special effects, which is a compliment I seldom make. I think Mann accurately reproduced the sound and the amount of smoke that muskets produce in battle. And the scenes of the fort under siege were well done, particularly the shot from long range when the sights preceded the sounds.",The Last of the Mohicans
117,tenthousandtattoos,This guy really knows how to make movies,10,12 July 2007,"""Aw man, this is gonna be another 3 hour Dances with Wolves nightmare,"" I thought, being quite literally dragged into the cinema to see this film. I had oodles of candy and a bucket of popcorn bigger than my head, and was preparing to BURY myself in it as the curtains drew back, and i was suddenly drawn in for the next two hours. I barely touched my popcorn as Trevor Jones' score swept across those breathtaking mountains, spired trees, before immersing us in 1757 new America, and sweeping into a story that is at once a drama, a romance, a war film and an historical period action adventure. In short, Michael Mann's masterpiece. This guy really knows how to make movies. I can't fault this film, I think it's perfect. Viewed on a superficial level it's an exciting adventure story, set against a backdrop of cathedral forests and a savage war for possession of an entire continent. Go deeper and it's a masterpiece of storytelling, a finely crafted motion picture (editing, sound design, costuming, production design - technically, it's brilliant. Dante Spinotti (has worked with Mann on Heat, and probably others I am not certain and don't want to guess here) captures the frontier wilderness like something straight out of a painting, a period novel or an epic poem. It's magical, beautiful, yet so simple and professionally done. The whole 2 hours of the film are beautiful to watch. Daniel Day Lewis is great, although I must admit this is only one of two films I've ever watched him in, the other being In the Name of the Father. Madeleine Stowe is beautiful in an almost indescribable way, and although several of her lines seem strangely forced and awkward she is also great in this. All the supporting cast are great...like I said, can't fault this film in any way. It's on my top ten ultimate must see best ever movie list (which is no lighthearted matter - it's been 15 years in the making!) The film is also a great little snapshot of the times. While not all that historically accurate when you look into it, it does keep certain historical events in context and doesn't take HUGE liberties with the historical truth. It's a fairly accurate portrayal of the warfare and weapons of the time. Also dramatic is the conflict when viewed in the larger context that, in less than two decades the ""settlers"" as they are referred to in this film would kick the Brits out anyway and establish the United States so the fighting depicted in this film was even more a pointless waste of life.Director's Cut vs Theatrical releaseIn my opinion there is no reason to watch the theatrical version anymore. Fair enough, it was the version that blew me away at the cinema, but Michael Mann has extended and built upon crucial scenes to a point that elevates it from action/romance/adventure film to pure masterpiece. Trevor Jones' score is fantastic, moving, a perfect example of how to score a film.Interesting point of note I watched this film on the same night as Mel Gibson's Apocalypto. Now, while the two movies are totally different, the reason I compare them is they both begin with indigenous people engaged in a hunt. Now, seeing the two scenes back to back the better film is startlingly obvious - it's Mohicans. The hunt scene is dramatic, tense, and even moving, complemented by a beautiful introduction to the score. Apocalypto's opening hunt, by contrast, was a flat, uninteresting start to a film, with no music, and focusing on very graphic aspects of the dead Tapir, whereas Mann, in Mohicans, chose to focus more on the characters who shot the deer, not the wound inflicted on the animal itself. My friend, a 25 yo female, walked out on Apocalypto after 4 1/2 minutes of that hunt scene. By contrast, she stayed for all of Mohicans and describes it as one of the best films she's ever seen.",The Last of the Mohicans
118,LouE15,Excellent historical romance despite dubious 1930s screenplay,8,30 March 2008,"How to find the right things to say about this complex Pandora's box of story, history, romance and film-making. There's so much that's good, great even; but it's counterbalanced by things that stick in the craw. There are so many reviews on these pages, this will probably never get read  so I'm just going to talk about aspects of it that interest me. I could find no way to make it shorter, sorry! This sweeping epic is no less sprawling and fascinating than James Fennimore Cooper's original novel. I've seen comments on how racist and bigoted the book is: whilst there's some truth in this, I think it's almost equally true of aspects of this film. Crucial scenes  especially the dramatic finale  are drawn almost shot-for-shot from the far more racist and bigoted 1930 movie of the same name, and some scenes even appear to echo ""The Birth of a Nation"" by the incomparable, visionary, dangerous bigot DW Griffith, so much so that at times they make Fennimore Cooper's original seem enlightened (as indeed it was. It did not, for example, fail to give a voice to the many tribes of Indians involved in this period of history). So many decades on, I'd say it's now a moot point which was in fact the more racist period  Cooper's prefiguring of modern-day ""gone native"" at a time when 'Indians' were in the process of being wiped off the face of the earth; or the KKK-addled America of the 1930s. Perhaps future generations will write us all off eventually. So be it: progress is made through revisionism, we hope.Daniel Day Lewis puts in a spectacular performance as Hawkeye, also known as La Longue Carabine (The Long Rifle) for his renowned skill as a hunter and marksman. Day Lewis is certainly the actor to bring this unusual character to life (although Hawkeye's decided idiosyncrasies and downright bigotry have definitely been shaded away, leaving a younger, meatier, handsomer and much more silent man  in fact more like a silent film star). In many ways, while it is certainly visually sumptuous, the film reflects the prejudices and opinions of the 1930s, the date of the original screenplay this film is based on. It has the sensibility of a silent film. Music is relied on to perform the function of storytelling much as it did in the silent era. The prejudices are the same, too. The story alters from the original book right away in having Hawkeye fall for Cora: in the book Hawkeye is resolutely unromantic, and it is Uncas who has this misfortune: the racism of the book is that the author joins with the reader, as he supposes, in the assumption that such interracial love is, naturally, quite out of the question. But even the film doesn't address itself in the 'modern' way we'd perhaps like, by allowing Uncas to realise any actual romance with Cora's sister Alice. Here, as in the book, Uncas's is strictly an ideal love. Despite this, however, the film in general shows excellent and forward-thinking treatment of Indian, French, American and British characters as equally interesting.Russell Means is the veteran American Indian (his choice) activist who plays Chingachgook, Uncas's father, and Hawkeye's adoptive father. He plays his character with great dignity and skill (his decades of public life have prepared him well). An extensive and entertaining interview about his experiences on this film is somewhere on the internet. Hiring such an explosive and dominant personality was clever casting, but was always a big risk. Behind the scenes Means supported the Indian actors, striking against their housing conditions; criticised the unreasonably small size of the breech-clouts designed for the Indian cast to wear; pointed out that he believed the heavy oak weapon he carried in the film was in fact a misinterpretation of a nutcracker design. Wes Studi is amazing as the Huron Magua: a powerfully malign point of focus within the story. He can feel very proud of this performance  that he in no way contributed to a simplistic and negative view of American Indians with his nuanced characterisation. Magua had a tribe, and motivation, and was given screen time  and a multilingual voice  to articulate it. This is a significant development from the vengeful (and tribeless) cinema Indian whose sole motivation appears to be revenge itself. Witness, perhaps, Studi's own part in ""Dances with Wolves"".Elsewhere too, the casting is excellent, for example Madeleine Stowe's spirited Pre-Raphaelite Cora and Steven Waddington's thankless role as stiff and unsuccessful suitor Major Hayward. I don't think I'll ever forget Jodhi May's Alice; wordlessly she manages to do a great deal and creates considerable pathos (another silent film star!). Her able counterpart is Eric Schweig as Uncas, the young warrior, who, with perhaps even fewer lines, contributes greatly to the authenticity, and the romantic drama, of the piece. (But for the real deal check out Schweig with veteran actor Graham Greene in ""Skins"", a film about real, modern Native Americans, made by a Native writer, cast and crew.) ""The Last of the Mohicans"" is an absolutely cracking epic historical romance, tackling a complex multi-subject storyline head-on with great intrepidity. Michael Mann deserves his reputation, and putting the pitfalls and debatable issues aside, I'd heartily recommended it for everyone. But take your history lessons from more trustworthy sources: you'll need to read the histories of all sorts of 'sides' to get the full picture of his extraordinarily turbulent time in America's history.

The primary aspect of the movie that I am infatuated with is the score. It is a perfect accompaniment for the flair and the exuberance that is shown by the characters on screen. I must confess that the sole reason why I saw this film was to see Daniel Day Lewis. He has given singularly mesmerizing performances in Lincoln, Gangs of New York and There Will Be Blood. Here, once again he is in the lead role as the member of a community which is rapidly diminishing due to the ongoing war between the French and the British troops to conquer America. As expected, he is solid and believable in his role.This movie is not a character based movie due to which no actors were in reckoning for any acting awards. However, the casting was wonderful and there is no weak link in this film. As this is a period drama, the vivacious and opulent sets manage to capture the essence of the era in which the movie is taking place.I would highly recommend this movie to all movie lovers due to the immensely satisfying conclusion that resolves the story in a fitting manner.",The Last of the Mohicans
121,tonyjackie,A truly excellent adventure story,9,5 November 2006,"When I noticed that one of my top 10 movies of all time wasn't even in your top 250 I felt that I had to try and change this. I don't dish out scores of 10 too often,but felt I had to this time if only to improve the overall rating of this fabulous movie. I have seen it several times now and I can honestly say that I have enjoyed it every single time. I won't give away any of the plot and some critics have said that the film is historically inaccurate.Believe me,that really doesn't matter as what we have here is a stirring adventure story set against the backdrop of true love. Daniel Day-Lewis makes for a totally believable hero and his love interest Madeline Stowe looks fabulous and makes you believe that she is worth fighting for. With stunning scenery,fabulous music and very slick direction from Michael Mann,this is a jewel of a movie that will appeal to blokes as well as women.Give it a try,I reckon you will be impressed.",The Last of the Mohicans
122,shhimundercoverdamnit,"""The whole world's on fire, isn't it?""",10,11 February 2008,"My all time favorite film. Still gives me chills. It's easily one of the most amazing films I've ever seen and it also features perhaps one of the greatest soundtracks ever. They way, the music hits the scenes is just absolutely astonishing.In essence, The Last of the Mohicans is an epic adventure/romance set against the panorama of a frontier wilderness ravaged by the French and Indian War.Director Michael Mann brilliantly captures the essence of the era ( 1750's)-the hand-to hand battles, the scalping's, the harsh life in the wilderness, etc. But, I especially love the way that the film depicts the perspectives of each of the groups and the people involved. Whether they are competing for military superiority, referring to the French General Montcalm ( Patrice Chéreau ) and the British Colonel Munro (Maurice Roëves) or the simple existence of peoples in their homeland, the viewer is given a true sense of their mindset in the midst of a great conflict.Even the story's main antagonist, Magua (wonderfully portrayed by Wes Studi) draws us in.The always amazing Daniel Day-Lewis stars as Hawkeye, rugged frontiersman and adopted son of the Mohicans. Day-Lewis, with flowing mane and heaving pecs, makes a virile but sensitive hero for the screen and Madeline Stowe is Cora Munro, aristocratic daughter of the proud British Colonel Munro. Stowe manages to find in Cora a fiery balance between sensitivity and strength. One can't help but feel fascinated and/ or captivated by her dark eyes and flowing dark hair.Generally, the film tells the story of Hawkeye and Cora Munro, two people who meet across cultural and class barriers, and are presented serious new challenges.But the film has so more. For example, the contrasts between the two brothers ( Hawkeye and Uncas) and the two sisters ( Cora and Alice). Hawkeye being the more daring and outspoken from the start. He dares to approach the dark haired Cora when he was drawn to her, where as Uncas (Eric Schweig) never openly reveals his attraction to Alice ( Jodhi May). Besides, those short simple looks and glances.But then again, do we really need lines? No. Both Schweig and May have very few lines, but it is their eyes, that are saying everything... Case in point, that sequence in the cave, where Uncas pulls Alice back from the falls and holds her.All in all, I have to honestly say that the last 40 or 50 minutes or so of this movie, are just completely off the hook. I'd wager it might start along the lines of hearing that huge Huron war party cry as the British Army retreats from Ft. William Henry. This leads to Hawkeye vow to rescue Cora no matter what in the scene that takes place behind the waterfall. This is a scene that has been copied and mimicked by many others ( notably Tom Cruise in M1-2) but the way Day-Lewis delivers the line ""You stay alive, no matter what occurs! I will find you. No matter how long it takes, no matter how far, I will find you"" simply makes you believe him.Another amazing sequence would be when our heroes are running up the hill to save Cora, Alice, and the British Maj. Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) after they've been captured. For whatever, reason the Directors Expanded DVD emits the haunting Clannad song, ""I Will Find You"". Why this isn't heard during the scene is beyond me.I've watched this film way too many times now, but easily it is the last 15 minutes that are the most powerful and emotionally devastating. For instance, just watch the way the sequence of music starts with Duncan shouting ""take her and get out"", you know that something serious is going to happen and Duncan is doomed......Or the scene of Uncas's and then Alice's shocking deaths. I've always viewed the later scene as the first time Alice takes control of her own destiny and chooses not to be a victim. She finally snaps out of her shock-induced haze and takes action. Her choice of suicide is made from a place of strength.But it is also the more quiet of moments that simply resonate. For instance, when Chingachgook ( Russell Means) speaks about being the Last of his tribe.A film that truly resonates. No matter the age or the mood.",The Last of the Mohicans
123,antonjsw1,"Well made, strongly acted but too short",7,15 April 2012,"Michael Mann's first feature post Miami Vice is a slickly made, beautifully photographed, well acted but slightly detached, and marred by an ending that feels far too abrupt. This weakness is the same issue that plagued the otherwise excellent Thief. The film takes place in 1757 during the French and Indian War, and focuses on a father, son and adopted white son , all living as the last of the Mohican Indians. Russell Means, Eric Schweig and Daniel Day Lewis play these characters very well, as Day-Lewis's intensity and charisma really shines through and is the anchor for the movie. The main antagonist, Magua, a Huron Indian, is very well played by native American actor Wes Studi, who is always captivating in these roles (particularly his performances in Kevin Costner's Dances with Wolves and Terrence Malick's The New World) and the central dynamic of vengeance playing out between different characters and different levels is well constructed and well played. The major shortcoming is that most of the characters backgrounds and motivations could have done with more development, which would have led the audience have a greater interest in the characters. For example, the arc before Jodhi May's and Eric Schweig's characters could have been genuinely affecting and touching if more time and been devoted to letting it develop. The same goes for Madeleine Stowe's Cora and Steve Waddington's Major Haywood characters. Wes Studi's and Day Lewis's characters background, while explained verbally, doesn't have the same background as having these properly part of the film's narrative. The ending feels too abrupt and I was wishing for the film to have a proper epilogue, which would have rounded off the characters journeys' more fully. Issues with the original cut of the film being 3 hours, and the final film being shorter, may have been a reason for this.Nevertheless despite these gripes to quality of the film is impressive. Mann has found some great locations and the direction is first rate, particularly of the action sequences. Dante Spinotti's BAFTA awarding winning photography is impressive, particularly when showcasing the natural locations. Regular Mann collaborator's Dov Hoenig and Arthur Schmidt's editing is solid. However, it is the sound-scape of the film that is really impressive. Despite problems in production, mainly down to aforementioned issues around the running time, the hybrid score, which is a mix of styles works very well. The sound work by Chris Jenkins, Doug Hemphill, Simon Kaye and Mark Smith is first rate and not surprisingly won an Academy Award. Chris Jenkins has contributed to a large variety of high profile films, and obtained is second Oscar on this film, after collecting his first for Out of Africa. While this was Doug Hemphill's first Oscar, he has subsequently contributed his talents on films such as Almost Famous, Master and Commander and Walk the Line. Simon Kaye was a veteran of the industry, having worked on Charge of the Life Brigade and What a Lovely War, and also had won already won an Oscar, for his work on Oliver Stone's Platoon. This was Mark Smith's first Oscar, but he has subsequently worked a wide variety of high profile films. Overall an impressive film, with a great central performance by Day Lewis, but the drive to reduce the film's running time to approximately 1 hour 40 minutes is what prevented a potential masterpiece from being released, and instead let to a well made and enjoyable film",The Last of the Mohicans
124,kennprop,Not perfect,8,12 August 2020,"This is one of the first American novels. The scenery is good.Period dress and tactics are accurate. DD Lewis can do the,physical part but his acting is too wooden.His dialogue is blah. Even when other people are fired up, it does not come across as real.Despite continuous action, the movie drags. The people are stereotypes.Yucky pompous English .Tough competent Americans.You do have good and bad Indians. Tricky French. The love stories are pretty important factors bit are not exactly hot stuff. Cora was mulatto in the book . That is not in the movie.
Decent movie but lacking something.For some reason many of the scenes are very dark. I understand some of it is at night,but the others lack definition because they are so dark. Some of the dialogue is muddled. My feeling is the characters are stereotypes. The roles with variety are the Indians. Best characters are Magua and Chingachcook and he,seldom speaks.Best lines are the old Huron Sachems .Since I was a boy we have asked, what are the Hurons to do? All the tribes are doomed. That is the message.It's a solid B ,maybe B plus. It's an epic story but falls a little short.",The Last of the Mohicans

126,roystephen-81252,Still not the version I've been looking for,4,5 March 2016,"I was introduced to James Fenimoore Cooper's novel through an abridged graphic version made for filmstrip projectors when I was a child, and I fell in love with it immediately. It was only much later that I found out that the original book is painfully overlong and convoluted. I always thought, however, that the story itself, stripped of the unnecessary fat, would make an excellent movie full of exciting characters and non-stop explosive action. Unfortunately, none of the cinematic versions produced so far have been able to deliver that.Michael Mann's take on The Last of the Mohicans (a considerable box-office and critical success at the time) is like a National Geographic special meant to cure insomnia. An elegiac lament with gorgeous widescreen vistas and lots of slow motion for forced emotional impact, backed by epic synthesizer music. Mann weeded out most of the action, humour and excitement, he mixed up the relationships and characterisations (why, oh, why?) and he basically eliminated the title character, Uncas, from his own story.The result is a movie that has an overwhelming sense of longing, but not much else. A pondering, romantic picture that, in itself, might be beautiful to look at, but is ultimately boring and would never inspire a kid to know all about American Indians and the colonial history of the United States. Of course, it all depends on what you prefer — a plodding adult version or a breathtaking adventure movie that would finally do justice to a story that has captured so many kids' imagination around the world.",The Last of the Mohicans
127,cagebox111,Should Have Focused More on the Last of the Mohicans,7,22 June 2021,"The Last of the Mohicans is a good movie that could have been better had it stayed truer to the source material. This is much more a romantic epic than it need be and the worst part of the movie was the romance. While well-acted, it seemed rushed and would have served better as corollary to the plot rather than driving it. Uncas' death was made less impactful because he was more a side character than he is in the novel, and we feel bad for Nathaniel because he lost his brother, rather than feeling the full weight of his death as the tragic end of an entire race of people. Yes, the movie has the 'Last of the Mohican's' line but the death of the Mohican's is not the primary story here.The movie can also be slow in parts and relies on a great soundtrack to keep the interest through many scenes devoid of dialogue. The final scenes of the movie are effective but could have been much more so had the romance not been such a big storyline and had Uncas been given better development.",The Last of the Mohicans
128,Supachewy,The Last Native American Film Should Have Been Dances With Wolves,3,23 August 2010,"The epic historical film The Last of the Mohicans is directed by Michael Mann and stars Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe, and Jodhi May. The films take place in 1757 in the American Colonies.The films starts off with three of the Mohicans hunting and successfully killing an antelope. Then the Mohicans are recruited by the British Army to become a militia and are promised that if their homes are attacked that they can go back and defend them by Major Heyward. Major Heyward is dating and plans on marrying Colonel Munro's daughter Cora (Stowe). While the Major, Cora and her sister, and other British troops they are ambushed by Native Americans that are supported by the French only to be saved in perfect time by three Mohicans, including Hawkeye (Day-Lewis). From there Hawkeye and Cora begin to start falling for each other as the tension between the Native Americans, French, and British grows in this corny adventure story.The plot of this film is extremely weak. It is full of romance and drama... just like every other film except that every other film is remotely interesting. The whole time I was watching this film I was losing my interest because there was nothing interesting going on. Everything was so predictable and many things were just unbelievable. Such as how one of the Native Americans faced about twenty and was able to kill them all. And also at the beginning during the ambush that everyone died that was not a significant part. During the film is was queue brutal murder to make an emotional reaction and queue a minor character's death. It just seemed so staged and traditional that it was not at all enjoyable.The acting in the film was not all that great. The great Daniel Day-Lewis, one of the greatest actors of all time, is not known to be such a great actor for this film. Yes, he did put on a believable accent, but I was not able to feel a connection to his character. Nor could I feel one to Stowe's whose performance was not in any way special. All she did was look sad at certain parts and like she was in love at others. Another poor thing is that I did not feel any connection between their characters. If I feel no connection with myself with the characters or between the characters themselves then the acting is not very good.The direction of this film by Michael Mann was under par as well. Anyone can get beautiful shots of beautiful landscape there is nothing noteworthy about that. Mann didn't succeed in getting beautiful shots of not so beautiful landscape, which is what a great director needs to be able to do. A great director also needs to connect the characters on the screen so a connection from the audience to the characters can be made, but yet Mann fails again. Now Michael Mann is a very successful director and he goes on to make some pretty solid films so don't think I am bashing him. It is just good to know that he improves in the future.The best part of the film is easily the score. It is moving and provides the emotion that the rest of the film is not able to give. Perfect for this kind of epic film. The film won an Oscar for sound which it definitely deserves.Overall I give this film a 3/10, due to the fact that it is very bad for the reasons explained above. I don't know why this film is so highly rated everywhere I check, maybe it is not for me. Anyway I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys historical, romance, or epic films.",The Last of the Mohicans
129,elcoat,Brilliant film - one of America's greatest and most historically descriptive ever.,10,2 April 2016,"I first saw this film after checking it out from a video store one Friday night, and I watched it 3 times straight! I have always regretted not seeing it in the theater, where it must have been overawing.It is amazing how many people around the world have seen and been awed by it as well ... and have had their understanding of the 1700s American frontier shaped by it. I have never read Cooper's book, and I doubt it would be up to this film version of it.The various passions it depicts - especially the love stories - are amplified by its grippingly intense, pulsating music.It does explain the basic, growing differences in attitudes and philosophies of British-American colonists and British military officers and politicians at that time.There are flaws - like historically inaccurate contact-exploding shells hitting Ft. William Henry - presumably for dramatic effect - but they can and should be forgiven.Madeleine Stowe's luminous intelligence and sensitivity/sexuality spotlight Cora's character. It should be noted that neither actor had to remove her/his clothes to make the love scene torrid.I prefer the original studio cut which includes 3 essential items: Hawkeye telling the Major he thinks they will someday have a serious disagreement, Hawkeye cockily asking the Major - pointing his pistol at H. from the other canoe - if he has nothing better to do on the lake today, and the Clannad lovesong impassioning the heroes' pursuit of Magua and his band with the captured girls and Major.However, the director's cut version I also have does include the Major's well-commanded action outside the fort's walls - a diversion from the courier starting off elsewhere - ordered by Col. Munro in the film. It also shows a bit more of the science of 1700s siegecraft and military engineering, which the studio cut should have had.Wes Studi's Magua is one of the great villains in film history, but even Magua is shown as human, albeit so deeply embittered. (Shocked at Alice's apparent intent to fall to her death, even he relents from killing her and wants her to live ... only to be rejected.)And Russell Means - whom I had not liked after the Wounded Knee Incident of 1973 - was a strong father figure worthy of respect.I cannot understand why anyone would down-rate this magnificent film.By the way, the sister of one of my great (great, x?) grandfathers, Susannah Willard Johnson, was captured for ransom along with her entire family by Indians allied to the French around this time. (Mercifully and miraculously they all survived, even her baby christened Captive, born and allowed to survive on the trail up north to Canada.) Her Narrative is an historically important piece of American literature.And I grew up in Rock Island Illinois, which was the site of Saukenauk, the capital village of the Sauk and Fox Indians, mentioned as rivals by Magua to the Sachem at the climax of the film. (Many years later, it was ""the British Band"" of Sauk War Chief Black Hawk that crossed back across the Mississippi from Ft. Madison to raid and campaign up through northern Illinois into Wisconsin: the Black Hawk War of 1832.) My ancestor, a pensioned British 1815 Napoleonic war veteran, survivor of the British Legion with Bolivar in Venezuela, and Scottish soldier of fortune, arrived in Rock Island in 1830 and is buried there.Lou Coatney",The Last of the Mohicans
130,NoName1989,Very good film!. Excellent soundtrack,8,16 August 2006,"I thought this was a very good film!The acting was pretty good, certainly Daniel Day-Lewis did a good job, but the rest of the cast was also good.The music by Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman was also excellent! The Last Of The Mohicans won an Oscar for the soundtrack. Personally I'm not sure if that Oscar was deserved, because I think the music in the film 1492: Conquest Of Paradise (by Vangelis), also released in 1992 is maybe a little bit better. But, nevertheless, the music is really excellent! One of the best soundtracks ever made! Michael Mann did a good job as director.

131,dorotka24,"Dramatic, intense historical adventure",10,20 November 2007,"This film, in my opinion, began a long run of intense, violent, and passionate historical action-dramas throughout the 90s. Braveheart, Rob Roy, Gladiator, and The Patriot all followed in its footsteps.This is the ageless tale of a brutal struggle in an unforgiving and, to Europeans, unfamiliar land. There are clearly two sides in this struggle, but neither one has truly likable characters. The endearing players here are forced to choose sides in the struggle, much as was the case in the America of the 18th century. They clearly have no great loyalty to their chosen side, and the main struggles here are without a doubt personal.I felt the acting here was excellent, with superb performances all around. I especially liked how a particularly arrogant and unlikable character, a British officer, in the end completely redeems himself with an unmitigated selfless act of great personal sacrifice.This was at the time unlike any movie I had seen before. It was fast paced with intense combat, passionate romance, and a compelling and exciting story. Even the many character interactions had a particular intensity to them even when the physical action had ceased.This will perhaps always remain one of my favorite films, and I cannot think of a single flaw, though there most certainly must be a few. Some have commented on the accuracy of the transfer from book to film. I cannot comment directly on this, as I have not read the book. But I can say that there is not a film in existence that will appeal to every fan of the book, nor is it realistic to assume that a literary work can ever be completely and accurately represented on the screen.It is therefore with an unbiased and honest heart that I give my highest regards to ""Last of the Mohicans.""",The Last of the Mohicans

133,johcafra,Michael Mann In Spite of Himself,8,7 July 2007,"With some very rare exceptions I don't enjoy Westerns, and I'm quite the nitpicker with historical epics. But when this is televised I literally stop what I'm doing, willing to suffer through even the ""pan-and-scan"" treatment and interminable commercial torture sessions.No, I don't own the ""Director's Cut"" DVD, and I feel users unnecessarily quibble over its differences from the theatrical release as well as James Fenimore Cooper's novel. Watch ""both"" films if you like (the theatrical release likely on VHS from your public library), its predecessor film version perhaps, then read Cooper's novel that you may have been forced to read in school, or others in the series by him featuring ""Natty Bumppo,"" then for background some historical accounts or novels by Allan Eckert and Walter D. Edmonds. But if you watch only the film you just can't lose.For in spite of himself Mann makes everything work here, and I do mean everything. If it isn't his most topical film it's his best film, hands down. And even with legendary accounts of overproduction, if the end result shows me the director gives a serious hang about what I pay two bits to see on the big screen, I won't gripe about my passenger status.Recognize Daniel Day-Lewis plays America's first literary action hero, and I cannot picture that done by anyone else in any other way. Madeline Stowe and Jodhi May don't have to say a word to get the point across. Wes Studi is a portrait of unalloyed menace. And that all converges in the penultimate 15 or so minutes of the film, enhanced by the location, photography, editing, stunt work, Trevor Jones' positively hypnotic theme that includes of all things a Scottish reel, and no (repeat, NO) spoken lines.Perhaps the highest praise I can offer: If you don't think you'd like this sort of thing, you are guaranteed to have a change of heart.",The Last of the Mohicans
134,Axiom-2,The Best Remake Ever!,10,22 April 2000,"I never got to see this unforgettable picture when it was released back in September/92. I've owned the Laser Disc of it for over three years,but never got around to watching it until last summer(99). One of my fellow co-workers told me that it was his favorite films of all time,so I invited him over to watch it with me. I can't believe that this much time has gone by without me ever watching it. This movie is amazing! I just finished ordering the soundtrack for it from Amazon.($13.99) They wanted $36.99 for it here in Canada! This is another one of those film's where the music adds so much more impact to it. I sometimes will put on the part near the end when they are running up the side of the mountain.That scene along with the music leading up to the final cliffside battle with actor Wes Studi is one of the best climatic scene's ever filmed! There are no words to describe the power of that part.Wes Studi was excellent in his part as Magua. I now have the DVD of it, but was a little disappointed that there were no extras with it. Not even the stinkin trailer! But the movie itself & the sound & picture quality far out weight that minor error.

Still, having re-watched Mann's Heat the other day I thought I was in safe hands.What surprised me the most was how beautifully it was shot considering this is the early 90s.

136,berberian00-276-69085,Epic of American Wilderness,10,13 November 2013,"When I started to write this short review on the film ""The Last of the Mohicans"" (1992), my utter amazement left me stupefied in front of an avalanche of information that was available on the background novel and its author James Fenimore Cooper. This is good and bad simultaneously. If someone in their teens try to understand the plot, he will soon become too shy in his endeavor. The Leatherstocking Tales as a series of novels each featuring the main hero Natty Bumppo and his adventures in American Wild West have long time became a historical legacy. The five novels are themselves based on real events reflecting episodes from life of the author (James F. Cooper) as frontiersman and navigator on the area of Great Lakes (Ontario and Erie). So the lush youngster should beware before making hurried conclusions. Now on some personal commentaries.""The Last of the Mohicans"" (a novel) was written in 1826, and tells a narrative from 1757 (the Seven Years' War between France and Great Britain battled for control of North America). This war led ultimately to the American War of Independence (1775-1783) since the British settlers were not pressed southward anymore by the French and their Indian Allies. In continental Europe the French defeat led to outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792. So one can realize now the immense impact of this local Indian Drama from 18th century on the global ebb of historical events. No offence for titular author, but Cooper himself was a poor historian and couldn't grasp in his imaginative mind the long term consequences of what was going on around him - the French and Indian Wars, the American War of Independence, etc. His main source of information was the local Antiquarian Society which was in itself an achievement. Consider, for instance, the contribution of people like Lewis Morgan and his anthropological research on the Iroquois Ancient Society (the Mohawks and Five Nations). As in the movie and the novel they fought against their adversaries the Hurons (from Algonquin tribes of Canada) and intermittently with the White Settlers that in due course sacked them to a vanishing race.As good as the novel has been - though sometimes packed with slow action and much verbosity - the film, directed by Michael Mann, appears to me even better. Several are the reasons and in first place the simplified plot. The credits for the screen adaptation belong to several people but they did an excellent job. Get here the differences with the novel which I consider essential:1/ Only the leading male characters remain unchanged - Natty Bumppo or Hawkeye, Chingachgook the Big Snake, Uncas the Last of Mohicans, and Magua the Huron;2/ Colonel Munro's family doesn't die in the book except Cora - in the film Cora remains alive, while the Colonel is killed by Magua and later he also kills Alice and Uncas. Magua is slain finally by Chingachgook;3/ Duncan Heyward - a British army major is presented as traitor and dies on fire-stake. David Gamut – a psalmodist, is not existent in the Film.

Buy a good video camera, head to Shenandoah or Blue Ridge mountain and I guaranty that you'll make some artistic videos of nature so is taking some good videos of national parks considered art? probably! But that's not enough to make a movie neither artistic nor entertaining. This film has severe production problems which gave audience feel of a TV movie rather than a cinematic work. Everything looked polished, both Indians and colonials were shaved, clean and dressed up. Indians were the worse speaking plain English with just some misplaced words! But that's not all. There was something seriously wrong with the screenplay. It was slow, boring and lacked almost any conflict. The Mohican was flirting with the British lady in broad daylight while the presumed suitor/fiancé was acting like a carrot. No emotion, no conflict and I doubt if it was even historically accurate. Acts were not notable also. Daniel Day Lewis delivered a flat performance, probably not his fault, there was nothing special about his character.

But I hope that the confusion resulted not from directorial lapses, but intent. The confusion only added to the horror of the violence, and showed that no war or battle is not fun, whoever the victor.Johdi May was simply radiant in her, and in my opinion the film's, climax. She was the most memorable character because of what she did in those last scenes.But then why did she have to die? A short while later, Magua was killed. Perhaps, that was the moment she was not restrained, but I also remember Hawkeye urging Cora to stay alive at the waterfall.It also seems weird, now that I think about it, that the Magua's fighters stood around after those in the front were hacked down.",The Last of the Mohicans
140,ashi-lance,Another Must watch from DD Lewis,9,27 August 2013,"""The Last of the Mohicans"" was one of the most popular and acclaimed films of its time. Its vision of early America, as it was during the French and Indian War, is captured in its utter brutality and beauty, complete with the many driving ambitions and clashing cultures with everyone being involved. This movie has a bit of action, romance, war, and passionate drama. The director, Michael Mann, knows the story well and it appears that he has researched well into the James Fenimore Cooper's book on which the movie is based. The story is all over the place, with three frontier scouts - Hawkeye (Daniel Day-Lewis), Chingachgook (Russell Means), and Uncas (Eric Schweig) - escorting a British colonel's daughters – Cora Munro (Madeleine Stowe) and Alice Munro (Jodhi May) - to safety at the besieged Fort William Henry. Major Duncan Heyward (Steven Waddington) rivals Hawkeye for Cora's affections and a vengeance-driven Huron named Magua (Wes Studi) seeks to have both daughters killed in retribution for the loss of his own children. This is by far Mann's best film yet and he uses the lush wilderness settings to great effect. He also makes good use of the editing, which actually comes in handy when showcasing the brutal violence that dominates much of the film's action sequences. The film's last 20 minutes are a definite stunner that can only be described as classic and vicious. This is a great movie that shows America in its infancy; complete with the rivalries, intrigue, and violence that I'm sure was an everyday part of life during that hectic time period. MY RATING: 9/10",The Last of the Mohicans
141,TexMetal4JC,Stunning.,9,14 August 2001,"What to say about The Last of the Mohicans that hasn't already been said?The cinematography is absolutely stunning. The colors and scenery used are phenomenal. Just an absolutely beautifully shot movie. Likewise, the acting and directing are nearly perfect, and we all know the music is some of the best ever made.It seems there is currently a trio of war/patriot movies out now. ""The Last of the Mohicans"", ""Braveheart"" and ""The Patriot"" make up this trio, and they all have amazing similarities. They all contain the brawny, long-haired pacifist drawn into the fighting when his loved ones are drawn into it. They all dog on the British pretty badly. And they all contain that last climactic scene between hero and archvillain.But Last of the Mohicans breaks several of the stereotypes set by the movies that came after it. While the shortest of the three, Mohicans feels more like the epic, what with its cinematography and soaring score making the movie seem ethereal at times. And although it seems epic, it doesn't seem to run long enough. By the time you realize that inevitable climactic battle has happened, the movie is already ending. And that climactic fight is far shorter than say, The Patriot's. Also, Mohicans has a more complex plot. Because Lewis' character is fighting not only to protect his girl, but also the families of the settlers, the rights of the colonists and the lives of his adoptive family. (As opposed to Mel Gibson's characters who fight for revenge and ""FREEEEDOOOM!"")Needless to say, Last of the Mohicans is incredibly impressive. Some of the speeches (especially the argument between Madeleine Stowe's character and her father) are moving and believable, while the violence is done quite tastefully.Unfortunately, the fight scenes are a bit hard to follow at times, but this seems to be the only part where the movie is even the slightest bit lacking.Overall Last of the Mohicans is an excellent movie, just below The Patriot on the war/action/romance scale. It is truly stunning.",The Last of the Mohicans
142,ltj36,Dances with adventure,9,15 March 2000,"""The Last of the Mohicans"" is a modern western. It has the same epic breath of movies like ""Stagecoach"" or ""The Searchers"". Daniel Day Lewis has given a wonderful character of Hawkeye, well helped by the beautiful Madeleine Stowe, the good Jodhy May and the great Indian characters who are Russell Means and Wes Studi. Michael Mann did very good work helped by the likes of Dante Spinotti and the score of Trevor Jones & Randy Edelman.

143,floyd-52,I don't get it,3,28 April 2007,"I'll give this a 3 out of 10 for trying to be an epic. The music that everyone raves about is, frankly, ordinary. Try a movie like Legends Of The Fall if you want truly great music.As to war movies, The Patriot beats this movie by a factor of ten. For one thing, Mel Gibson's character is a suitable centerpiece whereas this movie lacks one.Some of the scenes are truly bizarre. Have a look at that ""tea in a field"" scene in the first hour of the movie. Why on Earth were they in the middle of a field having tea? And why did the camera zoom back to show us this highly improbable location? This ""Director's Expanded Edition"" DVD has a bunch of stuff removed from it (according to other comments). This is a major drawback, and goes against the name (Director's EXPANDED Edition), yet 19 of the 20 most recent comments give this movie nothing less than an 8 out of 10. Most give it 10 out of 10. This DEE DVD has no commentary, no extras of any kind. Why? Because this is one very ordinary movie, people.Some poor movies are sleep inducing, others simply fail to draw the viewers in. This movie is in the latter category -- without merits, frankly. The only reasons I can think of for the high votes are (1) the usual ballot stuffing by studio shills, (2) those who love blood and guts movies and enjoy seeing realistic scalping scenes.Michael Mann makes great, and awful, movies. I've got the Special Edition of Heat and like it a great deal, but both The Insider and Collateral were immensely awful.No reason to see this movie. Rent something like The Prestige or The Guardian instead.",The Last of the Mohicans
144,Pikchar,A story about Love amidst War,8,5 February 2000,This movie is about the French - English War in America. It stars Daniel-Day Lewis and Madeline Stowe. It has been directed by Michael Mann and he has done a brilliant job. The on - screen chemistry between the two stars is electrifying!

French-British War for the North America 1757.",9,24 April 2011,"To start out with, the acting was superb from Daniel Day-Lewis, Wes Studi, Russel Means, Eric Schweig and Madeline Stowe. The intensity of the Mohawks, the passion of the frontier settlers, the arrogance of the British soldiers. The time period shows how the daughters of the British General are not very wise to the world and just what truly happens.Costumes and the re-enactment was very realistic. War is hell, and this movie shows it from the scalping of the British soldiers to the cannon fight at Fort William Henry.This movie has a lot in common with the old Alfred Hitchcock films, in that the music is subtly infused when needed. The ending of the movie with the build up of the ""Main Title"" music during the race to retrieve the two daughters will keep you on the edge of your seat.",The Last of the Mohicans

147,lurch-17,emotionally gut-wrenching,9,22 July 2003,"Stowe's performance and Mann's direction should have won academy awards along with the haunting score (which did).  I am amazed at Mann's ability to draw out such emotion with action, music, cinematography while few words are spoken.Stowe's scenes alone with D.D. Lewis were memorable - especially her 'soul stirring' lines.The guns sounded real, the actors were not acting, the settings and cinematography were riveting, and the celtic score constantly pulled you in.Jodhi May's and Steve Waddington's final scenes still makes me cry after having seen them twenty times.  Wes Studi's sincere and unfaltering hatred, coupled with Russell Mean's innocence and lack of polish, made these characters seem not only real but plausible.The four-way three-language 'hearing' in the Huron village, at first difficult to follow, is so cleverly written, played and emotionally charged it stands out as a one-of-a-kind scene in cinema history.Owning the DVD, I have shown this to various family members and friends.

149,epat,Vivid sense of time & place.,10,17 April 2014,"The book makes a pretty dry read, but Last of the Mohicans is a good yarn.From history books, we all know how the French & English warred for colonial control in North America; we might even remember that certain native tribes allied themselves with the warring powers. But how many of us remember it was the Mohawks who fought on the side of the British & the Hurons who allied themselves with the French? This rich-textured film brings it all alive in a way we probably won't forget. When we hear Hawk-eye talk about wintering in ""the Kain-tak-kee"" & realize this is a time before such artificial political constructs as states even existed in the New World, we can suddenly grasp the boundless sense of freedom held dear by woods folk who cared nothing for borders or politics.The film also brings out the quandary of ""colonial militias"", ordinary men whose protracted absence meant leaving their families undefended on the ragged frontiers of a war-torn land. Add to this the factionalism & rivalries of the native tribes in their uncertain alliances with ""les Fransayz"" or ""les Yengiz"". Contrast the inflexible authoritarianism of the British (presumably the French as well) with the natives' political system, governed by loose alliances & by the moral suasion of local wise men known as sachems, & one begins to get a real sense of the humanity behind the dry history we all learned in school.We see the absolutism of colonial commanders who renege on promises to allow their militiamen to leave when their homesteads came under threat & we gain insight into the cutthroat machinations so often masked by the flowery language of formal agreements. When Colonel Munro surrenders his fort to the besieging French forces under the deceptively gracious General Montcalm, Montcalm hints to his Huron allies that while his honor requires him to allow the British to leave unmolested, he really would prefer not to risk having to fight these same soldiers again some other time & place. Understanding full well what the general has just given them license to do, the Hurons fall on & massacre the helpless troops & civilians whose hubristic leader traded the dubious security of the fort for the grave dangers of a forced march through hostile territory.Daniel Day Lewis performs well in the lead role as Hawk-eye & real-life First Nations activist Russell Means puts in a nicely understated performance as the quietly stalwart Chingachgook. (I've heard he also exerted considerable influence behind the scenes to assure the accuracy of the historical setting & interpretation.) For me though, the fierce intensity of Wes Studi's portrayal of Magua, the vengeful villain of the piece, outshines them all. You hate him for his cruelty, but when you learn his back-story, you can hardly wonder at his thirst for vengeance. This superb piece of acting & the vivid sense of time & place make this film one of the best-ever historical dramas brought to screen.",The Last of the Mohicans
150,joeestlinbm,"The essence of viciousness, and beauty",10,8 February 2005,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Probably not much, but I feel like it's my duty to try, since this movie in my opinion, from beginning, to end, is one of the most dynamic, and beautiful things man, has ever had the initiative to produce.I think that nothing I've ever seen, aside from actual realism, has ever seemed as real as this movie.I don't want to take away from any of them, so I won't put my finger on any one in particular, so as for the Native Americans who acted in this movie, they were superb, right down to the speaking of their native tongue, (noting that some of the language of north eastern Native Americans has been lost over the years). Even the extras played their parts flawlessly.And the music, especially during the last scenes in the movie, on the cliffs, seemed to accent the viciousness, and to some extent the beauty of that which was taking place. If you're a fan of Native Americans, as I am, and you haven't seen this movie, you're doing yourself an injustice.Thanks for allowing me to express my opinion.",The Last of the Mohicans
151,Leungzy,Good soundtrack but overall overrated and dated,5,11 August 2021,"I'll start with why I gave it a 5/10. This movie is very dated when comparing it to modern day movies, I don't feel like it has aged well at all.Maybe had I seen this movie around the time it was released I would have appreciated it more, but I really do not understand how it is so highly rated.For example some of the action scenes are ridiculous to the point that they are comical, at one stage DDL's character hip-fires two muskets killing two soldiers without even aiming them.During one of the main fighting scenes when they are ambushed, you can see soldiers in the background holding their guns upside as if they're baseball bats ready to swing them... These are muskets by the way that have knives attached to the end of them... It was like they paid a load of extras to be in the movie who had never seen what a gun was before and gave them no direction as to what to do.I also didn't find Major Hayward's character redemption story very believable at all, how could someone go from being evil and selfish to sacrificing themselves to being burnt alive... just seemed so far fetched to point the story in the direction that the movie makers wanted it to go.The ending also didn't make any sense either how one character got so far ahead of the pack on the mountain.I don't know how this movie won an Oscar for ""best sound"" as some of the scenes were completely inaudible, I couldn't make out what they were saying without turning on subtitles, for example, the scene when they're in the waterfall.Some of the things I did like - the soundtrack is good, probably the best part of the whole movie and the most memorable to me. I also enjoyed how the main antagonist isn't dealt with by the main protagonist in the end... it was pleasant to experience an ending that wasn't a typical Hollywood one.Overall I gave this movie a 5 because I'll only ever remember the ridiculousness of the fighting scenes and the good soundtrack, other than that I've no interest in ever watching this again.",The Last of the Mohicans

155,flyingsaucer,Emotional saga filled with heroism,9,11 February 2012,"The Last of Mohicans is a remarkable story of a man, whose destiny envelopes lives of many others, and stands out as a burning message thrown out onto the world. From the beginning to the end, the movie sings only the song of freedom. It depicts how every creature, every race is craving for freedom, and what happens if the freedom is prejudiced by some greedy men. But as every wise man on earth says, troubles are not forever, a brighter day shall come, and this movie gives this message too.Three mohawks are on their way to can-tuck-ee, in war-torn America. English and French fight each other for the land. A party of British soldiers and two daughters of a general area attacked by a group of natives in support of french, who kill almost all of the British. But these Mohawks, trace the natives and come out and kill them. They rescue the two girls, and an army officer and take them back safely to the fort where their father has been commissioned, and in the process there brews love between Hawk-eye and one of the general's daughter. The French are already bombing the fort and are sure to take over it in a few days. The remaining story captures the efforts of Hawk-eye and other mohawks to save the general's daughters and escape. Acting wise, Daniel Day-Lewis nails it. Brilliantly Inspirational Acting. Kudos. The movie never bores you, it is a very thrilling ride into the world of natives, and it shows that natives have a lot of great culture. The background score is really good, one of the best I have ever heard. I would recommend it to everyone on this planet.",The Last of the Mohicans

Seeing a movie version of this is such a woderful experience and director Michael Mann managed to make one that is special and heartfelt. With Daniel Day-Lewis as the main protagonist teaming with the charming performance of Madeleine Stowe and dauntless acting of Wes Studi; excellent musical score and sound effect; beautiful cinematography; and solid production design, thi s movie will surely take you to a journey in the middle of the French and Indian war.

158,debjyoti1981,An Instant Classic !!!,8,5 December 2009,"An instant classic if I need to express this movie in one word.Michael Mann's ""The Last of the Mohicans"" is loosely based on the famous classic novel of the same name written by James Copper.If we start digging, we will notice lots of the main stream movies have taken its roots from legendary literary works. Well though it's not a bad thing but most of the time in general the movies have always deviated from the source material. End result is, you will find them less gripping than the novel. Well this is not in the case of ""The Last of the Mohicans"" which is a very good thing. If any of you have read the novel you will know that the story had a kind of tragic ending. None the less, this movie had been highly compelling; I hope every one will agree with me.For those who have not yet seen this movie, the story is set in the time of 1757 when Great Britain & France fought for gaining control of the North American colonies along with the support of local militia & Native American tribes. In parallel to this we also get to see a beautiful love story wedged in the middle of the war. Though this movie does have some unpredictable tragic note still I feel that this movie was extraordinary. I will not go into full details of the story as it really ruins the anticipation.First thing which comes to mind about this movie are its remarkable scenery & an amazing musical score by Randy Edelman. Even if some one does not find the story appealing I am sure they will get transfixed with the soundtrack as well as the hand to hand action displayed which is really satisfying. Considering the time this movie was made I just cannot forget how beautiful the cinematography had been.This movie has used some great talents like Daniel Day-Lewis & Madeleine Stoweshe looked so stunning & majestic simply I can't forget her... :) Steven Waddington as Maj. Duncan was also very impressive. Overall I feel it was not only the actors which made this movie a sensation but the story itself along with the backdrop score. Considering all together we were presented with a high octane action adventure. This movie has two versions, one is the ""theatrical cut"" other one is the ""director cut"". Well I have seen both of them & the only difference between the two is inclusion of some two minutes footage & emission of one song from the movie. This fact hardly makes any difference.If any of you have not seen this, do give it a try. This definitely should find a place in any collector's shelf.",The Last of the Mohicans

When he rescues her and returns her to her father, he starts to be attracted to her, and a love story unfolds. Plenty of action, with many battle scenes that are skillfully done. This was the first Daniel Day-Lewis movie I had ever seen, and it appears to me now that no wonder he won Best Actor in 1989 (for ""My Left Foot"") he was also great in this movie as well. As I've told you it has skillfully done battle scenes, but it also has great scenery, wonderful music, and awesome acting. A masterpiece!

It is comparable to other great historical action/adventure movies like Braveheart and Gladiator, but what makes this better is the music. It is haunting but at the same time inspiring. The name of the theme song is The Gael and I could probably listen to it all day. There is little to complain about with this movie. Maybe the romantic part was a little bit forced.

This is the overall background of the movie, and violence runs almost throughout, from the beginning hunt to the last few minutes. Despite the sad and violent backdrop, the story is uplifted by the tense developing romance of Hawkeye (Daniel Day Lewis) and Cora (Madeline Stowe), and both of them give a sterling performance as the role seems to fit them perfectly. The romance is all the more intense because it is between two people who are so differently oriented and socially placed and also because it is fused with intense adventure. The script and direction provide several insights into Native American culture, one of which is right at the beginning when Russell Means performs a prayer ceremony over the fallen deer. Neat and economic script with nothing superfluous, beautiful photography, unforgettable musical score, brilliant dialogsin short, no wasted moments, makes it a movie that can be seen several times, worth having in your collection.",The Last of the Mohicans

165,Shelly_Servo3000,Beautiful in every way,8,20 July 2001,"""The Last of the Mohicans"" is a glossy, romanticized version of James Fenimore Cooper's classic novel. But I mean this in a good way. Does anyone remember reading Cooper's novel in High School? No one does. No one cared. This movie MAKES you care. This movie thrusts the characters in your face, puts human emotion on display, and leaves you genuinely interested in their lives.Daniel Day Lewis gives an incredible performance as ""Hawkeye"" - the white ""brother"" of the Mohican tribe, which, for reasons I can't remember, only consists of two members. Madeleine Stowe is superb as the Englishman's daughter, who gets caught up in the fight for American Independence. The chemistry between Daniel Day Lewis and Ms. Stowe is outstanding. There wouldn't be a better pair for this movie.Even if you are not impressed with the performances given by the principal leads, you WILL be impressed with the breathtaking cinematography. Also, there is no more haunting and gorgeous soundtrack in existance than the score for ""The Last of the Mohicans.""In short, no matter why you would choose to see ""The Last of the Mohicans"" - SEE IT.

The film depicts depicts the French and Indian war in 1757. This film is absolutely amazing. It holds no punches back in the depiction of war, both dramatically and in the way it exploits the violence of it. It's an authentic portrayal and unbiased as much as the director can. While the director caters more towards the settlers, giving them more reasons than just land, he also gives layered reasons for the natives as possible, to make the war more engaging and believableSo the story revolves around mostly Hawkeye, the main character, and Cora, who are caught in the middle of the conflict. Hawkeye just wants to find his true self, as he is the adoptive son of Chingachgook. Between his intriguing past, his dedication and unconditional love for Cora (though the love story and chemistry I find to be the weakest part of the film, but still solid), all of this within the war going on, makes him a well layered character to follow, and its all powered by Daniel Day Lewis' fantastic performance. All of the actors do a great job, and I can't think of a single bad performance. Even side characters are given such weight. It reminded me of the dark knight, where Jim Gordon has such presence thanks to the writing and acting. Same happens here. One of the main positives (that's an understatement) is how the film balances acting in a full circle. The movie doesn't just rely on dialogue (as good as it is), it also gives priority to body language and facial expression, adding more depth and natural progression to the characters. It makes them more human and relatable. And there is something to be mentioned: Magua has to be one of the most underrated film villains to ever come. Sympathetic, ruthless, honorable are just some of the words to describe the character, excellently portrayed by Wes Studi. His motivations and hatred for the English is fleshed out, from a tragic past, full of blood, it is understandable why Magua took such a bloody path of hatred and violence. The movie looks and feels magnificent. Whoever did the cinematography truly deserves an Oscar. Its visually enlightening, the camera work is graceful, giving you a complete vision of everything going on the screen as you can get, and the color palette adds a unique atmosphere to the film. they add an epic and beautiful scale to give you a full experience of the movie. It's arguably the greatest adventure movie ever made. And of course, how can anyone forget the iconic and great musical score? Every time it hits the screen, it gives me goosebumps. You feel like its telling a story to you. What more can I say? The film is excellently crafted with such care and passion that no film buff or fan should skip.

Maybe I have recently seen too many films from the 1930s and -40s - an age when plot development was crisp and directors aimed at finishing within 90 minutes. By comparison, this take on Cooper's tale appeared to me bombastic and unneccesarily long. I grew bored, tired of the music and the pompous speeches, and the thing kept going on and on.

170,onewhoseesme,if you could only have one . . .,10,14 April 2009,"This is my very favorite film! As much as I like Gladiator and Troy, they always seem so distant. Perhaps this being closer to our time and fought on our turf, just before we set off on our own as a nation - it speaks more to me. Only Mel Gibson and The Patriot come close to the excellence in cinema that tells of this time. Like a lot of guys, I am easily won over by big, epic, sweeping, romantic stories of war and heroism - I enjoy them immensely. This is the one I enjoy the most. I think in part it's because all of the tribes at war here, are presented in a favorable light. The French and the British, Mohawk and Huron, the settlers and colonists - you like all of them! There are bad guys too, but it's the Noble men that stand out. And there are noble men and the showing of honor throughout. I'm sure Mr. Cooper's great telling of a good story has a lot to do with it - the writers always do. But it's the movie we're talking about.It might just be my imagination, but it seems that Michael Mann always does something with the lighting. I think it goes all the way back to his Miami Vice days. It seems to affect the intimacy, or the way we view the people. But I could be wrong. His two best films are this one and Heat. With the greatest shootout anywhere being the one in Heat. Daniel Day Lewis wore the part of Hawkeye as though it had been tailor made. What an excellent performance. But then he's famous for the study he puts into his characters. There are some seemingly smart strong people in every group presented here, no one tribe has all the virtue. In that sense, they are equals - a rarity in storytelling and movie making. So much of history is crowded with the master and servant relationship that also ends up in much of our literature. And there is always an element of truth to that, but it's not the whole truth. Don't forget, it's the winners who always write the history. Seldom does a conquerer speak well of a vanquished foe. The character of Chingachgook, the older Mohawk and former chief, has got the coolest weapon in the form of a Mohawk throwing axe. It's so big it looks like a rifle when it's slung over his back, but it's not. This is not at all a Western, which occupies a unique time period in our history between the end of the Civil War and the early 1900's. One hundred years before there was ever a west to have cowboys in - there was the Frontier and frontiersmen. A completely different time, place and people - not related to the cowboy. This is their say, let them have it.It all takes place during the time that the British and French are fighting for control over the fur trade in the north all the way up into Canada, and the sugar trade all the way down south into the Caribbean. Sometimes wars are about the land, but many times they're about the money coming from the resources. This is one of those times, and the heat of the battle over this money is the French and Indian War - at least on land. Which covers the period of our story. You never hear that in movies or novels, but that is the history of it. When left to themselves, Cain will always kill Abel - over something. I leave it on that note as it ties in perfectly with the sense of remorse and longing we're left with from the story. But you'll have to watch this most excellent movie for yourself to see what any of that means. I don't think you'll be disappointed. It is a rich tale, a grand sweeping romantic action adventure epic, a satisfying movie, and a most beautiful one at that.",The Last of the Mohicans

172,Stanjaudit,Pre-revolutionary Wary,8,21 March 2013,"This movie was excellent with a strong cast and definite Heros and bad guys. There was love, betrayal, hatred, deceit, distrust and loyalty. The time period was 1757 and just 9 years later we declared our Independence and 1787 defeated England at Yorktown. A follow on to this movie would be April Morning where a young boy not quite 16 enlists in the town militia to stand with is father (Tommy Lee Jones) who is killed the first day on the Boston common. He spends the rest of the day hiding and firing at the Redcoats. Another movie that follows on to this one is The Patriot starring Mel Gibson. This takes place in South Carolina and concludes with the surrender of Cornwallace at Yorktown. For all practical purposes that was the end of the war but it went on for two more years until the English finally signed surrender documents in New York and we became a nation of 13 states in 1789. The music in Last of the Mohican was beautiful and intoxicating. It also played a significant part in the movie. One will thoroughly enjoy this movie. For most of the movie Cora Monroe was the stronger of the two sisters. However, at the end, Alice Monroe exercised great courage and threw herself off the cliff rather than allow Mauga the pleasure of killing her.",The Last of the Mohicans
173,endersgame1972,The last of the Mohicans,10,18 May 2015,Let me start off By saying this was with out a doubt one of the best films I have seen. The acting by Daniel Day Lewis ( Lincoln) was absolutely above broad I enjoyed it form the first moment to the last I was on the edge of my seat. and it was historicity accurate an enjoyable film but NOT for children in any way shape or form way to much violence for any one under 16 and the dialog was very course. But for the high school crowd this could be a good subject matter for history class. the screen play was awesome and the cast was all star. With out a doubt this will go down in history as one of the greatest film of time.,The Last of the Mohicans

175,catalog,A Breathtaking Action Movie,8,7 December 1999,"The Last of the Mohicans has some of the most beautiful scenery ever filmed. It also takes us to the time before the Revolutionary War.  That doesn't mean it is boring.  This isn't a Merchant-Ivory picture, this is a modern action movie that doesn't slow down once it starts rolling.  Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe are thrown into the mix for beauty's sake, and they give strong performances as would-be lovers in a savage wilderness. 
Historical inaccuracies pretty much run wild in this picture, but no one really cares because the action is so stirring and the sights are so gorgeous.  In fact, the action and cinematography almost make up for the lame story, but not quite.  But once again, who watches an action movie for plot?Unless you are a hard-core historian who gives a rats behind about whether muskets could be used like sniper rifles, you will find The Last of the Mohicans to be a quality action picture.",The Last of the Mohicans

Not that it was bad the first time but, pieces after pieces, you see much more...Well, you can be seduced by the acting, the romance, the historical background or the Indians way. But it's finally an all-together thing that makes it really great: sequences extremely violent are succeeded by narrative scenes, and the tension, the suspense builds itself part by part, little by little until the wonderful final and the full dramatic score. Yes there is some big twists from the original text from Cooper but the adaptation gives us more, in particular with the Magua character who is not just a villain but a man whose honor and past dictate the present conduct like...Munro his very same enemy.Let say that everything in this movie just tend to greatness.",The Last of the Mohicans

The cinematography is just beyond words...the gorgeous location of the North Carolina Great Smoky Mountains becomes an integral part of this classic....and oh, the unforgettable theme music! If you haven't already seen, this movie, you have missed out on one of Hollywood's greatest accomplishments.....It has it all, action, thrills, romance, history, the best music ever in any movie, and the best acting by all the stars.

Mann absolutely destroys the narrative with anachronistic dialogue, over acting and historical distortions and untruths. Daniel Day Lewis' worst performance of his storied career. His performance as Natty Bumpo/Hawkeye is boring, uninspired and unconvincing. Stowe is terrible. Wes Studi as Magua is the only consistently interesting character in the movie.

180,gfourmil,"Not Perfection, Yet Easily the Best Historical Romance",10,6 June 2007,"The reconstruction of the 'French and Indian War' is amazing in its details. And its romantic elements. Did you notice how Uncas clearly 'falls' for the Brit Alice, who after seeing Magua (Wes Studi) graphically kill him, chooses to leap to her death, than accept being Magua's woman--real 'reincarnation' study. As for things mentioned (doors in wrong places, scene to scene), there are numerous other small editing errors, but i've noted a lot depends on which format, VHS, DVD, you're watching. There's absolutely no explanation, at the end (much weaker on the VHS), why Russel Means declares himself 'The Last of the Anything.'? Still I watch this over and over, as with Carpenter's 'The Thing', one has to remember that screenplays vs. a novel have a wide license, you're not reading prose---you're sitting there enthralled by a vision---and the procedures of cinema are quite apart from literature---scenes are flying by, and few viewers note minor discrepancies---no time for such.the real treasure is the acting/directing, for the most part, and the basic view of that certain time. The sets, clothes, and action are A++. The special-effects, the realism are nothing short of spectacular. Unlike 'thrown-in' romantic hoke as in 'Titanic' (serves no purpose), here we have a wonderful Romance, on film--rare in any era---sure, for the Huron with knife to the the heroine's throat to wait around for Hawk-eye to whack him? Chalk it up to the concept of cinema--whose demands do reach a budget-time-limit. When you see the scenes of Col. Munroe, a typical taciturn Scot meet his adversary, Le General Marquis de Montcalm, with his classic French near obsequious display of respect--no one may forget such. Flawed, yes, but still quite magnificent--worthy of many views--and a solid 'Romance 10'. Oh, and the soundtrack? I yet hear bits of it in TV exercise-for-ladies episodes--another bit that will persist--one 'killer' soundtrack--So if you want historic and accurate action, high romance, and you have not seen it? Please do so---a helluva ride--tough act to follow---i'll never forget a napster user comment---'The bestest movie i ever seed.'",The Last of the Mohicans
181,thomascapital,James Fennimore Cooper would be pleased.....,10,5 March 2005,"In order to fully appreciate the film, one must first have read the original novel by James Fennimore Cooper. Unfortunately, very few under the age of 40 were exposed to this fine novel and great author if they attended public schools.Students since the late 1960's have been force-fed worthless crap about non-Western-Civ material that will not help them on their road to discovering their purpose in this world.Cooper stands as one of the finest American writers of all time and his books will simply move you and educate you at the same time.Michael Mann has been one of my favorite film makers since Miami Vice. He uses sound, emotion, and filmography all at once. Your senses can be overwhelmed at times; however, if you are not moved by his films, especially this one, your emotions must be dead.The film is fairly true to the original Cooper novel, however, most who have commented on it are wrong! It is a love story at several levels. The first level is that of the relationship of Hawkeye, Uncas, and Chingachgook. Hawkeye is the adopted son of Chingachgook and Uncas is his step-brother. Uncas and Hawkeye were raised in the Mohican ways, but exposed to the white ways in by a Christian missionary.The second level is that between Hawkeye and Cora Munro. The love story at this level was more fully explored in the novel (much easier in print due to the size of the book). However, it was no wonder why Cora chose this magnificent warrior, who saved her and her sister from barbarians, over the stuff-shirt English Major.The third level to the love story is that of the last three Mohicans' for their country. Not just ""their land"" but all of the untainted and pristine Frontier.At the close, Chingachgook and Hawkeye mourn the loss of the frontier to white-man's progress. But take comfort in the fact that future people will make their homes here, work, suffer, and live.If you don't love this film, I pity you, for it would be very difficult to make a better film. Daniel Day Lewis, a much under utilized actor is great, and Russel Means (Chingachgook) and Eric Schweig are great actors.Enjoy the great film!",The Last of the Mohicans
182,imperial_wizard,This film DID NOT get the credit it deserved!!!!!!!!,10,28 August 2002,"Ok, it should have won best picture at the oscars, best sound, best cinematography, best original score and best supporting actor (Wes Studi.) This is most definetely is the best film of 1992. Daniel Day Lewis does a really good job as a tough guy, Wes Studi does and excellent job as a malicious native american, and the rest of the cast is just as good too. I compare the cinematography to the Lord of the Rings's. It deserved what it did not get is a good way to put it. This should be on the top 250 right behind the Lord of the Rings. I have no idea why I do not own this movie yet. It has great costumes and makeup, and the sound puts you right in the battle (which is why it won a well deserved only oscar for the sound.) The Last of the Mohicans has some really good visual effects too (the battles between the French and the English.) This film is the visually the best film next to the Lord of the Rings. Go see it if haven't. I highly recommend it.",The Last of the Mohicans

The cinematography is breathtaking, the costumes and props are consistently realistic, and the great Trevor Jones score, with help from the Celtic group Clannad, is so moving it's an integral part of the experience (use good speakers, if at all possible). I don't buy soundtrack albums; I bought this one. I found the storytelling to be enthralling, especially given the fact that the story, although a classic, is really a bit of a lightweight, after all. If you've read Mark Twain's comments about James Fenimore Cooper and this book, never mind; this movie makes it all work. I was particularly impressed with Wes Studi as Magua.",The Last of the Mohicans

185,nuntukamen,anyone who didn't like this film doesn't understand art,10,1 December 2004,"The most amazing element of this film at IMDb.com is the overwhelming international location from viewer comment response, which means on a human level, this film really hits home, and Michael Mann was obviously swinging for the fences. It is the second widely acclaimed film released--not counting musicals, of course--where the score is as important as the actors, cinematic photography, characters or the story (2001: A Space Odyssey is the first). Set in the West of its historical time period (Hawkeye's isolationist view was that his dad, his bro and he were heading to ""kan-tucky"" to escape the encroaching modern civilization since you couldn't get any bare bones farther west than that in the human knowledge of the day), this is the first real chase story in literature and Mann makes it so on screen, it starts with them running and finishes with them running; everyone is pursuing something, and few reach their destination without death and violence interrupting their personal chase. The photography belongs in a museum, the music is a symphonic magnet, the acting and sparsely spoken words fit like little pieces of a jigsaw puzzle to create an immaculately magnificent picture. This is right up there with Kubrich's Barry Lyndon as the best film ever photographed for popular release. A solid -10- Must See ...if you watch this, Dances With Wolves, then The Unforgiven and The Wild Bunch, you will have seen a staggering panoramic view of western genre that covers the entire period. As a trivial sidelight, Russell Means(as Chingachkook), who is a true American Indian, and was at the last battle with FBI and government agents at Wounded Knee, once was hired in Ohio during the Bicentennial Celebration, along with Native American buddies of his, to play Indians greeting the Mayflower crew as they landed. As the ship drew close they shot arrows at the landing party and refused to let them ashore (now THAT'S a true revolutionary with the courage and the intelligence to make a point with some great humor--although the folks that hired him in Cleveland weren't laughing much then) so its only appropriate that the moving and eloquent closing speech along the North Carolina skyline at sunset is his.",The Last of the Mohicans

Having heard good critics about the film, I actually expected many things; electrifying performance by Day-Lewis, a nice cinematography and direction, strong side characters, impressive battles. However, after the film ended I found it hard to vote.The film wasn't bad at all. At some extend it did have what I expected, but in a lesser degree. None of the characters had a real depth and that lead to the actors to just perform 'alright'. Duncan and Magua were perhaps the most interesting characters of the story. The British officer was in love with a woman who never wanted him and even died for her, while the Huron warrior was driven by vengeance and it was revealed that his mind was closer to that of the 'White Man'.I also found the writing to be quite shallow. Most important of all, Hawkeye and Cora's romance felt flat - it felt like there was no chemistry between the two. And after all, there is almost no memorable quote from this film.Without a doubt, the soundtrack was the movie's only flawless part; magical.",The Last of the Mohicans
187,Siradakis,Very good action & romance,8,17 January 2003,"This film made me think that, it seems that whatever Michael Mann copes with, it's definately worth seeing. This is a classic action & romance film, at its best. Action is embellished and sometimes even descended into nature, and romance is chased by stalkers of life and revenge. Landscapes rise above people and embrace them and love is as needful as survival, or more. Classic movie, imposing action, excellent music,very good acting and of course, the unmistakable mark of Michael Mann.",The Last of the Mohicans
188,Sundance26,What a fantastic movie.,9,15 November 2002,"I could go on about this movie forever, so I'll try to keep it simple.This is a fantastic movie.Now, purists will complain about the historical accuracy, because they are more concerned with history than the making of a good movie. So ignore them. :) For the most part, the history is accurate. And the things that were given up for the sake of good filmmaking and plot, you wouldn't even notice.Above all else, this is a BEAUTIFUL film. My brother commented once that 70% of the movie was the scenery. It's just breathtaking. The colors and the mist, and the cliffs... accompanied by an also breathtaking soundtrack, it's just beautiful. This has been the only movie that I've ever seen, where ever time I hear the soundtrack, I want to see the movie again, right that moment. By the end of the movie, a simple violin tune is enough to evoke some pretty strong emotions from you. It's incredible. (I also recommend the soundtrack, btw.)Daniel Day-Lewis conquered his British accent pretty damn well, to adopt his english indian one. And his eyes just dance throughout the whole thing. And besides a few mildly funny instances where his long hair whaps him in the face while he's running... he really does a great job. Madeline Stowe is a beautiful woman, and made a great Cora. What happens to her, her sister, and her family... 'heartwrenching' wouldn't do it justice. It makes you hold your breath.I'm going on and on... but yes. A beautiful film, rightly in the top 100 greatest movies ever made. I gave it 9/10.",The Last of the Mohicans
189,the_other_kinsey_institute,"A subtle, dramatic masterpiece--opulent in simplicity (but only the VHS version)",10,16 September 2002,"The makers of this film understood that a picture really is worth a thousand words.Unlike most other movies, it does not rely as heavily upon dialogue, which gives it an unspoken power--a true presence.  It gives the film an overall tone of openness, similar to the feeling one gets upon seeing a beautifully detailed, but uncluttered painting.  The film's silence is its greatest strength, requiring precise performances on behalf of the actors and some excellent camera work. The result is a film that speaks to emotions on a much closer, more primitive level.  With a less-talented cast, the film would have been corny or overly melodramatic.  As is, it's breathtaking.My only complaint--the DVD version is the director's cut.  No offense to Michael Mann, but it's terrible.  As good as the movie is, is how bad the DVD is.  Technically, the 'skips' are aesthetically offensive; there's even a disclaimer of sorts *inside* the packaging, which makes returning it a bit more challenging.  The music has been literally gutted, and some of the best lines were chopped.  The added scenes were okay, but understandably cut from the final release.  They would have been much better served as extras on the DVD.",The Last of the Mohicans
190,brycehoogland,In case your aim's any better than your judgment,9,21 March 2012,"The Last of the Mohicans is set in 1757 during the French and Indian war. This film is a excellent war epic all the way down to the perfect customs. Director Michael Mann takes you into this detailed action that is staged with excitement and excellence. Mann knows how to direct action sequences with such grace because he draws you into Daniel Day-Lewis's character and you actually feel for him. I want to see Michael Mann direct another action film! The Last of the Mohicans is based off the novel of the same title. The script for this film is impeccable. It is written with the right amount of action, great dialogue, & the perfect love story. The Last of the Mohicans has excellent performances from just about the whole cast, but the incredible, Daniel Day-Lewis has another flawless performance. What I believe makes Day-Lewis stand out as one of the greatest actors is that he becomes his characters. When you watch the films he is in your not watching Daniel Day-Lewis, your watching the character. His use of method acting is perfection and shines in The Last of the Mohicans down to the last second. This film has one of the best scores I have ever heard in a war film composed by Trevor Jones. I can't say much about the score because I don't know a lot of the aspects that go into creating the score for films, but I can say the score in The Last of the Mohicans is unforgettable. The Last of the Mohicans is a excellent period piece, extremely well done war film, and the perfect love story.",The Last of the Mohicans
191,Sage-c4,Gorgeous,10,8 December 2012,"I saw this in a theater when it was first released. I've been watching it at least annually ever since. I own both the VHS theatrical cut and the DVD director's cut. I've purchased both the soundtrack album and two Clannad albums, downloaded and read the original novel and the Mann script, reread the Classics Illustrated version, viewed the WWII era b/w film upon which Mann based his script, read the rest of Coopers Leatherstocking Tales, taken a course in longrifle building, taken up deer hunting, and read historical accounts of the frontier conflicts that form the backdrop to this magnificent film. I can tell you, it is the best version of the story. Unlike many adaptations, this one improves upon the original novel by a degree of magnitude. The elaborate bigotry is gone while preserving the constellation of cultures and races. The prudery vanishes but virtue remains. And the jarring silliness of some episodes from the novel is mercifully extinguished in favor of dry wit. And it improves upon every previous adaptation. Magically, much of the dialog and structure from the b/w version, is preserved but the delivery leaves no doubt that the British and French are at war, carelessly using Native and Colonial Americans as pawns - a subtext that was in expedient in the time of the b/w version. Some experts have criticized the film for historical inaccuracies, including details of the props and costumes, but the fact that the film stimulates interest enough to discover the inaccuracies seems to me to overturn that criticism. There is an internal confusion of place, apparently a half-carried out attempt to reconcile the historical location of the events in the colony of New York with the filming location in the state of North Carolina. Hawkeye states his intention to head west to Kantuckee. And for reasons I cannot explain the great Lenape sachem Tamenand becomes a Huron. The thrilling and memorable score should have won the Oscar, but was ineligible for nomination because of a confused parentage, I guess. The soundtrack album is not the same recording as in the film, and introduces a slightly irritating adagio quality missing in the purposeful score. The director's cut restores a somewhat obvious and therefore unnecessary prognostication to Chingachgook at the end, and edits down an exchange between Hawkeye and a recruiter that does a better job of establishing his character's wit in the theatrical release. Finally, the director's cut eliminates the ""I Will Find You"" Clannad song that accompanies the trailing/tracking scene in the theatrical release, though the end credits still acknowledge it. I place this film right up with Dr Zhivago in cinematographic power, Only a bobbing steadycam long shot of Fort William Henry under siege (was that supposed to be edited in as though from a canoe?) and a questionable green fill light during a nocturnal scene inside the fort mar the otherwise sumptuous camera-work. I acknowledge that it falls slightly short of Titannic in establishing sexual chemistry, but triumphs as a historical action film standing shoulder to shoulder with subsequent genre leaders like Gladiator and Master & Commander, is less tedious than Braveheart or The Patriot, and avoids the juvenile testosterone orgy of 300. Lastly, it works on multiple intellectual levels. The characters can be viewed literally, acting on their personal motivations, but also function allegorically, representing the cultural forces motivating the nations contesting for control of the North American continent. And the camera-work supports this beautifully. Major Heyward, bearing the ambition of England, gazes at a small idealized portrait of Cora, the ""heart"" of Colonial America, as he crosses a perfectly symmetrical brick bridge representing the transplanted English civilization. Soon we see Cora framed in another symmetrical shot, surrounded by the abundant harvest of the fecund American soil. Heyward reveals his intention to transport this bounty, in the form of Cora, back to England, arrogantly assuming she could have no other plans for her future. Later, we see an alternate option in the form of Hawkeye, who has turned his back on his European heritage, intending to head west and live unbeholden to mother England. It doesn't really take Chingachgook's ending speech to see to what nationalistic future that path leads. And all of that is value-added by Mann to rather flat characters trapped in a wordy tangle by Cooper, who seemingly never recognized the substantive potential of his own novel. Beautiful, exciting, deep. What more could you ask for in a film?",The Last of the Mohicans

I just can't describe her.I came on here considering writing a review for another film and just started thinking of how much better the Last of the Mohicans was. So I came here to write this instead.A ""10"" is not ""excellent"" to me (IMDB says 10 is ""excellent""). To me, 10 means a masterpiece. Only about 1 in 1,000 films is a masterpiece.

196,Kehleyr,Classic and beautiful film with an extraordinary soundtrack,10,29 January 2001,"This is one of my favorite films, one that I can watch over and over again and never grow tired. It is a classic movie about romance, adventure, sadness and having the courage to follow your feelings. I won't start describing the plot to you. I will instead tell you what sets this movie apart from others.
First of all, the cast. It was my first movie with Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe and they were both wonderful. Their acting is so intense, it gets right to your heart. He is undeniably very handsome, although not in the classic Tom Cruise way; he is much more rugged and masculine. The word I would choose to picture her is delicate; frail and vulnerable without being soapy. I especially like her because she is not blond and blue-eyed, doll-like; also not the sex-symbol kind of woman. She is the perfect choice for a romantic role. Her beauty is of the kind which goes to the heart, not to the eyes.
Second, the images. I first saw this movie at the theater and I was overwhelmed. I have never seen such beautiful scenery until and I haven't seen such scenery since. It takes your breath away and puts the action into a different perspective; you realize how small you are compared with the world. Since then I have (of course) bought the tape and I must confess that viewing it on a TV-size screen takes something away. But it's beautiful nevertheless.
And last but not least, the musical score. It's the perfect example of how a soundtrack can increase the value of a movie by at least 50% (I would have given it a 8/10 instead of a 10/10 if it weren't for the music :). The only soundtrack which comes close to achieving the same result was Michael Madsen's ""The Piano"". It is simply wonderful and so well connected with the action, you just live everything twice as intense: once through the images and once through the music. It's a music about open spaces and the grandeur and aloofness of nature; a music about war; a music about romance and the way feelings keep growing inside you until you can't contain them anymore; a music about sadness and desperate searching; and so much more.
This movie is especially for romantics. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else, I wouldn't want them to sniff at it and say it's just another soapy :). Everyone with his own tastes, after all.",The Last of the Mohicans
197,eric-1501,"If this movie were made today, 2008",10,20 November 2008,"Enough's been said by my fellow amateur reviewers here that I don't have much to add to remark about this film's greatness. Having seen more than enough of current movies, though, a contemporary director would modify this script to a point where there would be little resemblance to the 1992 work by Mann. First, the pioneer families would complain, complain, complain about being victims of the over- arching villainy of ordinary business interests, wanting to install a Marxist economic system more than anything. Second, Cora and Alice Munro would be using karate kicks, punches and against anyone who attacked them, Indians, French troops, you name it...then they'd slowly walk off after setting explosive charges and would be shown silhouetted against the huge balls of fire. Thirly, Hawkeye would find moments alone with Cora to express his inner feelings of inadequacy and burning hatred of all violence. He'd admit to being plagued by inner demons from the past that he has no power to banish. However, he'd later go out to meet the foe and commit countless stagy, gratuitous acts of violence for which we'd find little justification. Fourthly, Chingachgook would be the main character, keeping the other characters at arms' length, occasionally spouting phrases from Shirley MacClaine's latest works of religious impotence which have nothing to do with traditional American Indian culture or faith. Fifthly, the French would have wisely refrained from attacking British positions and would have already surrendered. Finally, Magua and his band would be revealed to be not American Indian at all, but the last remains from an early settlement of brutal, northern-European white males from the land of Halliburton.",The Last of the Mohicans
198,lani4-886-903615,"In a word, this film is Majestic.",10,15 October 2012,"Every time I watch this DVD I am blown away by the music which is soaring and majestic and so is the cinematography. The performances are powerful and convincing and yet have great subtlety. The brutality of the combat is gut wrenching and the tenderness of the love and caring is heartwarming. Even the simple scenes with the Cameron family are a delight in their casual ordinariness and at the same time the affection and respect between all those sitting quietly talking around the dinner table creates a simple pleasure. I find Daniel Day-Lewis' performance to be incredibly masterful, he is Hawkeye and many others including Madeleine Stowe, Russell Means, Eric Schweig, and Jodhi May gave wonderful portrayals. Steven Waddington's portrayal of the lying and underhanded Maj. Duncan Heyward was riveting and Wes Studi, as Magua, was brilliant as usual and chilling.I highly recommend this movie even though I find the brutality of the scenes of combat to be disturbing taken as a whole the movie is simply brilliant.",The Last of the Mohicans

You can clearly see/feel how good this movie could have been, but ultimately it fell flat..Again, the script itself was great, but the execution/directing and the acting was pretty bad.. Virtually every dialogue comes off as extremely corny and the actors look and sound like they had a gun held to their head whilst reading their lines. Even the brilliant Daniel Day Lewis had some cringy & corny performances in this movie, which is baffling.Overall, the movie is still enjoyable and not at all bad, per se.

It is a beautifully crafted movie, that perhaps follow the traditional Hollywood treatment too closely. Your heartstrings will get pulled certainly as you care about the characters in this story - as their situation goes from bad to worse.It is certainly a movie worth watching - in spite of the violence and gore - and is a clear reminder of how difficult it is when cultures and countries clash.",The Last of the Mohicans

216,LibertyValance27-1,Magnificent war-drama!,9,24 February 2005,"Last of the Mohicans, is rousing, romantic war drama of the highest caliber. Recently we have been bombarded with historical epics, like ""Troy"", ""Last Samarui"", ""Gladiator"", ""Alexander"" etc.... However when this film came out, there was a scarcity of them, and even more so of good historical epics, with ""Dances with Wolves"" being the exception. However this film breathed new live into the genre and did so with such vividness and excitement! The film takes place during the French-Indian war of the mid-18th century. Nathaniel (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his small family of Mohican trappers get caught up in the war, while attempting to defend a group of Brtish soldiers and women from a Huron war party. The Mohicans and their ""white son"" Nathaniel agree to escort the lone British survivor and the daughters of a British general to a nearby British fort, which unbeknown to them is currently under siege by the French. Nathaniel and Cora, daughter of British general Muro fall in love and this causes Nathaniel to fight for her and her sister and to safely see them through the hell that is war. As Cora remarks after witnessing the horrors of the war: ""The whole world is on fire"". It is now the obligation that Nathaniel feels for his new love that leads him and his Mohican family into the danger of the war and into a fight for their very survival. This film boasts beautiful natural landscapes, rousing war action, romance, and a great musical score, which puts you right into the middle of the action. The film has a visual beauty that is rarely equaled and a great story with plenty of action. It also remarks on the coming of the white man and how his wars become Indian wars, and how his vices became Indian vices. The ways of the white man have begun to corrupt the Indians. The once delicate balance between the natives and the land and their ancestors has been forever altered due to the intrusion of the white man, and they are continually pushed west into the frontier until there is no more frontier. Chingachgook, the elder Mohican has a line near the end of the film, which is highly prophetic: ""The frontier moves with the sun and pushes the Red Man of these wilderness forests in front of it until one day there will be nowhere left. Then our race will be no more, or be not us.""Highly recommended!!",The Last of the Mohicans

For those that love revenge movies, LOTM has got it.A note: if you can possibly see this in a theater that shows older movies, see it there. This is a movie made for the big screen. TV is ok, but to appreciate the truly remarkable cinematography (this from someone who didn't know what cinematography was before I saw this movie), one needs to view this in a theater.Lastly, buy the original score if you have any interest in instrumental music.

Bugs are part of the forest.This took the believability out of it pronto. In this movie not a mite, a tick, a skitter, a beetle, a spider, a spider's web, or a fly... the little black fly where ever you go... You move in the woods you sweat and breath heavy.

Daniel Day-Lewis do a memorable performance, its impressive how he act, he has good vocabulary and his quotes are awesome. Michael Mann does a great job mixing romance and action. The most important thing about this movie is the final scene that is considered for me an epic and powerful scene, I can't describe what I feel when I hear the soundtrack at this scene, its simply epic.

All the actors played their part to it's fullest. Mann presents and eerie feeling of how brutal the fighting was during the French and Indian War.

228,eflapinskas,My All Time Favorite,10,31 March 2007,Some years back I saw this movie for sale on DVD and made the purchase blindly. If I could only pick stocks this way ! Having seen literally thousands of movies in my lifetime this is THE absolute best.The actors chosen for each part were a perfect fit. The scenery presented on location is breath taking. The story line is great and the music is chilling. The track for this movie transports you to that time as though YOU are there experiencing this all yourself.Wes Studi does an excellent portrayal of the villain ( we were both in Viet Nam serving in the same Army unit then ).It is appreciated by me personally how the movie depicts with great accuracy how it took great survival skills just to live another day. Bear this in mind as you watch the film. It will give you as a viewer some idea of the hardships Americas pioneers faced and we can only imagine. I watch this film periodically and urge you to get for your collection a world class film.,The Last of the Mohicans
229,drk150,"One of the best movies of all time, sadly damaged by DVD",9,8 December 2006,"""The Last of the Mohicans"" is one of my favorite movies. It is an excellent portrayal of the early United States of America, done in a historically accurate style, not a stylized version of history like many modern movies use. While drawing us into that time period, it does not feel at all like a documentary. This is a great action movie, a great adventure movie, a great romance, a great movie in general. And above all, every frame is fantastically beautiful, as is every second of the soundtrack. Even if for some hard-to-imagine reason you are uninterested in the story, you will find it impossible to look away from the screen because it is just that visually engaging.So, all in all, one of my favorite movies ever, so without hesitating I bought the Enhanced Widescreen Director's Expanded Edition DVD. What a disappointment! All of my favorite Hawkeye one-liners were removed! No more ""Someday I think you and I are going to have a serious disagreement."" No more ""Haven't you got anything better to do on the lake today, Major?"". I guess looking back Michael Mann decided to strip off that likable part of Hawkeye's character. So then why did he leave in ""Well we kind of face to the North and, real subtle-like, turn left""? One wonders. Maybe Mann wants Hawkeye to start out a little flippant but become more serious as he becomes more involved in the Munro's affairs. I liked it better when the smart-mouthed part of his character survived the war.The DVD also lacks the great Clannad song ""I Will Find You"", which was included in the original version when the Mohicans are tracking Magua and the captive Cora and Alice. Another disappointing loss, perhaps due to licensing issues or something. The music that replaced it is boring, stripping that scene of the emotion it carried in the original version. Another musical beef: the music for the final cliff-side chase sequence is not included on the ""official motion picture soundtrack"", at least not in the same arrangement as in the movie.The addition to Chingachgook's final speech is debatable. It's not as offensive as the other edits, but it seems tacked on. Chingachgook did fine before, he doesn't need to predict the 21st century status of the American Indian for us, we can figure that out for ourselves. It's also irritating that the movie no longer ends with the phrase ""The last of the Mohicans"". I can certainly see why this scene was left out of the original version, even if only for the fact that the lighting is inconsistent with the original ending. The sun sure did set fast! On another Chingachgook note, I hated the slow-motion effect at the end of his fight with Magua. This is The Last of the Mohicans, not Street Fighter. Another Director's Cut mistake.Frankly I didn't think any of the ""expanded"" scenes added anything to the film. In fact most of them I hardly noticed. Mostly extra shots of cannons firing and whatnot, which is not what this movie is about, and therefore not needed in larger quantities. I was much more disappointed by what was lost.Still, buying the DVD is worth it just for the last 20 minutes or so. Here Mann proves that dialogue is absolutely unnecessary for good storytelling. Nobody says anything of any consequence for this entire act, yet if you can watch that stretch of film and not feel some kind of emotional response, there's something wrong with you.",The Last of the Mohicans
230,Val-63,Enough stories to satisfy anyone's tastes,10,10 October 1999,"Personally, this has been my favorite movie since the first time that I saw all of the story lines converge into one awesome theatrical experience. I think that anyone who gives a bad review for this movie sees only one of the levels. When one movie talks so eloquently about the expansion of the British, has multiple love stories, and enough blood-filled battle scenes for even the most blood thirsty, I can't see where people find the faults. I have watched the last half-hour of that movie more times than I care to remember. Starting from when Hawkeye goes into the village to rescue Cora, Alice, and Duncan to the point where the panoramic view shows the deadly blow applied to Magua. The three separate accounts of self-sacrifice should inspire even the most hard-hearted person (except for Alice's suicide maybe).

Everyone's performance is wonderful and the location is breathtaking.  Even the soundtrack is fantastic.  I never tire of watching this movie.

232,rebecky14,An excellent historical drama,8,19 September 2012,"Director: Michael Mann Stars: Daniel Day-Lewis, Madeleine Stowe, Russell Means, Steven WaddingtonStory: British and French troops are battling in colonial America, with aid from various native American war parties. The British troops enlist the help of local militia men. A British Colonel gets three native trappers to protect his daughters. A romance begins between one of the colonel's daughters (Madeleine Stowe) and an independent man who was reared as a Mohican (Daniel Day-Lewis). This complicates things for a British officer (Steven Waddington). They all try to survive in the middle of the harsh war. My brother has been trying to convince me to watch The Last Of The Mohicans for quite a while, and last night I finally watched it. And I enjoyed it immensely. Daniel Day-Lewis is fantastic as the native Mohican named Hawkeye. And that's really to be expected, as Day-Lewis is an insanely talented actor. The other characters are very well acted also, in particular Steven Waddington as the young British officer. The action scenes are well choreographed, although quite violent, especially in one surprisingly gruesome part (watch the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about). The music is what it needs to be: beautiful in the soft, emotional parts; fast-paced in the action scenes; and often ethnic-style instruments are used, making a tribal sort-of sound that matches well with the native Indian theme and the beautiful, old landscapes. Scenery is a plus in the movie, with plenty of long panning shots of lovely green forests and pristine lakes. There is a medium amount of romance in the movie, although it only really extends to kissing and nothing overly explicit is shown.All in all, this is quite a fantastic movie.

233,sportster_16301,Great movie,8,6 February 2005,"I loved the period piece of this movie as I'm a big fan of our history. The facts were accurate for the most part except for one glaring scene. When Montcalm approaches Magua, after Fort Henry falls, he is obviously playing to his sympathies about the British not keeping to their terms of the surrender. Montcalm, knowing of Magua's lust for revenge, knows that he will then attack the defeated inhabitants as they leave the fort.That scene is sheer poetic license, as the facts bear out that Montcalm had assurances from the Indian chiefs after that battle that they would refrain from attacking the departing party in exchange for all the forts plunder. In fact, it was Montcalm who finally put a stop to the actual massacre once he was informed of it. No, I'm not French, but all books and letters, show Montcalm as a man of highest honor and a champion against greed and corruption.",The Last of the Mohicans

I don't think there are enough adjectives to describe this movie or the effect it has had on me. Incredible. Soul-stirring. Heart-rendering. Amazingly hopeful. Gloriously Sad. It has two of the greatest love stories ever seen on screen- both yearning, smoldering and heart wrenching, and yet so different and subtle- I won't say more. The battle scenes are violent and brutal, but not gratuitously; realism is no issue here- you are transported to another world, and the actors have clearly thrown themselves into it as well. The period is meticulously and perfectly recreated in incredible detail. The scenery is almost as engaging as the action itself; and the score is so perfectly descriptive of the stunning visuals that your spirit actually soars with it. Sorry to be so corny but nothing else justifies it. The final 25 minutes are, in my opinion, the greatest 25 minutes ever filmed. Without spoiling it, let me just forewarn- get the tissues. I have watched this movie 6 times in the past 48 hours. Don't wait, get hooked now!",The Last of the Mohicans

I remember seeing it once when I was young, but I just watched it again 20+ years later and it easily is in my top 50 movies all time.It's easy to get caught up in the hype of Daniel Day Lewis being one the greatest actors to ever step on screen, but this movie embodies so much more than that. Sure, he delivers a classic performance, but the human element, and connection between the natives and nature is superb. Though Dances with Wolves is another great movie in the same genre, Kevin Costner failed to make that distinct connection where Michael Mann. That connection stirred up a number of emotions throughout the film, a true sign of a film that links to the heart and mind.The scenery and cinematography is gorgeous, as you would expect it to be in a basically unsullied land at that point in history. The score/sound for the movie is unreal also, as illustrated by the academy award win. Must see, instant classic that I will show my kids and theirs.",The Last of the Mohicans

It was so moving that I had to go back and see it a second time! Since 1992, I rented it over and over again and then finally bought it when it came out on DVD. The scene where the carriage is reflected in the water as it rides over the bridge is still one of my favourite scenes of any movie. The director did an amazing job and the cinematography is breathtaking. I don't think this movie ever looses its momentum. It just keeps getting better and better with each passing scene and wonderfully written script. I love the costume design and the well planned out fight scenes - large and small. Everydetail was attended to. On a personal note, the best acting for me was from Jodhi May (Alice) and Steven Waddington (Duncan). It's a shame they don't get more roles these days. (You must rent Ivanhoe with Steven Waddington if you're a fan of his or even of period stuff) I love how the writers really develop each character, Alice's story line was my favourite. The director also does a superb job on setting the mood with that wonderful soundtrack and lighting and the wonderful cinematography. I give this movie 2 HUGE thumbs up.

238,longrifles,Thrilling if slightly inaccurate,10,1 September 2002,"This is a rollercoaster of a movie, one with everything you want in a good film.  It is probably as close as you'll get to an accurate portrayal of the longhunter culture that existed in the eastern frontier from the 1740s to perhaps 1810, where frontiersmen like Nathaniel Bumppo got ""off the boat"" from Europe and, in a very brief time, learned to out-Indian the Indians. The film is gorgeous to look at, with incredible scenery and everything bathed in a rich, liquid light.  The script is sophisticated and tight, and the movie pulls you along at a good clip.  Boredom is not a problem.  Sure there are inaccuracies here and there, and the truth of the 18th century frontier is a much better tale than any fiction you'll ever read about it, but all in all this is a grand effort, and one that will probably become a screen classic.  The real star of the show, however, is Magwa, played by Cherokee actor Wes Studi.  He gives an absolutely chilling performance as a man deeply harmed by the gruelling life of the frontier, who seeks to exact vengeance.  Imagine yourself and your family in a tiny cabin in the middle of an old growth wilderness, in 1750, with Magwa and several other men like him trying to beat your door down to do God knows what (kill you quickly? torture you slowly? steal some sugar and tobacco and go away? take you captive and treat you like a brother? kidnap your children and leave you to wail with grief?) and you get some idea of what life must have been like for our forefathers.

The score contains possibly one of the best theme's in cinema history. The photography is stunning as is the action. Day Lewis gives his customary brilliant performance. Plus the movie manages to depict native Americans in a way that does not seem like a pathetic apology (see: dances with wolves) or remotely patronising in a ""my, they're so mystical and at one with nature"" kind of way that most films seem to fall into.

244,A2Z,A novel view of Native Americans,10,29 September 1999,"Hollywood has a lousy track record in its' portrait of Native Americans. The Last of the Mohicans is a refreshing change from the normal view of drunken savages, clownish buffoons, and the ""noble red man"".  In this movie, the Native Americans are on an even footing with the white man.  A good example is when they visit the settlers home and are treated as equals, without a trace of fear or condescension.  Of course, the white man was still the minority in 18th century America.In most cases, they are portrayed as having better common sense and superior fighting ability.  European soldiers just weren't trained for guerrilla warfare, as accurately depicted in this movie.Excellent setting, pace, and cinematography.  Russell Means is very convincing as Chingachkook, and the weapon he carries is the most wicked I've ever seen in a movie.",The Last of the Mohicans
245,pete-246,Overlooked masterpiece bucked trends of the time,10,11 December 2003,"It used to baffle me why this film hasn't been held in greater esteem. I was blown away by this film when I first saw it, and knew quite a few people who snuck back to the theater several times for more. The beautiful and harsh scenery, dreamlike photography, sudden explosions of bloody violence, and raging, over-the-top passion amid a collapsing world create a pure emotional rush. This is melodrama at its best, which means that it can really stir your emotions if you let it.After reading a recent review of Ron Howard's ""The Missing"" by Steve Sailer (Washington Times) I think I know why ""Last of the Mohicans"" was overlooked. No matter how good this film was, it bucked the dominant trend in pop-culture perceptions of Native Americans at the time - a trend, according to Sailer, that might be reversing. Here's a historical breakdown of trends in similar films:1. 1950-1970 - Native Americans are one-dimensional, easily killed, comic-book villians. No religious elements appear. There are only a few exceptions to this rule (e.g. John Ford's ""The Searchers"").2. 1970s - Native American violence becomes brutal and real - but we also get rising sensitivity to Native Anericans without much sappy-ness. To quote Sailer:""'The Missing' resembles 'Ulzana's Raid,' the 1972 Burt Lancaster film that was one of several brutal but realistic films (such as 1970's 'A Man Called Horse') made during a brief period of balance in the depiction of Native Americans, falling between the earlier era's anti-Indian prejudice and the present day's happy-clappy New Age nonsense.""In other words, if ""Last of the Mohicans"" had been released in 1970 it might have been hailed as ""progressive.""3. 1980s and 1990s - Religious/spiritual interpretations of Native Americans become dominant but are just as comic-book as the old 1950s violence. Native Americans are cute New Age ""Dances With Wolves"" icons that sit around and act wise. ""Native American"" becames an always-good point of reference in the Culture Wars. Classic example from South Park: an old hippie screams in front of a new Starbuck's""...how many Native Americans did you slaughter to make that coffee shop?""Michael Mann's ""The Last of the Mohicans"" (1992) clearly ran counter to the 1990s trend - it was trashed by critics at the time but I've always felt it was a much better film than it is given credit for, even a classic. But it bucks the New Age image of Native Americans so popular in 1992. For example, the old chief at the end uses his spiritual authority to make a brutal, violent decision for death so that justice is served. The Native American father Chingagchook kills the revenge and power-mad Magua without pity. And as for Magua's own behavior...nobody on either side is asking ""...can't we all just get along?""In other words, Mann picked the exact wrong time to make this film. In the 1970s it might have been properly recognized, but by 1992 it was out of step with the touchy-feely image of Native Americans. Coupled with its obvious melodrama and action-film hype, the film became too much of a ""guilty pleasure"" to win praise (but don't let that stop you now).Movies are changing again, and that might be a good reason to go out and rent ""Last of the Mohicans.""  According to Sailer, ""the dark side of Native American spiritualism"" is now being seen in ""Missing"". Like ""Mohicans"", Howard's new film loses the New Age stuff for a dreamlike action/horror state. The scenes below have their obvious parallels in ""Mohicans"":Blanchett finds her boyfriend's charred corpse strung up over a campfire where the Indians slowly roasted him to death. Later, when a photographer snaps the Apache leader's picture, the shaman gets his soul back by tearing out the man's heart.The other problem with ""Mohicans"" was that it is too ""manly."" There's a very strong female lead, but the men are also real, lusty, nasty men. By including this brand of passion, ""Mohicans"" conflicted directly with the ""girl power"" pop culture trend of the mid-1990s. Admitting you liked the film made you anti-woman as well as anti Native American.In this light, consider Sailer's comments on ""Missing"" - they apply equally to ""Mohicans:""""Still, I have to admire Howard for ignoring the bogus and condescending fantasies about American Indian culture rampant in our society today. Native Americans have suffered enough without having the memory of their warriors emasculated by self-absorbed eco-feminists into sappy symbols. Geronimo was a cruel man, but he was every inch a man.""We may be on the edge of a revival of films which are capable of mixing Native Americans, violence, and romance in a good way.

Like other people have said, the DVD ""Director's Expanded Version"" isn't enhanced, it's been hacked. There are a few scenes added that when you look at them, you know why they were edited out in the first place. But what's worse, some of the dialogue and music has been cut. Some good lines were taken out, and the music excerpt from Clannad's ""I Will Find You"" towards the end is missing. Plus, there is expanded dialogue to the speech made in the end that goes on to predict modern life with buildings and the plight of the faceless office worker- it's preachy and unrealistic.The only reason I can see as to why they did this was a money making scheme- release a hacked up version of a movie that everyone loves on DVD, then when enough people have bought it and seen how messed up it is and clamor for the original theatrical release, they'll re-release the original version on DVD so people will have to buy it all over again.My recommendation is to buy a legal copy of the original, unaltered widescreen version on VHS and copy it to DVD for yourself, in case they never release the ""good"" version on DVD.",The Last of the Mohicans

As a result, we come face to face with a stunning & emotional piece of epic cinematography. Combining elements of war action, drama, romance, & tragedy, this film accomplishes its mission as far as I can see.With scenes of lush, green wilderness environments, log cabins, Native American weaponry, and clothing from the colonial era, I was easily taken in to the setting. The soundtrack is nothing short of remarkable also. Noticing how a lot of the Native Americans were able to come across guns and ammunition in order to go against the Europeans in battle brought a fresh sense of irony to the story. Anyhow, movies which demonstrate the ways people lived before electricity and cars and cities have always been intriguing to me.The most outstanding thing about this movie to me is the fact that the director chose to make a movie about such a bold and important topic in the first place. Being that in this day & age, Native Americans are not often seen in their original state, ""The Last of the Mohicans"" is somewhat like a reference to this particular era in the development of the United States of America.",The Last of the Mohicans

Then after the first hour, like most Mann movies, it kept getting better and better. The tension rises and you find that you are sitting at the edge of your sit.I was thinking that it was actually quite an unusual and rather bold film coming from Hollywood. One of those unusual points was how the Indians and the fighting Europeans were portrayed. The Indians had left aside their customary arrows and had picked up guns and rifles. The Europeans were not your typical cowboys but soldiers who were fighting for land. And the intrigues went both ways.The film is not perfect and possibly not even one of Mann's best.

I thought Day-Lewis' character was the let down of the whole movie, just irritating he was, Stowe was solid without being brilliant, but the best performance goes to Wes Studi who played the fearsome Huron war captain.I don't know if its in the league of Braveheart for most people, but in comparing the 2 movies i think that LOTM at times soared above the heights of Braveheart, whereas Braveheart has a well developed story and is really solid entertainment, Mohicans is much looser and gives the actors more room to move, i didn't really feel anything for Mel Gibson when he was put to death in braveheart, however the last 10 minutes of Mohicans was some of the most moving i've ever seen. Its a no contest between Jodhi May's final scene and M.Gibson's death in Braveheart, whereas one was genuine the other was less convincing because it wasn't William Wallace suffering it was Mel Gibson. Most of the big name actors have this problem as well: they can't seem to ""become"" their character instead they bring their real life personality into the film. That is the difference between The Last of the Mohicans and Braveheart, and The Last of the Mohicans and The Patriot. I'm not just picking on Mel Gibson here either, its across the board.I love the way they bring everything together in Mohicans, the music, the scenery, this is what making movies is all about. I like it that there's no reason or apologizing for the murders of the soldiers and innocents alike (British, French, Huron, Mohican) its just how they lived in those times, death was on every side. The bad points in the movie is that there is little character development and some of the heroics of Day-Lewis are a bit hard to stomach, otherwise i thought it was a truly entertaining and different kind of movie to what we usually see in this genre nowdays.",The Last of the Mohicans

265,americanscipio,Better than Cooper's writing,9,18 November 2002,"I have the misfortune of having read all of the Leatherstocking Tales. Utterly terrible writing.  I find myself agreeing with Mark Twain about Cooper as a writer: he is a terrible craftsman.  But his characters are compelling, particularly in The Deerslayer.  This movie captures the raw power of the characters, and while it does conflate some plotlines and adjust the relationships of the characters to introduce a romance, it does so in way that enhances Cooper's work.I believe that this film will stand as the definitive interpretation of Cooper's work.  I saw it in a preview showing, and I immediately bought the soundtrack.  The music works so well with the movie, it is difficult for me to accept that it was composed by two different people, neither of whom was the director or editor of the movie.  The Clannad song adds a nice touch to the film.The acting is uniformly great.  Several of the minor characters (General Webb, for example) exist as caricatures, but very useful ones to both the plot and the development of the major characters.  In particular the Marquis de Montcalm provides a fascinating portrait of the aristocrat who happens to be an excellent soldier.Russell Means does a fine job as Chingachgook.  Daniel Day-Lewis fits perfectly as Hawkeye.  Wes Studi brings a practiced malevolence to the role of Magua.  The dialogue is so spare, and so concentrated (there are quite a few scenes with no dialogue) that it must be good when present, and it is.I remember my utter shock when this movie was not nominated for a single Academy Award.  Not a sausage.  Bugger all.  It blows my mind to this day that Michael Mann was not honored with a best director nod, and that Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman were not nominated.  But the continued vitalit of the movie is pleasing indeed.",The Last of the Mohicans
266,gregorj56,Extremes...,6,30 January 2003,"Michael Mann's 'The Last of the Mohicans,' a retelling of the tale by James Fenimore Cooper, is interesting in its radical shifts from terrific to terrible and back. Let me ensure that I am a fan of M. Mann as a director, specifically: Heat & Manhunter. I had seen this film some time ago and decided to revisit it due to my affinity for the director and Daniel Day Lewis, whom I think is one of the most gifted actors today. Here's a brief list of the good, the bad and the ugly.THE GOOD Cinematography: Wow! Breathtakingly beautiful landscapes coupled with a fantastic score (Trevor Jones & Randy Edelman) really set the tone early for a legend of epic proportions. I felt this made some of the more unbelievable portions of the movie much easier to accept. Interestingly enough, Dante Spinotti recently worked on the making of Red Dragon, a retelling of Mann's earlier project, Manhunter. Costumes: Kudos to Elsa Zamparelli who actually hasn't done anything of note in recent history. Not surprising she worked on the costumes for 'Dances with Wolves.' Not too much of a reach from this film but her effort deserves recognition none the less. Fight Sequences: Amazing!!! I really couldn't believe how well these scenes were choreographed. I think of so many movies that tried to do what Mann accomplished with this film and didn't even come close to the beauty and fluidity of 'Mohicans.'THE BAD Pace: As he is prone, Mann directed this movie at a snail's pace and I was amazed to see the runtime at only two hours. Epics of this sort do require length to adequately explain the situation, evolve the characters to a point were the viewer's care for them, etc., etc., etc. but this should move quickly to the point were the viewer leaves wanting more (watch Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai' to see what I mean). The Score: Though I previously stated how fantastic it was (and I stick by that) the moving theme of the movie was way, way overused. Mann doesn't seem to understand you can have too much of a good thing. I think by the ninth time he panned over the mountains with the score blaring inspiring music and moved to DDL running in slow motion that the awe effect he was looking for had worn off. This leads into.THE UGLY (possible spoilers ahead) One really bad scene: The escape from the massacre towards the end (i.e., canoe race). I blinked and thought that I was watching a different movie. Suddenly the falsity of setting was disgustingly clear and it was like a bucket of cold water. The river had three different looks: 1) stock footage of a river I would expect from a Superstation original, 2) distant shots of stuntmen on the river (not as bad) and 3) the actors in what is clearly a set (that really killed me). There's a particular scene where they go over a small waterfall and it looks like a bathtub and then Mann, seemingly quite impressed with his own cleverness, shows it a second time. For the next 10 minutes of the movie we see the actors in some sort of a cave/underhanging/whatever behind a waterfall. Again the scene is foolish looking. Basically, I felt the movie really lost a step towards the end.I hope I didn't wander too much in my description but I'm sure the point was obvious. Really good / Really bad. Worth seeing? Yes. Rating: 6.5/10",The Last of the Mohicans
267,gpermant-1,Very bloody ...,7,9 December 2018,... but probably a realistic depiction of what man did to man in times of war,The Last of the Mohicans
268,AnnikaLen,Bottom line: Daniel Day-Lewis is excellent,10,1 January 2008,"I am convinced that this film would not have been as engaging and enjoyable if it had another actor in the lead role. Daniel Day-Lewis is quite possibly the greatest living actor today - his performances are uniformly jaw-dropping. In his last few films, he has played darker, heavier roles, so what a treat to watch this film and see him as a smoldering hero.I, too, have objections to the director's expanded edition and continue to hope that the original version will be released on DVD. But, despite its flaws, the expanded edition does not take away the enjoyment of watching this film. It's not perfect - the lovely Jodhi May's talents are just about wasted, and a couple of the scenes are poorly edited. But it has many virtues: good action sequences, an exquisite score, a wonderful romance, and a sensational Daniel Day-Lewis.",The Last of the Mohicans
269,ping_time,Disappointed,5,13 June 2021,"Was very disappointed with the movie. Leaves out the second half of the book. Wooden acting. Last of the Mohicans book was not that good and this movie was worse. Read the first book in the five book series, ""The Deerslayer"" it is much better IMHO.",The Last of the Mohicans
270,anthonymcdonald150,"Movie of beauty, catch it slowly, stop it and go back , view the scene again..",8,23 September 2017,"Loved this movie, Day-Lewis and Stowe are so good when acting off one another in close up like after the Cameron massacre. Day-Lewis as gives us such a tight performance. His playing against been an English type is as per usual. He does not seem able to take up the battle for the land of his father in any work. What happened to him walking and talking to the Celts of Western Europe has a profound effect on his craft, as one born in London at about the same time but brought back ""Home"" so often I never can recall ever feeling anything but not English. It's the strangest belonging. An Englishman can be British, an Irishman can be nothing else. This forms such moments in ""The Mohicans"" when there are stretches of silence between Stowe and Day-Lewis. Mann's making (rather than) directing is not like any other movie I know of his. He trusts the cast to play their parts with such honesty and the gorgeous New York Hudson Valley background, the colours, sounds, the Bobcat looking at Stowe are a delight, are a full star in their own right. This movie is not like anything that is made now, maybe it too is the last hurrah of a by gone age just like the Mohican. Watch, watch it slowly, catch as much as you can and come back to it again some night you are on your own. I think it may become one of your all time favorite movies. Enjoy",The Last of the Mohicans
271,BrookeAWheeler,A pale shadow of the book it's based on,4,9 July 2018,"If this were not a remake of the classic book by James Fennimore Cooper, I would have probably given it 6 stars. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to the book. Do yourself a favor if you have not, and pick up the book this movie was based on. It's not one of those ""classics"" that are loved by critics but not accessible to normal people. Rather it's excellent writing that sucks you in and won't let go. It's also a little grim a times, but nevertheless worthy of it's reputation. The movie is rated R, however the directors weren't willing to put some of the more realistic elements from the book into the movie, instead just going for a slightly-better-than-average action movie. Nothing extraordinary here.",The Last of the Mohicans
272,flatwatr,"Love this movie, loathe the DVD release",8,10 March 2002,"I have probably seen this movie 20 times; it stays on my personal top 10 list.  I own a copy of the VHS and have seen later DVD or VHS release with the ""restored"" footge as deleted scenes/alternate ending editions.The DVD version I rented last night and eagerly brought home to view threw me for a loop.  All the formerly ""unseen footage"" has been placed into the film, tha Clannad song that halps set the tone for the last act is gone from the score.  It is the score that is most alarming to me in this edition.  I own the original-issue CD (in addition to the VHS), have listened to it many times, so I enjoy the Jones/Edelman music. But not in this new release.  The scoring throws the entire movie off balance for me.  It is too loud, too omnipresent, and totally overbearing.  I believe there was some controversy about the music during the making of the film and so maybe this is an attempt to appease someone about something - I don't know.   It does not work. The other big disappointment for me is the insertion of what I think of as the ""preachy"" alternative ending. I admire Russell Means for his work with AIM and I know that the movie presents an opportunity to make a political statement.  For me the beauty and power of the original edition is in its essential spareness.  Watching these characters move is poetry because of the purity of their motivations and actions; that they have the skill to live their lives they way they can is a testament to their integrity.  That for me is the most compelling statement that can be made in this venue.",The Last of the Mohicans
273,Lord Tal,The Greatest film of all time.,10,3 May 2002,"This is, in my view, the greatest film of all time.  It has a fantastic storyline, arguably no real bad guy, great characters, fantastic acting by all the leads, beautiful cinematography, some of the greatest musical scores ever, great action scenes and a love story to top it all off.As of yet, I have not read the book, but generally I don't really compare novels with there movie counterparts, the major reason being you can achieve a far greater level of detail in a book than in a 2 hour movie (case in point, The Lord of the Rings), which, at the end of the day, has to bring in the money in order to please the Hollywood producers.To be perfectly honest, there is not a single thing I don't like about this film.  It is by far and away my favourite.  All I can really say is watch it.",The Last of the Mohicans
274,ChildoftheKindlyWest,One of the only movies that is actually better than the book,10,6 December 2000,"I think the Last of the Mohicans was the first ""R"" rated movie my parents let me watch with them.  Years after I first saw it, I am still in awe of its beauty.  It provides an excellent mixture of romance, wit, and action to cater to most movie fans.  While the dialogue and plot enchants you, the cinematography has a magic all its own.  I read the book when I was in the fifth grade because, thinking since I loved the movie so well, I would enjoy the book, too.  Big disappointment.  The book, which I realize was written over a century ago, lacks all of the movie's charm.  Its truly boring.  The movie takes the important aspects of the book, and melds them into an attractive, enthralling, exciting story.  They also switched the names of the sisters around, too, but that doesn't paricularly matter.  I would definitely recommend the movie to everyone, but the book...eh, not so much.",The Last of the Mohicans
275,soon_to_be_actress,Great movie...10/10,10,13 May 2002,"This was a sensational movie: mix of both war and love. It was great how the characters seemed to grow alive with the surroundings around them and would react in some unexpected ways and turn. But what i would like to focus on is the love between Uncas and Alice Munro. I have read comments and summaries and all i hear about is the love between Hawkeye and Kora which i thought was kind of lamely done! But between Uncas and Alice you find something passionate and rare. I thought it was truly fantastic the way it was done. Slowly growing though not too much interaction between the two. Though throughout the film clues are given and distributed. And at the end, you realize the two would rather die then be alone because the love is so strong between them though there were never any words involved in it. It's as if their love had blinded them from any sort of fear. It's beautifully done and imaged perfectly.Other actors such as the one that played Magua...he also played real well, the thought of revenge for his family was very well expressed though i must say they never quite explained why he hated Mr. Munro so much!For all this and more, this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 for great spontaneous scenes, special effects, wonderful actors, etc...",The Last of the Mohicans

You realize this statement is false when you watch the film. Over ten years old now, Michael Mann's direction in this film is much like his others: great. While not his best film, it takes you on a journey you'll never forget. The first half is good, the second half is breath-taking. I also like the use of color in this film and the sound track is compelling. Daniel Day-Lewis and Wes Studi are excellent, and Madeliene Stowe is great as the supporting female. Overall, a touching, epic tale of romance, action, and history. Grabbing at your emotions, it's definitley worth the 120 minutes, especially if you're a Michael Mann fan.",The Last of the Mohicans

280,t-jure,They don't make movies like this anymore,10,4 November 2021,"Michael Mann's film adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper's 1826 novel The Last of the Mohicans: A Narrative of 1757 isn't the first film adaptation, there has been quite a lot before, but is probably the most well known.The story goes like this: three trappers, Chingachgook, his son Uncas and adopted white son Hawkeye are hunting in the woods, where they whitness a Huron attack on a British garrison protecting Colonel Edmund Munroe's daughters Cora and Alice. They escort them to Fort William Henry.This is one of the first movies I ever saw and the one that made me love cinema. It's sad that so little people have seen this movie and it's probably one of the most underrated movies ever. They say only people with soul understand this movie. It got an Oscar for Best sound, which was the only nomination, but it has one of the best movie soundtracks ever. How it didn't won an Oscar for Best Music is beyond my understanding.Hawkeye is not the most recognised Daniel Day Lewis's role but he did amazingly good job, even for his standards. The cinematografy is beautiful and it gives us a look into the beautiful nature where native Americans lived. The last 15 minutes of the film is probably one of the most intense scenes ever put on film and should give you chills.",The Last of the Mohicans
281,dl-alpha-omega,The Original Michael Mann Masterpiece,10,10 March 2013,"Set in old colonial America this movie manages to distil what is best in movies into a masterful mix of drama, romance and action blended into a spiritual and beautifully filmed setting of a violent war merging old and new.I remember seeing this when younger but did not fully appreciate it like I do today.Daniel Day Lewis plays a white man brought up in an American Indian family and portrays one of the strongest male leads in recent times. The as ever lovely Madelaine Stowe brings beauty and a brooding presence to the drama and both a perfectly matched against each other and they are totally believable when the inevitable attraction occurs. It is true old fashioned presence that allows both actors convey such intensity in a look - without the need to display extreme facial expressions or dramatic movement.What is notable for me in the this movie is the utter perfection in the way it is shot and scripted. The dialogue in this film are for those somewhat old fashioned like myself who merely tolerate clichés but really appreciate a beautifully expressed script amid all the cannons and musket fire.In action films today, it seems the cost goes towards special effects rather than the right actors and writers. Michael Mann adds his touch to the intense and brooding screenplay - which we are reminded of in the later 'modern' masterpiece - Heat. It seems when you put Michael Mann with 2 strong characters and actors - Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in Heat, Jamie Fox and Tom Cruise in Collateral, Al Pacino and Russell Crowe in the Insider - you have a Masterpiece in the making.Perhaps that 2nd special actor is really all that is missing from his other films to make them great. A generalisation I know - but after seeing this again - Michael Mann's first big feature - it is hard to imagine him doing any wrong.The only comment I could add is I felt like it should be longer. More epic. More of everything. If it led on, I would follow.If you haven't watched this - watch it. It is an timeless experience.If you have seen it - watch it again like I did. And see if you can see the broad and delicate brush strokes to this masterpiece.",The Last of the Mohicans
282,eric_buist,"A thrill, but I was expecting more",7,19 July 2020,"I was expecting something like Dances with Wolves, which is such a rewarding and fulfilling film. This film was basically one long blood-bath punctuated by moments of forced romance between characters with little chemistry. I found the film very gripping, but when it was done, it just felt so incomplete, and I wanted more. When it got to the scene with the Huron village, I thought I was in the middle of the film and that a really interesting third act was ahead. But when I checked the time bar, I saw that the film was almost done! The climax was already nigh! Nothing truly interesting happens in this film, the only good things are the visuals, the fight scenes, and the acting. The story is not fleshed out enough, I have no reason to care about Hawkeye and his companions beyond basic empathy. It's just ""protect the damsels in distress"" and then ""save the damsels in distress"". But there are two things that prevent me from giving a rating lower than 7: The first is the ending, which is both beautiful and harrowing. The second is the character of Magua. I just couldn't take my eyes off him when he was on screen, and I hinged on his every word when he spoke. He is a brutal man, but there is a gravitas to him. He really carried the film.",The Last of the Mohicans

I was stunned by its power, & proud it's American made. What was the reviewers' problem? Not liberally biased enough for you folks? The box office proved otherwise. I rarely purchase a film or soundtrack; I had to own both on this one, the gorgeous Irish music strangely appropriate with its deep American roots prior to African influence. Somehow the photography captured America's early geographic breadth as well, against the backdrop of the life & death struggles between light & darkness, good & evil in America's early days of manifest destiny.

284,vdvaleva-79868,"Great film, great story and even greater music",8,12 May 2019,"They don't do such movies anymore. The visualization, the portrayal of the characters, the story-telling. The casting is superb, no remarks here whatsoever. The most I enjoyed watching Wes Studi who was stunningly good, captivating performance. Studi was actually nominated for his performance and it's shame he didn't grab any award on this. Next I want to give my credit to Jodhi May, she was outstanding and I think the greatness of her acting in this film was not the part as such (there wasn't too much of a dialog around her character which fell in the shadow), but her performance - her facial expressions and the radiance of her character will make you believe it was all real, all happening right there in front of you. And not at last, Daniel Day-Lewis - no surprise here, Day-Lewis doesn't have a single bad part throughout his career, he is able to morph in any character, depicting any era, any story.
The entire casting was flawless - hardly can I imagine these parts played by someone else now, everybody fitted their part in an effortless way.
The best of this film is that it triggers your imagination, makes you want to see more of that era, the Indian Americans, those tumultuous times, the lives of those people, their dreams, their fears, their determination. I wished more movies like this one were being made these days.
Thanks to this film I came to understand as to why men were captivated by the history of American Indians that much in my childhood :), and all of them went through the dream of wanting to be an Indian :)!
I am giving 8 out of 10 for the fact the story in my opinion, despite convincing, truly believable, and yet imagination-provocative, is a bit too romanticised for my taste. I saw too much of the love story going on between the main characters (which I dare to think could have been imposed externally in one way or another for the fact it was shot in Hollywood (nothing against Hollywood, great films have been produced there)).
I'd rather see more of the history of those days, and the habits of the indigenous people and how they fought and their cause, as also I wished to see more on the conflicts between England and France, more on the politics between the two of the greatest powers of the day back then.
Nevertheless the movie triggered my interest that deeply that I went on reading the original novel written by James Fenimore Cooper.
The music is epic, Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman created everlasting scores! I dare to say this is perhaps the best in the film. This is beyond excellence!
I wish to imagine some of the people I mentioned in this review would read this :) (so much unlikely though), I want them to know they materialized a great story from a great times. I wish contemporary directors and producers turn again back to this kind of movie-making.",The Last of the Mohicans

I was disappointed with some edits, such as the song ""I Will Find You"" being deleted from the DVD version. I don't mind additions but the removal of the song was of a major disappointment to me personally . The whole score is absolute excellence but it is diminished by the deletion of that song, played as they search frantically for Cora, Alice and Duncan... I now have the DVD in my collection, but for the first time I feel that the original version is better than the Director's Cut for the DVD.

M Stowe, much underused in movies, is beautiful in this and is no shrinking violet when needs be. W Studi is one of the best villains in film and, as Magua, shines. from the time that hawkeye enters the Huron encampment, the action rises to a new level, taking on a ballet like character set to an irish jig. a very good choice by M Mann. the last sequences are Mann at his very best, and there are such focused emotions here. the heroics of Lewis and others, while a little unrealistic, suit the emotional mood, a do what you'd expect from them as characters. only the fabulous S Leone could have done the climax better than this.",The Last of the Mohicans

Yet Mann makes it breathtaking thanks to three key elements: Daniel Day-Lewis (the method-man looks even more here heroic than Gibson's William Wallace in Braveheart!), the photography (the scenery and battles are filmed with equal beauty, the already excellent Spinoti never surpassed his work on this) and one of the best action scores ever (the themes by Trevor Jones are among the greatest music ever associated to the film industry). ""Last of the Mohicans"" is also a very smart romantic portrayal, thanks to it's pragmatism and impartiality, and above all, the film feels honest and authentic; that's something you rarely get in a historical epic, for at heart this is what Mann's film remains.

There are no long dialogues and rallying cries, no epic sets to dazzle the viewer. There are some long conversations, but only as long as is necessary. Most of the dialogues are kept short and to the point, but you do not lose anything that is left unsaid. The grandeur is provided by nature herself. And, although there is enough in the movie about native Indians and their ways, I consider the movie as primarily a love story. The romance between Cora and Hawkeye burns through the movie.

This is the kind of movie that can change my mood for days because of it's 'real' qualities. It's not a perfect little fairy tale where everyone lives happily ever after. In fact, not everyone lives! Granted, I was a little upset about Uncas' death, since he was my favorite character, but it's still a marvelous piece of film-making. Magua, the antagonist, is someone that is extremely fun to hate. Hawkeye, Uncas, and Chingachgook all maintain qualities of good people, as well as having traits that contribute to their realistic personalities.

296,Ariamus,A master at work,8,29 May 2005,"You don't have to look very hard to recognize when someone is a master of his or her craft. Saying that, for example, Babe Ruth and Willie Mays were masters of their craft is not a risky venture and neither is an assertion that Shakespeare was a master playwright. But when it comes to directing motion pictures, that assertion is a bit harder to make. For one reason, it is fair to argue that, in the movie-making hierarchy, direction ranks at best, third in order of importance behind acting and writing. But when the actors and writers differ yet a catalog of movies is populated mostly by excellent examples of the medium, it goes without say that any common denominator should be looked at as a reason for the consistent excellence of the same. By that rationale, it can be said that Michael Mann is a master of his craft. His resume certainly indicates a preponderance for great directing. ""Thief"", ""Heat"", and ""The Insider"" are all excellent films; so is ""The Last of the Mohicans"" New Jerseyan James Fennimore Cooper's novel of the same name has been translated to the screen many times, with varying levels of success. The latest version on film is Mr. Mann's 1992 production starring Daniel Day Lewis, Madelaine Stowe, and Wes Studi. I guess it can be said that it is to my detriment that I have not seen most of the prior productions of this classic story. However, I don't believe that prior accomplishments and/or failures in telling this story have very much bearing on the merits of the most modern envisioning of the same. Mr. Mann's realization of his and Christopher Crowe's script is as successful a dramatization of elements in Cooper's story as can be expected from a two hour movie. In short, the plot is fine; it leaves little to be desired.The performances of the actors, on the other hand, leave nothing to be desired. Yes, the most visible of all the cast, Daniel Day Lewis comes across as over the top at times. The ""stay alive"" exchange behind the waterfall in the third act of the movie comes to mind as far as this goes. But this minor trifle may be mitigated by shortcomings in the writing; a couple of the other lines Lewis' Hawkeye has in the movie seem to reinforce that idea. Nitpicking aside, Lewis delivers a Hawkeye that is supremely confident, charismatic, and almost haughty in his righteousness. It is a performance akin in it's excellence to Lewis' Gerry Conlon, Danny Flynn, and Will Cutting. It is not the best performance of this movie which is enough of an endorsement of the quality of the whole cast. That honor has to go to Wes Studi. His Magua is so irrevocably evil that you can't help but root against the guy. His cold and disaffected predictions of what he will do to the ""gray hair"" are indications of a psychopathic nature. Yet, when you hear why Magua hates Munro, you begin to doubt your own feelings against him. Then the revelation during the Huron tribal council scene at the end of the film that revenge is not enough for Magua reinforces your first opinion of the guy.The other performances in the movie are quite good as well. Jodhi May's mousey Alice Munro serves as an excellent metaphor for what war can do to someone as she spends the vast majority of the movie in a state of perpetual shellshock. It's a performance that also serves to contrast superbly Madeleine Stowe's exceptional depiction of Cora Munro as a strong and fiercely willful woman of the frontier. Steven Waddington is good at portraying Major Heyward, a noble soul buried underneath a warrior blinded by duty. And Russell Means and Eric Schweig are very effective in their roles of Hawkeye's ""Indian"" father and brother.Another star not yet mentioned is one that doesn't appear on screen but works behind the cameras. That is Italian cinematographer Dante Spinotti. That this movie's visuals are gorgeous isn't a surprise given the locations where it was shot. What is a surprise is the stark contrast created by the juxtaposition of the beauty of nature and the ugliness of war. The exceptional and comparative visual quality of both in this movie is best exemplified by the ambush sequence in the forest after the surrender of Fort William Henry. It is here that the two are brought together splendidly almost like a real life realization of the ""Yin Yang"" symbol. Visuals on this level are no accident just as the fact that Mann has worked with Spnotti on a number of other films is no coincidence.Which brings this review full circle. All the individual elements of a movie can be excellent but if they're not brought together effectively, then the final product will be muddled. But Mann is a master of his craft. He brings in the right cinematographer. He consults on and writes the right script. He directs talented actors to say and do the right thing. Finally, he blends all the elements into an excellent example of how a movie can always serve, at the very least, the purpose of great escapism.8.5 stars of 10",The Last of the Mohicans
297,shadowking107,Simply Awe Inspiring,9,14 September 2011,"This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I thought that it was a little weak for an R, but then again, it's a little strong for a PG-13. This is the type of movie that some have said necessitate a rating in between the two. However, the rating has little to with the overall quality of the movie, and don't let the rating drive you away. All in all, i would say that this movie is no more graphic than Dances With Wolves, so i wouldn't worry. Just sit back and watch the awesome story take place. I won't spoil it for anyone, because this is just to good of a story to waste on spoilers. Just watch it and find out! I have only one complaint, and that is that the first few scenes went a little fast and that (not saying who, what, when, where, why) you cannot fire two long-barrel muskets akimbo(two at once). Other than that, it was a great movie. Just watch it and find out!",The Last of the Mohicans
298,ace100,Clichéd and shallow,4,12 November 2004,"This was a movie of clichés: arrogant and cold British Army, hard-working and decent Colonial farming folk. Native Americans are portrayed here interestingly as both the ruthless savage and noble harmonious types. Shallow characters are wrapped around an improbable story entailing a thoroughly unconvincing love story, with some god-awful dialogue thrown in (""You must live! Whatever happens, I'll find you!""). The movie is interesting if you're a fan of the genre, but does not stand out as an exceptional piece of movie-making or storytelling. The all-location backdrops are beautiful, and I enjoyed the music score. Otherwise, don't expect too much.",The Last of the Mohicans
299,fmpemy,Intensely good,10,17 January 2005,"Movies that are centered around war often bring blood thirsty men to the box office craving carnage and amputations of all kinds. Well the blood thirsty man will get this when they watch this amazing picture, I know because I happen to be one of those blood thirsty savages, but there is another element that makes this movie so darn good. The romance seen between Hawkeye and Miss Munroe contains enough passion to ignite the forest where their love blooms a blaze. The romance seen in this movie is not the kind that women crave, and men make gagging sounds to, but it is the kind that makes women swoon and guys say, ""This Hawkeye character, he's the man."" This is clearly shown when viewers see Hawkeye vow to rescue Miss Munroe no matter what in the scene that takes place behind the waterfall. This movie deserves a much higher overall rating because it satisfies the male thirst for carnage, and the female thirst for love and romance, but at the same time men that watch this movie see that romance is not always as cheesy as it seems.",The Last of the Mohicans
300,cwoodul,Real Men,10,14 July 2005,"Want to see what real men are? This movie is full of them. Regardless of which side they are on, they protect and defend their women and families, they have moral strength, they are patriots fighting for right, and they are downright sexy to boot! The spectacular location and haunting musical score further enhance this wonderful glimpse into U.S. history. Daniel Day-Lewis (Nathaniel, ""Hawkeye"") and Madeline Stowe (Cora Munro), both perfectly cast, exude chemistry in a scene which is, in my opinion, one of the most erotic love scenes in all of cinema. Wes Studi as Magua gives a stunning performance; definitely Academy Award caliber. Russel Means(Chingachgook), Eric Schweig (a very handsome Uncas)and Jodhi May (Alice)all perform with understated elegance. A beautifully made, perfectly acted and directed film! One of the best ever.",The Last of the Mohicans
301,sandyclaws7-1,Uplifting and truthful story of our past,10,2 June 2005,"Watching this movie has always brought me closer to the truth of the past. The colonialists, thought they were supposed to rule over the land and bring the 'savages' into the ""Way of God"". It never crossed their minds that they were driving the ""True Americans"" away from their homes. This movie points out the heroism of a few immigrants and some native Americans. The French and English were only concerned about their possessions. The Indians were concerned about losing their culture and their way of life. The immigrants wanted to raise their children and their crops away from excess taxes and tyranny. We forced them under our rule. They lost their way(s) of life and now, we are the poorer for that loss. Daniel Day Lewis and Wes Studi are the absolute embodiment of that time and these characters, and I applaud them each time I watch this movie",The Last of the Mohicans

I used to watch it all the time when I was younger and not of it really ever hit me. However, I chose to watch it again a few months ago and I realized what an absolute masterpiece it is. This is the type of movie that has everything: a beautiful music score, great acting, solid writing, and a very deep message. The scene that got me (and I think everyone) was when Uncas and Alice were captured and Hawkeye and Chingachcook were trying to free them. That scene left me speechless and in tears. There were only a few words spoken, yet the acting made you feel every emotion. Anyways, if you haven't seen this movie I highly recommend you do.",The Last of the Mohicans
304,spjames,My Favourite Film Of All Time!,10,3 April 2008,"I remember vividly seeing this film for the first time when I was young (like,really young). The images and sounds resonate so powerfully in my head that I just have to watch it at least once a year.I like to see this film as a mini-epic, because it certainly has an epic sweep but not the running time to match. I read that the original version was three hours however the final result clocks in at just over a hundred minutes (without credits). Therefore, the film may appear choppy and the charatcers a bit thin.But I don't care. Yes it's very Hollywood but it's the best kind of Hollywood; so exciting and moving, so romantic and thrilling, with such an exhausting recreation of the time that pulls you into this world so well, the action staged with such precision by Michael Mann, the score so evocative and inspiring and Daniel-Day Lewis so charismatic in the lead. He really is the greatest actor of his generation, the fact he can play a man with cerebal palsy, a despicable oilman and the coolest motherf***king hero on the planet doesn't really begin to analyze his genius as a performer Most people consider TLOTM to be simply a terrific action movie, and I see it as such too but for some reason I rank it higher than all else. Maybe it's because of this; when you're young you see great films, and then you see great films you want to make, or wish you had made. The Last Of The Mohicans is one such film. If in my life time I had the chance to have directed any film sequence in history, I would choose the final ten minutes of this film, which is the greatest action climax I've ever seen and no other film has come close to matching this climatic gun-fight-on-the-run for sheer exhilaration and emotional power.A masterpiece in any language.",The Last of the Mohicans
305,HitoZen,Director's Expanded Edition (DVD),10,30 November 1999,"I just received the Director's Expanded Edition on DVD today and watched it right away.  All I have to say is the addendum makes this movie, which I had seen twice before, all the greater.According to the included insert, 15 out of 32 Chapters have been expanded. And according to the little enclosed card, ""This movie has been re-edited by Michael Mann.  It is his definitive vision of the film.  In order to create it, certain shots had to be lengthened, resulting in a momentary jump in the image.""  The jumps were noticeable but negligible, and the new materials make up all the tiny flaws and some more. The only real regret I have is that I got the THX version instead of the DTS version. :(  But 's all good.Get this DVD!!!  ^_^",The Last of the Mohicans
306,jackal-20,wow it's one of those movies that you can watch on daily basis,10,4 October 1998,wow!wow!wow!The movie starts with the elk hunt with the superb Main title as the background music.The movie basically starts by showing a British army squad escorting Cora(madeleine stowe)and her sister;who are going to meet their father.Their party is attacked by hurons led by Magua(wes studi) and then they are saved by the wandering Mohicans led by Hawkeye(daniel day lewis).The movie boasts of glorious scenery;great music;and memorable performances by all the actors.Just go and watch the movie for yourself if you don't believe me.Highly Recommended.

It has a perfect mixture of beautiful filming and a great soundtrack. I believe it won an Oscar for the sound. The story, a classic, is well interpreted by director Michael Mann. I think what I like most about this movie is that the fighting scenes are so brutal and horrifying, which makes the film and the story seem more real. The movie reflects both upon the horrors of war and at the same time the strength of love. This is my all time favorite, I just love it.",The Last of the Mohicans
309,cyykeen,Stunning.,9,24 July 2000,"Mann is The Man. The battle scenes are very well executed, very easy to follow, and very exciting. The ""secondary"" love affair in the movie, between the young Mohican and Stowe's sister, is at least as compelling as Lewis and Stowe's. The last act of the movie is beautifully-centrifugal and cinematic, sparse on dialogue, letting Mann's graceful visuals and the music alone tell the story--and what an amazing job they do! The soundtrack is incredible unto itself.",The Last of the Mohicans

From the opening shot of the wild American landscape to the sad but poignant ending you will be truly captivated by a movie of love and loss of revenge and war. This has everything you could ask for. Fantastic performances by DDL Madeleine Stowe but for me the stand out role from Wes Studi.All played against a beautiful and haunting theme. Perfect!,The Last of the Mohicans
311,lilreeves,Make sure you watch this in your lifetime,8,28 March 2008,"Yes it doesn't win my award for the best movie I have ever seen but admittedly it would be in my top 15 favourites of all time. Apart from the dashing Day-Lewis and stirring soundtrack this is a well-executed epic, all be it slightly over-romantic. From a female perspective you have to see this movie if nothing else but to see Daniel Day-Lewis look utterly stunning and the romantic although slightly clichéd relationships within the plot which epitomise what women want everywhere. From a guy's perspective this movie has authentic fight scenes and well developed characters who are excellently acted by the likes of Wes Studi and Day-Lewis, who as ever applied his passion for method acting to the role and built a canoe, learned to track and skin animals, and how to use a 12-pound flintlock gun, which in true Mohican style never left his side (If he doesn't earn your respect for that alone then there is something wrong with you). This movie reminds me a lot of Braveheart, I think Braveheart is slightly better but if you like that movie without a doubt you'll like The Last Of The Mohicans. I loved this movie and there wasn't a moment when I wasn't entertained, some of the romance quickly evolves and if you've read the book it is definitely not faithful to the plot, which I believe enhances the film if anything. Other than those small almost irrelevant points, the movie achieves what it sets out to do, don't take it too seriously or you might find more criticisms than I did, but just enjoy it.",The Last of the Mohicans
312,mattmccor-1,Doesn't hold up well,3,3 September 2018,"I'm not American and this movie seemed to made only for Americans who probably have greater context of the timeline. For me, I had very little background and did not understand a lot of the context and it wasn't explained very well what was going on.A lot didn't make sense. For example, at the waterfall scene, Hawkeye just leaves the women without any explanation. Also, why didn't Magua kill the daughters instead of capturing them? He said that was his mission.The music was completely overdone to try to overcompensate for drama and acting that was non-existent.I suppose this must have been thought of more highly in the 90's when it came up but it just doesn't hold up well.",The Last of the Mohicans

The score to this film strikes great emotion and plays to the visuals perfect. The ending scene makes me cry every time. This is definitely the magnum opus for Michael Mann, it displays his powerful prowess for dramatic storytelling with perfect balance. Daniel Day Lewis and Madeline Stowe have incredible chemistry together. These 2 show here why they are revered as a couple of the greatest actors of our time. Their performances are emotional and powerful. This is a classic American tale that was brilliantly transcribed to film.I recommend this to any one who loves an epic tale.",The Last of the Mohicans
315,st_george,must-see movie,10,22 June 2002,"What a great film - I first saw 'The Last of the Mohicans' a few months ago and have watched it a countless number of times since: I never get tired of it!  Beautifully shot and brilliantly acted, it's a definite must-see.Set against the stunning backdrop of the Smoky Mountains in North Carolina, it's a tale of war, revenge and transcendent love.  Reportedly it's nothing like the book (I started it but didn't get anywhere) but I doubt that really matters!  Fantastically directed by Michael Mann, the supporting cast is great: Wes Studi is suitably terrifying as Magua and Jodhi May as Alice almost steals the show in one of the film's most haunting images in the final scenes.Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe are the improbably drop-dead gorgeous romantic leads; the chemistry between them is electrifying.  Day-Lewis is competent and convincing as Nathaniel/Hawkeye, but it's Stowe, as Cora, that you've really got to look out for.  She's an incredibly talented yet under-rated actress and her performance here is great; at once vulnerable and threatened yet courageous and independent, there are few other actresses who could steal thunder from a scantily-clad Daniel Day-Lewis....
It's impossible not to comment on the score here: I've never seen a film which shares such an equal partnership with the soundtrack.  The music will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end!  Without the soundtrack, the film would only be half of what it is now, but you can't appreciate the full power and beauty of the music without having seen the film!The Last of the Mohicans far out-shines both Braveheart (sorry Mel) and Dances with Wolves (which, let's face it, was a tad on the long side), two films which seem largely to have eclipsed it, for some unknown reason.  A fantastic film, especially for born romantics; not for the squeamish - the battle scenes are horrific - but you'd be mad to miss it, and anyone who fails to cry at the end must have a heart of stone! 10/10",The Last of the Mohicans
316,Jimmious,One of the best movies ever.,10,3 September 2003,I have seen many many movies in my life but yet only few achieve to really touch my feelings.This movie (The Last Of The Mohicans) really does that every time I see it...Not only the whole concept is great (the slaughtering of native population-the ugly war) but also the acting and music where great!!!The way this film was depicted was also fantastic and made me feel all the time I was so near to these Indians I could touch them.Ofcourse many people throw this movie into the garbage for the following ridiculous reasons: 1)The English lost a battle 2)The movie supposedly hates English people Ofcourse both these statements show that the people who believe in them never trully saw the movie but only what they wanted to see. Ok the movie resembles English losing one battle... WOW!!! That is NOT the point of the movie...The whole battle thing is brought into this movie to depict the destruction war caused in this land...And ofcourse when you write a film for Indian people its very logical to reveal English and French as destroyers-killers which they were at that period. There is never a possibility I will listen to the ending scene music and my hair wont stand up in excitement... Cheers!! 11/10!,The Last of the Mohicans
317,ballston54,Cora film version and book version,8,25 November 2020,"I admit I enjoy this movie and have seen it several times, including the ending again this week while channel surfing on cable. But one thing I would like to point out may be controversial to some. As any number of reviewers have indicated, the film deviates from the novel in several aspects, but one change no one has mentioned involves Cora's race. In the novel she is described as Colonel Munro's daughter from his mixed race (mulatto) West Indian wife, hence Cora would be considered black in the context of the U.S. (His younger daughter, Alice, had a different mother, a white woman that Munro married after the death of Cora's mother, hence in the novel Cora and Alice are half sisters.) In the film, Cora is played by white actress Madeline Stowe; nothing against her, but wouldn't it have been positively daring to portray Cora with a black actress and her (and Alice's) background explained as they are in the novel? Just my humble opinion.",The Last of the Mohicans
318,jburgess6,Review,10,20 January 2004,"This is a movie for both men and women to love. It is action packed and has two love stories between brothers and sisters. The women are real and proactive and are not just ""eye candy"". The cinematography of the Carolina forest and mountains is breathtaking. I read when they were making this movie that Daniel Day Lewis stayed in his character ""Hawkeye"" the whole shoot and walked/ran everywhere and did not ride in a car out to the remote locations. He and Madeline Stowe have great chemistry together.",The Last of the Mohicans
319,Liason1,Force of nature,8,22 December 2020,"Daniel Day Lewis is a force of nature as Nathaniel Hawkeye, the white man raised by his adoptive Native father (Russell Means) and living in the wild. Madeleine Stowe is a dark haired candle of radiance and fierce spirit as the lovely Cora Munro, brought from the prim, lacy traditions of England out to the wild, uncompromising new land, with her impressionable, naive sister (Jodi May).Wes Studi gives the bitter hearted warrior Magua a steady grace and brutal resolve. The film is lovingly made, and although it drags a tiny bit in the middle with a lengthy battle sequence that although is beautifully done, could have been streamlined a bit. But it's all worth it for those last twenty minutes, man. Holyyy hell does this movie have an ending. When the final, white knuckle climax happens atop the scenic yet unforgiving Promentory Vista, hearts, bones and dreams are broken as all the characters collide in a tragic, inevitable confrontation that leaves fire in your heart and tears in tour eyes.I still cry every time at this sequence, it's that stirring and memorable. James Newton Howard provides a legendary, soul stirring musical score that swells for this end sequence and carries it to transcendent heights. Mann directs with a compassionate, objective eye, never designating anyone as the good or bad guy, but simply showing us human beings, fighting for survival, love and revenge in a land only just being discovered.",The Last of the Mohicans

The acting was great, one of Daniel Day Lewis's best films. Michael Mann knew exactly what he was doing. He knew exactly where to shoot the scenery for maximum authenticity, especially at the end, (SPOILER AHEAD) where Hawkeye, Uncas, and Chingachgook attempt to rescue Alice and fight Magua. I would definitely recommend this movie for history classes. The battle sequences were very realistic and the music put you in tune with the battles.

The special effects are prety basic (its he 90s be reasonable) but it still looks more realistic than any blockbuster movie you will see, and the reason for that is the superb acting from the basic characters to the secondary to the background actors and that goes to show directors Michael Manns vision and charisma.Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe have a special kind of on screen chemistry that goes to show the superb casting of this movie.But the acting asside the realism of this movies climate is unique and can very difficulty be created again today.

The costumes, the music, the acting is wonderful and you have to give mad props to DDL for his portrayal of Hawkeye. Wes Studi is also great in it as the bloodthirsty Huron warrior Magua. I cannot understand why it did not win or be nominated for more awards. Its current rating of 7.6 is hilarious. 7.6 would tell me this movie is barely above average and I have seen plenty of average to above-average movies in my lifetime and this ain't one of them.

The poor sound design made the dialog difficult to follow to the extent that I needed to use subtitles in my own language! Ironically it won an Oscar for its sound which only serves to confirm my lack of respect for Oscar winners. It didn't help that the entire film was also drowned in an excessively loud and unimaginative soundtrack which tediously repeated the same refrain ad nauseam. The romance element seemed quite implausible and the relations between the characters were underdeveloped to the extend that I really didn't care what happened to any of them.

But I can not find one actor in this film who is not worthy.I think this is Michael Mann's 'Labour of Love' I think it's the film he always wanted to make. When he made it, he made it well.To me this is the almost perfect film.

In my own heart, I feel the raw power of the wilderness and the drive to survive amongst the elements. The agony of the endless walking and watching at every turn for danger. Yet in it all, there is a story line of what we all seek, love, fulfillment and completion. The ever brewing and building romance between Daniel and Madeline is evident yet submerged. As the story moves, it is like a boiling pot slowly gaining heat and energy. Utlimately, the grandest sacrifices are made and over it all, love triumphs! This is the perfect roller coaster ride tailor made for hopeless romantics like myself. It should be on everyones shelf for that night when you and your loved one are alone and need a powerful romantic story to move your soul.",The Last of the Mohicans
329,erklise,All but flawless,10,27 October 2007,"Realism & intensity, minus pandering. The passion that blazes up between Stowe & Day-Lewis in the hours running up to the final assault is white-hot, as powerful as anything I can remember on film, all non-verbal and fully clothed. Stowe's voice, hoarse with feeling, and blazing features stand out in my memory, as do minute but detectable changes in Studi's face as things happen to and around Magua on the mountainside. The interview in the Huron town with the running 3-way translations was a dandy, and Duncan's final act of courage and abnegation, manly and moving, reclaiming his honor. They took good care of the details, always satisfying to see, uniforms and equipment, even the sound of shells in flight, and Pete brandishing his pistol pan-side up.The only misstep was the embarrassing gaucherie of the interview with Webb at Albany. How that business of ""make love with their faces"" got by the editors is a mystery.A little surprising, in the days of Brown Bess, to see a column route-marching down a forest road in hostile country without bayonets fixed. Wonder if senior British officers in the 18th were really so carefree. Not exactly Bobs Bahadur & the hard-bitten, wide-faring Tommies of the 19th (or 20th, come to that).Terrific score. Went right out and looked up a tape, SR1.50 off a clearance-table at the Jubail souk, directly we turned off the VCR. Played it to transparency. Still find ""The Gael"" one of the toughest tunes to shake, once it gets going in my head. Wonderful.This one's in my top 10 best; for historicals, top 5.

331,tarasadowski,"A gorgeous, heart swelling film",10,30 July 2021,"This movie does so much right. The casting, the story, the landscapes, and perhaps the best movie soundtrack ever. But after recently re-watching this movie, I've discovered what makes this film so excellent in what it doesn't do. There are so many scenes that hang on the eyes of the characters--meaningful glances that say more than any dialogue could achieve. From the lusty exchanges between Hawkeye and Cora, to Alice's cliffside grief and courage, are all achieved without saying a word. Modern Hollywood would insist on overexplaining every detail, but this is filmmaking that trusts the audience to understand what human emotion looks like. Some accuse this move of being overwrought and dramatic, but it is so much more subtle than it is often given credit for. I personally would love to see the 3 hour cut that Mann originally made.",The Last of the Mohicans
332,currywertz-48103,Excellent complement to the French & Indian War,10,3 December 2018,"Excellent complement to the French & Indian War. Haunting musical score, wonderful scenery locations, and fantastic minimalist dialog. (Eric Schweig/Uncas does an outstanding performance with minimal dialog. His character is well defined with only facial expressions, eyes, and his comportment.)
My 13 year old grandson is studying the French and Indian War and I remembered seeing this film in the early 90s. I read the book and like Michael Mann's work.
We watched it, he loved it. He even enjoyed me pausing it to explain further details of the perod and politics.

333,gunwell,One of the best movies of all time,10,13 April 2018,"I do not write reviews often, but The Last of Mohicans compels me to write a review for a film that I think is vastly underrated and one of the greatest films of all time. I consistently watch this movie once a year and each time I watch it I enjoy it as much as the first.Now for the reasons:CinematographyThe locations, costumes, feel of the time period, and how each scene is shot with care never ages this movie. Many movies do not age well, but 26 years after the fact and Mohicans has aged better than many films made in the last 10 years.ActingDaniel Day Lewis as Hawkeye is in top form. He owns Hawkeye in this movie and plays him not only as a strong warrior, but a compassionate and individual who puts a lot of thought in to every action.Madeleine Stowe as Cora gives her best performance in Mohicans. She plays the older, wiser, but still vulnerable and somewhat naive older sister exceptionally well. Stowe and Day-Lewis are an extremely convincing romantic couple.Jodhi May as Alice is in my opinion is the standout actress in this movie. Her portrayal as a young siste,r who is not only extremely naive but incapable of comprehending and handling what goes on outside her wealthy daily lifestyle, is truly mesmerizing. Her haunting scene on the mountainside promenade is unforgettable.Eric Schweig as Uncas is vastly underrated. Eric very humbly once said in an interview ""people come up to me and said I did such a great job acting Uncas, but I always tell them that I didn't do anything except run and say a few words"", which is partially true, but he didn't have to. His facial and emotional acting for the character conveyed everything about Uncas. His love for Alice. Likewise his scene on the mountainside promenade in an effort to prove his love for and save Alice is one of the saddest, brutal, and unforgettable fight scenes in the movie.Finally Wes Studi makes the perfect villain as Magua. He is brutal in his unrelenting quest for vengeance against the British, namely Colonel Monroe and his daughters. You feel some sympathy for his situation and what happened to him with this loss of his wife, but on the other hand you will hate him for the way he carries out his vengeance. By the end of the movie you are ready for him to be brutally destroyed by Chingachgook.StoryI've tried many times to read James Fenimore Cooper's novel and watch other movies which followed the book's story. I'll be blunt here and say the book and the previous movies were very boring. I could never finish any of them. Mohicans has action, romance, drama, and tragedy. It makes for a much better movie than any movie that is follows the book.RomanceI am not a big fan of romance, but Mohicans is my kind of romance. Two unlikely, but strong female and male characters start off at odds but eventually come to respect and finally love each other. When they are both in the infirmary and Hawkeye is looking up and down at Cora, which would be offensive to nearly anyone in her position due to her social standing and the time, Cora asks ""what are you looking at sir?"" to which Hawkeye replies ""well I'm looking at you miss"". Cora looks down first in embarrassment, but then looks back up with strength and a smile. It's one of the best romantic scenes in the movie. Shortly thereafter with ""The Gael"" playing on a violin in the background Hawkeye takes Cora's hand and they head out of sight in a scene that shows passion but still leaves something to the imagination. Not something that is done often in modern times.ActionThe fight scenes are very well executed. Day-Lewis who is somewhat stiff in his athletic ability has done enough training to make Hawkeye a convincing warrior. The march of the British army with Major Hayward leading the escort of Cora and Alice to their father is thrilling once Magua starts the attack. There is tension in every scene as Hawkeye, Uncas, and Chingachgook lead Cora, Alice, and Major Heyward back to the British Fort. The Massacre is so well executed and you feel the fear of every survivor of the British fort being lead to their death. Finally, the mountainside promenade battles will have you cheering for the Last of the Mohicans to stop Magua and save Alice.MusicMohicans simply would not be the same movie without the soaring, epic, and romantic soundtrack composed by Trevor Jones and Randy Edelman. The main title track is an unforgettable and rousing piece of music that has been used numerous times by people across the world, from MMA fighters to rappers and even Nike commercials.Trevor Jones is responsible for the rousing main title, the romantic pieces ""The Kiss"" and ""Promenade"" derived from a scottish folk piece ""The Gael"".Randy Edelman provides the softer pieces that help connect the emotion and story.26 years later and the soundtrack is still as stirring as it was the first time I saw Mohicans.DirectingMichael Mann as always is an amazing director. These words from Eric Scheig in an interview tell you everything you need to know about Michael Mann from the eyes of one of his actors:""MP: Okay...... So what was it like to work with Michael Mann?ES: He was intense. He's a nice enough guy. He's pretty intense. He's one of those guys..... He's all business. He's a hard worker. He expects the same from his cast and his crew.MP: Compared to other directors you've worked with since Michael Mann, how does he fit in to the over all mold of the other directors? How is he different from them?ES: He's more meticulous, he's a perfectionist ... to the power of 10. And you know, most of them are...... but where most of them will do 3 or 4 takes of something, whether it's a close up or an establishing shot ... he'll take 12 laughs .... or 13.

I guess whats really astounding about the movie is the way the action is blended with the storyline. the romance is strong and real. i love the expressionless faces of the characters even when dying...it places more emphasis on the meanings behind each action.

This film only won the best sound Oscar but should have won more. If you breakdown the movie into the major categories it excels in all of them. The screenplay A work in progress since 1936 is superior. Cinematography-LOTM was not even nominated for an Oscar in this category. I think some of locations chosen for this movie give the movie its grand scope and gritty feel. Best Actor- Daniel Day Lewis has you believing he is an adopted native about 30 seconds into the movie. Editing- the editing of this movie is excellent, just like the characters we are given just enough time to rest before being whisked away to some other adrenaline pumping adventure. Music- Started by Trevor Jones finished by Randy Endleman, this soundtrack is what has me coming back for repeat viewings.

339,Volay,"Action, Romance, and Intrigue",9,6 February 1999,"The Last of the Mohicans is a timeless tale of the 18th century frontier and the virtue and tragedy that results when the uniquely different cultures of the French, English, Native Americans, and colonists collide.  Based on James Fenimore Cooper's literary genius, The Last of the Mohicans transports the viewer back to a time of America's youth in a brilliant, mesmerizing fashion.The story centers on an eclectic band of travelers, thrust together by fate and their attempt to escape danger and reach the besieged British fort, William-Henry.  Deep within the western forests of colonial New York, Hawkeye, the white, adopted son and brother of the Mohicans, tries desperately to avoid an ever-increasing war.  He is forced to act when, along with his Mohican father and brother, he encounters two endangered sisters trying to reach their father, a British colonel in command at the fort.  Hawkeye, the rustic tracker, and Cora, the refined, eldest daughter, are naturally drawn together (much to the dismay of Major Heyward, an intriguing character who also vies for Cora's affections).  Tensions and passions arise between the characters as a whirlwind of conflict and violence rages around them.  In the end, each character must face heart-wrenching decisions that will affect their very lives, and the lives of those around them.I especially love the way that the film depicts the perspectives of each of the groups involved.  Whether the group is competing for military superiority or simple existence in their homeland, the viewer is given a true sense of their mindset in the midst of a great conflict.  It is difficult to say one side or the other is completely to blame for the events that take place.  Even the story's main antagonist, Magua (wonderfully portrayed by Wes Studi, Dances with Wolves) draws in a fair amount of empathy.The Last of the Mohicans is a marvelous, visual adventure that thoroughly reveals the horrors of warfare, the wildness of a chaste frontier, and the fated and ill-fated romances of the characters involved.",The Last of the Mohicans

This is a fine piece of movie making. The brutality and violence of the battle scenes are shocking, but everything here has the ring of authenticity. Even a quick scene of the colonialists and Native Americans playing some sort of field hockey together leaves you thinking, ""I'll bet that's how it really was."" The involvement of Russell Banks and Dennis Means probably accounts for this. Daniel Day-Lewis gives what probably is his best performance to date, and the supporting cast is superb. It's a beautiful, suspenseful and thrilling movie, one you can watch over and over again and never feel like you wasted your time. Rent this movie.

346,Tim-454,Just one of the best ever made! Watch it!,9,23 June 2001,"What can one say about this ""The Last of the Mohicans""? Only thing... Highly underestimated! I would rank it right amidst its rivals as Braveheart, Gladiator and the Patriot and I might even dare say, that some could perceive it to be fastly superiou to those other historical epics, due to the more credible story. Now you ask, what it is that makes this movie so great. I will tell you.For starters it has absolutely one of the best soundtracks ever, no doubt about it. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, while experiencing the sense of drama and romance. All at once! And this is realized through the music only. In combination with the scenes all of your synapses are on overload. One minor point is, that the movie contains almost no other sound scores and one must settle for the soundtrack in mostly every scene.Next up is the scenery. Michael Mann KNOWS what a good setting for a movie is. But even more does he KNOW how to get it over to your tv screen. Every camerashot couldn't have been taken better and entices you completely.And that brings me to the action. The Last of the Mohicans portrays some of the best personal combat, comparable to a martial artists film, with actors seemingly to be as highly skilled as Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan. And this might not be to everyones liking, but the movie often shows very realistic gory details, like broken bones showing through  skin and weapons penetrating a body.Now I have reached the last reason for the greatness of this film and why it belongs amongst Gladiator and its kind. The viewer receives a massive dose of the entire scala of emotional triggers: romance, intrigue, action, drama and adventure. And above that, the story stays credible. Something Braveheart and consorts passed by. Because the main lead is of flesh and blood and isn't made into a superhuman hero that can defeat anything on his path it keep it's credibility!Though I would like to stop now, I need to deal with one final point. The acting/actors. Don't get me wrong the acting was of high class, only the two lead characters, who were to convert the main love story to my screen, Daniel Day Lewis as Hawkeye and Madeleine Stowe as Cora Munro, were disappointing. To me neither of them could bring the story to life, because they just weren't convincing in their part and couldn't reach me. Fortunately, Wes Studi made up for a great deal of Daniel's doing as his best performance EVER as Magua, Daniel's counterpart. The other main characters were just as good as Studi. I liked them so much I just have to name them: Jodhi May as Alice Munro, Steven Waddington as Heyward, Eric Schweig as Uncas and Russell Means as Chingachgook! I would have loved for all of them to have twice as much screen time as they did, at the cost of the two leads! But hey you can't have everything.Well I guess this is why it deserves to be amongst the other great epics. The music, the scenery, the action, the versatility and the acting are all of superb quality. You must be a fool not to watch this movie. And when you do, be sure to do so on a tv as large as possible and a superb soundsystem to bring out the full greatness of this classic!",The Last of the Mohicans

349,crystalax3,OK should be better,6,8 July 2006,Its a Michael Mann film. This is a great start for any film. With him at the helm even at its worst its going to be interesting. I saw his forgotten gem THe Keep which had all the Mann touches: periods of silent acting accompanied by odd lighting and music and this reappears in this film. Far more thoughtful than similar films would be in the action genre Mann has taken Cooper's novel which is dated long before the usual western heroics. Instead of cowboys its the rivalry between the British and the Native American tribes that is the plot. Hawkeye is a white man adopted as a boy by the Mohicans. They have a greater sense of honour than many of the tribes and having been raised as one of them Hawkeye brings this nobility in contrast to them and the ruling British whose ceremony doesn't match his sense of honour. They also have an uneasy relationship. Relying on Hawkeye's local expertize but seeing him as something savage and untrustworthy because of his adoption. This intriguing set up is let down by the lack of characterisation in the script and the repetitious nature of the action. Hawkeye is diluted from the novel's far more independent and abrasive persona and the romance between him and Madelaine Stowe is unconvincing since Mann isn't know for directing romance,The Last of the Mohicans

The dialog between the the characters are enveloping. It's easy to get caught up in the scenes. My favorite line is when the group is behind the waterfall.

353,dogum6,"One of the more realistic ""history movies""",8,3 September 2006,"I was not expecting much when I read the reviews of this movie but I was surprised when I saw it and I still watch it now and again. As the plot line has been gone over extensively by other reviewers I only want to make a few points. First, while not perfect, this movie very accurately portrayed life in 1700's America. I love historical movies but I am so often disappointed by the cheesy Hollywood portrayal. That has started to change with movies like ""Platoon"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", and ""Master And Commander"", to name a few. I'd like to see more. Another thing that struck me was how clearly superior the Mohicans were over the Huron and Mohawk. Though their numbers had dwindled they were living a lifestyle that advocated honesty, mercy, and denounced hatred, revenge and cruelty. But in battle they were fast and fierce. They clove through the ranks of attacking Huron like a knife through soft butter. Also the speech Hawkeye gives as a captive in the Huron village shows good foresight for the times to come, and the colonial treatment by their British ""masters"" definitely sows the seed of rebellion. Well casted, well acted and well done. What happened to the DVD? I rented it and lines like ""Have you nothing better to do on the lake today Major?"" (one of my favorite) seemed to have been chopped. Bummer! Hopefully there is a director's cut or some such by now and it is back up to speed. Excellent movie.",The Last of the Mohicans
354,Kid_Revelator,"No matter how far, I will find you!",10,8 February 2007,"There is so may things about this film that will blow you away. The first thing you will notice is how wonderfully this film is shot, every single scene could be a painting, its so brilliant. The set pieces and costumes are mind-blowing in every detail. Several scenes could be considered classics but none compares to the love scene at the Fort Henry between Cora and Hawkeye. They are 2 very intense actors that made me forget i was watching a movie and they made me believe in the magic.The waterfall scene is one of the finest scenes I have ever witnessed, Hawkeye is standing with Cora and haunting violins resonate as he tells Cora to stay alive, that no matter what those nasty Hurons do he will come back for her. A scene of Cora and Hawk locked together while the waterfall rages beyond them is so beautiful.For villains you just want to see get ripped to pieces, actor Wes Studi brings to life the war Chief Magua, not many villains can hold a candle to this guys psychosis, he literally cuts a guys heart out and its as casual to him as ordering Chinese food.For action genre fans, the final mountain-ledge showdown will bring a tear to your eye as Magua and his braves break out the tomahawks and have a chop-a-thon with Hawkeye and his guys.Every actor in this film is a joy to watch but pay close attention to Jodi May who plays Cora's sister Alice. Her subtle performance as the woman who cannot cope and would rather make the ultimate sacrifice then be a slave to Magua, it is the performance of the movie.Bottom line, this film might be the best film ever made, sad it does not get the recognition it should, Mann's best film by far.",The Last of the Mohicans

360,phagor217,Glorious if uneven,9,23 September 2001,"The Last of the Mohicans is such a fast-paced, lushly shot and impeccably acted film that I didn't notice the first few times I watched it that it is essentially a string of action set-pieces. While these set-pieces are essentially very well woven into the fabric of the story (so well that they do not emerge immediately as any different), it has the unfortunate effect that the rest of the narrative tends to sag somewhat in the face of the amazing animal highs presented by the action sequences. The sudden attack of Magua as Col. Hayward and the Monroe sisters travel to Fort William Henry; the resumption of the attack after the fall of the fort, and the amazing closing fifteen minutes as Alice is led away -- these scenes dominate the narrative, and whilst - much to the credit of the cast - the romantic storyline still propels the film forwards and maintains audience interest, its purpose is largely to simply add greater significance to the inevitably violent resolution of the conflict. The romantic scenes elevate the action to a more important plane, but in doing so diminish the relative significance of these scenes in themselves.However, despite the violence and brutal, animal code of the frontier which is used to resolve almost all of the film's conflicts, the most enduring image in my mind is the suicide of Alice (Jodhi May) in the final set-piece. Struggling bravely with adolescence (""I mustn't be an invalid schoolgirl""), falling for Uncas (Eric Schweig), and now led away by the malicious Magua (Wes Studi), she is forced to see her tentative love interest fight and die for her at the hands of her captor. Her response to this is utterly silent grief. Tears filling her eyes, yet almost bored and indifferent to Magua's gesture of mercy, she slowly throws herself from the scenic mountain ledge. A perfect image of grief-stricken beauty, May manages to steal the moment, however briefly, from the action sequence, and has produced, to my mind, one of the greatest enduring images of modern cinema (to rival Irène Jacob in Kieslowski's Trois Couleurs Rouge) as the score winds inexorably onwards throughout and in spite of Alice's passive demiseNonetheless, however, the film cannot maintain the highs of the action in the other scenes -- perhaps what prevents it from becoming a truly ""Great"" film. Though both thematic halves of the film are great, it is a shame that they are not more synthesised and fluid. Perhaps this is unavoidable in a film about war, where the pauses are long and the action sudden -- they are by nature antithetical. Unavoidable flaws, perhaps, but flaws nonetheless.",The Last of the Mohicans

365,dakana_vaia,A timeless classic 10/10 WARNING(This review contains spoilers),10,11 February 2002,"I thorougly enjoyed this film and it is most certainly my favorite. It is extremely well directed by Michael Mann and there is not one actress or actor in the film that, in my opinion, did not perform extremely well. The location of the settings were well chosen and extremely beautiful and the soundtrack was a haunting melody better than any other I have ever heard in a film. I enjoyed this even more than Braveheart (And I am not biased against Braveheart because I see it is a story, and not as anti-english propaganda like some). This film is a timeless classic filled with gut-wrenching action, a wonderful romance and on-the-edge battle scenes.I particularly admired the performance of Jodhi May (who was only 16 at the time of filming) as Alice Munro. Her perfomance was quite amazing, especially towards the end in the way that she said nothing, but the facial expressions were so real that one could just about believe that it was real and not just a story! This scene was the best of one of the best films I have ever seen and I have remembered it ever since. The music was an amazing haunting, celtic type during this scene and it fits perfectly when the beautiful Alice Munro falls to her death next to her lover. This has left me thinking about the character and her motives for doing this for some time and this entire film sticks in one's mind as a very good film should do. The perfomance of Daniel Day-Lewis and Cora was also gripping and excellent and Madeliene Stowe as Cora is one of the most beautiful actresses. My only gripe for Cora was that her English accent was a little now-you-see-it now-you-don't.I would give this film 11 out of 10 if it was possible. Read the book too- Although the film is quite different, James Fennimore Copper's classic is also a brilliant piece of work and I hope he would have been proud of this so excellent film. If films like Braveheart and Gladiator are you types of film, then watch this. 10/10",The Last of the Mohicans

I watched this film expecting an epic tale of adventure and found my self vomiting in my mouth for the sheer amount of putrid slush that ruins a film that could of been so much more. My father had briefly described the book and I was very intrigued but this film is awful. If you're looking for an adventure film, it's not what you want if you're looking for a BBC style Austen drama set in a war zone, who is?, it's exactly what you require.

372,newflo2,"The title is all, or modern day sex on Mann's frontier",5,25 June 2008,"During a lifetime spent viewing and talking about movies, my pet peeve has been those who compare movies to books and are congenitally incapable of seeing (that's SEEING) that a movie can be a good movie, even an outstanding one, without being a faithful retelling of the book on which it is based. (Two good examples, EAST OF EDEN and THE WIZARD OF OZ.) Unfortunately I saw Michael Mann's (and Christopher Crowe's) THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS immediately after reading the novel, and for the first time I find myself in the camp of those viewers and critics who make invidious comparisons.There is little left of James Fenimore Cooper but his title. As to characters: Major Heyward, so noble if a trifle stuffy in the book, is unaccountably made a first-rate sonofabitch. This turns him into an uninteresting person except for his last grand gesture. (SPOILERS AHEAD.) Even Munro, the girls' father, even played by charming Maurice Roeves, becomes a villain. But the most disturbing change is the personality of the hero as conceived by actor, director and writers. (Mann and Crowe credit the writers of the 1936 movie.) Cooper's Hawkeye is never arrogant. He is never condescending to frontier tenderfoots. He knows when he's right, and he's supremely confident; but he never needs to prove himself right; and he is never supercilious. In fact, he is scrupulously courteous. But even his name is altered for this movie. Is Daniel Day-Lewis too exalted for the homespun name of America's first superman, Natty Bumppo? I have always believed that if you are changing a good book what you do differently had better be as good, if not better, than what you are replacing -- or, at the least, be more appropriate for your medium. (Dorothy Johnson said she thought the changes made for the movie of her story THE HANGING TREE were improvements.) The point of these changes to Cooper's characters and plot escape me, and what this movie is about eludes me as well, unless it's about sex-ahead-of-its-time. No matter the danger, no matter who has just been brutally killed, hero and heroine always have time for a squeeze. And in crowded Fort William Henry they even find a place to screw as it's being bombarded by Montcalm and his artillery. And they do 20th century, American-movie bite kisses. At least we don't see her mounting HIM, and she stays off her knees. But what we do see of lovemaking is as anachronistic as the slow-motion photography and the over-meticulous effects which jar you away from the 18th century.And all this is less powerful than Cooper's original. There is the unforgettable moment in the novel when Cora realizes that the Indian Magua, to her astonishment, has sexuality, and that it is directed towards her. This is subtly done -- as it had to be at the time Cooper wrote -- and is all the more moving because it is.Madeleine Stowe is excellent as Cora in a quiet and subtle performance. Daniel Day-Lewis is much less interesting than usual because of the script that has him playing a wilderness snot whose main concern is women, or one woman, anyway. And while Chingachgook and Uncas are serviceably played by Russell Means and Eric Schweig, the characters lack the nobility and humanity which in Cooper's book caused us to care so much about them and made almost unbearable the death of Uncas (Cooper's but not the film's last of the Mohicans).Ignoring the novel, however, and taking the film on its own terms, I see this as one of the most over-rated movies of the last couple of decades.Addendum: Did Pete Postlethwaite especially want to be in this. Or was the rest of his now very small part edited out?",The Last of the Mohicans
373,salacious-loquacious,An astonishingly realised and beautifully crafted modern epic,10,23 November 2008,"Michael Mann's The Last of the Mohicans is often overlooked when lists of great movies are compiled but this is a film of such astonishing beauty and raw energy that it deserves to be reassessed. From the opening frame to the closing shots this modern epic satisfies on every level, resonating with heart and scale, drama and action. It is a film of haunting beauty and profound feeling with a pace that is unequalled in the genre. It positively oozes charisma.The cast disappear into their roles, and for a period film that is now over 15 years old there isn't the slightest hint of it dating. There is nothing superfluous here but nothing is left wanting either. This is a credit to the skill of the entire crew. Everything works - the locations, sets, costumes, editing, sound, music, tone, writing, direction, performances, everything. Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe generate chemistry with rich but scant material, while the other main players give such refined performances that the viewer is simply swept along. And this film is sweeping in every sense. Whatever the accuracy in comparison with the original text, this film becomes a text in its own right and is so delicately crafted and magnificently edited that the final scenes play with virtually no dialogue, and powerfully so. This has a lot to do with the stunning score - the last ten minutes demonstrating all aspects of cinema operating on the highest level - as it reinforces the primal beat and rhythm of the piece while still maintaining a colonial heart and hauntingly epic sweep.The Last of the Mohicans is a thrilling, fierce adventure tempered with attention to historical detail, heightened yet not melodramatic emotion and a sympathetic yet seethingly tense depiction of the time. An adventure epic with a lot of soul and heart. It's time for Mann to return to the epic genre and demonstrate once again what he can do as evidenced by this overlooked classic. Highly recommended.",The Last of the Mohicans
374,StGeorgeDragon,The first time i watched the film i never thought much of it..,10,24 October 2002,"But how wrong was i! I now consider this movie to be in my top 20 of all time. Maybe it was because i was 12 or 13 at the time and i never really understood it ( terminator and friday the 13th were more my style back then). The thing i like about this film is that it tells a more realistic tale of love and war then the likes of the patriot. There are no winners or heroes in the end just the destruction of innocent lives. Unlike the patriot and braveheart where we get this try hard ""us against the world"" mentality and ""we're the underdogs and the battlers fighting against oppression"" Last of the mohicans is about the plight of three totally different civilisations ( english, french and the natives) and their battles for the continent of America. One aspect of the movie i didn't like was the acting of Day Lewis. His heroic antics were a bit hard to put up with and very unrealistic given the situation, how many times did he show up just in time to avert disaster. That kind of acting belongs in the Mel Gibson inspired movies of braveheart and the patriot. His anti-British attitude is also very irritating. Best performances were from Stowe, May (although she didn't say much her acting towards the end of the movie is as good as you will see anywhere) and without a doubt Wes Studi as the brutal Magua was the best of them. I'm suprised this movie didn't recieve any major awards, there weren't many better than this one in 1992. I give it 8.5 out of ten.",The Last of the Mohicans

Of its many attributes, the two that stand out for me the most is the magnificent haunting music throughout and the strength of character shown by key actors. In life and at the movies, I am most moved by unstated integrity. By this I mean integrity and courage that appears as natural rather than conditioned by what someone thinks about and then does as the right thing to do. In this, I particularly thought that the lead role of Nathaniel, played by Daniel Day-Lewis was superb.The direction, casting and make-up were impressive and the photography near perfect. Though violence was depicted, it was never without reason. The hundreds of people involved in creating this movie classic deserve commendation. It will be enjoyed by people and go to their hearts for as long as films are watched.This film well deserved the Academy Award and the long list of other awards and accolades it received.

377,niallthegod2,review,10,17 March 2009,"The last of the Mohicans reviewMichael Mann's ""The Last of the Mohicans"" Based on a novel by James Fenimore Cooper, the movie tells the tale of Hawkeye , a white man raised by a clan of Native Americans called the Mohicans. there's only 3 of them left: Hawkeye, his adopted father Chingachgook , and his adopted brother Uncas . The film is set in the untamed American frontier during the British-French Wars of early 18th century, with both sides fighting for control of the n discovered American continent. Native Indians and colonists have been forced to pick sides, but Hawkeye and others have refused to join in, believing that the war has nothing to do with them. Things change when Hawkeye crosses path with English beauty Cora Munro and her sister Alice , the women are being escorted by Major Duncan Heyward to their father at the frontlines. After saving the women and Heyward from a bloody ambush engineered by the vengeful Magua, Hawkeye agrees to escort them to an English fort.Despite its good points ""the last of the Mohicans"" is still a better Romance-Adventure picture than it is an action/War movie. But there are numerous scenes of military battles, mostly at the siege of the English fort. Cannon fire and exploding muskets light up the night-time scenes, making the film an experience to watch. The cinematography by Dante Spinotti is brilliant, and the film's many scenes in the woods of Colonial America are ripped with beauty that many other films can not capture. The acting is also superb, which is a very good thing because the screenplay by Mann and Christopher Crowe is sometimes too plain for its own good, with a lot of romantic language that's better left to, well, romance novels but doesn't destroy the film. Thankfully the movie has a fine cast that manages to sell even the plain dialogue. Daniel Day-Lewis turns in a solid performance as Hawkeye. Madeleine Stowe , convinces us of the blossoming romance between her Cora and Hawkeye. The fact is, without these actor and actress the dialogue and screenplay just would work and it takes talent of this calibre to pull it off.For the most part the film Michael Mann has got it superb, although he seems to have a little trouble with the more bloody battle scenes. More than one occasion the film has a cheap feel, as if whole chunks of screens were removed. And despite being an 18, the film is nearly bloodless. Another point of ""the last of the Mohicans"" that works is the natural soundtrack. There is a constant drumy tune that plays throughout much of the exciting forest scenes, including the movie's final battle on the side of mountain and really gets you going "" go on kill him, run, run faster man"" well it did me even though I have watched it many times I still do it. An under rated and forgotten classic, ""The Last of the Mohicans"" ,is epic, great to look at, and Madeleine Stowe is almost as lovely as the scenery.

An old-fashioned adventure that's been given the attention it deserves with fantastic performances from all involved. Daniel Day-Lewis acts like he's been born into the time and the culture, Wes Studi is suitably malevolent as the Mohican's nemesis, Madeline Stowe and Jodhi May both feisty and intelligent as the two women caught up in the events of an empire's making.

Surprisingly in this case the movie was more enjoyable than the book for me. Where the film departs from the book only improves the storyline to my mind. Special mention must be made of the cinematography by Dante Spinnotti providing some breathtaking scenery at times.The film still holds up well despite being made in 1992 and to me it is a film I can watch many times without tiring of it.

The same feelings appears every time. This is a film that combines, a perfect mix of adventure, action, drama and romance, equally balanced and I assure you, it will crab you from the early beginning and drive you to the end to a very beautiful journey of mixed feelings. The indescribably, unbelievably exquisite music is I may say the ""salt and spices"" of the Last of the Mohicans, being not just an escort to the film but truly manages to lift it into something unique. The astonishing slow motion scenes, a silent action amalgamate, full of love, pain, courage, desperation and revenge towards the end, will make you feel like holding a tomahawk, a carbine and... I stop here, see the movie! Michael Mann surely did a great joband I hope he will be able to create such a masterpiece again in the future. Danny -as always- at his best. I really believe that this film wouldn't be what it is today if Danny (as usual) wasn't a part of it. Stowe (playing Cora) delivers a fine performance of elegance, beauty and passion altogether. Even supporting cast like Eric Schweig (Uncas-son) or Russell Means (Chingachgook-father) seems to be carefully selected as they all seem to give their best, look and act real while they help to the development of their characters.This part (The character-development, which I never really understood why ONLY this should be every time the element that defines a good and a bad movies, but anyway...) is sufficiently deep in my personal opinion. Afterall I don't think that you will spend not even a second during and MAINLY after the movie to even think if this is correct or not, or if this scene would be appropriate and etc... Damn, I now realize how difficult is to express your own feelings about a masterpiece that you loved and make others who haven't seen it yet, to run, rent/buy and watch it! But this is what a perfect movie (for me at least!) should probably make you feel. Finally, I really can't understand why it's not on the top 250, as on the same moment you can see there movies like Ratatouille, Hot Fuzz, American Gangster and etc. With respect to these good movies, I just can't accept the absence of Last of the Mohican -at least- in the top 250 of all time.

The actors and actresses did an incredible job and the music is simply amazing. The battle scenes were filmed with admirable ability and the violence is never excessive. Madeleine Stowe is great in the role of Cora, the older sister, mature and courageous; and so is Jodhi May as Alice, the younger sister, subtle and inexperienced. Also the actors are very good: in particular Russell Means(Chingachgook) and Eric Schweig(Uncas), because they are Natives and play their characters with truthfulness. Perhaps you believe that's a war movie, but I don't see it that way! I think LOTM is above all a movie about romance. The love between Cora and Hawkeye, two characters that seems very refractory to love, is a passionate love.

Special praise goes to Russell Means and Eric Schweig, who convey the dignity and decency of their characters with only the slightest of dialogue. Kudos, too, to Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe.

I turn a deaf ear to the 'tarzanesque' and wanton scenes of the first film minutes, but soon my body starts to become embittered when I see the ridiculous first ""action"" scene, a brawl which reminds to the Bruce Lee movies taking place in a world 300 hundred years younger. 'The Last of the Mohicans' introduces archetypal characters (the glorious hero, the beautiful princess, the unscrupulous villain), a predictable ending and a hardly sufferable development, spiced by a love story so sweetened that you want to turn off the screen. It was actually what I had to do at times —or at least, leaving somewhere else. In addition, the tear-jerking music during the dramatic key moments —such as tragic deaths or leaps into the void— produce laughter. Quo vadis, Daniel Day-Lewis?

Day-Lewis in great shape), while the two Mohicani friends, Chingachook and its Uncas son, act as co-stars. More than in past, the apex of the vicissitude is the besieges of Fort William Henry in which, during the Franco-British war of seven years (1756-63), English were defeated from preponderant French forces. Flaws and Weaknesses do not lack, but a lot has to be forgiven because it recreates an ancient sense of the adventure and of the great spaces, it gives back (also because of the color of Dante Spinotti and a huge sonorous column) the flavour of an age with the taste of an old press, and it has the ingenuous force of great feelings and characters all rounded. The film gives ""visual concreteness"" to the word ""ambush"" and holds faith to the beautiful image that was made from the manifesto: the agile Day-Lewis in race with tomahawk in fist and the long carabina on shoulder . A ""kinetic"" film of wide breath, with an end of cinematographic anthology.",The Last of the Mohicans
393,steve_v98,Wonderful atmospheric film,10,2 April 2007,"This film is all about the loss of innocence and the passing away of an older world under the influence of the growth of a global culture. I find the depiction of the war between the English and the French over the spoils of the wilderness of north America and its peoples, evokes strong emotions. The north Americans are by no means 'innocent' of the concepts of war, retribution and hate. But they were totally unprepared for the mechanised, industrial violence and betrayal that came with the Europeans to their land. And, of course, the Europeans, having used Indian against Indian in their struggles against each other, finally turned on the native peoples and wiped them out. Most have disappeared now, along with their forests, plains, animals and gods. So it may sound pretentious to say that a film like Last Of The Mohicans can 'represent' all of these events and emotions - but it does, and with its terrific musical score the pace never lags either. The way Hawkeye is shown as one of the very few Europeans who can comprehend the value of what north America was before the European invasion is very intelligent. He is wise but ultimately cannot affect the inevitable outcome of this monumental clash of cultures. Therein lies the immense sadness of the film and perhaps its uplifting side too, as even in the most tragic of circumstances it's shown that it's possible to find individual wisdom and heroism. When I first saw it I loved the story, the action, the score, the fine performances. You will too. Then see it again - give it a year or two to sink in first. You'll begin to see the many different levels at which it can be enjoyed.",The Last of the Mohicans
394,silentthunder464,The Best Movie Ever!!!!,10,24 January 2005,"By all means, this movie is the best movie ever made. Consisting of action, romance, adventure, drama, and suspense, this is the perfect movie. So much goes on from beginning to ending that it fills your heart with excitement, making you feel like if your heart is going to explode. My hat goes off to Daniel Day Lewis, whom's acting deserved every award possibly ever presented. Daniel Day Lewis was born to play this role. He is ""perfect"" in every aspect of the word. He's extremely handsome, ambitious, intelligent, talented, and did I say ""gorgeous""!! As mentioned before, no other actor would have filled Nataniel Poe's shoes the way DDL did. As for Eric Schweig and Russell Means, they also did an excellent job playing Uncas and Chingachgook. The talents expressed by this actors and the rest of cast were beyond sensational. Congratulations to Daniel Day Lewis, Eric Schweig, Russell Means, Madeleine Stowe, Wes Studi, on a job well done. It's a shame that a second part was never made, maybe it's for the best since this movie ended up being a masterpiece. I applaud Michael Mann for making this movie. Although this movie was released over 14 years ago, it still captures my interest as if i'm watching it for the first time again.",The Last of the Mohicans

396,jordy_doyon,My favorite movie ever!,10,7 April 2006,"This movie is by far better than the book for many reasons.Hawkeye, in the book, is the dog of the British. He is a scout and is called throughout the whole book as being a scout. From which the surprise of the audience when Hawkeye of the movie told Heyward: ""I ain't your scout. And we sure ain't no damn militia."" Ironically, Hawkeye of the book rejects the white civilization while helping the ones who spread it. In the novel, Hawkeye is friendly with Colonel Munro and join him to find back Alice and Cora. In the movie, Hawkeye seems totally heroic by standing his ground against the evil and uncompromising Colonel Munro. The Hawkeye of the movie looks smart, independent and does not follow anybody, on the contrary of the Hawkeye of the novel. Hawkeye of the novel does not feel love for any woman; in fact, he does not understand the feeling between men and women, which makes no sense, unless he is gay. Hawkeye of the novel is still a great hero, but is not willing to sacrifice as much as in the movie.Uncas falls in love with Cora in the novel, while Duncan loves Alice. Since Hawkeye or Nathaniel is the protagonist, it is normal that he should have a love story too, while he got none in the novel. That is why in the movie, a love triangle is created between Cora, Hawkeye and Duncan, which create a lot of tension. In the movie, Uncas rather loves Alice, which seems more normal, since they are about the same age (both in the novel and in the movie). In the book, Uncas and Cora both die, but in the movie, both Uncas and Alice die. It is better like this, since it is sad to see them both die, but we are relieved to see that Hawkeye and Cora survived.I like the character of Heyward of the movie. He is a gentleman and is sometime seen as an antagonist, but we later realize that he was misunderstood. He is a soldier, after all, and definitely not a coward. It is normal that he wants to punish Hawkeye for sedition. The sacrifice he gives at the end of the movie shows his worth. It is a good way to redeem himself. In the novel, nothing of that happens.In the novel, Magua's story is elaborated. He had an alcohol problem and was wiped by Colonel Munro, thus he wants his revenge. In the movie, to simplify all his long and complicated story, Magua just says that he lost his wife and that his children were killed by the British army.The scene of the waterfall does not happen at the same time in the novel and in the movie. In the novel, this scene happens at the beginning and is ineffective, since Hawkeye and Cora are not in love. In the movie, this scene happens later, so Hawkeye and Cora had the time to fall in love. Since he loves Cora, Hawkeye does not want to leave her to the Huron. Also, the annoying singer of the novel has been removed. It was better like this, since the singer had no key role in the plot. After, the tribe of the Delaware in the book has been removed. It is much more entertaining to see Hawkeye face the whole Huron tribe alone. In the book, he rather fights the Huron with the Delaware.The most impressive scene of the movie is when the British army is attacked by the Huron. In the movie only, Hawkeye, Uncas and their father save Alice and Cora. In the book, they don't save Alice and Cora. This scene is heroic and the greatest of all.I recommend the director's cut, since the rhythm is better and the last and best quote of the movie is not cut out (the one from Chingachgook). ""Then our race will be no more, or be not us."" Of course, it is an American movie, made for Americans, thus Americans must not be the bad guys. If that great quote had been said in the theatrical version, the American audience would have felt guilty for what Americans have done to Native Americans. No, it is better for them if the bad guys are the British, the French and the Hurons. Also, the movie is way better on DVD, don't watch it on VHS. The landscapes must fit in the screen. The director's cut is more elaborated, since the introduction describes the setting: ""It is the third year of war between France and England for possession of the continent."" This is not written in the theatrical version, thus the audience probably had trouble understanding. Stupid Fox!",The Last of the Mohicans

398,j-ribera,"Great Drama, but not true to the novel",10,17 March 2005,"This was great cinema, but not the story of the Last of the Mochicans as crafted 200 years ago by James Fenimore Cooper. The characters exhibited traits more commonly attributed to the archetypes that was held in Cooper's day. Major Heyward was a good guy from the start, not some nancy, blustering ""red coat"" with anti-colonist leanings. In love with Alice (the frail, blonde one) from the start, not the dark haired Cora. Uncas loved the dark one, not the blond one, who was stabbed to death by one of Magua's crew, while he was dispatching the reckless Uncas. Hawkeye (Natty Bumppo) was a middle-aged (for the time), non-romantic woodsman with a good rifle, who had no feelings for anyone other than Chengachgook and Uncas his Indian blood brothers. He was a supporter of King and country and the white race (actually a bit of a bigot where bloodlines were considered), not a free-thinking, he-man as portrayed by Daniel Day-Lewis. Magua is probably the only one portrayed accurately (with respect to the novel) he was purely, and unremittingly evil. Wes Studi nailed it.",The Last of the Mohicans

It is loaded with intense and magnificent scenery, and the music!!!!! The music is the heart and soul of this film and absolutely wonderful. This is a film where the music and the pictures tells a fairly simple story in a grand way. Daniel Day does a great job of showing his characters mixture of white heritage and Indian upbringing, cultivated in ""reverent wheelers school"", and Madeline Stowe is as always the innocent looking woman with a lot of depth.

Two romances, multiple action scenes, conflict, death and a unique central character. I quite like DDL in his other performances, but here he was so unlike Hawkeye in every way. No humility, quick to anger, lustful and arrogant. Heyward was unlikeable, Cora lacked depth, while Alice, Uncas and Chingachgook were dull and forgettable.The changes in the romances were unnecessary as was the introduction of the militia storyline. This took up time that could have been spent developing the characters so we actually cared when any of them died.

If you want to see a film that encompasses everything that is great about cinema then I recommend this movie as it is easily the greatest one of the 1000's of movies I have seen in my life. It delivers on every level and is the only movie I can say that has a perfect beginning, middle, ending, soundtrack, casting, setting, background, with perfect directing and acting. It has enough substance to its plot to make 3 or 4 movies just by the depth in story line alone, that's not taking into consideration the incredible acting, the beautifully crafted character development and the spectacular attention to historical detail portrayed throughout. There is no one star in this film, there are many. There is no one scene that defines it, the whole film is a work of beauty.

406,creepyphish,A man a woman and lost of action,9,15 December 2005,"Lasting impressions The cinematography was excellent because the action scenes were not ""super human"" they were ""real"" and the camera angles complemented the emotions of the actors and the surrounding situations. When the Indian warriors were engaged in hand to hand combat there was no drawn out flashy choreography, it realistic and brutal. To show the emotion of the actors at moments of intense drama the camera was very close in to establish personal feeling for the actors. Most action scene were mid-shots to extreme close even in a scene were you may want to see the action the camera was close to the faces. I was on the edge of my seat during every action scene and I enjoyed in drama I felt a degree of ambivalence when certain characters were killed because if felt like I knew them on a personal level or I may feel like I was them. The director, I think did a good job of building relation ships with the audience and the actors in a short period of time. He was able to reveal that history of the individuals in a way that was personal.After observing this film several times I couldn't help but notice the way each scene was approached in a way that enabled a smooth transaction from the relatively lengthy dolly shoots into the intense action scenes. This also made a devastating impact on how the characters interacted with each other and how they viewed each other; for instance when the British officer was talking to the Indian scout. The officer was on a horse and on the right side making him appear dominant to the Indian; not only that but yet another example, when the officer was being led by Hawkeye to the fort. They were walking from the left while in the background a raging river flowed against the way the characters were walking, symbolizing the struggles they would encounter and the flood of events that lay on the horizon. The action in the movie was not superficial in the way that some action adventure films are made. Even in the movie ""The Patriot"" the fight scenes tended to have a scene of mysticism that the brutal fighting and rigid choreography of ""Last of the Mohicans"" did not have. the extreme solidity of the motions pertained to real life combat. The choreography and the special effects department must have work tirelessly to show the rawness of the French and Indian war. Nobody was flying through the air and punching each others heads off. It was grounded hand to hand fighting. In the battle field scene they used real people and not digital effects most of the extras were professional re-en-actors.In the action scenes despite choreography the camera was kept close to the actor's face, now and then it will go to a mid shot or a full shot. This technique allows the actors to show the emotion with their faces, as in the silent film era, forcing the audience to feel the same feelings or contrary ones. Talking all this into account we see a very expressive style of filming but it still contains equal contrast with wide shots and tight shots, so the viewer doesn't feel like the actors are in his or her face the whole time. Still the viewer makes a connection with the characters. The audience can live the adventure with the characters.",The Last of the Mohicans

409,Dawnnnn,Who wrote all these excellent reviews have probably never read the novel,3,23 June 2021,"I'm going to make some major spoilers in this review, so, if you've never seen the film, I recommend not to read it.So, 1 star is for the unquestionably beautiful soundtrack of this film, the second star is for the legendary (and forever Indian!) Sir Wes Studi and the third star is for the stunning landscape shootings. The rest, in my opinion, is definitely not worth the too many 10 star ratings I've seen on this and many other websites... but I think there's a reason for them. I'm pretty sure that everyone who appreciated this film so much have actually never read the novel, because, let's be honest: who did, knows perfectly what is wrong with this film.Personally, I read the novel first and I completely fell in love with it! I simply couldn't stop reading it as the story was so engaging and immersive. When I arrived at the end of the book, I cried my eyes out for the emotion! So I eventually decided to watch the film, which seemed to be one of the most appreciated of it time. No wonder - I thought - with a great actor like DDL and such an amazing soundtrack like this, it must be a masterpiece! So one day, I found it on Netflix and decided to watch it and I can't explain how excited I was!Sadly, my expectations were abruptly disappointed. I could list several reason why this film is completely below expectations, but I will limit myself to list the two major reasons in my opinion: 1. The plot, 2. The characters.If you expect - as I did - to watch a faithful transposition of the 1826 novel by J. F Cooper, just forget about it. Indeed, since cinema was born, several transpositions were made of this book, 12 in total; I haven't watched all of them, but apparently, for some reasons, none of them reflects the actual plot of the novel, and the 1992 version, despite being the most recent one as well as the most appreciated one, does no better work than the previous versions. One of the main differences regards the romance between Cora Munro and Hawkeye, which is actually absent in the novel, but it's pretty suitable to a blockbuster... isn't it? A brave, charming, vigorous man with a beautiful and tenacious young woman... a romance that may appeal even a slice of cucumber, of course! But seriously, is it always necessary to ""put the romance in it""? Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm convinced the romance between Hawkeye and Cora has just been an excuse to appeal the audience, especially the female part of it.The author J. F. Cooper already provided a beautiful romance in his novel, that actually did not regard the protagonist of the story, but two secondary characters instead. In this film, the original romance is deleted in favour of a more intriguing one, which, however, has probably forced the director to cut out many more important aspects of the story, including the psychological deepening and development of the characters, but I will get to this one point later. Also, if you decide to change the plot of a classic novel, you have to make sure to make it work. You have to make sure that your changes ADD something to the story... but this is not the case. Indeed, Hawkeye and Cora's romance becomes soon the centre of the story, and all the rest literally gravitates around it, but action film director Michael Mann is probably not used to portrait romances, so that everything about this - supposedly emotional - love story seems unrealistic, unengaging and unlikely. Let's just say that they basically fall in love after a five minute conversation under a starry sky... I'm not joking, that's actually how it happens! The result is a forced and maybe too fast romance between two characters that, in the author's intention, were actually perfect on their own.I don't want to get into details, but this film really misses the point in my opinion. Even Hawkeye's attitude is completely distorted. There's no way the character portrayed by (the talented) DDL could resemble the original Hawkeye... let's just note that the Hawkeye of the novel would have never dated a woman, for the sake of his values and his uncompromising principles!Don't misunderstand my words, It's not in my intention to judge the director Michael Mann, who I'm not familiar with at all; in fact, he seems to actually be famous for directing some pretty successful movies. I just think that this film was evidently not his best work, that's all.In all this, the - according to the novel - kind, honest and brave Major Hayward, unfortunately becomes an obnoxious, nasty character that no one would ever relate to! What I personally loved about the Hayward of the book is the fact that, in a first time, he is the most underestimated one: he is considered the weak one, the incompetent one, but he eventually turns out to be the most willing character, and it's impossible not to fall in love with him! So I found it pretty sad that the director decided to change his attitude for the worse.Another major difference with the novel: Hayward is in love with Cora, not with Alice, so that the woman is contended between him and the way more pleasant Hawkeye... there's no blockbuster without love triangle, uh? The poor little Alice eventually ends up - or at least should be supposed to end up - with... Uncas? The idea could even be intriguing, after all, except that the director fails again in portraying a credible love story. Indeed, for the whole film there's no sign of attraction between these two characters, only at the end, you would see a mutual exchange of glances that inevitably makes you wonder... wait, why is this even happening? They have barely talked to each other until now! - How they happen to fall in love is still a mystery to me.Fight scenes are fine, at least. They look very realistic. It is evident that Michael Mann is more used to this genre, rather than love story.Now, let's talk about the characters. Who read the novel KNOWS how DEEP J. F. Cooper goes when he describes his characters. When you finish the book, you have a very clear idea of the personality of each character and become attached to each of them. This is probably the most beautiful thing about the novel.Well, what happens in the movie is basically the exact opposite. Unfortunately, the director wasn't able to deepen the inner self of the characters, not even the main ones! The result is a film full of great special effects, endless landscapes, engaging war scenes, an emotional soundtrack... but still, hopelessly gaunt and soulless. Indeed, there are these two characters: Chingachgook and Uncas, which are main characters in the novel, but end up being secondary characters in the film. They are the closest thing to a family for Hawkeye and both have decisive roles in the book. Chingachgook is Uncas' father, he is ""the wise one"" as well as the oldest man of the group; when you read the novel you can really feel the weight of his words, always driven by his own wisdom, never by impetus... there is just a remote suggestion of all this in the movie: one of the deepest characters is hopelessly reduced to a stereotyped background figure. Same thing happens to Uncas, the youngest of the group, or - as he is supposed to be remembered - ""The last of the Mohicans"".Note that, at the end of the novel, when Uncas dies, as I already said, I cried like there was no tomorrow, because I truly grew fond to that character, while at the end of the film, I knew what was happening, but his role was so poor that I literally felt nothing! The point is, you see this one person dying and his loved ones mourning him, but you can't participate to their pain because you don't really know who he was! This is one of the weakest points of this film in my opinion.It's the end of the movie, finally, but again, even in very last seconds, plot twist is around the corner. The director gives a brand new interpretation of the title: not Uncas, but Chingachgook is ""The last of the Mohicans"", as his only son has died. I have nothing against this choose, I mean, I just don't like the fact that the story underwent so many changes but still kept the original title of the novel. In my humble opinion, this is not ""The last of the Mohicans"", it could be considered a good story though, but it's a different story, it should not have kept the original title. Just this.Also, as I already said, I don't want to get into more detail of what I disliked about this film, but there are some other things that need to be noted, because as I read in other reviews, I was not the only one experiencing certain difficulties while watching the movie, indeed, I often found myself getting lost and wondering ""wait, where are they now? What's happening exactly?"". I personally had a very hard time following the sequence of the events. I thought it was me, but it was comforting to know that many other people out there had the same issue. The director was not very good in organizing the scenes, as they often appear very confusional, so that the whole narration results unengaging and hardly comprehensible to the audience.Naturally, there are also some little things I appreciated too and that deserve to be mentioned: let's say the soundtrack first, which is a pearl of rare beauty, in my opinion. No wonder the film won an Oscar for sound. It is probably overused in the movie because you would hear it playing in the background every five minutes, but it's still enjoyable. Then, the very realistic war scenes and setting in general, as well as the beautiful landscapes that truly reminded me of the endless frontier as described in the novel.Someone would say my review is not objective because it is mostly based on the differences between novel and film, but when it's about a transposition of a great novels, - or a literary classic - making a comparison is inevitable. Of course there are films that are even better and more enjoyable than the related novels, but, in my opinion, - despite many would say the opposite - this is definitely not the case.",The Last of the Mohicans

He would have me be a romantic like the youth of civilized folk with similar complexion, but I confess that's not much in my nature (at least not until I was given the cognomen, Pathfinder), and to deviate from that is pleasing to those who might enjoy the story, but not to the truth of the matter. Any director of a picture has the liberty to turn a story from its course, this way and that, as long as it honors the threaded path of the storyteller to the extent that the entire fabric is still recognizable.

412,Musical_Rocky,A visually thrilling movie whose attempts at Romanticism fall short at times,7,12 September 2008,"The Last of the Mohicans is a book written by James Fenimore Cooper in the 1800's. The novel upon which this film was based was part of the Romantic era, and so director Michael Mann evidently tried to bring that spirit and character of the time on screen. However, the film The Last of the Mohicans is a somewhat loose translation of the book, and sometimes the so-called ""Romantic"" touches are no more than dramatic appeals to modern audiences.There are many things that may have worked in the romantic era, but in this day and age can seem essentially ""cheesy,"" especially on film. There is one scene in which Hawkeye, Daniel Day-Lewis' main character, stares at his romantic interest, Cora, provoking the question: ""What are you looking at, sir?"" to which he responds, ""I'm looking at you, miss."" What kind of response is that? This type of dialogue suggests a liberal departure from history, however Mann seems to try to ground the film in history and a trueness to that period. There lies the contradiction, and from it the feeling of cheesiness. Further, Mann also employs wide, sweeping shots of the surrounding nature in which much of the film is set. While true to the Romantic ideal of reverence for nature, after a while one does start to think, ""All right, the setting has been established, how about a little more intimacy with the actual characters?"" Although, it must be admitted: backgrounds of waterfalls and palates of beautiful, green forests give the film a boost and even realism.It would be difficult to be true to romantic characteristics while trying to appeal to modern audiences. There can't be a ten-minute monologue in which Hawkeye explains to a companion exactly how he is tracking the British soldiers. Modern audiences just wouldn't care. Thankfully, Mann has the sense not to do anything of the sort. He delicately balances Romantic idealism and Hollywood blockbuster standard. The screen is blasted with gunshots, shooting arrows, flying cannons, and explosions galore, and while some of the battles may not have been so dramatic-and gory-it certainly does make the heart race in a good way.Now, how do the actors themselves stand in all this? Day-Lewis does a fine job portraying that resourceful, culturally-mixed, almost unapproachable, and All-American hero. He knows when to poke at the humor, as well as he knows how to stir the heartstringsor play out the drama in a fight sequence. What can one say? This is the kind of role made for Day-Lewis. Madeleine Stowe strongly plays his woman, Cora Munro. She plays the kind of woman who can take charge and, most importantly, grab the interest of the audience. Bringing out the strength of women in the time period, she is a fine supporting actress to the hero Hawkeye. Their romance may be a little corny, but it provides a nice side story for the film. Besides, what's a film based on a Romantic novel without a little romance? Editing is right-on, clearly bringing out the intended pace of the essentially ""war film."" We don't have too many ""conversation scenes"" before we are thrown into a battle again, which keeps the blood pumping but also allows some story and depth to be woven into the product. Mann was clearly an experienced director who knew what he wanted and how to get there.All in all, should you watch this movie? Well, what are you looking for? Just a couple of hours to zone out to mindless violent battles? You may be a little bored at times. A timeless romance about an American-Indian and half-Scottish women who meet in the battlefield? You might be a little disappointed, though intrigued at parts. How about a film about a war that tries to be historically accurate but also can entertain with some artistry and modernity? Sit back and enjoy.",The Last of the Mohicans
