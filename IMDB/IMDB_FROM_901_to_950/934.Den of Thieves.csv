0,Leofwine_draca,Surprisingly decent bank heist thriller,7,27 October 2018,"DEN OF THIEVES is a surprisingly decent bank heist thriller, a new addition to a genre that's been going since the 1950s. I enjoy the oldies and I enjoy the new ones too, and this one doesn't disappoint. After a slightly awkward opening that nonetheless features a top action scene, we move into a slow burning plot that involves the usual parallels between heroes and villains. HEAT is an obvious inspiration here and DEN OF THIEVES suffers a little from the comparison; a way overlong running time doesn't help much either. What I did like was that the characters are more fleshed out than usual for the genre, with Gerard Butler's deadbeat county sheriff a particular blessing. Inevitably the heist itself is the highlight and it's an extended, extensive moment, superbly directed to wring every drop of tension from the premise. The ending offers spectacular and gritty action, plus a twist that sets up the forthcoming sequel. I loved it.",Den of Thieves
1,SnoopyStyle,muscles and guns,6,2 December 2018,L.A. is the capital of bank robberies. A heavily armed crew led by Ray Merrimen (Pablo Schreiber) steals an armored truck. Police Detective Nick O'Brien leads the Major Crimes unit in charge of the investigation. He is perplexed that the truck is reported to be empty. The squad kidnaps suspect Donnie Wilson (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) who reveals that he was recruited by the crew to be their driver.Everybody is playing hard-body acting while showing off their muscles and guns. It tries to be Heat but this is a B-movie version. Nick's home difficulties have too much prominence and the movie spends too much time on it. The movie is over two hours long and it doesn't need that. This should be a shorter hard-nosed action thriller. It's got enough gun action. It's got plenty of hard-body posing and grunt acting. It's got a fair bank robbery caper. It's just too long.,Den of Thieves
2,claudio_carvalho,The Bank Robbery Capital of the World,7,29 April 2018,"""Den of Thieves"" is an entertaining crime film with the showdown of Los Angeles County Sheriff ""Big Nick"" O'Brien and his team, and the criminal Ray Merrimen and his skilled gang of bank robbers. The plot is full of action and twists and the identity of the mastermind is a great surprise. The pace is perfect and the viewer does not feel the 140 minutes running time. The shootout recalls ""Heat"" and O'Brien´s personal drama with his wife is pointless and only a filler in the story. ""Den of Thieves"" is not a film for intellectuals and the target audiences will be very satisfied. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Covil de Ladrões"" (""Den of Thieves"")",Den of Thieves
3,nogodnomasters,We're the bad guys,7,28 January 2018,"Ray Merrimen (Pablo Schreiber) has been out of prison for eight months, gets the gang back together and manages to steal an empty security van and kills a cop in the process. In comes Big Nick (Gerard Butler) a modern day ""Dirty Harry"" who doesn't play by the rules. Who and why would anyone steal an empty armor car?? The film becomes a battle of bullets and wit. Worth seeing once. Will blend into the rest of the crime-drama-action films. Mild humor. Guide: F-word. Implied sex. No nudity.",Den of Thieves
4,kosmasp,Criminal Squad,9,5 September 2018,"That's the German title of the movie - literally, not translated into English. I like Den of Thieves better, but whatever helps selling a movie, right? But back to this, because apart from changing the title, Germany also got an international version of the movie which was way shorter than the one that played in America (over 20 minutes) - add to that another couple of minutes that were added to the Directors cut that came out and you have half an hour.Fortunately that all got remedied when the Blu Ray came out and I got to see the whole version. And it really is a treat. Comparing it to Heat may feel like a cheat to some, but the shooutouts are there. The comraderie is there. And I guess you can see Butler and Schreiber as good opposites. But there is another element to it, which I won't talk about, which you'll probably like a lot. There is of course a chance you despise it for that, but I embraced it.Good acting too, especially for an action packed movie like this. 150 minutes fly by like that. There may be a lack of likeable characters or rather a lot of despicable things that are being done, by bad and (supposedly) good guys - but the movie gets away with it",Den of Thieves
5,classicsoncall,"""We're cop killers now.""",6,1 October 2020,"Personally, the story made little sense to me the moment Merriman (Pablo Schreiber) instructed Donnie (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) to tip off Big Nick (Gerard Butler) when their bank heist was going down. The stripper who set up Nick to run into Merriman in his own apartment? That was just bizarre. And for Nick to antagonize Merriman on the shooting range? This is just about the only action film where I was almost rooting against the good guy because Nick did anything and everything to prove just how big a jerk he was.Now the bait and switch with the armored truck business looked pretty clever. As did the bank robbery to throw suspicion away from the federal building heist. But if Nick's persistent gaze at the manhole cover where the bad guys made their getaway was so concerning, why didn't he put a detail on it to wait them out? This was all very sloppy and a major distraction from the credibility of the story.As for the sub-plot regarding Nick's marriage woes, that was left dangling with no real resolution, even if he did sign the divorce papers. So in effect, it didn't really need to take up space in the picture. This could have been a whole lot better with a bit more thought put into the screenwriting and applying a sniff test to some of the scenarios I mentioned. But if you need a good tip on where to buy men's suits, just go with Nick's shop where they sell at three for a hundred bucks. It doesn't get better than that.",Den of Thieves
6,Quinoa1984,"a highly successful debut, especially for a January release",8,6 February 2018,"Den of Thieves is a good example of a filmmaker taking inspiration visually and with the entire setting and mood and pitting of two sides - it's Heat, alright, it's damn Heat - and it actually being a strong effort. Christian Gudegast, who co-wrote and directed this 140 minute tribute to mandom in its bullet-flying, hard-drinking, muscle-bound weight-lifting tattooed uber-machismo, makes his debut as director here, and while it can never really live up to what Michael Mann did with his piece of ""Guy"" cinema, it also doesn't come with its high expectations and overly grandiose sense of epic pretention (and I don't mean that as a put down exactly for Heat, but... it is a movie very full of its importance, anticipated actor team-up besides). Den of Thieves cares about what it's trying to do, and that can go a long way for me in a world where a lot of filmmakers just come in and are lazy AF.It's the over-long (by at least ten minutes) take on Los Angeles grit and it hearkens to a tradition of heist movies with tough criminals and tough cops. Melville of course this ain't, but I might hope that some plucky 17 or 18 year old growing in love with movies finds this in a near-empty February cineplex (or, in a few months, on any video platform) and may be inspired to seek out more. It's Gerard Butler vs Pablo Schrieber (with O'Shea Jackson Jr fully in the mix as the driver for the latter's crew, fully making a mark for himself not just as Ice Cube Jr, though the resemblance certainly helps at least at first), and it's unapologetic about its characters. This isn't to say that the movie necessarily *endorses* how they behave, at least I'd hope not. I do think the filmmaker does find this tough and exciting and hopes we will too. Does he indulge a bit much? Well, let's say that 50 Cent confronting his daughter's prom date is so 'on the cutting room floor' ready it's puzzling why it's here past a probably final cut (or maybe no one really cared as it's an under-the-radar middle-budget January release)But the direction, how Gudegast and his camera operators move the compositions and know how to frame people and make a mood for a scene, is good. Really good. Maybe to that point where I could kind of forget about Christopher Nolan's own homaging in past films, though without the same sense of coherent visual grammar as this guy here (not to say he's *better* than Nolan, let's not get into that discussion). The point is that in the script and in how he directs the actors - most especially Butler, who I've never had any strong affinity for (sometimes disliked his attempts to be tough that come off lame in other films), but taps into a character he gives a damn about, his many, many warts and horrible parts and all - he is trying to craft a genuinely gripping story, which involves a plot to rob the Federal Reserve counting room in LA, and does so.Again, some of this can be chalked up to low expectations, but I always like to go into crime films, especially the heist sub-genre, with all the hope and good will that I can afford as a fan. This filmmaker is a fan, and not an obnoxious one which is a key distinction. There aren't attempts at any sort of deeper commentary about how the cops or criminals operate, but that's okay; we just have to accept Butler's Nick and his wild bunch of ""bad"" cops have carved their own hardcore niche out (they're not entirely corrupt persay, just dirty and full of sh***t folks), and yet there's enough to understand how the criminals operate too, that they're largely either ex-Marines or ex sports aspirants. I'm not a hundred percent sure how close it hews to real life, but it creates its own reality.... a bloody, beefy, characters-sometimes-saying-homophobic crap group of people.This doesn't mean that it has some kind of grand artistic pedestal to stand on, and I thought of a couple of plot-holes that were glaring in relation to what Nick and his cops would/wouldn't tell the people working in the Fed Reserve building given that they saw Donnie go in as the ""Chinese food guy"" to keep an eye out for. But if you like movies that are largely intelligently made, care about putting in a modicum of work into creating characters and relationships and, sure, even giving Nick a couple of kids taken away from him and so on etc (and that does work, surprisingly so), this hits the spot. At least it did for me.",Den of Thieves
7,searchanddestroy-1,A not so bad Heat rip-off.,8,26 February 2018,"It is so obvious that this helium inflated grabe B movie - more than two hours and twenty minutes, that's a big deal for a B movie - but grabe B anyway, is one more HEAT rip off, same basic scheme - even the cops dialogues when they arrive on the settings of the first heist, the armored truck steal; the heats argue about the manner the robbers chose the place to rob the van, the proximity of the motorway to escape and so on...Remember, you had the same dialogues in Michael Mann's masterpiece. One more main thing in common, the gunfight scènes, which are here absolutely AWESOME. The director emphasized much on this aspect and made a good job. For the rest, I repeat, this feature remains a damned good B picture concerning the directing, characters portraits and so on...NOTHING TO DO with Pacino and De Niro performances. But this was the first director's film. I wait for the sequel!!!
One more thng : I did not know that the Police was in charge of the Federal Reserve security. I thought this was the job of a private company.
 The USUAL SUSPECT ending manner is also so obvious related to the Bryan Singer's movie.",Den of Thieves
8,zardoz-13,"""Heat"" Meets ""The Town"" with ""The Usual Suspects""",9,24 January 2018,"An audacious, white-knuckled, adrenaline-laced, cops and robbers' crime thriller with a twist ending, writer & director Christian Gudegast's ""Den of Thieves,"" pits a loose cannon L.A. County Sheriff's Department detective against a crackerjack team of gunmen shaped in the crucible of combat while serving as soldiers in the Middle East. These nonconformist warriors came home, clashed with the law, and survived the purgatory of prison to emerge as an elite gang angling for the big score before they retreat into obscurity. The lead in ""300"" and ""Olympus Has Fallen,"" Gerard Butler turns in a strong performance as an obsessive cop struggling with marital woes. Pablo Schreiber of ""13 Hours"" commands the villains. He matches wits with Butler in a lively cat and mouse game where survival is the prize and a cold slab in a morgue is the penalty for those who stray from the straight and the narrow. 50 Cent fans may not recognize a buffed up Curtis James Jackson III.""Den of Thieves"" reminded me of Michael Mann's bank robbery movie ""Heat"" (1995) where Al Pacino's rugged cop tangled with Robert De Niro's hard-nosed bank robber in a high stakes showdown. The difference between ""Den of Thieves"" and ""Heat"" is Butler displays little respect for his adversaries. Meantime, the villains have a few tricks up their sleeves that nobody, especially armchair detectives, may be prepared for at fadeout. Although he makes his debut as a director, Christian Gudegast has already established his bonafides as a genre specialist with not only the Vin Diesel thriller ""A Man Apart,"" but also Butler's ""London Has Fallen,"" the gung-ho sequel to ""Olympus Has Fallen."" Butler is at his best as a tough-guy protagonist, and his gritty performance compares strongly with Gene Hackman's Oscar-winning portrayal of an unorthodox, hard-as-nails, NYPD detective in the 1972 Best Picture ""The French Connection."" A wry sense of humor pervades this 140-minute, R-rated opus, but it never undercuts the gravity of the action. Mind you, a fourth quarter glitch in credibility threatens to unravel the plausibility of plot. Nevertheless, Gudegast and ""Prison Break"" creator and co-scribe Paul Scheuring have worked out meticulously the logistics of this far-fetched caper. They conclude it with an out-of-left-field finale like Bryan Singer's ""The Usual Suspects"" (1995) that wowed everybody. If you like your heist thrillers served up with lots of testosterone, tense 'snap, crackle, pop' firefights, and obstinate adversaries who refuse to flee, ""Den of Thieves"" is your ticket.Nick Flanagan (Gerard Butler of ""London Has Fallen"") runs a squad tasked with bank robberies. His guys could be mistaken for stone-cold, Russian mafia gunsels. They are unkempt, and their arms are engraved with tattoos. They have no qualms about violating rules. Everything is fair once they ""click"" off their safeties. Nick's free-for-all lifestyle doesn't harmonize with his wife, Debbie (Dawn Olivieri of ""The Wolverine""), and her dreams of middle-class domesticity with their two elementary school age daughters. Naturally, they don't understand why she walks out on their father. As the film unfolds, ""Den of Thieves"" presents statistics that classify Los Angeles as ""the bank robbery capital of the world"" with a hold-up every 48 minutes. Basically, Gudegast's epic is a West coast version of Ben Affleck's ""The Town"" (2005), where Boston boasted more bank robbers per capita than any other city. Meanwhile, Merrimen (Pablo Schreiber) has assembled a posse of heavily-armed, former Marines, who have matriculated through prison after returning stateside. They carry out their crimes with a military precision. Those plans hit a snag when they approach an armored car after dark outside a donut shop. A hail of bullets erupts like Armageddon descending. An innocent bystander lives to tell the authorities that he saw masked shooters lay down a barrage on the guards. Later, after he arrives at the scene, Nick plunders a sprinkled donut from a box that one of the guard's dropped during the massacre.Gudegast doesn't give the audience a chance to get comfortable. Upfront without any delay, he stages a violent, night-time attack on an armored car as if he were imitating ""Black Hawk Down."" The villains mow down the off-duty guards, steal their armored car, and then stash it safely out of sight. They send somebody back to photograph the various law enforcement personnel at the crime scene. Merrimen isn't happy one of their own lies sprawled dead in it. Eventually, Nick suspects Merrimen may be the ringleader. Unfortunately, the police don't have enough evidence to arrest him. They stake Merriman out and search for accomplices. They abduct an African-American, Donnie (O'Shea Jackson Jr. of ""Straight Outta Compton""), who tends bar where Merrimen drinks. The two show up in surveillance snaps. Nick interrogates Donnie in a motel where his deputies are having a party. Primarily, Nick is interested in Merrimen, and Donnie confesses he serves just as a getaway driver. Merrimen confides nothing in him. Donnie heaves a sigh of relief when Nick turns him loose. Meantime, Donnie doesn't share the incident with Merrimen. Merrimen unveils their master plan. They have decided to liberate $30-million in clean currency from the fortress-like branch of the L.A. Federal Reserve Bank! The gauntlet of security checkpoints and surveillance cameras that they must contend with makes ""Den of Thieves"" look like a Tom Cruise ""Mission Impossible"" cliffhanger.Apart from a domestic strife scene when Nick fails to reason with his wife, ""Den of Thieves"" shifts back and forth between the sheriffs and the robbers. Gudegast emphasizes the professionalism on both sides. Merrimen's gunmen shoot only those who shoot at them. Furthermore, the bad guys orchestrate a multifaceted heist that involves them infiltrating the Federal Reserve and looting it smack under the nose of the guards. Suddenly, brazen Nick blows his cover and approaches Donnie and Merrimen in a restaurant and lets them know about him. This is Nick's way of going off the reservation that spikes the suspense. Surprises and revelations ensue. ""Den of Thieves"" is ""Heat""/""The Town"" laced with ""The Usual Suspects.""",Den of Thieves

10,view_and_review,They followed the heist movie formula,5,6 July 2018,"A gang of a-hole cops hunt down a gang of slightly less a-hole robbers. Honestly, the only thing separating the L.A. Sheriffs--led by the biggest tool Nick O'Brien (Gerard Butler)--is that the Sheriffs had badges. Quite literally in looks, language, and behavior the cops were undistinguishable from the ""criminals"" they were chasing. In fact, they were worse!Den of Thieves fails to separate itself from any number of heist movies. You can draw a heist movie name out of a hat and almost assuredly you'll choose a movie with1.) Going for the big score
2.) An elaborate scheme
3.) Hiccups in that scheme
4.) The big reveal where we get to see all of the little planning that made it successful that we didn't see (or realize) at the time they occurred
(Sometimes) 5.) The astute lawman that figures out the plan based upon some small intricate tidbit of information.Den of Thieves has all of that plus a lot of shooting. Think Heat level shooting but not as compelling. The movie's success or failure really all came down to the end because up until that point it was a marginal movie at best. The ending was decent though not all that shocking if you've seen enough heist movies. As it was I think it still left a lot of loose ends. There were questions regarding certain characters, their motives, and their story that were never answered. They tried to use a lot of machismo and flash-bang to distract from the gaping holes but I wasn't buying it. It was a nice try but no A's given for effort here.",Den of Thieves
11,neil-476,Overlong,7,1 May 2018,"Ray Merrimen heads a crew of crooks who have successfully carried out multiple bank robberies in Los Angeles. Nick O'Brien heads a group of fairly wild cops who know who they are after, but haven't been able to catch them yet. Merrimen's crew have a big caper set up, O'Brien's squad has a man on the inside, and the scene is set for a cat and mouse crime caper movie.The caper is good - a little over-complex, but pleasingly constructive. And the ultimate scenes bring a smile to the face. Now to look at what is not so good.This film runs for 2 hours and 20 minutes, and feels every minute of it. Butler's character is deeply unpleasant (nothing wrong with an anti-hero as such, however...) to the extent that you don't want to spend time in his company, nor do you want him to triumph despite the fact that he is nominally a goodie. There is great emphasis on the drama of his domestic situation: this is plot irrelevant, goes nowhere, is never resolved, and has no impact on his mood or actions. O'Brien and Merrimen have a weird kind of one-upmanship jockeying for position going on: this doesn't seem to have any direct cause or effect on anything. And the final action sequence goes on for rather too long.Like the film, in fact.",Den of Thieves

It indeed didn't disappoint, the best film I've seen in a while. Even though there's few likable characters and no good guys. It's engaging throughout, minus Butler's character Nick's downtime, as he's an a-hole and you can't feel sorry for him.

Suprised to like it or let me even say like it very much.Clocking in over 2 hours is a hell of a time and most flicks clocking in at that time do have a boring moment. Let me say, this one hasn't. The acting is all above mediocre yes even 50 cent. Gerard is doing what he does best, the hard guy not to mess with.From the first minute until the end I was into this flick. Not one drop or boring moment and even as it didn't go fast sometimes it added towards the suspense. Effects are good, story was good, just a hell of a movie, I was as stated suprised.

It's all well done and acted but you watch it with the constant feeling that it's all impossible, alot of bad choices and alot of macho behavior. The movie isn't bad, it's entertaining, but would I watch it again? No, I wouldn't. To me a seven star rating is a good movie that I would watch again, a six isn't a bad movie but I will only watch it once. The actors are perfect in their roles, big macho attitude during the entire movie. I wouldn't expect anything else from that cast. The story itself is everything that would never happen in real life, and that might work in a movie, but still you get that little annoying feeling while watching it.

It was directed by debut feature filmmaker Christian Gudegast, and it was written by Gudegast and Paul Scheuring (the same duo also co-wrote the 2003 crime thriller 'A MAN APART'). The film stars Gerard Butler, O'Shea Jackson Jr., Pablo Schreiber, 50 Cent, Evan Jones, Dawn Olivieri, Mo McRae and Max Holloway. It's received mixed to negative reviews from critics, and it's also a modest hit at the Box Office though. I really enjoyed it (and so did the audience I saw it with). The story centers around a team of successful bank robbers, in Los Angeles, and the team of elite County Sheriff officers trying to bring them down. Nick O'Brien (Butler) is the lead L.A.P.D. officer, that's obsessed with catching the gang of crooks, and he also suffers from alcoholism and a failing marriage. While Ray Merrimen (Schreiber) is the leader of the gang of robbers, who's extremely good at his job. Nick spends most of his time, at first, harassing Donnie (Jackson Jr.), who's just the getaway driver. The whole time the gang of thieves plans to rob the Los Angeles Federal Reserve.The movie is really interesting and involving, and it's also got some pretty cool, and well done, action scenes in it. Butler is always engaging to watch, in the extremely flawed lead antihero role, and the supporting cast is all more than adequate as well. Gudegast really did an impressive rookie job directing, and I really like how there's not much difference between the cops and criminals in it (neither are really good or bad guys, they're just flawed people). I had a blast watching it, and I definitely recommend seeing it in the theater if you can.",Den of Thieves

18,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Gets by, but is nowhere near as deep and meaningful as it thinks it is",7,12 November 2018,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn Los Angeles (where, this film informs us in the opening, more robberies than any other happen) Ray Merrimen (Pablo Schreiber) and his gang of robbers, including right hand man Enson Levoux (50 Cent) have crossed the line in their latest crime, and become cop killers. Burnt out cop 'Big' Nick O' Brien (Gerard Butler- who wasn't very happy this morning when his house burned down!) is assigned with his group of men, to track them down. But Merrimen and his men are plotting their most audacious crime yet- breaking into Los Angeles central bank and stealing a load of bank notes that have been taken out of circulation before they're shredded- pitting him and O' Brien in a climactic battle of wits.In a day and age when we're quite relentlessly told how cyber crime is the new thing we've all got to be weary of, and old fashioned 'heists' are pretty much a thing of the past (not worth the time and risk!), it seems cinema goers still have something of an attachment to 'heist' thrillers, and so debut feature length director Christian Gudegast has delivered us this weighty little flick, serving as a kind of Heat lite, trying to capture that film's mood, style and atmosphere, but only really managing a kind of tribute act level of success.The similarities with Heat are so immense it feels safe to assume that Gudagest was a big fan of the film, and is trying to apply his own take on it, with Butler mirroring Al Pacino's deadpan, cynical anti-hero, in scenes that feel like they could have been taken from that film (most notably a scene where Butler walks in on his ex-wife and her new partner entertaining friends!) whilst Schreiber (any relation to Liv???) does a Robert De Niro tribute. But then, this is a film drowning in cop movie clichés, pretty much just going through the motions while thinking it's a lot more grander in scale than it really is.It's all perfectly serviceable and competent, but stiflingly over-indulgent for what it is. In asking us to invest so much of our time, Gudagest really needed to deliver something with a bit more originality and substance beneath the surface. Hopefully he'll learn his lesson next time round, and deliver something that really knocks our socks off, instead of something that just gets by in spite of its pretentiousness. ***",Den of Thieves
19,MOscarbradley,"No ""Heat"" but a good old-fashioned action flick nevertheless",7,18 December 2018,"""Den of Thieves"" is certainly no ""Heat"". For a start it lacks that DeNiro/Pacino dynamic that made ""Heat"" such a great movie but as heist movies go, it's definitely a cut above average despite an overly complicated plot, due in large part to director Christian Gudegast's decision to cut between what the police are doing and what the thieves are doing. It starts and ends brilliantly with a couple of terrific gun-battles while still managing to sustain our interest midway through, the way a good heist movie should. Unfortunately it's a film that borrows much too readily from Mann's classic in a way that isn't so much homage as rip-off. Nevertheless, if you like action flicks this is certainly the business.",Den of Thieves
20,bowmanblue,Better than I could possibly imagine,8,5 February 2018,"I didn't expect much when I sat down to watch 'Den of Thieves.' Gerard Butler's Box Office draw has long since faded and there were no other major stars attached. All I knew was that the film was 'long' (well over two hours) and I even pictured myself walking out about half way if it really didn't grab me. Luckily, I was hooked long before the middle of the film!If you're bored of your typical 'cops and robbers' film, then this one does its best to be a little original. The two things that stood out for me were the facts that it wasn't so much 'cops and robbers,' as it was 'bad cops and bad robbers.' Seriously, the police didn't act that much better than those who were robbing from banks in L.A. and gunning down anyone who tried to stop them. The second thing was that normally this kind of film just concentrates on the cops who are out to catch the villains. However, this time it felt like the robbers got equal screen time to those out to thwart them. In fact, Gerard Butler was about the only officer of the law who you really got to know (out of his squad of about six men). You actually got to see a lot more of the robbers' home life and therefore understood their motivations (on top of just getting rich!).I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but you get the sense that this could go either way. Will the robbers get their big score? Will there be a twist or turn in the proceedings and, of course, who will make it out alive? It is pretty violent, so expect a fair few scenes of torture, gunplay and general foul behaviour (and that's just from the police!).If the film does have a flaw then it's the length. I mentioned it was well over two hours and, although a lot of this is spent on establishing the characters, there are a few scenes (all of which involving Gerard Butler's on-screen family) which drag and really do slow the pace down. In some places I was just desperate for the bank-robbing portion of the story to start up again. However, that's a minor gripe. I totally intend to buy this on DVD when it comes out and therefore may just skip those few scenes which I felt don't really add that much. Ultimately, if you're looking for an excellent and action-packed, gritty cop thriller then this one will definitely keep you entertained.

21,dromasca,a job well done,7,28 August 2020,"'Den of Thieves' belongs to the category of action movies that I like for two reasons: it's well done and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. From the first scene to the end, the film with which Christian Gudegast made his debut as a feature film director in 2018 claims to be nothing more than a description of the fight between a gang of bank robbers planning a seemingly impossible coup and a group of police officers who use unconventional methods to catch them and if possible to prevent their next blow. Despite the over 2 hours and 20 minutes of screening 'Den of Thieves' did not seem to me too long, nor artificially prolonged. What's the secret?Christian Gudegast is a native of Los Angeles, knows its streets, neighborhoods, highways, harbor, clubs and dark alleys. His passion for the city is visible in the way he films and frames his heroes. Unlike traditional heist movies in which we follow the careful planning of a robbery in one of the apparently best guarded places in the world (here the Federal Reserve Bank) in 'Den of Thieves' the gang of criminals is not composed of elegant gentlemen but of violent and well-organized criminals, combining indifference for the lives of others with the mastery of digital technology that nowadays joins or even takes the place of massive padlocks and impregnable steel walls in protecting banks. But Gudegast is also a good connoisseur of the human mosaic that populates the city, so both the bad guys and the good guys looks real and genuine on screen. If Michael Mann's 'Heat' is the model for films with cops and criminals set in the City of Angels, by comparison, 'Den of Thieves' is less stylish but more credible.Those who prefer equal screen opportunities will rightly complain that there is no consistent feminine role - this is a (bad and worse) guys movie. The main roles feature three actors who play their anti-heroes with skill. Gerard Butler is O'Brien, a cynical and vicious cop. His private life is falling apart and we can only wonder that his family lasted so long, probably waiting for the divorce to take place in the film. He is opposed by Pablo Schreiber as the leader of the gang of gangsters, and although the role does not leave him much room for nuance, one can guess the talent of an actor who deserves to be watched. The most interesting role is perhaps that of the night bartender and day driver of the thieves, forced to collaborate with the police, in which O'Shea Jackson Jr. shows that he is blessed, like his father with both musical and actor talents. The action is well paced and the intrigue reserves for the end a surprise that I did not anticipate. The shooting duels are edited and choreographed well, despite an excess of arsenal that occasions by the end one of the few moments when the story seems less credible. 'Den of Thieves' is a well-made action film. No more, no less. Which is a lot.",Den of Thieves
22,ThomasDrufke,Heat With Gerard Butler,6,24 January 2018,"I admittedly had not even heard of Den of Thieves before a month or so ago. It's not like I'm seeking out every Gerard Butler movie out there anyway. However, Den of Thieves proved to be a film that will take more than a day or two to forget. And for a January release, I'd say that's an accomplishment.This is far from an A-movie action film. It doesn't have a ton of levels of direction, acting, or writing. In fact, it's mostly a beat for beat remake of Heat, with De Niro & Pacino. But sometimes all I want is to enjoy some well-shot and heart pumping action sequences with some inconsequential thrills along the way. Den of Thieves give me just that, and surprisingly a couple chuckles as well (whether they were intentional or not).The highlight of the movie is clearly Butler's ""Big Nick"" Flanagan (or is it O'Brien? I honestly don't remember and I've seen conflicting answers online) and his back and forth with Pablo Schreiber. The latter is quietly building himself a solid career with this, American Gods, and his upcoming film with Damien Chazelle. Watch out for this guy. But he's very entertaining, as is Butler, flexing their muscles and manhood all the way through this Heat rip-off heist thriller. Seriously though, this movie is literally Heat.However, it's worth noting that just because this film lacks originality, doesn't mean it lacks in quality. Albeit definitely 20 minutes too long, it's hard to think of a better action film from January that I can remember. This is most certainly a 5.99 blu ray bin purchase this summer.6.9/10",Den of Thieves
23,cricketbat,"Too long, too many unlikeable characters",4,10 March 2020,"The main issue with Den of Thieves is that you're not rooting for the thieves or the police, you're just rooting for the movie to end. That's the problem with making all your characters unlikeable-the viewer stops caring about what happens to them. There are some interesting moments, but they're bogged down by the extra-long runtime and the cliched plot points. I would be more annoyed, but I'm sure I'll forget about this movie very soon.",Den of Thieves
24,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews....,6,16 April 2018,"Den of ThievesThe key to a successful heist is double-crossing your partners before they do you.Unfortunately, the hoods in this action-thriller aren't aware of this detail.A boozy sheriff (Gerard Butler) remains one-step behind a heavily armed and highly efficient posse of armored truck robbers (Pablo Schreiber, 50 Cent).While the sheriff finalizes his divorce, the crew partners with a shifty bartender (O'Shea Jackson Jr.) who has an elaborate plan to steal from the Federal Reserve. As the scheme progresses it becomes clear that not everyone is on the up and up.A simplistic caper with a passable twist, this crime saga is unduly long and not that original when compared to others of its ilk. But it is the blundering performances of Butler and Cent that really drags this picture down to the dregs of the genre.Incidentally, heists are one of the few events that men can actually organize.

Unfortunately what it did lacked was amazing characters, terrific antagonist, and perfect shootout sequence - all main things that made ""Heat"" perfect.On the other hand ""Den of Thieves"" was a pretty entertaining movie on its own. It had a good central hero played by always great screen presence Gerard Butler. It had a good looking but unfortunately lacking charisma antagonist -they could give more to this character. Also at running time 2 h 20 min this movie was surprisingly very well paced and barely dragged. The shootout scene at the end was not bad at all. And the ending left me surprised, and in a pretty good way. So at the end of the day i liked this movie - it was good. But it could have been so much better!",Den of Thieves
26,The-Sarkologist,Great Bait and Switch,9,29 January 2018,"Oh, what can I say about this film without giving too much away. I guess I can say it is one of those heist movies that has a really good twist at the end. No, not one of those heist movies where we have a small gang of people that rob a place and actually get away with it, but rather one of those really ballsy heist movies that ends with one of those twists that points out that it was there starring you in the face the whole time, but because of the exceptional use of the 'bait and switch' we simply did not see it.
 So, the story is about a gang led by Merriman who we learn wants to rob the Federal Reserve in Los Angeles to take off with 30 Million dollars of unmarked bills. On the other side we have Nick, who is a member of the sheriff's department and it tracking Meriman for other crimes that he has supposedly committed. The film opens with a heist of an armoured truck, which happens to be empty, and for most of the film we are left to wonder why it is they stole an empty armoured truck. In fact, at the beginning, we are even led to believe that it was a botched robbery - except it wasn't.
 It movie is fairly slow in places, but that is usually the case when it comes to heist movies. In fact it comes across very much as a cat and mouse game between Nick and Meriman, and of course, like many of these films, it ends with a shootout, and a pretty big one at that. Well, okay, not really a big one, but it is probably what you would have come to expect from such a film. In fact, a part of it reminded me of this film I saw back in 1995 called Heat - not quite, particularly since it has been quite a while since I have seen it, but it did have some familiarities nonetheless.
 Den of Thieves wasn't a bad film at all. As I suggested, it is a little slow, and I wouldn't call it one of those action packed films, but then again it is a heist film, and that is what you should come to expect from such a film. Still, it is good, especially with the interaction between the cops and the robbers. Oh, and it is interesting how they portray the sheriffs department as well, though once again, like a lot of these films, it seems as if the United States law enforcement regime is really one big chaotic mess.",Den of Thieves

Due to Showtime I've seen it multiple times and originally had rented on Amazon, had some ice cream with it - that was nice! Anyway though, I love this movie except the ending is slightly disappointing while also being brilliant. Really impressive that this is director Christopher Gudegast first film; it's very well thought out and Gerard is so badass; I relish so many of his scenes like a delicious hot dog.",Den of Thieves
28,cruise01,"Better than expected with a great cast, action, and suspense.",9,2 February 2018,"Den of Thieves has really caught me by surprise with being a really good heist film. I thought it was going to be poorly put together and dull performances from the looks of the trailer. But it proved me wrong. Director/writer Christian Gudegast threw the curve ball with setting the film up with gritty dark characters, gave the film an intense gun shoot out, and build the suspense with having this heist play out until the final moments. Den of Thieves is no Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in Heat. But it might as well be. What I like about the film is it was never boring. The film kick start when Merriman (Pablo Schreiber) and his crew steal a money truck resulting in a police shoot out. Detective Nick (Gerard Butler) takes the case and is on track with Merriman and his crew. Figuring they enjoy the thrills of robbing banks and will hit the ultimate goal of stealing from the Federal Bank. There are a few gun shootouts that are intense and loud as it should be. These characters are put on the line and can get killed at any given moment. The action and chases were good and entertaining. Director Christian Gudegast film felt like it was trying to be like Heat. The climax is just a ticking time bomb bloodbath.The heist set up was good. Merriman and his mastermind plan of stealing money from the federal bank and how it's executed built a lot of suspense. Merriman is the type of character that seems like he would go off mentally at any given moment. But also has an emotional side that he does not hurt civilians. Gerard Butler plays a gritty detective. He is a brute force that will stop at nothing and will also go off if someone upsets him. From his shaky relationship at home to chain smoking and following Merriman's crew. Especially, Donnie (O'Shea Jackson) who seems to be the only reasonable guy in the crew. Butler character is the type of guy that will shoot down the bad guys first and ask questions later. Like he said to Merriman about not bringing handcuffs cause it would involve a lot of paperwork. Pablo Schreiber's performance was also good as well. A character that seems to enjoy the thrills of robbing banks. And also a marine veteran. O'Shea Jackson Jr. was good. 50 Cent was good as well. There is a fun scene when 50 Cent character is meeting his daughters boyfriend before prom. And he uses the intimidating technique. Sure, the scene was played for laughs. But otherwise, the film had no humor whatsoever. But seeing Gerard Butler and Pablo Schreiber going head to head at a shooting range with no talking but glaring at a distant while proving who is a better shooter. Or another stare down at a restaurant. These scenes feels like anything can happen and these characters can go off at any second. What I dislike about the film is I was hoping for a little more character development with Gerard Butler and Pablo Schreiber's characters. These guys are brutes and ruthless and it was difficult to care for them. Overall, Den of Thieves is a really good heist film. The action and shootouts are a few but worth it when it happens on screen. It is intense and suspenseful. The direction on the shoot outs is well executed. The heist and thrills is intense. It does keep you on the edge watching these characters until the final moment leaves off with a twist. Gerard Butler and the cast all did good with their roles.I rate the film 4.5 out of 5 stars. I definitely recommend seeing this film in theaters. If you are into heist films or suspenseful gritty action movies.",Den of Thieves
29,Floated2,Very entertaining heist film,8,18 November 2018,"Bank heist films have always some sense of thrills, suspense and overall entertainment within the department. Den of Thieves has that special element that makes film very entertaining and intriguing from start to finish. With a solid ensemble cast, starring Gerard Butler, Pablo Schreiber and O'Shea Jackson Jr., they all deliver as we see much more than a typical bank heist film, but more layered characters, as we get to know more about them.The action is there, as are the thrills. For a January release film, Den of Thieves is much better than most expected, as there have been talks of a sequel. Of course some criticism is of the film's length which is 120 minutes, but the pacing keeps the film balanced as there seems to be more layered, and more details thrown in the film.The ending and finale are what makes this film quite memorable, including a very thrilling final back heist mission, involving all sorts of trickery and overall solid suspense. O'Shea Jackson steals the scenes in the very end, including a clever twist which we don't see coming. All together, Den of Thieves has slick action, great thrills and overall suspense keeping enough energy for two plus hours.",Den of Thieves
30,eddie_baggins,This sure is no Heat,4,29 May 2018,"So it turns out all those people calling out Den of Thieves as a Heat-lite heist thriller are entirely correct, as Christian Gudegast's film riffs liberally from Michael Mann's 90's classic in its quest to become the newest king of the heist/crime epic.Set in the sun-bleached surrounds of Los Angeles, Thieves starts off with a bang as our crime gang led by Pablo Schreiber's Ray Merrimen pull off a dangerous robbery outside a donut shop in the early hours of the morning, as Gudegast's film sets in motion a game of cat and mouse between Merrimen's crew and Gerard Butlers detective ""Big Nick"" O'Brien, yet while Thieves contains some genuinely thrilling and nerve wracking moments, this 140 minute behemoth can barely dare to be mentioned alongside Heat as its fails outside of its action ticks to create any type of genuine tension or character connections in an overstuffed narrative that pans out exactly as you'd expect it to.Gudegast tries hard to set-up Merrimen as the De Niro of Thieves and Butler as the Pacino but these characters are both highly uninteresting with Merrimen nothing more than an ex-army type turned bad while Butler is sadly a shadow of his former self as the loathsome ""Big Nick"", an unfit, sweaty and insufferable anti-hero who sulks when his strip club visiting ways and boozy behaviour force his wife and children to leave him.From the top down Thieves struggles to make the crew of crooks and cops work to its advantage with the likes of 50 Cent and O'Shea Jackson Jr rounding out a cast with recognisable faces, not so much sure-fire talent, who all struggle to build much into their characters, making the stakes in the film irrelevant as the ""big heist"" is planned around Nick and his colleagues bearing down on Merrimen's gang.It's a shame this is the case as Thieves isn't completely redundant of thrills and when the film's final, much too late end segments begin Gudegast's film offers some relatively unbelievable yet enjoyable moments that showcases the film did indeed have an opportunity to be more than it is as a final product.Final Say -Den of Thieves looks good, has a moody score from the ever reliable Cliff Martinez and bares moments of well attuned action and thrills but as a whole this wannabe gritty thriller finds itself lacking in the departments that matter most; investment and engagement and with another cringe-worthy Gerard Butler performance at its forefront, Den of Thieves never really stood a chance up against the kingpins of the heist thriller sub-genre.2 Chinese food deliveries out of 5",Den of Thieves
31,leonblackwood,Decent action but too close to Heat!,6,17 August 2018,"Review:
The director of this film must have watched Heat too many times because the concept is EXACTLY the same, including the style of the epic shoot-out at the end. In this case, Gerard Butler plays the cop, ""Big Nick"" O'Brien, who heads his unit and goes to the extreme to get the job done. At the beginning of the film, his wife Holly (Meadow Williams), leaves him because she is fed up with his lying and womanising ways, so she takes there 2 young girls with her, even though Nick is begging her not to stay. Meanwhile, Ray Merrimen (Pablo Schreiber) heads a team of robbers, who are in the process of a violent armed attack and hijack an armoured truck. Police officers arrive at the scene and engage in a shootout with the robbers, which kills one of Ray's team. They manage to escape from the cops with the empty armoured truck but Ray is upset with a couple of the crew members because the robbery didn't go to plan. As most of Ray's crew are ex-military, they know how to handle heavy artillery, which is why they managed to escape from the cops. Anyway, it doesn't take long for Nick to work out who done the robbery because he has been monitoring Merrimen and his crew for some time. He then uses brutal tactics to kidnap the driver, Donnie Wilson (O'Shea Jackson Jr.), who works at a bar nearby. Whilst interrogating him in a hotel room, with the rest of his unit, Donnie reveals that Merrimen is planning to rob the Federal Reserve on Friday of that week by removing about $30million in old bills which are scheduled to be shredded after their serial numbers are deleted from computer records. Near the day of the heist, Ray and his crew invade a commercial bank and take hostages. With Nick knowing about there plan to rob the Federal Reserve, he struggles to work out exactly what they are doing but he's keeping a close eye on them, from outside the bank. Merrimen demands money and a helicopter from the police, which is due to be delivered in an hour's time but Merrimen's real plan is to use the tunnel underneath the bank, to get to the Federal Reserve. The thieves needed commercial bank money so they could make a cash drop-off at the Federal Reserve, which is the only way that they could get inside. With everything going to plan, Nick realises that everything has gone a bit quiet at the commercial bank, so he goes inside and he can see that they have used a tunnel to get to the Federal Reserve. He then alerts his team, and they start to make there way to the Federal Reserve, hoping to catch Merrimen in the act. Nick's team catch up with Donnie, who has managed to leave the Federal Reserve, masked as a Chinese delivery man, and they beat him up in the car, whilst interrogating him about Merrimen's whereabouts. After Merrimen and his crew, have sorted out the cash, changed their clothes and swapped cars, they start to make their getaway with the money but they hit a heavy traffic jam, which Nick and his team are stuck in as well. Nick decides to take the opportunity to take out the bank robbers but Merrimen sights him in his mirror, and he begins to take fire. This is when the Heat shoot-out comes into play! I won't spoil the outcome but if you have watched Heat, you will know what's about to happen. The final showdown was pretty realistic, in terms of sound and action but I still think that Heat has the best shoot-out of all time. Anyway, the acting wasn't bad from the cast, especially Butler but it wasn't anything amazing. There is a sense of intensity throughout the movie, which made the film watchable but there isn't much of a suspense element because the whole plan is revealed way too early, in my opinion. Another moment that let the movie down, was the fact that Nick didn't alert the Federal Reserve about the heist, which would have made total sense. Also, the Usual Suspects moment at the end was a bit weak, and I personally wasn't that bothered about Donnie getting away with the whole thing. I've heard that there is going to be a sequel, which will be the revenge from Nick on Donnie, so it will be good to see how the story truly ends, Anyway, it's worth a watch if you're into your dramatic action movies but it could have done with some top actors. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was written and directed by Christian Gudegast, who also wrote London Has Fallen, which also starred Gerard Butler, A Man Apart and Beyond The City Lights. The sequel to this movie is in production, and his upcoming projects include Hawaii Five-0, Mexicali, Black Flag and an untitled project about a Serbian Jewel Thief. For his directional debut, he did a good job, in terms of getting a decent cast and earning a hefty profit at the box office but it was way to close to Heat for me. The only way that the sequel will work, is if Gerard Butler returns because his character was the main reason why this movie worked. I also liked the intense Merrimen character, who I really can't see returning, so they need to come up with a decent baddie to go toe-to-toe with Butler. At the end of the day, it is a straightforward cops and robbers concept but now they have included an intelligent element, in terms of Donnie's character, the sequel sounds promising.Budget: $30million

I was not impressed that the films' star Gerard Butler, who plays 'Big Nick' O'Brien was portrayed as an out of control cop who plays both physical and mental mind games with his wife who initiates divorce proceedings against him while he is in the midst of breaking up this military trained band of bank robbers.It is a decent cat and mouse, good versus evil, action film that deserves at least two viewings to fully grasp how ell done this film was made.

37,paul-allaer,"At times intriguing, but overly long and too predictable",6,19 February 2018,"Den of Thieves"" (2018; 140 min.) brings the story of Nick and his fellow LA sheriffs. As the movie opens, we are reminded that LA is the bank robbery capital of the world, where a robbery happens every 48 min. We then go to ""Gardena, South L.A. 5:14 am"", where a money truck is robbed and in the ensuing shoot-out, several people are killed including a cop. ""We're cop killers now"", laments one of robbers. Later Nick examines the crime scene and much to his surprise, the money truck was empty. Why would the robbers target a money truck without money? At this point, we're 10 min. into to the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the directing debut of screenwriter Christian Gudegast, who previously gave us ""London Has Fallen"". ""Den of Thieves"" is very much in the same vein as ""London Has Fallen"", an action movie that is bent on winning you over with hair-raising shoot-outs and heists. The premise of the movie, namely why would the robbers rob, and then take off with, an empty money truck is actually quite clever and intriguing. Alas, it isn't long that we get sidetracked with far too many tangents that do not advance the core story line and dramatically slow down the movie. There is zero reason for this movie to be creeping towards a running time of 2 1/2 min., and the movie would've benefited greatly from an editing trim to bring it in around 2 hrs. On the other hand, the movie benefits greatly from Gerard Butler's performance, who seems he was born to plays this rough-and-tumble character of the corrupt-but-meaning -to-do-well LA cop. I can't say the same thing about Pablo Schreiber who, as the main villain Ray Merrimen, lacks color and personality. Last but certainly not least, there is a delightful electronic score courtesy of composer Cliff Martinez, delivering his usual top-notch electronic noodling (check: ""Drive"", ""Only God Forgives"", etc.).""Den of Thieves"" opened strongly at the box office in January. For whatever reason, I didn't get around to seeing it until this past weekend, a month into its run in the theater. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at was attended quite nicely, somewhat to my surprise. Looks like this movie benefited from good word-of-mouth. I enjoyed it for what it was, nothing more, nothing less, but tighter editing would've made it even better. I encourage you to check out ""Den of ""Thieves"", be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Den of Thieves
38,jtindahouse,One of th best bank robbery movies in years,9,26 December 2019,"I'm a big fan of bank robbery movies. Typically there are two types: there's the brute force type robbery movies where the villains show no mercy and will harm whoever they have to to get the job done, and then there's the smart bank robbery films where they try and get the job done with their heads and hurt as few people as possible. 'Den of Thieves' falls somewhere in the middle of those. Both elements are present. The result is a very fine film.Not often does a film get both the good guy characters and the bad guys characters right. Typically it's one or the other (or in some unfortunate cases neither). We meet the bad guys first on this occasion and they are extremely bad-ass. Usually to counter that most screenwriters will make the good guys more tame in order to ensure they are more likeable and the audience will side with them. Here though, the good guys are as bad-ass as the bad guys - and it works. Every character in this movie is great to watch and every scene is a treat because of this.The action sequences are also great. They are fast-paced, smart, brutal and extremely tense. The film is also paced remarkably well. It runs almost 140 minutes but never feels like it. Finally this a smart movie where you knew there was always going to be more than first meets the eye. I really liked the way they ended this one. This is a very hard movie to fault and one I would highly recommend.",Den of Thieves

This is a cops & robbers shoot em up, written & directed by Christian Gudegast-this is his first time directing but he did write 'London Has Fallen'. Oh yeah, he is also the son of Eric Braeden, who just happens to make a cameo in the movie-anyone remember 'The Rat Patrol'? Gerard plays a tough as nails cop that runs the major crimes unit of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Pablo is the just out of prison leader of a gang of robbers that plans on hitting the Federal Reserve Bank in downtown L.A., if Gerard doesn't put a stop to him, that is. 50 plays one of Pablo's gang members and O'Shea is their new driver that was recruited because he knows how to drive like a maniac. If you are a 'Walking Dead' fan, you will also spot Cooper Andrews, who plays Jerry on the hit tv show. It's pretty heavy on the action but the plot has a lot of holes in it. I mean, there are things that happen, with no explanation for why it was even in the movie; an example being when Gerard slept with the bad guys girlfriend, just to piss him off, and then right after Gerard leaves the room, she tells the bad guy that she did what he wanted her to do and he just smiles. That is it. Nothing else in the movie happens to explain what the purpose of the bad guys plan was. Oh well, at least the action was intense.

All of them seem to be the Politically Correct non-White sorts with whom they've been packing the Oscar voting booths in recent years, resulting in such Rigged Elections as the amoral MOONLIGHT (which most of the so-called electorate could not stomach enough to watch in its entirety) stealing the gelded statuette for ""Best Picture"" from the financially successful LA LA LAND, which everyone saw and thoroughly enjoyed. Is there anyone around to protect the Common Good against these rampaging felons in the DEN OF THIEVES? Other than a rag-tag handful of greatly out-numbered and out-gunned sheriff's deputies rounded up by THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (Gerard Butler), there's pretty much no one to stop the carnage against civilians and their property in the L.A. Free Fire Zone. The entire state of California has all but officially been declared a ""No Go"" Sanctuary Cities enclave, populated only by crooks and victims who have been robbed of their means to escape. If Leader Trump has three or four hours to view DEN OF THIEVES, it may clinch his initiative to nuke these infiltrating foreign terrorists before they can spread from their ""Golden State"" viper nests to corrupt the innocence of such normal, law-abiding regions as Oklahoma, Alabama, and Mississippi.",Den of Thieves
41,henry8-3,Den of Thieves,6,13 February 2019,"A bunch of tough bank robbers plan the ultimate, impossible theft, whilst an equally tough group of cops, lead by Butler, try and stop them.It is oft been observed that this is heavily influenced by Michael Mann's Heat and it is difficult to argue with that. Accepting this, it is handled rather well and was something of a pleasant surprise. Screen time is split pretty much 50/50 between the criminals and the police and the detailed study of the robbery and the brutal passion both sides possess for winning make for a persuasive ride. Butler is actually very good in the lead, even in the standard bad husband but loving father scenes.Really good effort - if Mann has done this with say De Niro it would be drawing in far more kudos than this seems to have, which is unfair - overall underrated.",Den of Thieves
42,kirbylee70-599-526179,GOOD BUT DOESN'T BRING ON THE HEAT,7,31 May 2018,"I love a good heist movie. There've been some classics in the genre. THE ITALIAN JOB and OCEAN'S ELEVEN stand out in my memory. So when I heard a new heist film was out called DEN OF THIEVES starring Gerard Butler I was in. Sad to say it didn't live up to my expectations though.The movie opens with an armored car robbery that goes awry. A guard is shot and killed, not something Ray Merrimen (Pablo Schreiber) the master planner had in mind. A shootout follows but the team escapes and he later reprimands the weak member of his team for not following orders.The next day Det. Nick O'Brien (Butler) arrives to investigate the case. He and his team of elite no-nonsense officers have been tracking Merrimen for a while now. Through various leads and questionable methods of interrogation they begin to think they may have an idea of what the big heist is going to be. They just need to fill in the details.As all of this is going along we also get a glimpse of O'Brien's home life. Like most police in movies like this his marriage is a shambles. He's also finding it difficult to spend quality time with his child. The end result is his wife leaving and moving in with her sister while filing for divorce.The day of the heist arrives and O'Brien and his team have staked out the bank they know Merrimen is going to hit. Hit it he does taking those inside the bank hostage and threatening to kill them if he doesn't get money and a helicopter out of the bank. Stalling for time O'Brien and his team placate Merrimen. Until they realize something just isn't right. SPOILER ALERT: This is when the movie gets good. We discover that the bank job was cover for a much larger plan, stealing used bills intended for destruction at the nearby Federal Reserve. As the job is going down O'Brien and his team realize what's happening and race to the scene to take down Merrimen and his team. The film ends with a major chase and shootout taking up most of the last hour of the film. It's a tense struggle and not everyone will come out alive. But the movie doesn't end there. And that is the best part about the movie, the end. So if you decide to watch it keep in mind it's not over until the credits roll.So what's good about the movie? It has an involved plot that needs paid attention to to be followed. The story here of the elite commando type team of criminals facing off against the best of the best of the police works well. And to make things a bit different the criminals are more inclined appear the more elite team than the police. The police are the gruff looking tough talking types some movies have gone towards. This takes us to the bad. The language used by Butler here actually becomes distracting after a while rather than help form his character. He's not a character we care much about. There isn't a sympathetic character to associate yourself with. The criminals are willing to kill anyone who gets in their way. The police squad comes off as unruly, undisciplined in certain circumstances and just plain mean. Who do you root for?Then there's the length of the film. There's no reason for this film to last nearly two and a half hours. It's not that epic of a story. Plenty of scenes could have been trimmed to bring the movie down to even two hours. If film directors in the 30s and 40s could make a decent film and tell an entire story in under 80 minutes why do today's directors feel the need to expand the length of a film for no reason?While watching this film I kept thinking back to the movie HEAT from 1995 starring Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino. That movie lasted nearly three hours and didn't feel near as long as this one did. I was thinking that the director here felt he was making a monumental epic in the tradition of that film. If that was the case he failed miserably. The movie is entertaining enough for a single viewing but nothing that I would make myself sit through again or add to my collection. It's simply there.",Den of Thieves
43,jewelch,VERY GOOD ACTION FLICK,9,14 January 2021,"Butler and Schreiber deliver commanding performances. They are men who could explode at any moment, at work or at home. That nonstop ticking beneath their calm exteriors fills the film with a gripping tension. Very good action movie. Yes I highly recommend it. James Welch Henderson, Arkansas 1/13/2021",Den of Thieves
44,kluseba,Going back to the essence of classic action movies in a convincing way,9,12 February 2018,"Den of Thieves might be a stereotypical movie about tough guys trying to outsmart one another but it's a really entertaining ride and worth the praise it gets.First of all, the story is fast-paced without any lengths. Each character is introduced appropriately, the tension slowly rises until a gripping climax and the final twist is quite impressive as well.Secondly, the acting performances are stellar. Gerard Butler fully impresses as tough and pitiless detective who convinces with unshakable determination but also shows his flaws with his aggressive recklessness. Pablo Schreiber offers a very solid performance as strong, intelligent and ambitious criminal who turns out to be much more complex than meets the eye. The secret protagonist of the movie is O'Shea Jackson Junior's character who goes through a spectacular development from being a curious bartender, becoming involved in a gang of highly trained criminals and ending up what seems to be an undercover collaborator with the local police force. Each character has important flaws and strengths which makes everyone of them particularly authentic. Identifying a clear protagonist or antagonist is nearly impossible which sets this movie apart from other genre flicks.Thirdly, the action sequences are quite spectacular, including car chases, gun fights and hand-to-hand combat but these elements are never overused and keep the movie diversified yet credible.Fourthly, the main heist is truly spectacular and nerve-firing as the clever criminals face quite a few serious challenges. The whole sequence lasts about half an hour but feels less than half as long because it's so gripping.Fifthly, despite being an action movie, this film doesn't overuse special effects, employs lighting techniques smoothly and utilizes calm camera work. Stylistically, this movie goes back to the great action movies of the eighties which is quite refreshing and not headache-inducing. Great action movies don't need shaky cameras and zombies but should stick to the simplest ingredients to fully convince. This is what Den of Thieves accomplishes very successfully.In the end, watching Den of Thieves was a surprisingly positive experience. I haven't watched such an overall enjoyable action movie in a very long time. Fans of action cinema with tough guys in the key of the Die Hard franchise just can't get around this film. I certainly don't aim to sound controversial but the only thing to point out is that this movie was made by men for men and might appear somewhat stereotypical to most women. On the other side, it's just the other way around with films like Pitch Perfect. If this movie seems to be right down your alley, you will enjoy it for sure but if it's not your type of movie, just ignore it.",Den of Thieves
45,TdSmth5,Very thrilling,9,8 June 2018,"Some crew steals an armored car. For some reason they felt the need to kill the guards. Cops arrive, a shootout ensues. The thieves make it away. Next morning big-shot cowboy tough-guy sheriff's detective arrives. He and his team learn that the thieves actually stole an empty armored car truck. The FBI arrives as well and of course they don't get along with the local cops. Somehow the cops make out one of the thieves crew, grab him, mistreat him, and he starts confessing. The cops have been suspecting this crew for a while and now start putting things together and with the one guy under their thumb, know what they are planning. There are a couple of odd encounters between cowboy and the leader of the thieves where he announces that he's on their tail. But our leader of thieves is unfazed, everything proceeds as planned even though at some point they discover the mole among them.The big day arrives. They walk into a bank armed to the teeth, make demands, apparently kill a hostage and gain access to the vault. Then they vanish. Cowboy of course figures out the whole thing was a ruse but doesn't quite know where they disappeared. We know from earlier their plan to get into the LA Federal Reserve no less and steal a couple of million. Now they are executing their plan. Of course cowboy and his crew arrive just as they are leaving and later engage them in a fire-fight for the predictable resolution and a final twist.If this sounds familiar, it should, as Den of Thieves is inspired by and borrows heavily from Heat, a bit too heavily. Heat as an inspiration can only be a good thing. And in this case it makes for a fantastic thriller really. Butler is always solid, even in the stereotypical role of the over macho rogue cop. Schreiber is excellent as the mature, good-natured, and smart leader of thieves. Music is sober and exciting. Cinematography is good, things are sharp, clear, and sunny, except when it was cloudy in Atlanta. Of course there may be some plot holes, and things that stretch the imagination. The story mostly focuses on what matters, there's some but little marital issues fortunately. Too much focus though on Butler's character. I would have liked to have seen more of his crew and more of the thieves. As with Heat you end up rooting much more for the ""bad guys"" than for the over-the-top cops. So the inevitable ending is unsatisfying in spite of the revelation at the very end. Den of Thieves is just what you want from a great heist movie.",Den of Thieves
46,s3276169,Den of testosterone soaked blow hards.....,5,21 September 2018,"I have to say I get really tired, really quickly of testosterone soaked blow hards. Really hard men don't need to show off, most are silent types who know who and what they are, which is considerably more frightening. The characters inhabiting this film are of the former variety, not the latter. As such they are not very convincing. Their incessant macho blather is tiresome, resorting to a lot of swearing, smoking, tasteless jewellery and in one instance, intimidating a kid who looks about 16. How brave. The films overall set up is one of these paper tiger tough guy villains vs paper tiger tough guy cops. The armed exchanges are about the only portion of this film that's remotely exciting. The rest is wall to wall bluster and BS that's mostly just tedious. My advice, give this one a pass. 5/10 from me.",Den of Thieves
47,questl-18592,Cops and Robbers,4,26 February 2021,"Since I first saw a trailer for this film, I'd been interested in it. I don't know what it is really but it always just seemed like it would be a fun ride. Maybe it's because I like the idea of gritty action star Butler or maybe I was just hoping to see 50 cent shoot up some people rather than getting shot himself, althugh that did give him a lot of tough guy points back in the day so who knows. Yet, despite all of that I never actually watched this mmovie until now and after all this time I can't help but think...Why didn't I just watch Heat again?This movie is so boring in the beginning, it's so wildly generic and uninteresting that by the time anything ""good"" happens I'm already too far removed to care and that payoff isn't remotely big enough to bring me back. The third act is where it finally finds it's intrigue but by then I was reading through articles on my phone and thinking about other things I'd rather be doing. Then my thoughts drift to Heat again because that's really what this movie feels like it wants to be. A more action driven, gritty version of Heat and I'm sorry but that's like when a kid on a peewee team says he wants to play in the bigs. It's cute and all but we all know it's probably never going to happen.That's Den of Thieves. It's cute and all but it's never going to be Heat. It's not even going to come close. So, if you're looking for a Cops v. Robbers film with character and a gripping sense of action and drama and incredible performances, you don't watch Den of Thieves twiddling it's thumbs in the kiddy pool. You go watch how the big boys do it and pop on Heat. It's just better in every way.Well... Den of Thieves does have better facial hair, so I guess I can give it that.",Den of Thieves
48,TheFearmakers,Gerard Butler's big brawling cop in 'Den of Thieves',9,11 February 2018,"If Randall ""Tex"" Cobb played COLUMBO, you'd have Gerard Butler as Big Nick O'Brien, a bad cop without any good cops to counterbalance or compare with, leaving middleman Donnie (O'Shea Jackson) as a wishbone between the law and a small group of bank-robbing tough guys led by Pablo Schreiber's Merriman, who, verses Butler's formidably flawed bearded brawler, once a gang-member, gives this completely entertaining heist/thriller/action flick it's very own genre, Intimidation...With loads of edgy testosterone-driven angst between a botched rudimentary escape and the planned future heist, it's not just for the taut ""street theater"" dialogue, but to flesh out the characters, giving Butler a chance to stretch beyond his usual dependably muscular hero...Till the somewhat pretentious, drawn-out conclusion (with more twists than a pretzel) and unlike other heist films borrowing from the quirky Quentin Tarantino template, DEN OF THIEVES plays more like a no-nonsense modern Western, the city of Los Angeles shown in bleak asphalt exteriors and darkened neon interiors - then shaping into a sort of hard-edge Neo Noir since everyone on board has their own not-so-subtle ambiguity about bending (cops) or breaking (robbers) the law.

49,AudioFileZ,A Pretty Good Heist Flick,7,29 January 2018,"Heist movies generally follow a similar path no matter what. Not all of them, however, revolve more on the law officer who believes he's on to something. I'd say that's not bad for just a small yet important difference. Gerrard Butler is the grizzled renegade cop who can fill those shoes nicely. You won't like him much more than the cons who are pulling some increasingly messy yet sophisticated heists. It makes for an interesting ride as at you're not instantly sure if you can root for anyone. That said you don't have to invest in either side particularly as it's the cat and mouse game between the two that is the main device. This is a good thing making this not a simple by rote heist flick. The atmosphere is dark and the humor almost absent as you know things are likely to get messy. In fact it reminds me of a Walter Hill movie due to the cold violent undercurrent without Hill's use of humor to vary the pace. It works well enough to pull in the viewer and while not having to question a few obvious holes. The ending may be polarizing for some viewers yet it explains who won the game...at least this time.",Den of Thieves

-Good acting
-Character Chemistry
-Multiple Levels
-DetailedDISLIKES:
-More Action
-Nick's Tangents
-Language Den Of Thieves is another installment to add to the crime/drama library. The movie has plenty of secondary characters, but the three leads do their jobs well to bring the characters to life. And it is these characters that were the pinnacle of the movie. The chemistry between the three characters of Nick Merrimen, and Donnie is like an intense game of cat and mouse, each one trying to outwit the other with their numerous, vendetta themed tactics to get ahead. Nick and Merrimen do some pretty low things, and one will be intrigued to see how deep down the rabbit hole they will go to accomplish their goals. What is even more rewarding though, is that the entire scheme has many layers to it and as the movie progresses and the layers peel away, the mystery only gets deeper until the final twist at the end. It is a very engaging tale and a drama that has enough thrills to not put you to sleep. 
 Sadly, the movie had some limitations for me that led to a decrease in score. While the language can be distracting, the movie does a better job with making it relevant, though I could have used a little less of it. The biggest limitations were for me were Nick's tangents and the limited action the movie actually held in its works. While the effort to develop Nick's character get applaud, much of these backstory details were not necessary in the grand scheme of the plot. It didn't provide room for growth and didn't really get resolved so it felt like just extending the run time. As for the action, the end caps (beginning and end) were representative of what the trailers promised. It was engaging, it was tense, it was relevant to the story which is are all solid points. The movie just needed more of these moments to amplify the excitement and keep this story even more on the edge of your seat. 
 Overall though, this movie is a solid crime/drama story that is worthy of representing the genre. The multilayered complexity is the shining point, and will drag you deeper down the hole to try to uncover the true goal of all parties involved. Throw in the dark rivalry of the characters and it further adds to the tension and suspense of the movie keeping you engaged. While there are some edits that were still needed, and the action could have been stepped up, the movies still shines in the art of deception. These twists are what make it worth a trip to the theater, but definitely check this out at home when you get a chance. My scores are:

53,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Den of Thieves,7,25 January 2018,"Loud, visceral shootouts in daylight traffic. Various informants. A suspect firing rounds through car windows like Robert De Niro. Equal storylines told from the perspectives of the cops and robbers. The main antagonist saying ""told ya"" right before he bites the bullet. The main protagonist facing the downside of a divorce. No I'm not talking about the film Heat. I'm talking about Den of Thieves, my latest review. So OK, you could safely call ""Thieves"" Son of Heat or well, Heat Jr. It shamelessly resembles 1995's crime drama in many, subtle ways. I still dug it though. ""Thieves"" is effectively dense, plausibly bold, and tough-talking. Its setting is Los Angeles without the sunshine, the city of angels without the glamour, the back-alley stuff. You can't totally identify it as informal William Friedkin or full on Michael Mann (Heat's Chicagoan director). You can however, deemed it as Michael Mann ""manifested"".Now Den of Thieves is that rare January release that's worth recommending. It's also a decent enough reason for star Gerard Butler to keep his agent around for just a while longer. Butler's performance as Detective Nick O'Brien, is fantastically raw and profoundly reckless. His persona relentlessly tries to bring down an ex-military crew who are trying to steal money from LA's Federal Reserve Bank (a bank which has never had a successful attempt at a heist).Watch for crafty, meticulous direction from Christian Gudegast (this is his directorial debut). Gudegast takes Den of Thieves seriously and so should you. His scenes are long-winded and fastidious but his film feels distanced from the realm of B movie, action schlock and required smash and grabbing (that's rather refreshing to me). Also, watch for a gotcha, twist ending in ""Thieves"" involving the character of Donnie Wilson (played by rapper Ice Cube's son, O'Shea Jackson Jr.).All in all, ""Thieves"" at a lounged running time of 140 minutes, doesn't quite offer the emotional impact or epic tranquility that the nearly three hour Heat possesses (most flicks don't). However, it's a worthy companion and/or successor. Bottom line: Den of Thieves thrives on ""crime doesn't pay"" urgency, stung violence without over-saturation, and some canvased, LA aerial shots. With its harmless attempt at a manifest homage, it ""steals"" a three star rating from me.",Den of Thieves

55,shakercoola,A warmed up throwback,5,5 February 2019,"An American thriller; A story about armed robbers and an audacious plan to steal money from a Federal Reserve Bank. This is a testosterone loaded, male bonding film in effect, and bears a few similarities to Michael Mann's film, ""Heat"" not least in its face-off trope. It begins earnestly in depicting Los Angeles as a red zone for bank robberies, necessitating a special squad of LAPD sheriffs needed to capture robbers of a particular skillset. The heist sequence is absorbing, but the padding around it plays out predictably with lots of cliches. The film is generally consistent as hard-hitting and serious with a realistic tone so when the audience is invited to laugh at a line about robbers as cop killers in one family set scene it is something of a false note. That said, all in all, the film is solid and watchable and has good pace, and the cast deliver the action very capably.",Den of Thieves

Try reading a few books.If your slick and sophisticated heist crime drama requires a plot device in which someone opens an air vent and crawls to safety in an insanely secure federal bank, or you wager that you can get out of a first degree murder and armed robbery conviction because the cops leave you hand-cuffed and un-escorted in their vehicle, then you need to go back to the drawing board and think a little harder.

Fighting fire with fire produces nice results as the cops don't let the law, rules or regs get in the way thus giving them an edge and the other guys losing one. The hate? When it starts to blur as to who are the bad guys? Not just in the movie but in life. Character, morals and purpose play a part in what we do or we are no better than the animals.

There are no good or bad guys in this film just seriously flawed people acting on some quite ambiguous motivations.
I found this made the film more exciting because there is no chance of the ""good guy"" winning in the last moment.There are lots of scenes that build on characters but ultimately feel like dead ends in retrospect but does get you invested.The action is kept to the end and when things ignite it is very exhilarating and feels quite real.Well shot, acted and produced.

66,rockman182,Den of Thieves (2018),7,13 April 2018,"I wanted to catch this when it first came out but somehow missed it. I dug the trailer. It didn't look like a perfect cop v robber heist film but looked like a decent time at the movies. I also heard a lot of people early on say that the film was too similar to Heat. I don't see the problem with that. Heat is amazing, and as long as its not the exact same thing I didn't mind something paying tribute to that film. I also didn't notice too much between the two films. Overall, I had a good time with this film despite it getting a bit messy in the third act.The film follows a group of criminals and the detectives that try to bring down their ploy to rob a commercial bank. The lead detective (Gerard Butler) is rough around the edges, and is not always a straight razor but makes it his mission to infiltrate the plans of the robbers by tapping up one of their members. Things get messy as suspicion arises within the gang of robbers.I thought the film had a good cast. I'm not a fan of a lot of what Gerard Butler does these days but I really liked the inclusion. Pablo Schreiber and O'Shea Jackson Jr. especially put on a good show. I liked the entire heist sequence. It feels familiar at times yet there are a few twists,turns, and passages that occur to keep it layered. However, it does get clunky as the film moves around through different events occurring between different characters. There is a bit of a twist that comes which I didn't see coming which is always nice.Den of Thieves goes against the grain of typical Janaury Hollywood films. Its good and actually makes for an entertainment popcorn film. The film could have been shorter, yes, and the execution isn't always perfect but its a film to turn off your mind and watch. I don't quite know how I feel about a sequel to these films but I would entertain the idea if it follows the suit of the first film. If you have time and want to watch a real solid heist thriller, here is your pick.7.5/10",Den of Thieves
67,Holt344,"Den of Thieves is a fine addition to the heist sub-genre, a phenomenal experience",9,8 May 2021,"Den of Thieves is both written, directed and produced by Christian Gudegast. He put together a memorable, entertaining and realistic heist film. It's extremely well thought out and the writing is great. I'm glad Christian Gudegast got the chance to make the movie he wanted to make as it was incredible the first time and remained as good on my second viewing. The sound editing and attention to detail, everything makes the action sequences superb. Perfect editing and the pacing is perfect for the story that they're telling. I think the run time shouldn't be lower than this, maybe longer. But there is scenes that they could cut or trim down but I'm fully behind the length of the film.An elite unit of the LA County Sheriff's Department, it's led by Detective Nicholas ""Big Nick"" O'Brien (played fantastically by Gerard Butler) the unit is out to catch the state's most successful bank robbery crew as they plan a seemingly impossible heist on the Federal Reserve Bank. The crew has Pablo Schreiber as Ray Merrimen, a MARSOC Marine veteran who serves as the crew's leader and schemer. O'Shea Jackson Jr. Plays Donnie Wilson, bartender and skilled driver. Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson plays Levi Enson Levoux, a MARSOC Marine veteran. I would say these four have the best performances but the supporting cast is also worth praising. This has to be among of O'Shea Jackson's and Gerard Butler's finest performances, Pablo Schreiber is also terrific. The huge amount of work that the actors needed to put in, I'm talking about learning the weapons and tactics. Both sides, LASD and the criminals, the characters work so well together and it's because of what the actors had to learn.Den of Thieves is a movie that doesn't really need a sequel as it works fine as a standalone heist film, but that there are talks of a sequel and that the actors want to reprise their roles is positive. The characters are well written, flawed and interesting. I find it best when they're flawed as it comes off more realistic as everyone isn't likeable but the character development makes them more likeable which is good for a movie that focuses on these themes. There's so much more story to tell and I hope Christian Gudegast goes through with the sequel.",Den of Thieves
68,carbuff,"Dirty Harry rides again--dirtier and more absurd than ever, but redeemed by an final surprise twist",9,18 April 2021,"For about the first 2 hours and 15 minutes, the best that can really be said about ""Den of Thieves"" is that it has super high production values. For the first 2 hours I was really getting into the absurdity of the whole thing, but after that point I was gasping for air through a straw while drowning in a testosterone bath. The expected final shootout scene demonstrates everything that is wrong with having a militarized police force--the cops sure were endangering an unbelievable number of innocent lives just for a bunch of money. By this point in the film, it had sunk well below 5 stars.I'm a guy, and I thought that pretty much every guy in this film was an utter embarrassment to my sex. Admittedly, the problem might be me, given that I'm trim and fit, but middle-aged, a bit below average in height, balding, and, unfortunately I guess, in no way, shape, or form, a big swinging so-and-so. Seconding another reviewer's observation, I've simply never watched any film as macho as this one in my entire life, and I've seen so many films of so many different types. ""Den of Thieves"" is a straight-up steroid IV-drip from beginning to end. If I wasn't already a guy, I'd probably have developed male secondary sexual characteristics well before this extremely long film was over.This flick was so ridiculous that I was having a pretty good time watching something so utterly stupid and overdone, but then, right on cue as exactly all of these films do, it degenerated into just another bloodbath. Now I was hating myself for having watched it. The earlier pleasure one experiences with a film that's ""so bad it's good"" had nearly completely dissipated, and I was down to about a 2-3 star rating.But then, shockingly, at the very, very end, there's a great plot twist (it's been done before, but I'm not writing any spoilers). It was like the blinds in a dark room on a sunny day had suddenly been opened, and my rating shot right up to 8-9 stars (I'm giving it 9, probably due to momentum effects).So, before you subject yourself to this film, you've got to ask yourself one big question. Specifically, do you want to sit though 2 hours and 15 minutes of increasingly macho nonsense for 5 minutes of sharp gratification at the extreme end? Well, do you punk?",Den of Thieves

I saw some flashes of heat that really pumped this up , cool shooting and a cool bad buy good guy differential we could not easily differentiate, the lines blurred and at the end of the big show we had a pretty cool flix , but the only gripe, was, when ol' boy finds out ol' boy got popped by the feds in the third act, ol' boy does nothing, not even warn his crew, that's a total heat moment right there! I mean, a real professional crew drops everything that you can take with you in ten seconds or less if you spot the heat around the corner no? This guy is is uptight the entire flick, total stress case and at the last moment he can't drop everything go rogue camouflage protocol, switch cars and take another route? I mean his driving around knowing ol' boy got popped like its a Sunday drive with his arm hanging out the window, not cool, not proper stress case uptight bad guy Procedure; in fact it breaks away from this guys typical routine without any explanation, I mean did he get hit in the head, shot anything? why is he not stressing hard, I mean ol' boy got popped by the heat and he knows everything, the score, every detail down to where they were going to take the loot , I mean if that's not cause for major severe concern then what? what is? And then ol' boy is like all surprised there are bad guy cops behind him tailing him, I'm like dude, why are you in you allz Sunday driving in your big ass ugly black truck?

70,dave-mcclain,"a movie with a little ""Ocean's 11"", a lot of action and way too much machismo",5,28 January 2018,"""Den of Thieves"" (R, 2:20) features Gerard Butler in full macho action mode leading a cast of characters straight out of a prison production of ""Ocean's 11"". Butler is Nick Flanagan, the leader of an elite unit of officers in the L.A. County Sheriff's Office. Nick and his compadres put all of their toughness and above-the-law attitudes on the line in pursuit of ex-Marine Ray Merriman (Pablo Schreiber) and his crew of elite criminals (including 50 Cent as Levi and O'Shea Jackson Jr. as Donnie). Nick gets a hold of Donnie and tries to make him into an informant as Merriman is making plans to steal millions from what is likely the most secure facility in Los Angeles.This action heist thriller, written, which is directed and co-produced by Christian Gudegast, does seem to borrow a lot from the ""Ocean's"" movies, but injects a lot of grittiness and plenty of testosterone into the equation. The machismo can be a bit much and the attempts to humanize Butler's character fall flat (""Looks like I'm getting a divorce.""), but the gunplay is intense, the vehicle play is decent and the twists are good. Action fans will likely be pleased, but few others. ""B-""",Den of Thieves

A diverse just there to make you care for the main character, an over protective parent warning a boy friend on a first date but after sitting through nearly 3 quarters of the film with a story that could have been told in half that time this film drugs, so much so by the time we get to the inevitable shoot out and after you sit and think was that it.

A tough serious crime cop (Gerard Butler) leads a team to try and stop them, using the gang's driver (O'Shea Jackson) as an informant.This crime film is a blatant rip-off of Michael Mann's HEAT (1995) blended with Butler as a Riggs type LETHAL WEAPON character. The action is well handed by first time director Christian Gudegast, the dialogue tough guy stuff, but many of the characters feel underdeveloped. Jackson is good as the informant/driver, Donnie Wilson.",Den of Thieves
75,kuarinofu,"""Heat"" re-imagined by a 12 y.o.",5,21 April 2018,"Clearly inspired by Heat, this movie tries to copy some scenes and introduces a last minute twist that comes as surprising only because you can't believe they would actually go for it.
I did not find any likable characters in this movie, maybe this was the movie's intention, but I don't think it's that smart. We do get some random character backstories for some of them time to time (but not all of them), as well as some general bios just to establish at least something. It would've been ok to have only some of them developed, but these are mostly token characters. Nobody really comes to resembling an actual human being. 
As the story unfolds we see no development at all. There are some random character interactions most of which consist of really awkward dialogue with lots of swearing, like it came right out of a gangsta rap song. There are no visible connections between the Thieves or the Cops. 
The Thieves do no preparations or real planning, but it's ok since the Cops do no real investigative work. They just operate on assumptions and go for big stretches when it comes to decision making, but it always works, so it's fine. They never follow procedures, kidnap and beat people up, hang out with prostitutes, the most likable sort of characters you can get. The plot, being somewhat divorced from reality, just works, without connecting to real world mechanics.
If you've seen Heist you know how the main story line is going to end (besides the twist). The only problem is that in Heist the ending made sense because characters made the decisions you would expect from them, and the rivalry was well set up, De Niro and Pacino needed each other, so their connection was something more than just a cop catching a robber. You knew what was going to happen, and you saw that DeNiro character knew this was going to end this way, but this was just the way he was, his personality. Here, they just throw a random last minute plot device to show that our main ""protagonist"" is supposed to feel something, but we know he's just an ignorant asshole and he doesn't really care (not about his wife, kids, his partners or anything really). I love how he just jumps right into a violent shootout in the middle of a road full of people, getting most of his guys killed...amazing.
Den of Thieves doesn't work on its own, works only as an inferior version of Heist. At least the shootouts were cool, I'd give it that. It's not horrible and it's a good pick if you haven't seen Heist. If you have, there's nothing interesting for you here.",Den of Thieves

79,CANpatbuck3664,Den of Thieves Packs Enough Thrills and Action to Justify a Trip to the Theatre,7,29 January 2018,"Finding out that this movie is directed by first time director Christian Gudegast was surprising. I say that not as a judgement on his body of work, I just thought that this movie featured several strong things that you don't usually get from relatively new people. The best thing in Den of Thieves is that the action is tightly filmed and features some nice shots. The gunfire booms and illuminates the screen and they stick you right in the middle of some tense scenes. They also film those scenes well as you get some good angles in the car chases and the choreography with some of the gunfights was surprisingly solid. While the story meanders at points, you never have any problem when Merriman and his crew are engaged by the police and are trading fire in a shootout.Speaking of the story, a lot of heist movies boil down to how much can you buy into the actual scenario the movie sets up. It doesn't have to be completely realistic, but they have to present it a manner you can believe. They choose not to over explain the heist in Den of Thieves and that is both a positive and a negative. Heist movies tend to dump a lot of exposition and deliberately withhold things from the audience to set up the twist. They find a different angle to set things up in Den of Thieves that is interesting enough to keep your attention and they manage that exposition over 1 scene. I appreciated that they weren't willing to waste our time with that and keep going with the movie.This is a big cast but Gerard Butler ends up doing most of the heavy lifting from an acting perspective. Even though his character is very similar to Alonzo in Training Day, Butler does surprisingly well in this role. This is a step up from Geostorm for Butler and his charisma and screen presence are better utilized here. He's rude and crude but that's essential to his character. The movie tries to show a different side of him that doesn't work completely but he's at his best threatening and intimidating his suspect. O'Shea Jackson Jr. is decent, this is a different kind of role but he's up to the task. I really liked Pablo Schrieber in TV series like American Gods and The Brink. I think he's got a lot of talent and while he's good here, this isn't that breakout role that he needs to become a leading man. His character just doesn't have a lot of depth, maybe he'll catch it with the next one. 50 Cent still isn't much of an actor, but the movie wisely cuts down on his dialogue and uses him more as a physical presence. He can do that, and this is one of his better appearances. Dawn Oliveri is also fine in her short appearance as Nick's wife.The pitfalls of Den of Thieves really come down to just a couple of things. The first is that the character development is very uneven. They just focus it on Nick and characters like Ray, Donnie and Enson are only given small glimpses. This could have helped us like some of them a little better as they all are jerks as characters. The second is that the movie does drag with its long run time. I would say its at least 15 minutes too long and while they needed some things like red herrings to setup the twist at the end, shortening those scenes might have helped the plot flow better. The last is that the ending twist isn't plausible enough for you to accept it. They really throw it in the last 10-20 minutes of the movie and it came out of left field. If they had dropped a couple of hints, maybe it would have felt less tacked on. It didn't wreck the movie for me, but it did feel like a tad too much.I would also make a quick note that this movie might be offensive to some groups. The movie takes pride in being very non-PC, there's homophobic jokes and a ton of male posturing (Nick seems to have a compulsive need to be the alpha male in every situation and isn't afraid to say, threaten or hurt anyone to get that across). So, if that kind of behaviour offends you, this might be one to skip. I've seen a lot worse, so I wasn't so bothered by it that it detracted from my enjoyment of the film. These characters are ""the worst of the worst"" types and painting them in this light isn't inaccurate.I wasn't expecting much from Den of Thieves, but the movie worked as a heist/thriller. A couple of members of the cast turned in some good performances, the plot was intriguing enough and there was some good gritty action top things off. Its far from perfect but not every movie is going to be flawless. I think if you like a good heist movie, are familiar with some of the cast and you aren't determined to look for plot holes, you might walk away from this pleasantly surprised.",Den of Thieves

I say give yourself the freedom to just watch something that isn't politically heavy handed about fish-boning or sad sack townies who expressed themselves on a billboard.This is about man against man. The ""den"" being a wolf den of maniacs and monsters. The real problem is...I wanted a cop who was worse than the criminals. Then it becomes some other kind of movie. In other words...it has no idea what it is. BUT, that is the new template of a Gerard Butler flick. I mean, did it matter how silly ""Olympus Has Fallen"" was? Nope. You had fun. Then later, as you picked apart the logic, you told yourself it's not worth watching again. Though, you DID have fun the first time.
Also, the supporting cast are fun. They literally stop the movie to show that 50 Cent's home life is normal...normal-ish. He's a family man. And it awesome to see writer director Christian Gudegast rip off ""Bad Boys II.""
Anyway, this is like watching too rams pummel each other for a bit. The penis swinging contest isn't actually the centerpiece of the movie.

I Thought Cast WAS GREAT. thing no one knew about this movie was in development for roughly fourteen years, where director Christian Gudegast and a writing partner had a blind deal with New Line Cinema in 2003. The project was also later supposed to be distributed by the now-defunct Relativity Media at one point as well. i am like god !!! this means 14 years i am guessing 2003 or 2004 whatever it would be. god i am like who was originally cast then ???. great cast in movie Gerald Butler great actor in this movie his character was fantastic he nailed it. Gerald Butler was going to be in Pointless Remake Called Point Break (2016) the year before it come out. was a pointless movie he said screw that piece of crap. he did this movie witch is a better movie. now Gerald Butler is great in Olympus Has Fallen, London Has Fallen, Machine Gun Preacher, 300, Gamer. but this was brilliant he is my favorite role in this movie. and 50 cent Curtis Jackson did really i know he is not brilliant actor. but he really does sult for this kinda role for him, i always loved 50 cent. O'Shea Jackson Jr.. Ice Cube Son is in this movie. he did fine he played smart guy. the movie is more of thriller and crime together but action comes later on nothing like you saw on trailer. it's more of action but then you see movie it's thriller and crime together and action comes later. the movie is High PUMPING Adrenaline and sametime it's thrilling very thrilling nothing to hate about this movie at all. DON'T LISTEN TO BS Reviews who loves just Star Wars and Fifty Shades bullcrap. this is worth for movie ticket go and see it, it's really REALLY worth it. Rotten tomatoes critics gave it 39%, and as usual, they are full of crap, the movie is really good. That's why the rotten tomatoes audience score is 87%. First time director Christian Gudegast (writer of screen plays such as A MAN APART, LONDON HAS FALLEN) did an really good job, and looked like a veteran director. he knew everything about Bank Robbery Heist not buy watching another movies besides heat all that he looked at Reality of crime documentary's. really good on director he made his first movie he directed is this Den of Thieves he is great writer of great movies A Man Apart (2003) Vin Diesel, London Has Fallen now this. screw Critics really you listen to them and you gonna like it ? yeah right it's people different opinion they say it's great you will going to hate it or like it what so ever if people say i hated movie got low or didn't get much great Critics you will going to like it and people will hate it. who gives a crap about Critics they all Bullcrap full of it, full of lies, full of it. people check out this movie don't watch red band trailers or any trailer will make you spoil movie. go and see it you only LIVE ONCE in your life. story and direction taken really well. all plot was about A gritty crime saga group of Bank Robbery's Ray Merrimen (Pablo Schreiber) AKA Liev Schreiber (half-brother) You might seen him in 13 Hours, Donnie Wilson (O'Shea Jackson Jr.), Enson Levoux (50 Cent AKA Curtis Jackson) ,Bo 'Bosco' Ostroman (Evan Jones). which follows the lives of an elite unit of the LA County Sheriff's Dept. and the state's most successful bank robbery crew as the outlaws plan a seemingly impossible heist on the Federal Reserve Bank. 'Big Nick' O'Brien (Gerald Butler) was a corrupt LA sheriff who is hellbent on bringing down Merrimen's crew, who plan on robbing the Federal Reserve Bank in Downtown Los Angeles. now he nailed his character he was great character in movie witch i loved in movie he maybe look like a bad guy but he is not really much of good guy ? i know it sounds Confusing but he is Good guy being Bad Guy that's what i got to say. he has wife Holly

93,thomasjay-2201,"Tried to be 'Heat', came out cold",5,10 August 2018,Went into this film with no expectations really and even that 'standard' was lowered. There's little to it really it take me the concept of a popcorn flick to another level removing all substance from the film to just create an action spectacle. There's a few moments of brilliance and/or fun take for example the first action sequence and a lot of the planning however it's all been seen before in the likes of 'Heat' and 'Bad Boys II' so it's nothing original. Pushing out the runtime only increased my boredom with the film as there's little else they can do other than sequel bait and reveal a 'twist' which is unexpected yes but also irrelevant. Just a sub par release but if you have the time and nothing else to do then give it a viewing,Den of Thieves
94,coreyjdenford,A remake of Heat that loses it's heat,4,2 February 2018,"This review of Den of Thieves is spoiler free** (2/5)WITHIN THE OPENING section of writer-director Christian Gudegast's directorial debut Den of Thieves there's a brutal shootout where the shooters execute a clever idea when local police call in - it's an idea that claims the summary of, not just the films plotting, but also the execution of most of its meaty action set-pieces. With that and the stunning overhead shot of the light-filled rain-soaked streets of Los Angeles, it's clearly a promising homage to heist thrillers of old, as co-writer Gudegast makes for a confident substitute for those classical directors. However with the film's other action set-pieces, the set-up of the heists and the plans for the police to chase these criminals. With those in mind, have you guessed it? Yes, it's Michael Mann's Heat; in fact the film doesn't just make those references as homage to the classic 1995 thriller, it's a full-on copy-and-paste job. 
 
Firstly the cast has been substituted from Al Pacino and Robert De Niro instead we have Gerard Butler and Pablo Schreiber. Butler plays Nick 'Big Nick' O'Brien; he's the leader of the Regulators, a unit of elite County Sheriff Deputies. He's a man who spends most of his time eating, a lot. But he's also a man who has a hell of a temper, though instead of yelling ""this is Sparta"" here if you piss him you get bullets in the back. On the other side is Schreiber, he is Ray Merrimen the leader of an elite team of criminals, mostly bank robbers, who plan the biggest robbery in Los Angeles.
 
This surprisingly is within the film's 90 minute mark out of the total 140 minutes of running time, after this, throughout the last 50 minutes the film loses momentum by going through many bad ideas, an overstretched plot and finally a silly end twist which seemingly leaves the one in The Usual Suspects brilliant in comparison. Sure the idea of buffed-up men firing automatic weapons at each other might please some audiences, yet the truth is once the giddy novelty of the brutal, cool opening shootout wears off this is all hokey stuff that, irritatingly, runs for far too long. 
 
Though that's not to say Den of Thieves is a bad heist thriller, as director Gudegast does make some novel choices in his filmmaking, there's a keen montage of each side planning their attack and the film boasts some intriguing camera angles. And while the keen ideas show that the first-time director has experience with the genre. Which he does, having previously wrote A Man Apart and London Has Fallen (also starring Butler) so he certainly knows his way around, but here what should've been a smash-mouth, fast-paced piece of entertainment clocking in at 90 or 100 minutes long it ultimately becomes a 140 minute half-baked pie. Perhaps it would've been better if Pacino was walking around these streets, actually maybe not.
 
VERDICT Starts well by paying energetic homage to classic heist thrillers, ultimately finishes dull sadly missing the mark and losing all its heat.",Den of Thieves
95,DeBBss,Really Wasn't Expecting Much,6,10 December 2018,"I knew this movie was going to be trash, I was actually expecting worse honestly, but it held it's weight enough. Gerard Butler's movies haven't been doing well lately, but his acting really improved. You rarely see good acting in cookie cutter movies like these, I'm really impressed with Gerard Butler.The story is as plain as it gets, and the writers didn't try to add a twist on the good old fashion bank heist. I've seen so many of these movies that it gets to the point where you know what's going to happen. The movie tries to add some twists at the end, but they weren't that mind-bending, and it just wasn't fascinating at all. Usually bank heists get intense at the end, but I was just so bored of it that I just didn't care. Den of Thieves is two hours and twenty minutes, and it just felt so long, and so much parts in the movie felt pointless, and add nothing to the story or characters. The pacing was just all over the placing; this movie is just really sloppy.The characters are forgettable, except for only three main characters, O'Brien (Gerard Butler), Ray Merrimen (Pablo Schreiber),and Donnie Wilson (O'Shea Jackson Jr.). The supporting cast is just lame, they're just there to participate in the heists; they add nothing to the story. Gerard Butler does a fantastic job in such a terrible movie. Gerard Butler does a great job with playing a drunk, angry father; I feel like he should be in more dramas, he really does have the potential to be a drama actor.Den of Thieves isn't an action-packed movie, a lot of the time is spent around O'Brien (Gerard Butler) trying to stop the heist crew. This is one of those movies where you support the protagonists and antagonists. It was sad seeing Ray Merrimen (Pablo Schreiber) die, although he was supposed to be the bad guy; and for that, Den of Thieves deserves an extra point, as it's hard to sympathize with the bad guys in movies. The best part in the movie is the climax, the final shootout is realistic, and everyone gets hurt or dies, no matter how important you are to the story.Den of Thieves is an average heist movies, with few good moments. If Den of Thieves wasn't as sloppy, and if the characters were more interesting, then Den of Thieves could've been good. The acting is good, but the writers messed it all up with the characters and writing. If Den of Thieves was less boring, than it could've been actually thrilling, it had the potential. If you're a fan of heist movies, then you might enjoy this, but for you people who want to be thrilled or entertained, then this is not the movie for you.",Den of Thieves
96,jwscott-home,Really had me thinking the bad guys might win for once....did they?,6,25 February 2019,"Of course not... it set up the main cop to be not a likeable guy which had you pulling for the marines gone bad but as usual in Hollywood the 'star' always wins and frankly that changed my rating from an 8 to a 6... was a very well done robbery flick compared to most but ruined ny the standard good guy wins ending. Come on Hollywood, the bad guys win at least half the time... give us some realism.",Den of Thieves
97,thebricks,Great movie ruined by a silly ending,9,20 January 2018,"Absolutely loved the movie from start to finish. Every actor does a great job in this film. O'Shea Jackson, Paolo Schrieber, Gerard Butler did an incredible job. From start to finish, it was a riveting movie. If I ever rewatch it though, I'm going to ignore the end. It was terrible, a ripoff of The Usual Suspects. I don't even think it worked either, nor did it make sense. They had so much to work with and they just didn't follow up to create a great ending. There is an aspect of Gerard Butler's character and his team that is never answered in the movie. It's just dropped, but it was an element of the character that differentiated this film from other heist movies.It's one of the best heist movies I've seen since Heat and Ocean's Eleven, but the ending was just maddening. It would be a classic otherwise, and it's a shame.",Den of Thieves
98,Alanjackd,Typical butler,2,5 February 2018,Like I said...typical Butler...I fail to see why he's allowed to make movies. He cannot act and he has no screen presence whatsoever.This is a shameful waste of good movie making money spent on this rubbish.I deserve an oscar for sitting till the end. It tries to be clever but falls flat and is like a clip movie of other movies like Heat and Triple 9 .Ridiculous gun scenes and muscles galore with a nice batch of testosterone makes this a movie only men will dislike.Don't bother...really..it's just not worth leaving home for.,Den of Thieves
99,ginocox-206-336968,"Familiar, but effective action/heist thriller",8,12 April 2018,"""Den of Thieves"" is a heist film with the grittiness of ""Heat,"" the impossibly unassailable target of ""Loophole"" and ""Mission Impossible,"" the cunning misdirection of ""Ocean's Eleven"" and a dash of ""The Fast and the Furious."" As the directorial debut of Christian Gudegast, who also wrote the screenplay, it is not as polished as some of the films from which it draws inspiration and to which it invites comparison, but it is a worthy entry into the genre. Many scenes and plot devices seem evocative of other films. A climatic shoot-out invites comparison to ""Heat,"" as does the protagonist's marital discord and the hijacking of an armored truck. While these scenes seem evocative of other films, they are presented with enough freshness that they don't seem derivative. At 140 minutes, the film is a bit long. While some movies can run over two hours and leave the audience wishing there were more, DoT never succeeds in engaging the audience so thoroughly. Some scenes seem as if they would have been obvious candidates for trimming. A scene in which Nick (Butler) drinks milk and a playground scene come to mind. DoT presents a fantastic plot with enough detail and to seem nearly plausible. There are twists, turns, reversals of fortune and other plot devices to maintain interest.",Den of Thieves
100,EvanKevelson,Way too long for a simple story...,5,13 July 2020,"There are numerous side stories that are inserted that don't reveal anything about the character or the story.
There is a scene dedicated to Curtis Jackson scaring the daylights out of his daughters prom date serving no purpose.
A few scenes with Butlers wife running out the door with his daughters based on a text without the audience knowing weather he was even married, nor was their any indicator he was doing anything beyond being in a room with strippers as Butler and his team are about to do an illegal interrogation.
As far as the twist of ""Donnie"" unlike ""The Usual suspects"" there is no clear explanation how he pulled off the switch or when, pulling the wool over the eyes of the crew and the cops.

101,kaptenvideo-89875,"Heard lot of bad about it before seeing it, but its quite ok!",7,14 May 2018,"A gritty saga which follows an elite police unit and a successful bank robbery crew as the outlaws plan a seemingly impossible heist on the Federal Reserve Bank.Starring Gerard Butler, Pablo Schreiber, O'Shea Jackson, 50 Cent and a bunch of bad mother lovers, four of which are UFC fighters in real life.I honestly don't understand why this action drama has not been getting better reviews (39/100 at Rotten Tomatoes, 49/100 at Metacritic). ""Den of Thieves"" is a perfectly serviceable cocktail of all the best modern crime and/or heist movies that you have seen and loved already.So what if it's a bit too long at 140 minutes? There's no useless content that just begs to be cut out and left in the editing room. On the contrary, some storylines here would actually need more space to become really effective, such as the Big Nick's family drama. Not that I would like to see it cut out.And so what if the story is mostly made of cliches? After all these years and myriad of crime movies, it would prove near impossible here to offer something previously unseen anyway.The best crime movies, however, achieve freshness by visual style and interesting-enough characters whose lives you would actually like to follow, and ""Den of Thieves"" is good enough on both accounts. It's a fully-fledged world, not a shooting gallery with some added storytelling.It's not a masterpiece. It would benefit from some tigher editing, especially during the long heist section, for example, but there's nothing wrong with the movie either. Except if you don't believe in Gerard Butler's star power, or don't care about tough crime stories in general.The project actually lies on even two men's star power, Butler and Schreiber, and neither will disappoint.There's something about Butler's gruff machoisms that I just love even in weaker movies (let's call it a guilty pleasure), and Schreiber is just perfect in every role he does. A true next-gen screen star that deserves to go big as fast as possible.You may remember his multifaceted - sometimes horrifying, sometimes touching - performance in ""Orange Is the New Black"". Here, he is on full action mode, which is even cooler.""Den of Thieves"" is a good showcase for all of his strengths, an impressive acting range and presence, and buffed-up physique perfect for action-filled projects such as this.A word of warning though. ""Den of Thieves"" is not interested in going somewhere fast, so if you want just some quick thrills, you are in trouble.It's a slow-burn story which takes time with everything (in a good way, I'd say). It's not about offering cinematic fast food although all these guns, muscles and macho men from trailer may suggest otherwise.The only flaw could be the chosen format. The movie is so expansive that it would really work better as (mini-)series or something. 140 minutes is just not enough to properly fully develop everything ""Den of Thieves"" has to offer, starting from the characters and ending with the world they're living in.Luckily for me, screenwriter and director Christian Gudegast has a chance to do even better with the planned sequel. He's done his directing debut now, and has probably learned some about making a tighter movie for the next round.",Den of Thieves

The movie opens saying that ""Los Angeles is the robbery capital of the world and that a heist occurs every 48-minutes."" None of this is verified so...............This appears like a run-of-the-mill robbery. There is a twist later on and then you see this was NOT a run-of-the-mill robbery. The title suggests that no one can be trusted. Who will be your pick?We see Det Nick's men trying to figure out Merriman's next move and why did he rob an armored truck that was empty. We also see Merriman scheming with his men how the next heist will go down. We see this back and forth many times. Merriman knows that Det Nick has been talking to Donnie and will use that to his advantage. We will see where the heist will take place and we will see very complicated and integrated procedures that make a heist impossible. There is a plot hole that if I mentioned it, I would give away too much. There are scenes of Levi's (50 Cent) daughter going out on a date and was given the TALK about caring for his daughter or else to the boy. Those scenes could have and should have been cut.Notables: Dawn Olivieri as Debbie, Nick's wife who is divorcing him; 50 Cent as Levi or Curtis and he is Merriman's right-hand man; Meadow Williams as Holly, a hooker who gives false information to Det Nick; Mario Cortez as SWAT negotiator.Keep the title in mind as this has to do with the twist.

107,gabriel_sanchez,OK B-action movie,6,23 April 2018,"Den of Thieves (2018) is a B-action flick that doesnt do anything over the top. It's pretty much a good movie to watch with enough spare time to do something else later to clear up your mind.I think what will drive most people kinda mad is the fact that there are no likeable characters, but maybe that's the point, maybe that's why it's known as Den of Thieves, because pretty much all of them are corrupt in some way.The plot is thin, to say the least. Everything kinda evolves way too fast towards something that is kind of predictable. There are some plot twists for some good matter, but the overall story is way too shallow.You need to watch it for what it is. No great movie by any means; watch it for the sport!",Den of Thieves

The film tells that old tale of a crew wanting to make one big last heist.The build up is pretty good. The close bulldog like behavior of the crew leader and the dirty cop is good, although not as interesting as that which we've seen in 'Heat'.Ultimately the heist itself was a let down, it didn't really make sense and we as the audience wernt told the plan so we don't really know if something is going right or wrong; thus dissolving the tension.In the end I was a little disappointed and this doesn't even live up to something like 'Heat'. Of course they have a few shootouts that were filmed well enough, but my grip on the story was already gone.6/10, this film needed a neater plan of events and fewer plot holes.",Den of Thieves

And it's even weirder when the same guy pops up at the end - turns out it's Ice's son, Dave Cube I think his name is - with his idea of an English accent.Those moments bookend a film in which for long spells nothing happens. Though obviously modelled on Heat, it doesn't miss the latter's double-star power. Gerard Butler, the coolest thing to come out of Scotland since Sean Connery - though that's no' saying awfae much - carries it as well as anyone could. But it's a long wait till the climactic shoot-out which, even then, is reminiscent of Sicario without being as good.Beyond that, there's a problem with heist films in general. They're like stage magic: yes it's all very clever, but who cares? They get away with the dough, or they don't - you never feel it matters much which. Somebody must have like this though - I'm really surprised to see that a sequel is being prepared.As for Dave Cube - you have to think he's too little to make it as an action film lead.

114,shoobe01-1,"Does some stuff as well as it can be, a little let down in the end",7,3 June 2020,"Toss the first 24 minutes and start over. First, a Rip Off of Heat. Sure, it's been decades, you can do that. But I don't mean thematically similar, I mean there are lines that are +/- identical. I almost turned it off when Gerard Butler first shows up, expected him to leave the Pacino lines and demand a hard target search of every... because it was that trite.Then it got its stride. And what it is above all else is telling a story. The plot is a bit dumb, there's lots of unlikely tropes, and gaps (where are the rest of the police cars?) in the plot, but they do three things that make this work:
1) Are absolutely invested in it. Everyone is clearly a character with some back story, and cares about what's up.
2) Ignore the gaps. No need to explain jargon, dive into where the guns, explosives, gear, etc. come from or where they live or anything. It just all is and since everyone acts for a change like it is real, it works.
3) It is edited amazingly. You know the storytelling thing where you jump around to see the action being described? Never seen it done so well here, and then it didn't jarringly pop back, but they used jumping between two actions, two points of view, better than most films I have seen.It is engaging as hell. It absolutely does not feel like a 2:20 movie. Buzzes by like it's under 90 minutes. I was surprised how much time had passed.If this had a script to support the photography, acting, and editing, it would be a hell of a movie. Legendary.Also, once again, how many embarrassing tapes of people does Curtis Jackson have for his blackmail campaign?

They smoke, they drink, they've got big hands and they fight.Gerard Butler is excellent in this. With a character name of Big Nick, he fills that role and acts like a womanising, hard drinking, selfish Alpha. His enemy in the film, Merrimen, acts the same and it makes for a refreshingly male centric film. The characters feel real and they feel dangerous.The gun fights and soldiering in this is really good. The sound of the guns is incredibly loud which adds a real frisson of tension and reality when they happen. The film feels like a proper 'jungle' as these two big cats circle each other waiting for the other to make their play.Great acting by those involved, a clever and intricate heist and some really great tension building music by Cliff Martinez.

In this you can tell the director told Gerald Butler to do a ""bad lieutenant"" impression, hell they even named dropped it like we were supposed to be impressed.So yeah you know do bad guy things, drink, smoke, yell and curse and be awful.Its almost painful to watch because you can tell hes not into it and he's struggling. I wish we could stop hiring British and Australian actors to play silly american caricatures. There's a part where he's supposed to be hungover and eating a crudy donut. Ideally, it would seem typical and enjoyable for him, but its clear he doesn't want to and is just trying so hard to make it look natural and failing horribly.The rest of the characters act fairly natural and the movie gets by, but Gerald was really poorly cast and it hurts the film. They needed somebody who could pull off a more natural corrupt LA detective type.It was just ""ok"". I'm not sure about recommending it. Its a guy, heist film. Keep your expectations low or just watch anything michael cain has done instead. Like literally hes the ""heist"" actor. Anything from 1970-on. ...You know whats really good? ""Thief"" with James Cann. watch that instead. trust me. Oops actually thats also a Michael Mann film..you know..HEAT.",Den of Thieves

But this film, starting out okay, turned into a complete non event. There was nobody to root for. The cops were horrible and you don't know the villains. The story was painfully drawn out. The tension was non existent. The final shoot out non-sensical. The cop and wife story a worn out cliche.The way this was filmed was good. All the actors are credible.

Gerard Butler, who also produced gives one of his better performances as an out of control cop and is well supported by Pablo Schreiber as the leader of a gang of bank robbers.

An elite group of County Sheriff Deputies look to stop a gang of thieves planning to rob the Federal Reserve in Los Angeles. It received mixed reviews and grossed $79 million worldwide. The critical consensus feels it never comes close to living up to its obvious inspirations. However, audiences polled gave the film an average grade of B+.

This is a decent heist film that critics panned because they chose not to judge it for what it was meant to be.",Den of Thieves
140,rioplaydrum,Smokin' Good,8,23 January 2018,"Gerard Butler plays Sheriff Nick Flanagan, head of a rough and tumble team of hardened cops tracking expert bank robbers in Southern California.Nick is on the verge of serious occupational burn-out. Nick isn't that young anymore, yet he drinks and smokes heavily, parties all night with strippers and has to contend with a marriage long since failed, all while emerging every morning, craggy faced and stinking of booze to maniacally track and chase down the bad guys. Having to jockey for authority against a crisp and clean FBI agent is no help either. All sounds pretty cliché, doesn't it? Not this time.Christian Gudegast and crew have managed to craft together a wild and fast tale of cops and robbers infiltrating each other's clans to play a very deadly game of cat and mouse.I was immediately reminded of 1995's 'Heat' starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro (long before Bob ruined his reputation by turning into a jack-ass). All the heavy weight personas in 'Thieves' drip of sweat and desperation, perfectly matched by the background of a sweltering Los Angeles and a foreboding soundtrack composed by Cliff Martinez. What Gudegast has created triples the gun fire and intense standoffs with a dizzying display of military grade weapons.In fact, there is enough testosterone, bullets, muscles, and attitude to make any Hell's Angel down another shot and beat the living daylights out of that wimp at the end of the bar.There is one surprisingly comic bit thrown in spontaneously I'll refer to as the 'On The Way To Prom' scene featuring a very nervous suitor of one of the bad guy's daughters. If you're a father you'll crap your pants laughing.The gun play in 'Thieves' is excessive, but somehow doesn't feel gratuitous or unnecessary. It's just there and doesn't offer any apologies. There was one major jump-cut in the middle of the story that left me a little confused, but no matter. I was also bothered by the two hour and twenty minute run time going in thinking, 'Oh, no. Not another one of these', but the film doesn't give you a single chance to get bored.Great twist at the end, too.Fast, gritty and loaded with bad-boy fun. I enjoyed it immensely.",Den of Thieves

Den even copied a few lines right out of Heat. That this film is an unofficial remake of Heat shouldn't discourage you from watching it. It's actually quite good. Den of Thieves improves on parts where Heat fell short. Although Heat did have two superstars and an awesome shoot-out scene, the script was weak and the film dragged at times. Den does a better job of integrating personal life with the cops-and-robbers life. The script is better, the dialogue is more natural and the chemistry among the actors is better. And Den holds its own in the action department. Den does have a glaring plot hole created by the inadequate explanation of how one robber managed to regain the leader's trust so easily after being interrogated by the police.

Despite clearly being a film of it's genre, it has no typical exaggerated violence or unnecessary clichés, though there is shooting and violent behavior enough. The main roles, one gangster and on cop, are both brilliantly executed by Pablo Schreiber and Gerard Butler. But the side casts with for instance 50 cent and O'shea Jackson jr., are just as brilliant, and there are small parallel stories in between, quite perfectly balancing the story. This gives another dimension to the characters, avoiding to make them seem to stereotypical. It's easy to imagine that director and writer Christian Gudegast, together with actors and crew, have had a great but nevertheless exhausting production. On top of it all they've even managed to come out with a surprising finale. Well done all the way. Simply a great movie!",Den of Thieves

146,DBLurker,Den of Heat,5,24 July 2018,"So I saw this movie right after watching Heat for the first time few days ago.This movie blatantly tries to copy Heat. Like REALLY copy it. Scenes, moments, shootouts, the director barely tried to do anything different. And in what he DOES do different, the result is.. average.First things first. The acting is horrible. The only person trying to act is Butler, but that's to be expected. In Heat, you had two opposing factions, with actors like Pacino, Niro and Kilmer making you feel love/hate even for the criminals. Hell, eeven the families and love interests have a part to pay in Heat.In Den of Thieves? The only character you care a ""bit"" about is Butler's. But even then, his character is mostly awful so there isn't much to like, compared to Pacino's character who was shown to be a mere human, despite being a dedicated detective machine. Meanwhile in DoT, you have awful actors like 50 Cent who can't act their way out of a paper bag.Then the heist. It's alright. But relies way too much on luck and coincidences. You'd think that a movie 23 years after Heat, trying to copy it, would try to improve upon the formula. But they just settle for same and even less.I think the biggest problem I had was that these ""marines"" felt like a bunch of amateurs when handling weapons. Remember the ending gunfight in Heat and how professional the robbers looked when handling weapons. Val Kilmer especially looked smooth and their handling felt so natural. In DoT? They feel so amateur, especially the cops. The ending fun-fight was just them shooting a bunch of cars instead of a bunch of people (which is a miracle since cars were still full of people in most shots).Overall, I felt like the director could've gone beyond Heat and made it something more. Instead he just settled on copying Heat.. badly.Going to give it 5/10 since I think this is still a step up compared to most such movies and it wasn't THAT bad that I would give it less than a 5. It's a popcorn flick. Will not leave a lasting impact like Heat did.",Den of Thieves

I felt they also enhanced the action somewhat, and certainly the violence, cranking up the bang to level 11. There were some great suspenseful scenes and also some interesting family drama.

151,alexqueens,Bank Heists for Tough Guys,8,30 October 2019,"Gerard Butler is a man of variety. From throwaway romcoms to saving world leaders with all guns blazing, he's also a lovable family man if need be.
A distinction I deliberately set out to witness by watching two movies not too far from each other. The first being in the role of the aforementioned family man in the surprisingly titled A Family Man, with the 2nd being this, A Den of Thieves.
I'm happy to say that the roles couldn't be more different.
Butler brings a solid performance as a rogue grisly-bear captain of a Major Crimes unit that isn't too fond of lawful procedures. A role that almost resembles Michael Chiklis's corrupt Vic Mackey character in the 7-season perfection series that is The Shield - the most bold, grittiest and most frighteningly realistic crime show to have ever graced a screen.
If anyone reading this has a liking for movies such as Den of Thieves and has never watched The Shield in its entirety, then you ain't livin', you're sleepin'.
The good news is, the series has since been remastered on Blu-ray and waiting for newbies to wet themselves with adrenaline and excitement with each passing episode they indulge in.
I mean, it only won 15 awards and got nominated for 59 awards during its 7-year run.Back to Den of Thieves.
I can't get over how O'Shea Jackson Jr. is almost a spitting image of his dad, Ice Cube. Albeit, the much younger version of Ice Cube. Even more so in the mannerisms and down to the walk and ticks. Funny how that happens.
Although I'm hoping my own son, once grown and fully blossomed, will mostly resemble his mother than myself. Cos she's way prettier than I am.
50Cent, for a rapper, is very softly spoken here and barely says much. Regardless, I think it works well.All in all, the tension in this movie was dialled up to 11 in its 2nd half. For me anyway.

It was between this, Pitch Perfect 3, and Paddington 2. She'd never heard of it, and all I knew about it was that it was a bank heist movie and it had Gerard Butler, 50 Cent, Ice Cube's son and the actor who plays Pornstache in OITNB. Needless to say an interesting cast. This movie had a lot of marketing behind it, I saw a lot of interviews beforehand and semi anticipated it. If you're a fan of 50 cent let me give you a little warning: He has very little screen time in this film. There are a lot of scenes in this movie that seem to be there just for crowd pleasing. They really have no relevance to the story. That's rare for a movie to have and yet still not be terrible. But it's very much in plain sight. When the films over you recall these scenes and realize, wait a minute, what was the point of that? At the end of the movie my girlfriend had a look of sheer disappointment in her face. I was taken aback. The movie was better than I expected. The heist was clever, engaging, suspenseful, coherent and directed well. I enjoyed seeing Gerard Butler steal the screen and I loved how there basically was no protagonist, there's two sets of bad guys to root for. It even had a twist at the end. Perhaps it was the exceeding of my low expectations that caused me to enjoy this film. My girlfriend on the other hand, with no expectations, was left in a stupor.

Before even reading these reviews & eventually seeing ""Den of Thieves» for the first time. While their are similarities, like thieves & robberies, the idea that it's the same film only less than is a joke. My God, it's like every buddy cop movie is a lethal weapon lite or knockoff, every rich guy falls in love with poor girl is pretty woman knockoff, every spy movie is a knockoff of bond, mission impossible or Bourne. We as humans don't live very complex lives. There's love, murder, crime, comedy, fighting, sex, love triangle, & a few other things to write a story around but just the fact the character/actors are different unfortunately kills all your arguments/complaints that it's same movie cuz It's the first time those characters have gone thru that situation. Characters with own personalities & own script. Unless it's a remake & even then it's not necessarily to the tee same movie majority of time. I mean after ova a hundred yrs of about a million plus movies being made, to expect original storylines/plots in 2021 is a little naive. Even for those rare few who are under impression they are seeing something never been done before, we are sad to inform y'all, it's been done to some extent.I'm not saying it's wrong to put this movie side by side to Heat however & come to a conclusion of whether one is better than the other. It's same style of movie & when reviewing it's helpful to compare to similar movies. I just hate the condemning of any movie on merit it's been done before. The movie on its own merit, is actually pretty good. Wouldn't say it's great, as I would recommend Heat or Takers. But chances are most have seen those already.

From the beginning there's a very macho feeling going around, and that is just good enough for two laughs. So the movie got me over the ""20 minutes mark""... poor me. By the time the heist started I realized my thoughts were drifting away for quite some time, I even missed the twist in the heist, so I asked my wife what happened but she was half a sleep. Maybe there was no real twist, only a big black hole.
By then the last action part started, a B-movie like chase, so I went with it. And even I didn't follow the movie, I knew how it would end. I stood up, started filling my glas of water, got a beer for the next movie, and meanwhile I could confirm I was right about the end.This movie is a new low for Gerard. This is a straight to dvd movie with to many testosteron, stupid macho behaviour. Not one character is likeable, only guys with muscles and a bad mouth.

The biggest drawback for Den of Thieves is it borrows a lot from superior heist films like Heat and The Town and from this it just feels like it's ticking boxes. If you haven't seen those films then you'll probably enjoy it more just because it's so well made in terms of lighting, editing and sound which are done considerably well. It's sun drenched cinematography also looks great giving it a bleak atmospheric look. It is nonetheless enjoyable with a few tense moments throughout. Gerard Butler chews the scenery and does a decent job. He's a rundown weary person who goes to extreme measures to get the job done. You'll find yourself feeling some sympathy for him as he goes through a divorce as well as battling with his own inner demons. However less can be said about the lead characters who feel like they were taken straight from a Grand Theft Auto game. We are expected to root for them but they have no regard for anyone but themselves. We never really understand their motivations and they all come across as bitter with no morals. It even tries to make them relatable as some of them are shown to have families. But since the film introduces them as reckless cop killers it just makes them very unlikeable. Don't be fooled by the trailers because it's more of a drama thriller with barely any action scenes which is good but it just isn't engaging enough. With a running of over two hours there will be times when you get bored with it. It would have felt less cluttered of it was 90 minutes because there are scenes thrown in that feel unnecessary. In the end it's a serviceable heist thriller with some good acting, relentless shootout scenes and a decent finale but it just lacks originality and often moves at a plodding pace. If you want to watch a great heist film I'd recommend Public Enemies or Heat.",Den of Thieves

But... for me, it was a bit difficult to like any of the characters. Butler plays such an unlikeable role that I almost switched to the thieves. But here, Schreiber does the same thing. Maybe even more unlikeable due to his ratty face. But this is personal ofcourse. 50 Cent and the Samoa characters bring some natural charisma to the movie. The script is good, the camerawork and editing are great and you can't help thinking of Heat because of the powerplay between the two leads. But it's less intelligent and a bit more on steroids.

The group that robs banks together, hangs out together. But the rob an armored car with no money in it. Why? Hmmm.... are they just too dumb? But they aren't dumb. They have a plan to use it to commit the impossible robbery. (See Oceans 11) But somehow our hero / anti-hero knows exactly who the bad guys are. And they taunt each other in public.

(Very poor, cheating with a wink and nod to a movie we've all seen.)There are several very major problems with this film:1. Heat has been done before. And at least in that film the ""confrontation"" between good and evil made sense and wasn't forced like a square peg into a round hole like this one.2. The good wasn't even ""good."" They appeared to be a bunch of hard living, at least semi-corrupt cops who need to show their tattoos to the really bad guys just to show how bad they really were. Good grief. You don't really care about either side very much.3. There are substantial leaps of logic one has to believe, especially in the last third of the film. They don't make sense and are sometimes completely laughable, such as how to clear dozens of cars for an uninterrupted gun battle.4. The ending... the subterfuge didn't make sense and, even less sense, is how Mr. ""I've investigated everything"" somehow didn't spot what was clearly in front of his face. Hmmm.... which leads to.5. The audience is fooled by cheating on the reveal. It's not fair to the audience when you show them perhaps 2% of a conversation and then later say ""oh, here's the rest of it that changes the entire context of what we know was designed to mislead you."" I am not impressed.6. The entire personal life of Butler's ""good"" character was completely unnecessary. It was a lame, half baked attempt to engage in character building, of which there really was none.7. The twists and turns and seductions make little sense are are wholly unnecessary. And the obvious nature of the final setup was beyond silly, poorly done, and the ability to do the math by the characters in our script was equally lousy and amateurish.8. If you're trying to suspend the disbelief of doing the hardest job imaginable you have to make the audience believe that somehow you've covered every angle... which they didn't. In fact they screwed up what could have been the easiest angle to cover (chinese food) and the plan should unquestionably have failed from the multiple loose ends of that doozy of an open end. Just.... wow. 9. If you're going to have a 2+ hour movie, you better have something to say. This had a lot of unnecessary subplot filler that made it feel even more like a cheap copy of Heat.This is a B- movie of Heat and that other film you will know immediately after the reveal. The reason for it being a 5 is because the actors do a good job with what they have for the most part and because it has some laughs. Those laughs happen to detract from the reality of the film and which make these characters, especially Butler's, completely cartoonish. This had the potential to be a good film and probably at least a B+ if it didn't go the direction of trying to force the cleverness of other formulas into this film. I had a hard time believing the steps to the payoff and the payoff for me was leaving the theater. Entertaining - enough not to be bored waiting for the reveals.

Round out the cast with a rapper and the son of a rapper and you have a tailor made B-movie that shouldn't take itself too seriously. At first, that is pretty much what you get, but then it slowly becomes clear that Den of Thieves is blissfully unaware that it is bad. There are several subplots that belong in a more serious movie that bloat the runtime up to a lengthy 2 hours and 20 minutes when it should be a full hour shorter. The script tries to get way too clever for its own good adding twists and turns that feel more ridiculous than enjoyable. First time director Christian Gudegast clearly demonstrates that his talents unfortunately lie elsewhere as he incorporates several shots that would feel heavy handed in even the most serious dramas. On a positive note, the action sequences are fairly exciting even if it took an odd route to get there. The heist itself was the highlight of the movie and despite a few plot holes it played on screen about as well as any movie heists this side of the Ocean's trilogy. They were also able to recapture Heat's ambiguity as to who is the protagonist, though it was less through making both sides appealing and more through just wedging in that they all love their families.If you are looking for a fun heist movie, then check out Netflix, because there are a lot of better ones out there than this.",Den of Thieves
172,dafoat,"Like ""Heat"" - only boring",5,5 May 2018,"This movie has a few fun moments, and all of the performances are solid. But it's too long by at least twenty minutes. The subplot about O'Brien's troubled marriage does nothing to deepen his character or advance the plot. It could have easily been removed. There are far too many scenes of big, musclebound dudes posturing and trying to intimidate each other, and not enough action. The final gun battle was particularly frustrating to me. The whole point of staging a gunfight on a crowded road is that there are innocent bystanders who might get killed in the crossfire. But once the shooting starts it's painfully obvious that most of the cars on the road are empty. There are a couple of shots of O'Brien shouting for people to ""get down."" So I suppose we're supposed to believe that every passenger in every car crawled so far under their dashboard that they can't be seen at all. And none of the bystanders screams, or calls out, or tries to get out of the way.Of course choregraphing a battle with dozens of extras would have been more time consuming and expensive. But it also would have made for a more exciting scene. And actually shooting in Los Angeles instead of Atlanta would have been more expensive as well. But then the movie would actually look like it took place in LA. And finally the plot device of the EMP gadget is just silly. The rest of the film goes out of it's way to feel gritty and naturalistic.

175,neobateman,"Cheap, dull copy of Heat.",4,30 June 2018,"Den of Thieves is an action thriller directed by Christian Gudegast, this was his directorial debut however he also wrote London Has Fallen. Gerard Butler also joins this heist caper as the brutal police officer trying to take down this group of bank robbers that are plaguing Los Angeles. The plot of this movie sounds very familiar, that is because it was done many times before. Most notably in Michael Mann's Heat. I will try not to compare this film to Heat too much, however some contrasts will be brought up to explain why that film worked and Den of Thieves doesn't. There are a few action scenes in this film such as chases and shootouts. Most of these are fairly dull, not that they are badly pulled of but they're just basic, there is one really terrific chase towards the end of the film that was suspenseful and riveting. However I can not say that about the rest of the movie. One of the first major problems I encountered was the characters. Gerard Butler plays the cop Nicolas 'Big Nick' O'Brien, Butler isn't an actor with a lot of range but he functions in this role. The actor wasn't the problem, he was convincing with his large body mass, tattoos, facial hair and aggressive attitude, and when I say aggressive, I mean it. This character is so macho, over the top and violent, treating others with no respect whatsoever that I never rooted for him. Now there are films where the main character is unlikeable but the viewer is intrigued by him or her, wanting to find out what they're about. A key example of this is Klaus Kinski in Werner Herzog's Aguirre: The Wrath of God. This does not apply here, 'Big Nick' is just a bad cop that if he existed in real life would destroy any integrity that the L.A. Police had left. I was rooting more for the bad guys who seemed to have more genuine motivation to get the money. It wasn't all that compelling but it made more sense and I thought they had more of a morality. The beauty of Mann's Heat is the fact that both Al Pacino (the cop) and Robert De Niro (the criminal) play flawed characters. De Niro is the robber risking the lives of innocent and Pacino is the aggressive and charismatic police officer. As flawed as they are, they have redeeming qualities that makes the audience see them as people. They were just normal everyday folks with jobs, one being with and another against the law. O'Brien has none of these qualities, he was entertaining to watch simply because Butler had charisma. Other performances were mostly forgettable with no other character receiving any chance to shine. The writing is unrealistic for a film like this and doesn't engage the audience. The film looks cheap with obvious lighting and basic camera techniques. This is a Michael Mann film without the talent or effort that is generally put into one of Mann's films. The fact that this is Heat rip off could be forgiven if this film was fun, if it had good performances, characters or even action sequences. This film fails in all of this and is only somewhat redeemed by a fun performance by a central star and some generic action scenes.",Den of Thieves

Written and directed by Christian Gudegast
Gerard Butler as a hard drinking cop with family issues chasing down a team of finely tuned bank robbers, what could go wrong with this idea? Well if the bank robbers are basically automations. They have little to no personality.
Gerard Butler is the only character in the movie with any sort of nuisance and personality. It makes getting through this movie a slog.The reason for that is because there is little to no action in this action film. We need strong characters to lead us on this path. There is a way to do this type of movie. There are actually two very strong examples. One being Heat directed by Michael Mann and the other is The Town directed by Ben Affleck. They have strong characters and a good back and forth between the cop chasing the robber and the crew themselves. Den of Thieves tries to make the hunt interesting but fails because Pablo Schrieber is a wooden plank in this movie. This hurts to say because he's a good actor in other things. Stoic doesn't suit him though. The other members of his crew which includes 50 Cent who has always been a dull block of wood in movies even the movie based on his own life and O'Shea Jackson Jr who has also been excellent in other movies.As far as Gerard Butler's crew those guys are even more faceless. I wanted to be invested in what happened to them when they finally encounter each other. The movie doesn't use much in the way of a score. Normally I would love this sort of thing. It can work wonders but the importance of music shows itself when the silence doesn't work.This is a missed opportunity much like Triple 9 was. Everything was in place for this to be an exciting action film but for some reason it just did not work for me. I give this movie a D.",Den of Thieves

Instead, this movie drags with its 2 hours and 20 minute run time which is full of unlikable characters that you don't particularly connect with.Granted, this film doesn't want you to 'like' many of its characters but the suedo machismo of the script felt generic and generally not that interesting in the current era of movies. It felt as if it wanted to be something like Sicario with its commentary but falls short of telling a suspenseful and dark story like the former. The shootouts/heist sequencers are entertaining enough alongside to give it an average rating but I couldn't give it anything more. It doesn't help that parts of the plot also didn't make a great deal of sense as well.With the featured cast, I expected a bit more balls to the wall action and high octane chase sequences/shoot outs rather than the bloated and somewhat po faced story it tells here. If the movie had more guns and less sleaze, it would probably be a lot more entertaining.Try something like The Town with Ben Affleck if you're looking for a more character driven heist movie.",Den of Thieves
189,jetskiboybze,Interesting but not fully captivating,7,31 July 2019,I know its been said but this is not Heat although it tries very hard to be and falls short. The plot steals virtually all of its drama from Heat except for a more convoluted (and clever) heist. This doesnt make it better and like others I found that it dragged in large portions. As with Heat I liked the bad guys better than the good and in this area it scored because I hated Big Nick with a fervour. He had no redeeming qualities and even though you knew he would win out you didnt want him to because of his basic character flaws. The bad guys (excellently headed by Schreiber) were more emotionally approachable and so I hoped for a good end for them. I wish it hadnt taken so much from Heat as it was never going to be as good and would have preferred if it tried to stand on its own merits. Unlike some I thought the shootouts were less believable than they should have been with much wasted ordnance for supposedly proffessionals. In this area Heat totally blew it away. Try to watch it preHeat then see how its done. I would watch it again but am torn with the blatant theft from a better film.

I was psyched at the cast and it looked to be an engaging heist movie, and it's been a while since I'd seen one. The heist itself is pretty tense and smartly done. Nothing supernatural and no flashy muscle cars or over the top secret agent stuff. I believed these guys could pull off the heist they came up with and the red herring was believable. The issues I had were Gerard Butler's character and that there seemed to be a lack of denouement; we never get the payoff promised by the two type A leaders. It's anti-climactic at best. Also, the side story about Gerard Butler's character and his personal woes, leads nowhere. We get it, he's married to the job. That could have been established with a cell phone call telling him his wife left. Or not even addressing it. This movie tried to be Heat, Training Day, Inside Man and slightly Point Break, all in one, but it could have been just a good heist movie given some better interactions between the cops and robbers.

Tough cop that's all consuming, results in tattered relationships. Worthy adversary, hell bent on committing suicide by cop. Bank jobs, smart thieves, etc.It was very watchable. The director clearly tries to out-do the gun battle from Heat, but he fails on two points. First, the gun battle in Heat was based on a true story, and second, police do not pursue suspects with such aggression when there are a hundred or so civilian lives at stake.If you can ignore the sheer lunacy of this attempt at truly defying logic and abusing the 'suspension of disbelief' to the point where reality lies somewhere between Cops and The Dukes of Hazzard then it's very watchable.",Den of Thieves

The concept was fun but not original we get like 10 movies like this one each year and this one was not the exceptional one. Sure it's fun to watch an heist movie, still with this one they were so many misakes and such a terrible predictable end this movie should of just not been made.

215,naregian,"A fun, well paced movie that isn't pretending to be something it's not",8,20 January 2018,"You can't enter a movie like this expecting some cinematic masterpiece. If you do so, you'll be obviously disappointed. Otherwise, it's a completely entertaining and fun ride through some surprisingly complex characters and an unexpectedly intricate game of cat and mouse.There have been some comparisons of this movie to the movie Heat, and I think they may be somewhat warranted. OBVIOUSLY, this does not hold the gravitas of a mid-90's DeNiro/Pacino face-off, but plot structure, pacing, character development and the Los Angeles backdrop were all very familiar. At the core, you have Pablo Schreiber, who is 1 or 2 decent movies away from being given a real shot at a career defining role. He led this film effortlessly and truly gives you a very raw sense of character. Gerard Butler plays Gerard Butler and convincingly so. The two square off for 140 minutes and it's surely fun to watch.The 140 minute runtime seems to have garnered some attention from reviewers. Yeah, it's long, but it really doesn't feel that way. The pace of the film is stellar, and you never really feel any ""look down at your phone"" moments. The heist movie is often times full of overdone clichés and unconvincing ""suspense"" but for some reason this film was able to put a fresh twist on everything you see. If you've seen a trailer for the film, you'll be very happy with it. I think this is a case of extremely good marketing and a trailer can make or break your audience's expectations for a film. From the trailer, you see a crew of goons led by some wannabe badass and a crew of cops trying to intimidate them and take them down. The trailer doesn't give you much of a glimpse at anything more than elementary storyline, which is why if you see this film, you'll be pleasantly surprised.

The action scenes were great and not too over the top. The Chemistry between Merriman and O'brien was fantastic and their scenes together Kept me on the edge of my seat not knowing what to expect. I was really confused as to why we got to see O'briens Family scenes and really just wasn't interested in that at all. Maybe they were trying to show us his vulnerability but I don't think there was enough back story for it to warrant being in there. Also Fifty Cents scene where his daughters date turns up and the whole ""if you hurt my daughter we will mess you up"" thing. It's so cliche'd and has been done to death (Lethal Weapon, Bad Boys just to name a few). It really felt they were ripping off the Fast and the Furious's 'we are baddies but we are a family' vibe. One thing which really annoyed me was near the ending when O'Brien went to the bar and had the ""Usual Suspects"" moment where he figured out what had happened. This was such a blatant rip off of that movie that it just felt poorly written and for me detracted from my overall movie watching experience.

We never really get to learn about the main bad guy Merriman's motivations (played by Pablo Schreiber) outside of implied survival. The gunfights are fun to watch.

This film uses the L.A. Sheriff's Department instead. That's one thing that sets this apart. The other is that the thieves portrayed are highly organized ex-Marines. We don't really get into why they they resort to crime, but they are determined, professional, and, up to this point, highly successful. By ""Big Nick's"" estimate, they are responsible for at least four other heists.""Big Nick's"" Major Crime unit is highly successful too. Even if they don't always follow well established rules when engaging their criminal counter-parts. This is the foundation of this movie. Two highly motivated, intelligent, and successful crews destined to encounter one another at some point in the near future. When they do, it's quite thrilling.This is the best kind of actioneer. It has a very definite plot. The characters are highly motivated to succeed and they are very well paired off. Merimann and ""Nick"" are equals as leaders to their crews. The crews are both willing to put their butts (and lives) on the line to complete a successful outcome.Then we have the actual heist. It is daring, almost impossible to pull off, but that makes for a great story.I was very impressed with the acting chops of Gerard Butler (Big Nick), Pablo Schreiber (Merimann), and O'Shea Jackson Jr (Donnie). The rest of the cast was well chosen and played their parts well. There's even a twist at the end, which sets this film up for a sequel.The shootout along Alameda corridor was espcially butt clenching. Very well done!!!Christian Gudegast is a director to watch.

Trying to rip off a Federal Reserve Bank in downtown LAWith heavy weaponry used by both sides of the heist. From there, the excitement is ratcheted up, but not anywhere close to the development of the characters and excitement of Michael Mann's film. Gerard Butler always seems like he's just ""trying to hard"" 2 be an A-LIST actor, which he's not in my mind. I've enjoyed his work much more in other past projects...maybe this was a little too predictable, but not really sure why!If I'm not mistaken, that was the first film where Pacino & DeNiro were actually on screen together doing a scene, even though they had been cast in the same movies, but were never in the same scenes together prior to Heat..Give me the original any day, between the excellent cast & the better overall development and excitement of a thrill ride with Heat compared to ""Den of Thieves.""",Den of Thieves

260,puzgolac,A typical B-movie with plot holes so big and so numerous you could drive a fleet of armored trucks through them,3,17 February 2021,"To put it as brief as possible - this movie has nothing going for it.Plot - ridiculous. It makes no sense, and the ""twists"" somehow manage to have the worst of both worlds, being at the same time predictable and being incoherent and making no sense at all.Characters - terrible. We get a couple of characters that are one-dimensional and completely undeveloped. The rest of them are even worse. They appear on screen but you could remove them from the film completely without any loss.
When writing characters, a good writer knows how to make the bad guys not be one-dimensional by giving them redeeming traits; likewise, good guys can be made more real by not being perfect. However, this movie didn't have a good writer. Instead of nuanced characters, we get two groups of terrible excuses for human beings. You don't care a bit about any of them and immediately come to the conclusion that the world would be a better place without any of them.Acting - cringe worthy. Apparently the only thing that was important for the director was to convey how macho all of the characters are. And how do we know that they are macho? Well, they lift weights, have a lot of tattoos, walk around shirtless, make constipated faces constantly and mumble incomprehensibly. Gerard Butler was horrible. He looks like a fat hamster with a month's worth of food stuffed in his cheeks who is about two seconds away form a heart attack.Not even entertainingly bad; just plain bad.",Den of Thieves

The shooting action is at the point, neither too long nor too short. Before the end, I got confused when they got the trash truck and obvious you realize something is not right especially later nobody made no doubts about the package. The whole story is a mimic of Usual Suspect and the main story did a good job. Minor acting flaws are not discussed here.However, for some unknown reason, they add the personal life of the sheriff as the Line B, which is a completely useless and no ending story. This stretches the film to two and a half hour. One more bizarre screen play is the telephone man after he was told burned.

273,themonkwithnoname,Brilliant!,9,21 January 2018,"Absolutely brilliant. A total guy film. Gerard Butler (Big Nick) is - as Gerard himself mentions it in Kimmel - ""Silverback Gorilla"". Pure alpha male in a group of bunch of alpha males.He soon meets his match in the form of Pablo Schreiber's character Merriman. Another totally buff, totally shredded, former Special Forces who is incredibly smart and highly intelligent.Basically the movie is a tic-tac back and forth between their lives' portrayals with some glimpses of 50's life, O Shea and others'. I get that most people are trying to compare it to Heat, but for me it was more in line with Training Day.Now frankly, I went in with a Law Abiding Citizen mentality about a self-righteous cop(s) who break all the rules, acts as vigilante and makes their point proven with unconventional tactics.It was actually nothing like that. It is heist film with a brilliant misdirection. It delivers all the macho, high octane action. There are some subtleties and details that highly stands out:-O Shea's nostrils flaring after being harassed and bullied (loved this touch of microexpression ever since I saw in the trailer)-The way the robbers step in or wade in. Almost as if wearing fins and they first slide in and step in with one foot and then the body follows. Of course, 50 and Gerard said how they trained to get the movement down in military fashion.-Sushi bar scene, the Rowland Heights scene which truly depicts how a real Alpha carries himself was phenomenal. Loved the tension building and flaring and the subdued suspense and of course the breakup scene was strong-The muscle of Butler and Schreiber in the final scene with each sinewy muscle mass pumping was brilliant.. Probably they pumped irons before shooting those scenes.-Merriman character became a surprise favorite of mineMerriman character is not that much of a downright and outright alpha. Not a grey man either. He is just trying to have a meal and chill with his ""family"" or makes his point proven in the shooting range without reacting directly to Butler from getting his paper target riddled center mass.(Possible spoiler alert)Now as far as the spoiler or twist. Well if the movie had no twist it actually would have been boring. Another Mann-ish drama about real life grit. Although putting the twist at the end may sacrifice some of the content and make it 'cheesy' (as some might object) but THAT actually makes it more unique, original and movie-y.Listen. Reviews are subjective. C---pola like Wonder Woman - which is comparable to cringey chick flick - gets rave reviews by ""stalwart"" critics and these same critics lambaste this movie.Don't listen to anyone else. Watch a movie, judge it for yourself and then you'd have much better understanding and appreciation how life operates.For me art is something which ""I"" want to enjoy and savor again and again and again and again...This movie passes it on all accounts. A movie doesn't have to Oscar nominated with Brandeberg Concerto or discussing pilpul of Rauschenberg in Annie Hall-y style to get my respect.All ""I"" care is what makes me happy.

275,bkeener-28541,This should have gotten more publicity,9,7 March 2020,This movie came across as a predictable cops and robbers movie for the most part at least that's what I thought until the very end with a little twist. That wasn't super shocking to me but gave the movie a depth of actually having a good plot. All in all it was a good movie the acting was great especially ice cube's son steeling the show. I always think highly of Gerard Butler one of my favorite actors of my generation. The only thing that didn't make any sense to me was the fact that the robbers were at a shooting range in one scene where Gerard Butler's character follows the robbers there where a ex con is shooting at the range this isn't legal no felon can own a firearm and if they did they sure as hell wouldn't go to the range to shoot it because it's illegal and they could have been taken in on that alone. So I didn't see why they even did that scene it didn't make a difference in the story except that the main bad guy could empty a few clips really quickly. Wow big deal. No ex-con would ever take a chance on getting a gun charge by shooting at a range and any range that would let an ex-con shoot illegally would get in trouble as well. Maybe that's not a big deal to some people but I'm pretty sure in the USA felons aren't allowed to have a firearm. If he just had a misdemeanor then he could have a firearm but it showed him in a maximum security prison earlier in the film. Besides that the movie was good and I think worth watching if you like Gerard Butler and if you like Ice Cube's son since he starred in straight outta Compton when he played his dad then you'll like this one too,Den of Thieves

Problem is it was intended to be the second type of movie i.e. the serious type.

In the introduction, the scene was extremely realistic to the point where everyone said ""in other action movies with guns, *this* would've happened"". Props to the director for making it realistic/believable enough.

285,misfitone38,Not Enough Heat And A Usual Suspect,5,14 January 2019,"There's no easy way to assign a rating for a movie like Den of Thieves. On its own merits it gets 5/10 stars since it draws so heavily on Heat from director Michael Mann and is undeniably inferior to its predecessor.However, Heat was made almost 25 years ago and maybe the viewer hasn't seen it. If that's the case, then anyone who is watching Den of Thieves, and is unaware of Heat's existence, then add 1 star to the rating.The other obvious inspiration Den Of Thieves draws from is The Usual Suspects and its ""character who isn't who isn't who he seems to be"" as well as its ""Garsh! I just figured out what was going on all along"" ending.Again, ripping off a movie from a quarter of a century ago. If the viewer hasn't seen The Usual Suspects then I guess add half a star to the rating. Can't give it a full star because...well, the Den of Thieves twist isn't that clever.One other little note is the scene where one of the thieves intimidates his daughter's prom date with implied threats from his fellow tattooed thugs and ex-cons. This would have been funnier if it could have lived up to Martin Lawrence and Will Smith using the same tactic in a hilarious scene from Bad Boys 2. If you haven't seen it, add another half star to Den of Thieves.So this is anywhere from 5/10 to 7/10...its the best I can rate it.",Den of Thieves

287,danamadeus,Solid crime film,7,23 August 2018,"Just finished watching this movie. I really enjoyed it. Didn't quite catch it in theaters unfortunately but rented it on iTunes and it was well worth it.Den of thieves is a crime/heist epic in the vein of Heat. And it really really wants to be Heat. A heist film set in LA that equally focusses on a crew of criminals and a a team of cops. It opens with an armored car robbery. The climax is an epic street shootout. This film welcomes comparisons to heat and it cant quite measure up to that Michael Mann masterpiece and it doesn't have any match-up at the level of Deniro and Pacino to give it automatic weight. What the den of thieves has going for it is Gerard Butler in possibly his career defining performance as hard-living LA Sheriff Nick O'brien, a crooked cop who's methods go well beyond questionable. While Butler chews scenery in gloriously entertaining fashion and elevates the art of being a rude a-hole to incredible new heights, he never becomes a cartoon character. Nick is an incredibly flawed man but he is still a human being with emotions and butler manages to make him sympathetic despite how unbearably awful (in a good way) he is. The film is well made with strong performances all around, particularly Oshea Jackson Jr. (Straight outta Compton) and 50 Cent, as well as Pablo Schreiber, an actor I haven't seen before bringing real presence and charisma to his role as the leader of the criminals. The direction is interestingly low-key without the quick, flashy editing I've come to expect from heist movies. Overall the film's oddly understated style works for it, even if occasionally it feels somewhat lacking in momentum. And there were a few scenes here and there that could have been cut which would have also helped with pacing. I would really like to see more films featuring Nick O'brien, preferably not just a heat remake next time. Maybe a Nick O'Brien undercover cop movie, or international criminal investigation type movie. Apparently there is a sequel on the way so that might happen. I just hope it gets a better follow up than London has fallen. All in all Den of thieves is an enjoyable, solid film. If you like heist films or Gerard Butler it's well worth a rental.

288,jamestheklein,Should it be compared to Heat?,5,5 November 2018,"I watched it based on the trailer. I thought it would be about a group of criminals we are meant to empathize with being chased by a group of police who are basically criminals themselves, while they sweat and lean on the driver. I assumed some would die, and that the driver would probably get away with the most family-man-esque criminal with their share of the money.I don't think it was enough like this though, and as it went on it felt more and more like a Heat knock off, while being less and less like what I originally thought.By the final hour I could barely stop comparing it, and it came up very short. I mean, sure, it was fine, but it was not even close to being as interesting and enthralling as Heat was. I didn't care about the police officers, whereas I did care about Al Pacino's cop in Heat. I didn't care about any of the criminals apart from 50 Cent.Essentially, it was an average film, good for a couple of hours if you want to have something on to decompress after work, but it is not going to make you think, or even be remembered in a few years.There is a half decent twist at the end, which I hadn't been expecting, but should have seen signposted.",Den of Thieves

Gerard Butler produced it, and he tailor-made the role of a cocky cop who is so hard and mean that his wife can't stand him. The character development is good for the first hour, then the movie devolved badly.
It seemed as if they were trying to emulate ""Heat"", with Pacino and DeNiro, but the action got far-fetched and unbelievable. When one of the bank robbers pulls out an EMP device that is made of plastic with glowing LED lights on it, it got silly. Then the cops start a shoot-out with the robbers on a street that has motorists bumper-to-bumper stopped in traffic; all the citizens in their cars were between the cops and the robbers. Everyone starts shooting, riddling all the cars with the people in them in the mayhem.
No police officers would ever start a shoot-out with automatic weapons with innocent people in the crossfire. They just caused numerous civilian fatalities. Ridiculous!

It was really a great heist movie! Den of Thieves had great pacing and a solid cast working with a good script. It had a little bit of a ""Training Day"" vibe with the not-by-books cops and an ""Ocean's 11"" vibe with the complex planning of the heist.Unlike a lot of other heist films, where everything would of had to work out just right to pull it off, and ignorant security guards and trap doors were conveniently available, I felt this film actually seemed practical. Everyone was on their game which increased the tension wondering if the criminals were going to get caught at any moment. The explanation of how everything was planned along with the improvisation when things didn't go according to plan seemed very plausible.Although the criminals explain their end goal plans, they would omit certain details to the audience, which left me curious as to what their true intentions were. Leaving me trying to figure out what their ""real"" plan is, just as the cops who were pursuing them attempt to figure it out.My favorite part was the numerous twists. As someone who has watched many heist films I truly did not foresee all the wheels within wheels that were going on. However, all the hints were there to the savvy viewer, and only in the end do all the pieces come together. There were no loose ends I could see once the movie ended.Until the very last 10 minutes I literally had no idea whether the ""good guys"" or the ""bad guys"" were going to win.

Two reasons I give it 3, not 1. Near the end of film there is some nice plot twist and some semi-nice action (but semi- should be said, timing is not great). The second reason is almost likable character of Pablo Schreiber. And his acting. It's good. I'd better not saying a word of Butler's character, may be it's my problem, but it gave me nothing but disgust. Just like his characters in many other movies. Undue cruelty...

Michael Mann's Heat warm-up L.A Takedown was better than this totally banal and bizarre film.When Butler arrived on scene it was another ridiculous copy of Heat with similar dialogue and ideas - Butler lists off the criminal's M.O and talks about their professionalism. One of the cops calls a witness 'donut guy', in Heat there's 'tv guy'... the list goes on. Then it gets boring. I skipped through the movie, landing on other rip off scenes I predicted would be in there including Butler catching his wife with another man and eating some chicken. And an assault rifle heavy final shoot out. Only people who haven't seen Heat could think this movie is original. This made The Town feel like breath a fresh air by comparison.

A lot of people are referencing similarities to the movie Heat, which saw De Niro and Pacino have a bromance sharing different sides of the same coin. I personally didn't even think of Heat at all when watching this and I reckon it stands alone as the better film.The trailer had me expecting something similar to Inside Man, but I'm pleased that things worked out differently. The character development for the main players was certainly better than I expected. And I couldn't quite place Schreiber and Cube Jnr and was pleasantly surprised to see naming in the credits. The plot was well paced and didn't have too many issues with directorial license. I'll happily recommend this to friends and even watch it again at some point.A lot of so called film fans are running the story into the ground and still comparing it to Heat. (Heat sucked arse and was only enjoyed by a stupid general public) There are certainly issues with various story links that make you pause and wonder. But it becomes clear that the director chose not to waste time with aspects of intrigue and decision making. While I'd sooner see the intrigue personally, it's not the end of the world allows the film to progress.As for the real similarity. Spoiler... It wasn't bloody Heat. Instead, think Keyser Soze. I picked this early by fluke and really enjoyed watching the clues continue to unfold.",Den of Thieves
301,thejacobmello,Behind the Popcorn with Jacob Mello,4,8 February 2018,"This 2h 20min stint in Cinemark was the hardest time I ever did.The cast, just happy to be out from under the large footprints of their gifted parents, siblings, mentors, and Russell Crowes, seemed to bring everything they had to the table. Unfortunately the script was nowhere near salvageable. The whole enterprise was like watching Gene Hackman's cousin going flat-out while playing an action figure game conceptualized by a group of below average 6-year-olds at recess.At one point, 50 Cent's character takes his daughter's prom date to his garage where he and his muscle shirt sporting friends proceeded to bark about how not-to-be-fucked-with they are; which is followed by a session of self-congratulatory hand shaking and laughing, the moment the high schooler leaves the room. If the layout of that scene impresses you, I think this film might just be your Catcher in the Rye. If it doesn't, you probably won't be crazy about the rest of this film either, which is just more of the same.The trailer promised a gritty ride that blurs the lines between good and bad - it actually did a decent job at delivering on that. It showed the private lives on both sides and gave us a taste of how living in this world bleeds into everything you are. The problem was they never gave us anything to hope for or care about, which left us wondering for a substantial chunk in the middle about exactly who or what we were supposed to be rooting for. By the time the climax of the main heist was fully engaged, it was like watching a drunken nonsensical brawl between your friend's parents.While everyone (acting wise) was operating at their highest possible level, the standout was definitely O'Shea Jackson Jr. who commanded the screen with a certain cool likability. I wont be surprised if that charisma translates into an impressive career in the coming years.This idea had promise and could have been salvaged had the writer spent a little more energy on character arc's and story structure, and a little less energy on the measuring stick. Usually when a movie is packed with this much adrenaline, it's customary for some of it to trickle down to the audience's side of the screen.Prescriptions

313,mattpope384,"Solid and Gritty in the ""Heat"" Tradition",7,22 January 2019,"As has been pointed out, Den of Thieves was clearly influenced by Michael Mann's 1995 cops & robbers masterpiece ""Heat"". Fortunately though, Den of Thieves manages to be an hommage rather than a lower-budget knock off.The same themes are explored as Den of Thieves follows the personal and professional lives of a crew of Marine Recon veterans turned A-List bank robbers and the elite - and rogue- team of L.A. Sherrif's Dept. detectives trying to take them down.The lead cop is Big Nick played especially sleazy by a bulked up Gerard Butler and the lead robber played by Pablo Schreiber is named Merriman (which I found myself wondering if that was an ironic nod to Robin Hood and his Band of Merry Men).Many of the same themes in Heat are explored as we gain an insight into the personal and professional lives of the law men and the outlaws. We see that the criminals have a sense of loyalty to each other and to family and the cops tend to think of themselves as above the law.Writer-director-producer Christian Gudegast incorporates much of Mann's signature pacing and atmosphere to good effect here. The film manages to be moody and introspective without ever dragging and the action sequences- particularly the shoot outs- tend to have the attention to verisimilitude that allows the audience to feel some of the tension that the characters are experiencing.One major shortcoming however, is that in movies like Heat and Collateral, Michael Mann uses the city of Los Angeles as a third co-star. He treats the city and it's environs reverently and the look, feel and tone of L.A. permeates his films.Although set in L.A., for budget reasons Den of Thieves was filmed in Atlanta and it is apparent. Atlanta is a great town and has been good to the film and TV industries, but it looks and feels nothing like Southern California. This displacement can be felt throughout the movie and is distracting.Another difference is that I found myself less invested in the two leads than I did in Heat. Although Al Pacino's Vincent Hanna and Robert DeNiro's Neil Cauley we're definitely flawed characters, they were engaging and you were interested in their fundamental conflict. Butler and Schreiber do good work in playing their characters as written, but frankly Merriman is such a flat cypher and Big Nick such a greasy scumbag that I didn't have the same level of engagement around their eventual stand offs.That said, it can be fun in watching Big Nick be a smarmy, alcoholic taunting prick to Merriman's crew and his nemesis FBI agent and Schreiber does bring a dead-eyed menace to his character that should feel familiar to anyone who's ever worked around hardened career criminals.As someone who generally likes the heist movie genre, I found Den of Thieves a solid, gritty well-paced actioner that is more thoughtful than most. I enjoyed watching it from the comfort of my couch and would check out the sequel if one is made.",Den of Thieves

318,mcochrane-87400,could they steal anything MORE from Heat?,5,21 May 2018,"Not the worst movie ever made by loaded with BS:
1) The initial armored car robbery: stolen directly from the movie Heat. I mean, almost to the dialogue.
2) Meeting of the cops after, almost to the word the same as Heat
3) The final gun battle, I bet they used the same sound effects as Heat. 
4) Restaurant scene: albeit a little different in setting, the same idea as when the two protagonists meet in Heat.
5) Really? The lead cop is ALSO having marital problems? Same as Heat
6) Cop in heat finds his wife with another man, cop in DOT finds wife with another man
7) I hate it when directors/writers think movie goers are idiots. If the premise (spoiler alert) is that the lowly ""driver"" is the mastermind behind it all, why would Merriman even ask him if he's a cop? Or challenge him as to where they met? I so hate it when they do stuff like that in movies. Scenes that completely contradict the whole premise of the movie.
8) In the big shoot out scene, it's idiotic. The ""robbers"" had NO reason to worry about the cops. They didn't have the money, and the cops didn't know what they'd done other than drive out of the scrap yard. Ok, so maybe they didn't know they didn't have the actual money. How? The bags they threw into the truck were rectangular in shape, yet when the cops opened them, the shredded money was round pucks that crumbled as soon as you touched them. ONE of them would have noticed the bundle crumbling when they picked it up.
9) When they drove the armored car off after the shootout, the windshield is back in place
10) even if the armored car had ""old technology GPS"" they still would be able to track it to the warehouse. I mean, THIS is the epitome of crappy movies being made these days.

Yes you read correctly. They used 2 different trucks where one of them had one big windscreen and the other had 2 divided by a frame in the middle. If there was a high speed chase and a window got broken in one scene and was shown there the next scene, I would understand.

Except any member of this crew, who had all served time - literally none of them raised a flag. Where did the plans for this building come from? Yes, there is a plot twist but those plans - and the amount of details in them - would simply not be available through any means. The EMP device was ridiculously elaborate and really only served the purpose of making the guards more suspicious - even though they didn't actually go into the counting room to check things out and left it to the counting staff, who arrived to check a fraction of a second after our robber disappeared into the vent. The military discipline aspect was good - but to assume that a bunch of marines were/are also hackers, telephony specialists and various other roles which just so happen to fit the exact requirements of the job? The plot twist *was* clever - but there would have had to have been so many assumptions made on what could or would happen during a heist as complex as this - you have to suspend disbelief for that twist to be feasible.

The movie moved really quickly through the planning stage leaving them a big amount of time to show off the final ""impossible"" heist which they did do quite nicely. Most heist movies doesn't give this much time to the final heist.
Butler's character was shown really well. You could see the struggles and sadness he is facing, under his hard and strong face. When he starts to cry in his car, it reminds you that no more how hard anyone is on the outside, there will be a soft part of them. 
Although, I gave it an 8 cause it lacks an interesting story which most heist movies do lack. It's just super bad guys wanting to be rich and super good guys trying to stop them.

Why? Well you have a bunch of ex-military pro-guys with assault automatic weaponry (not the usual 12 gauge or semiautomatic pistols used in all heist movies, except Heat of course, the father of them all) being trigger happy !?
To my understanding these were all combat-soldiers so they supposedly understand the value of a round....like one shot - one kill (reference: John Wick part 2 ?).
Instead they wasted at the end hundreds (maybe thousands....a real picnic at the farm!) of rounds shooting at body-parts of various cars (wow .....aaaa, what?!). The most futile scene is the one in which the SAW is used...300 or so rounds completely wasted instead of using some of them to get some good guys to die.(some unfortunate car owners had to replace some windshields and fenders after....

At the very end all chambers were empty. If they had tactical helmets they would used them instead of rocks ....I really looked, no rocks on the asphalt .(see Sargent Horvath scene in SPR)

Also the shooting is so badly choreographed I just couldn't stop laughing.Seriously I would recommend watching just so that next time you watch an average film you aren't disappointed.Luckily I watched on Netflix because if I had actually paid for this I would be even more angry as disgusted than I am now.It is so far fetched with ridiculous twists and turns.The ending just made me shake my head in silence and go to bed disappointed with myself for wasting electricity watching it.The film is far too long. I assumed half way through we were done only to realise there was an hour left. NB the constant over dramatised shoot out which mimics every movement, mag changed from both sides is so unnecessary.Clearly I am not the only one who thinks this.All in all I can honestly say that your time spent watching this would be better spent tidying your house, washing the car or literally watching paint dry...I sincerely hope all actors involved were well paid for this as I cannot imagine they will be hired for some time. Once again the ending is Probably the worst I have seen in a film.There are no more words. This film is an Epic Fail",Den of Thieves

My sister loves heists movies so we have seen dozens of them and very few are clever. This film is a must see for action lovers! There are only two things that bothered me: 1) I'm not sure if Jarred Butler has to tweak his mouth like Popeye in order to speak with an American accent but it drives me and my husband insane. Lol very distracting! 2) I was born in California and raised in Georgia, attending Georgia State University and it irritated me to see them driving in Atlanta calling out LA streets, they look nothing alike. It killed me! Two very silly distractions but both caused me to lose focus several times. I got through it and the ending was phenomenal!",Den of Thieves
347,milleniumlogan,Don't listen to the critics. A crime movie that did not disappoint... at all.,7,23 January 2018,"I have been excited for Den of Thieves since the first trailer dropped back in October. Then very little came out about the movie for about two months and I began to worry that it wouldn't come out on time. There was very little hype around this movie and by the time I saw it, I was beginning to wonder if it would just be a B-movie with Gerard Butler slapped on for legitimacy. It wasn't!Gerard Butler played his role to perfection. It felt like he really was the hardened, ruthless LA Sheriff that he portrayed. They picked the perfect guy for the role in every aspect. Whether he was threatening criminals, engaging in a shootout, or popping off to fellow law enforcement officers his demeanor was perfect. Regardless of how much of a jerk his character is, if you're at all like me you'll find yourself rooting for him. Gerard Butler's performance was a 10/10.But Gerard Butler wasn't the only plus in this intense crime saga. Pablo Schreibner and his team of veteran bank robbers did an excellent job. Rather than being the weak spots in the movie several no-name actors on the criminal side of the fence ended up added depth and spirit to the movie. The action in the movie also felt very legitimate. There were often pauses for reloading during shootouts and certain characters even ran out of ammunition. Also, the action was not at all constant and the majority of the movie was spent in building a truly deep crime story. Above all else, the directors and screen-writers knew exactly how to lay out an intense heist film that keeps you on the edge of your seat for 2 hours and 20 minutes. A common criticism I often end up having with crime movies is that they don't know how to end and often they make your least favorite character win. Without giving spoilers, Den of Thieves ended so perfectly that I can't wait to see the movie again.",Den of Thieves
348,pglove,"Original, no. Enjoyable, yes.",7,13 April 2018,"According to the other reviews if you make a heist movie it's a rip off of Heat, and if it has a twist it's a rip off of Usual Suspects.I agree there are elements of both, for example the extremely loud gun fights, and never-saw-that-coming ending.Yes it had a lot of flaws but it isn't meant to be intelligent, it's a straight up crime movie and it did the job for me.I'll probably never watch it again but I'm still happy to have seen it.",Den of Thieves

From a technical point of view and I can speak from having had nearly 20 years frontline firearms experience this film is spot on the weapons handling is excellent and very accurate and I particularly liked the "" tac up "" sequence.

350,rgedgar,Makes the A team TV show look inteligent,2,5 August 2018,"It came as no surprise to discover that this movie grossed more in its domestic takings than it did n its international takings . ..Europeans tend to seek a glimmer of intelligence in their cinematic entertainment //
The movie starts with a bunch of people whom we do not know and with whom we have zero connection shooting at another bunch of people whom we do not know either . The screen is filled with an image of a stranger firing a gun with a never ending supply of bullets ... we cut to an image of another stranger falling over riddled in bullets .. we then cut to another stranger firing another ""magic "" gun .. .cut again to another stranger falling over ..yes .. riddled with bullets .. etc etc . 
 and then on we go with lame pointless dialogue scene after scene ,,, the initial verbal confrontation with the vegan cop is a prime example of the primitive script ..
just in case we get confused the writers have one character say to the other ""i do not like you "" ... did you get that .. these guys are not friends .

351,TheMachinistSleeps,Better than Heat,7,22 January 2019,"Yes, I said it. Den of Thieves is better than Heat (1995). I start my review this way because so many others are comparing these two movies and perhaps letting nostalgia cloud their judgement.I recently watched Heat again and I kept thinking... when does this get good? I don't remember this being a bad movie. Well, it may not be a bad movie, but it's not a heist movie. There is not even one proper heist in the almost 3-hour long Heat.The closest you get to a heist in Heat (1995) is at the start of the movie with the armored car - that actually required a little planning. In the middle you get an aborted half-a-heist that was basically a break and enter anyway. And at the end of Heat you get a simple ""cowboy job"" bank robbery, as one of the crew calls it. A brute force stick 'em up with a run and gun escape. That's not a heist. That's just a simple bank robbery along with multiple murders.On the other hand, Den of Thieves actually puts effort in to the heists. You get to see the crew pull off multiple heists that were planned out and strategic and it doesn't even take 3 hours to get there.Den of Thieves has its own issues that everyone else has covered. There are some very strange plot holes that I think are a result of shooting multiple versions of scenes and then not knowing which version to use to match up with the overall plot. I think a director's cut of this movie could really bump up the rating quite a bit, and I hope they're working on that right now.",Den of Thieves
352,jaygorto,Good actors. Cool premise,7,13 January 2019,"Cool movie. Good story and action. However its difficult to watch police movies sometimes when they do things that cops would never do. For instance throwing a donut in a crime scene where officers were killed, smoking a cigarette when walking into a shooting range, engaging in a firefight with lots of innocent civilians stuck in traffic in the line of fire and not knowing that level III a body armor doesn't stop .223 and other rifle rounds.

WASHINGTON!! and those movies were good. this movie...is not.i gave it 3 because it has a couple good scenes if youre a guy. but this is a complete ripoff. the only reason i wrote the review is because so many ppl were saying it was creative. i would take either one of the previous films over den of thieves. but really, what aggravated me most about this (and its happening a lot more in the last 5 years), is people writing/telling a story for 2 hours and 10 minutes, then just completely flipping it on its head in the last 10. seriously. the first 2 hours and 10 minutes of the 2 hour 20 minute runtime, was a completely different movie than the last 10. and the last 10 is completely absurd. if the bartender were the mastermind, then hes clearly an incredible actor. he would do that. he wouldnt work below minimum wage for tips to deal with drunk morons, just in the off chance maybe he can collect enough info over several months to plan a master heist.and its the federal reserve. yea. not a bank robbery (even though for a minute they were in a bank!!! MISDIRECTION!!!) because that would be too easy for a bartender to do. nope. he does a double cross setup, executed to perfection, against the Federal Reserve. you know. that place printed on the US dollar. he robbed that....from information gathered at a bar...where apparently every single federal reserve employee goes to get tanked immediately after work.and what happens when these workers lose their keycards and id badges, which give them access to THE FEDERAL RESERVE?? ""oh, we'll just laminate you a new one. no need to turn off that other keycard. im sure someone disposed of or destroyed it. visitor badges to the federal reserve? never change. security guys inside the federal reserve? military grade. guy at the gate? incompetent moron who fails at the one safeguard meant to keep this vital American financial institution secure...the sign in sheet. uhhhh.....brooooo....you didnt sign in....and then out of left field, not sure why this bothered me, they made sure to let us know the one woman who WORKED at the federal reserve was actually in the heist crew, setting up their next heist on a diamond exchange in the uk. she must have a stellar resume. great interviewer, solid eye contact, youre hired ma'am. one concern though, all your previous employers have been robbed of significant sums of money on your last day of recorded employment....last thing. an ending like this only works if you have several gap filler scenes throughout the movie to help tie it together during the big reveal in the last 10 minutes. there are no less than a dozen scenes in this movie that dont make sense until the reveal. 2 hours 20 minutes. all told. thanks gerb.",Den of Thieves

I can't help but think it will go down from here.Having set my expectations high, I was all-in with the opening action sequence. Then someone started talking and all I could do is cringe at the pat dialogue and contrived characters.It's a decent concept, even if a little derivative. The twists were clever, but not particularly satisfying. The plot holes were numerous and glaring.Despite the tropey, heavy-handed and useless subplots, Gerard Butler's character was not relatable on any level and wholly unqualified for his position. His relationships were unsuccessful props to make him appear more complex.I suspect the final cut of this movie was the manifestation of the filmmaker's worst fears of what it would become.I have to admit that I didn't see the plot twist coming.

If the police actually behave like that in American, then goodness help it's citizens. All the women in the film are portrayed as mindless sex objects - with zero character development, and the constant testosterone fuelled scenes become so idiotic, repetitive and unbelievable that I was actually laughing out loud in the cinema at how bad it was. All the waving of large military grade guns around - would lead you to believe there is some bodily appendage justification going on. I think Freud would have had a field day.Also some of the scenes when the thieves are working out borders on homo-erotic - though I fully suspect it was definitely not designed to do that. In one scene they definitely look like the crew from the village people, intimidating a poor young man - just bizarre and completely unbelievable.Whoever wrote the screen play must have sat down and watched every lousy film released in the last 20 years, and mashed it all together, as everything was as predictable as the sun rising. There is nothing in this film that will remotely surprise anyone, nothing.I don't know if the director had just read a book on clichés in the movies, but there can't have been many stereotypical characters he left out.

410,bhodso,An action movie for those who like their action macho & entertaining,9,29 January 2018,"Den of Thieves knows exactly what it is. A testosterone-fueled action film with both the good guys & bad guys trying to outdo each other in how tough they are, how clever they can be, and how many one-liners they can deliver. Like a lot of early 1980's action films, the primary goal of Den of Thieves is to just be entertaining and in that goal, the film delivers.The opening armored car heist has excellent tension, solid camera work (no shaky cam here), and an intense gunfire exchange. Gerard Butler plays a sheriff who isn't exactly all ""good"" as he muddles through personal problems while tracking a group of expert thieves. He's energetic in this and has some good one-liners along the way. Pablo Schreiber plays the bad guy's main leader and has enough intensity to match Butler's as they challenge each other along the way to the big bank heist.If there was one main complaint, it would be that the subplot involving Gerard Butler's family struggles doesn't really go anywhere and is completely forgotten in the last act of the film. Though the scenes with his family do help to develop his character and let us understand him a bit better so it's not wasted screen-time. But the writers should have wrapped that part up better considering how much time was spent on it in the 1st & 2nd acts.I was definitely entertained along the way, there were several twists I didn't see coming, and I was pleasantly surprised. We get few and far between action movies like this these days so this is one to check out if you like your action a little on the trashy side. (also kudos to the gun consultants on this film for getting a lot of the gun set ups & usage correctly - not all perfect but I appreciated that they were trying for realism in terms of gun recoil, reloading, and choices).",Den of Thieves

Rotten tomatoes critics gave it 38%, and as usual, they are full of crap, the movie is really good. That's why the rotten tomatoes audience score is 87%. First time director Christian Gudegast (writer of screen plays such as A MAN APART, LONDON HAS FALLEN) did an really good job, and looked like a veteran director. Gerard Butler was fantastic, 50 cents and O'shea Jackson Jr. (Ice Cube's son) were pretty good, but the break out star of this movie will be this guy named PABLO SCHREIBER (paternal half brother of Liev Schreiber). He was the main bad guy, and his acting will blow your mind. He was a bona fide bad ass, and I am sure we will see him in a lot of other movies to come. He has definitely arrived. He also acted in 13 HOURS, Orange is the New Black. Pablo will be the breakout star from this movie. If you want a non-stop edge of the seat action movie, with a huge twist, GO watch this.

421,D-Merc,"Great tension, great action with questionable heroes",7,23 October 2018,"I am quite ambivalent about this ""Heist""-genre movie: It's thrilling, captivating movie. The actors did a great job - they are so physical and menacing, it was a pleasure seing them owning the various scenes. The heist in itself is smart enough for that category to stand ok against ""The usual suspects"", ""Heat"" etc. - admittingly it borrows quite evidently ideas from that genre - but that is ok in my opinion.Furtheron If you like to watch the effectiveness of a well trained war machinery in action then you are right here, too. There is some strange fascination to watch big caliber army machinery being thrown into regular urban environments and used by trained personal. This is obviously not everybodies cup of tea, but it kept me on the edge of my seat.The film is often compared to Heat and rightfully so, there are several concepts that were inspired by the classic predecessor. The ""good"" guys and the baddies are actually made of the same stuff. The viewer does not sympathize with either side - in fact both of them are somewhat il-/legit in their own morality. This is obviously intentional and inspired by the Pacino/de Niro blueprint we see in Heat - fair enough.But that moralistic tonality is where the film opens up for critisism: The use of violence and machoism is too glorified. In fact everybody is a gangster and the film makes believe that it is the only way how to survive the harsh reality of crime. The agenda of both protagonists is unquestioned however violent. They have to be the tough mf's to pursue their agenda - and the movie shows this in great visual splendor.In the final standoff the ""good"" guys choose to confront the bankrobbers in a situation with massive civilian background - while visually spectacular an absurdely stupid idea. Obviously the film refrains from showing any of the civilian carnage that such a decision would ensue.While I was well entertained, I still question myself if we really want to expose our society to films that promote such idols that definitely nobody wants to see in reality.",Den of Thieves

424,justinguanzon,Pretty good. You won't regret watching it.,7,2 July 2019,"I really enjoyed this one. At no time was I really bored while watching. Some of the key characters had pretty decent depth.
The directors were attentive to a lot of details that most will overlook just to make an exciting action movie, but details really matter. Most hollywood movies do a pretty God-awful job at depicting prior service personnel. However, this one was light on the over-the-top cliché military jargon that others tend to go overboard with, and the characters were believable as prior military service members, especially Pablo Schrieber's character (Kudos to Paul Maurice). When I first watched it, I was a little upset at the fact that he would mag dump his pistol dring his last firefight, but then I realized it could be because his adrenaline spiked. You could feel him panicking when he was cornered by Gerard Butler. Bravo, Pablo. The character that I liked the least was surprisingly O'Shea Jackson Jr. He being a skilled driver was definitely under-utilized, the interrogation scenes were not very good, and he just seemed out of place. The plot twist seemed random; it was a good idea, but it definitely could have been written and executed better.",Den of Thieves

And while its true that Den of Thieves takes almost TOO MUCH inspiration from HEAT, it certainly delivers some unexpected turns that make the movie unpredictible and not generic. Sure, there are a lot of heist films out there, but I found Den of Thieves to bring some new elements into the genre that i have never seen, which i thought was pretty great. I was actually surprised with Gerard Butler's performance in this movie, he was actually REALLY good and played the role with commitment. The same goes for the other cast members, Great Acting! What really sold this movie for me, was the incredible action sequences. They are directed fantastically, and the firearms in the movie sound robust and authoritative, which gives the film a hard edge that i found to love.

Like to the point where they have to show other bad guys tattoos to prove that they are tougher. The motel scene looks like a 15 year old's dream of how tough guys act. Sitting around with scantly clad women, just drinking, smoking and punching things.I can't really figure out where the director was going with the two teams of people. They were both ""bad guys"" where they had the cops being shown doing criminal activity and then the bad guys were shown in a more humane light. This just creates 2 sides of a coin that you don't care which one it lands on. It wasn't the edgy ""this is real life and everyone is terrible"". It was meeting a quota for We are shown a bit of how Butler's job gets in the way of his family life but not in any meaningful way. He isn't remorseful, honest (which there is no down side to being honest like in most movies) and most importantly he isn't even likable. A character with no redeeming qualities.50 cent is a rapper turned actor and unlike any other person who followed that career path for these roles has made no effort to improve. I can't hate on him though as the roles he picks are minimal at best and can't say his character took away anything from the movie. He had maybe 1 line and then mumbled something at the end.The ""boss"" Pablo Schreiber was decent. Not in my top 30 bad guys. No hand to hand fight, no real outsmarting(the bank scene he literally won himself 45 seconds over butler that somehow turned in to an hour lead) and meh leadership. You get to see him shirtless in a few scenes and they like to lift weights, which is very important. Again it is tough to even grade these people because of the lack of dialogue. You will not be quoting him any time soon from this movie. Actually you won't be quoting anything from this movie.O'Shea Jackson Jr. actually showed some acting chops. I would say he was the most surprising actor in the movie. Nothing that will win an award but to shine in a turd of a movie is still something.The action was sparse and a bit lacking. Generic gun fights. The twist at the end was the only reason it should be 5 stars. Was a little predictable if you are as perceptive as a 5th grader but was still nice they at least did SOMETHING. But then it just ends on Butler's part. Nothing mentioned from this family, nothing on his next move (if any)...just a few dead guys and the twist.Overall I'd say wait for it to go to dvd and not waste your time with seeing it in the theaters. Maybe they will release an extended version that makes more sense of its useless subplots.",Den of Thieves

You can see the birds fly away... from _one_ angle, not with 40 cuts and angles of 1 second each which is extremely common for movies in the last decade or so.Anyway. Den of Thieves is about bank robbers, and some damn good movies in the past are about the exact same subject. One example is Heat (1995) - a movie I consider the greatest bank robber movie of them all.The story and plot in Den of Thieves is pretty damn good, and original too in my opinion. Strong acting, Pablo Schreiber is awesome too, and honestly... all the actors are pretty dang good in this movie.That and a really nice plot and plot twist makes this movie a gold nugget.

Some of these examples are when the police lead character ' Gerard Butler' is attempting to show a disturbed family life. But Comes of more like childish B grade in its execution.

471,excaliburdragons,"Nice try but major FAIL! Impossibilities in plot, open ended details, & things that just don't make sense...",3,19 May 2018,"A lot of things are wrong with this movie...and I will point them out.
Guy who says he's the driver and does this crazy driving skills scene to prove he is the top get away driver for the heist NEVER drives at all during the rest of the movie. On top of that his role in the heist doesn't even include him driving at all even before the change of plans. Just a irrelevance so they could have the driving skills scene in the movie. Next, the impossible change in plans for the heist...so somehow they expect you to believe that once the cop is onto heir heist plan (that is extremely intricate) in a matter of a couple days they are able to create an entire diversion plan wihwrw they would have to find a bank that just happens to have sewer tumnel that leads to the federal bank building, also plan the explosives to blow the floor to get to the sewer tunnel, a guy set up as a cal trans sewer worker, & all this timed up exact with the critical timing off the money drop and the federal building original plan. Next, hours before the heist let's give the ""driver"" a high powered assault rifle he's never used before and a quick 30 sec. tutorial on how to use it. But wait there's more! Driver is suspected of being an informant ...but hey lets not kill him to cover our asses incase he's lying, instead lets add on an impossible diversion plan for the cops (previously stated), & also tell him to make sure the cops knows exactly what day we are going to do the heist. Yeah that's believable right? Then there is this goofy death scene and dialogue ripped off from the ending of the movie Heat...""I told you I wasn't going back"" type scene between the thieves gang leader and the cop. Problem is these two guys didn't build any type of repport at all except a 20 sec. phone call during the bank robbery. Then there is just so much more like the ""delivery"" guy getting buy security to leave the federal reserve building without ever signing in and they are aware of it. The whole plot twist ending which has so many loop holes, & the pointless open ended cops family issues which lend nothing to the plot at all, & are cliffhangers.

They even stole the ending straight out of Heat, gun fight around some storage containers, daylight instead of night, oh and the beginning of this film is also stolen from Heat.The acting is poor, the movies edgy soundtrack also lifted straight from Heat, I'm not sure there was a single thing that was original about this movie, only perhaps the complete lack of concern the cops have for discharging automatic weapons in the general direction of civilians was quite unique I guess. There is a minute twist but that just leads to some very very bad English accent attempts by the American cast.All in all, would never have paid to see this, its a blatant rip off of something that was done so much better the first time, the cast were better, the acting was top notch, the gun chase scenes, the tension between Pacino and De Niro, all top shelf stuff, compare Heat to this movie?

Some of the action was entertaining, some of the plotting around the heist was actually kind of intelligent, and I like most of the actors. I originally checked it out, because most of the movies 50 Cent is in are pretty entertaining, and I was interested in seeing O'shea Jackson Jr. in a prominent role that isn't his identical father. Besides all of that, though, it was a slog.The dialogue is so tedious, nothing but smarmy comments and mumbling by charmless idiots. It sounds like it was written by divorced guys with a facebook addiction and brain damage from dropping the weight bar on their head too many times. None of it is clever, or tells you anything distinctive about the character saying it. For a director/writer who seems to have no problem with plagiarism, I wish this guy had stolen some of the lines from Heat or The Usual Suspects, too.I really wish they'd taken a Bad Boys or Fast & Furious approach to a movie like this. It's such a goofy movie, a sense of humor would have made it more watchable, in the way a WWE-produced movie sometimes is.

At 2:10 or so, the movie could have easily been 20 or 30 minutes shorter if they tightened it up a bit. Trying not to give away plot points, but there were a lot of things I thought were rather silly, like a delivery person just allowed to wander around the ultra-secure facility; or the old trope of crawling through an air duct. Also, not sure WHY they cast 50-cent, maybe for marquee appeal, but I'm glad they only gave him 12 lines or so of dialogue due to his mediocre acting ability.

Gerard Butler's bravado especially at the restaurant scene fell flat but the writing was also to blame there. I thought it really achieved the tension they were going for, with the risky entrance into the Fed building. But when the twist at the end comes, it's like...a lot of things that only made sense without the twist no longer make sense. Like because of the restaurant scene they want to kill the driver character played by Ice Cube jr, and they don't because he swears he didnt tell them anything and ""i only know what you told me anyway"". But at the end the twist shows that he masterminded the plan from the start, so they wouldn't have suspected him of leaking what little he was told after the restaurant scene, but of being a sting operation from the start. Talking his way out of it only makes sense if we think he was low level, but the twist shows he was ""the guy"" from the start, so how could he have talked his way out of knowing that cop like that. If those criminals were as hot as they said they were, they would have been spooked right there. And how did Cube jr get the stolen money into another truck if he had to drop it down the same garbage chute, it's not like he jumped down the chute himself, he escaped through the vent. And why was the samoan guy so mad when he got burned by Merriman, if it turns out he was in on the whole thing from the start.

540,alanduffy101,A fun 140 minutes,8,9 November 2018,"I'm not one for writing reviews but I found this film very enjoyable and it was the first film I've watched in a long, long time where I have not been messing with my phone or breaking off. I had put off watching it due to the length, often selecting films 100 minutes or under. The 140 minutes flew by due to a fast paced engaging story. Gerard was fantastic as were a number of other cast members (sorry Fiddy, not you). I definitely would recommend this film to anyone who enjoy films in the genre",Den of Thieves

545,shaunjakeway,Some people,9,10 November 2018,"I dont get it....I'm reading other reviews about plot holes in the movie and I just shake my head. Clearly some people have missed a few things.1. The stripper feeds our buddy Gerard the address of where the ""heist"" is going to take place.
Yes, yes she did. After she approached him and seduced him at the bar. Thus was clearly a ploy by Merriman as she even stated that she did what he told her to do, a few scenes after Gerard leaves the house the same stripper who is seen sleeping beside Merriman the morning of the heist.2. He got all of his information bt being a bartender....that is not realistic!
Well...you obviously missed the point.
He told Merriman that that is where he got all of his information, when in fact the guys that he grew up with all worked un the federal reserve bankThe only downfall to the ending is brought on by the horrible aim by all of the characters with guns in the end of the movie...why so many shots fired? You could get the same affect with rightly placed shots. The other part is how Gerard knew where to go after they discovered the empty sewer.I had a really good time with this movie. Od watch it again for sure!",Den of Thieves
546,creedombooks,GREAT movie with an EPIC shootout scene and unpredictable ending,10,25 January 2018,"Den of Thieves was a crime saga that had me on the edge of my seat the entire movie. The movie was based on a heist planned by a crew of career criminals. This wasn't just any heist; this was the mother of all heists. They planned to hit the Federal Reserve in Los Angeles. Den of Thieves wasn't the average cop and robber movie either. The good guys in the movie were actually more ruthless than the criminals. Gerard Butler plays Lieutenant 'Big Nick' O'Brien who is completely out of control from the moment we are introduced to him. At the beginning of the movie, he enters a homicide/robbery crime scene and eats a donut from a box that is on the ground near the dead body. CLASSIC. During the movie, we get a peek into his life as a devoted Sheriff and terrible husband/father. There is so much accuracy in this depiction of an officer that goes undercover and/or works special units. They get wrapped up in the underworld they are working in and often neglect their families when working long strenuous hours. On the other side, Pablo Schreiber gives us a villain you want to root for in Ray Merrimen. Merrimen and his crew are all ex-military, and they have a set of skills that can't be matched. They are almost as sophisticated as the crew from Takers, but with the training and weaponry of a small militia. We don't get a look at Merrimen's personal life, but they give us a little history of his work. O'Shea Jackson (Donnie Wilson) and 50 Cent (Enson ""Levi"" Levoux) both also give commendable performances. Wilson is so unpredictable in the movie and leads us up to one of the greatest endings you could ask for. The keys to this movie were the strong scenes and relatable characters. The heists are all detailed and wrap you while watching the plans unfold. During the bank heist, I found myself being in in the shoes of a Sheriff and wondering what their plan was, especially after the explosion. There's also a great plot twist at the end that no one will see coming. Surprisingly, I found myself laughing hard during several scenes in the movie.Overall, Den of Thieves will be considered one the best modern heist movies. It doesn't have the typical bank or armored car robbery plot. They also don't have the decorated ""good"" cop that saves the day or the typical gang bangers looking for a quick come up. I believe this movie goes against the grain when it comes to heists and it worked. It also has an EPIC shootout scene.",Den of Thieves
547,darkicelee-32815,An action movie and that is all,5,14 February 2018,"A very attractive opening scene with lots of firing at the beginning and to the end. Good filming and directing.
Yet the story line is a mess, lots of irrelevant characters and chapters disrupt the connection of mainstream, why spend 10~20 minutes about Nick's wife and divorce that had nothing to do with the main story? Some characters showed up, have some conversation which belong to totally another story and then disappeared from the rest of the scene. A good script writer could bring this movie to a much upperlevel.",Den of Thieves
548,deanolatte,Just as good as ...,9,14 February 2018,"This film, in my humble opinion, is as good as 'The Usual Suspects'. The cast was solid and Pablo Schreiber outstanding as the villain. The pace of scenes were consistent with an action picture. The gritty setting of LA appropriate for the subject of bank robberies as it most certainly is the capital of that type of crime. 
Gerard Butler always delivers a solid performance and in this film delivers with spades. 50 Cent as good as always. O'Shea Jackson Jr. gives a stellar performance as the 'straw-man' turned master thief. The only factor that could have been a bit deeper in this film was for more of the main characters to have had more dimension. In that sense, Butler's character seems to have gotten all the attention. That is the only reason I did not give this film a 10.
Christian Gudegast has shone on a number of occasions that he has talent as a writer and now, as a director has produced a very good first showing. Fine editing by David Cox, Joel Cox and Nathan Godley as this type of film is easy to get wrong.
All in all, I was surprised and delighted with the twist at the end of the film. The only factor of disbelief was the photograph in the bar at the end. Although, it lent an interesting factor to Jackson's juxtaposition as a weak straw-man in the film. I wondered for a moment if the 'big-boss' was actually the bar owner. If his accent had been British, I would have been mulling over that possibility as I left the theater.",Den of Thieves
549,ashokbharadwaaj,"Good, yet lost track at times",7,11 April 2018,"Kinda lengthy movie - a mixed bag I would say. There are some very tense scenes and will keep you on the edge of your seat. For most part the movie was alright. There was no reasoning or actual logic behind some of the scenes - you will most certainly think why were those scenes even present and what is the impact of them on the entire plot. While some scenes were totally out of context and I felt like they were simply added to drag the movie. Director did try to mimic Sicario scenes towards the end but failed terribly. All in all, good acting by Pablo and Gerald Butler, and its a one time watch.",Den of Thieves
550,gusgarcia-24451,"Should Have Called it ""HEAT, the remake""",4,16 April 2018,"There were so many similarities to HEAT, it was laughable. I watched until the end to see if that was like HEAT, yup. Was entertaining, lots of shooting but not very original.",Den of Thieves
551,timmo-60064,Den of Thieves our scores the heart monitor,8,17 April 2018,"Den of Thieves hit home with the evil good in me. Pablo Schreiber and Gerard Butler are scary good. Talented and steady, Evan Jones and Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson professionally act out my favorite scene in the entire movie. O'Shea Jackson Jr. is a name I love seeing as part of this cast and performs excellently. Dawn Olivier Ieads the sexualized life of women in this movie but the impact she has in her role towards the overall message of family pronounced throughout the movie, rounded out my rating of the overall 8.If you are not a fan of action or suggestive themes, I urge you to listen to the gunshots, the breathing, and the tempo the sound has. The audio and the music are beautifully mixed.Most of the scenes are tough to believe, but that is one aspect of what makes my rating an 8. The blend of realistic instances and unbelievable truth were gorgeous in the writing and dialogue alike.Even further, the camerawork was a fresh take on action and gave life to the characters.Not sure how the movie performed in the box office, but if you are still reading this review, I highly suggest you watch this movie.Thank you for reading.",Den of Thieves
552,miskodevin,Worth a watch...if you're bored,6,30 April 2018,"Butler does a great job with what he is given, which is a script that seems to be the result of a drunken one night stand between Heat and Usual Suspects...with scene nods to Lethal Weapon and Oceans 11 thrown in for good measure.Entertaining flick with several implausible plot points.",Den of Thieves
553,haileystrickland,"Den of Thieves, Thieves you can trust",7,9 May 2018,"Den of Thieves is a two hour and twenty minute long action packed movie. It was full of great acting and the beginning of the movie was beyond great. 
 The beginning started out by telling us how Los Angeles is the bank robbery capital of the world, and it broke it down to how many robberies happen in a year, month, week, day, and even down to the minute. The ending was interesting on how they planned it all out and robbed the Federal Reserve of Los Angeles. 
 I thought the film had really good acting, the soundtrack was music i typically listen too, it had a great plot twist at the end and had an amazing story line. 
 Some of the things i didn't like about the movie was how it feels really stretched out. It also had a lot of side things going on that didn't make sense so i don't know why it had to be in the movie. 
 Like i said before this movie had some great acting, they picked the right people for each character. Each major character had their own little part in the movie whether it was about their family or what they used to do before they become well executed bank robbers. 
 It throws you off because you would think the person in charge would of came up with the plan to rob The Federal Reserve in Los Angeles, California but it was actually one of the other guy's plan the entire time. 
 I would say renting or buying this movie is way better than seeing it in theaters because a lot happens in this movie and it's very easy to get lost very fast. You also have to pay attention to the small little details as well.",Den of Thieves

It being in the heist genre caught my attention, along with Gerard and 50 cent in the cast. The opening scene is marvelous, it gives you a taste of what's in store for the rest of the film.This would be rated much higher if people weren't low-balling it with 1/10 scores, these people consider themselves ""critics"" and are stuck in nostalgia with the Michael Mann epic: Heat (1995). I have no idea who directed this movie, but they did a great job and admittedly I have watched it countless times.
