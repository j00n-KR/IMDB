0,bkoganbing,Ludlow Family Values,9,3 February 2018,"I have to say that the Oscar winning cinematography just blew me away in Legends Of The Fall. With British Columbia standing in for Montana of the early
20th century it's not called The Big Sky country for nothing. My guess though
is Montana now is a bit too developed now to get the proper feel for atmosphere
in which Anthony Hopkins raised his three boys all of whom turned out quite
different. The three sons in Legends Of The Fall are Aidan Quinn, Brad Pitt, and Henry
Thomas chronologically. Quinn is the solid and reliable eldest who becomes
one of Montana's Representatives in Congress. They usually had and still have
only two of them. Henry Thomas can't get out from under being the baby of
the family. The other two are constantly looking out for him.It's Brad Pitt as the middle son who is our brooding protagonist and the closest
thing Pitt ever did on screen as a romantic idol. Brad's like something out of
one of those romance novels. The brothers start showing their differences when Henry Thomas brings home
Julia Ormond as his intended bride. She gets all their hormones in overdrive
and when Thomas fails to return from World War I the rivalry between Pitt
and Quinn drives the rest of the film.Anthony Hopkins who served in the Indian wars in the cavalry was disillusioned
by said conflicts and built his own empire where the native Indians share in its
bounty. His kids however grew up in the era of Theodore Roosevelt where you answered your country's call no matter what. And like TR all three Ludlow
boys are imbued with the idealism of the Allied cause. All three go to Canada
and enlist in their army and defy their father. It all becomes a Greek tragedy of sorts in the end.The Oscar winning cinematography is just breathtaking. The vastness of God's
earth will dazzle the viewer and you might become an instant conservationist.
Legends Of The Fall also won an Oscar for Art&Set Design which is also wonderful and I think that TR's Sagamore Hill might have been a model used.Sad though that Hopkins, Pitt, Quinn, and Ormond got no Oscar recognition 
for this film. Even watching it on television without the big screen Legends Of
The Fall still blows me away.",Legends of the Fall
1,SnoopyStyle,Too Legendary and not enough subtlety,6,16 December 2013,"Col. William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) hoped to escape the world to live in Montana. He would raise 3 sons Alfred (Aidan Quinn), Samuel (Henry Thomas), and Tristan (Brad Pitt) in an idyllic life. However, the first World War and the arrival of Samuel's girl Susannah Fincannon (Julia Ormond) would put a strain in all their lives.It's very grand. It's a little too grand. It's too literary. There are great actors here. But even they can't elevate it beyond melodrama. Maybe they participated in overacting especially Brad Pitt. There is no time for subtlety. The landscape vistas are majestic. The music is sweeping. The emotions are big. The betrayals are epic. The losses are unimaginable. The journeys are soul wrenching.It may be impossible to do otherwise with the material. But I like to see it tried with a bit more restraint.",Legends of the Fall
2,classicsoncall,"""She was like the water that freezes in the rock, and splits it apart"".",9,23 August 2016,"Stellar performances by the principals highlight this early Twentieth Century period piece, with an epic scope that spans the era of World War I and tells the story of a family torn apart, not so much by a global conflict as much as the internal one among it's own members. This is one of those pictures one might seek out for entertainment, but for all that, it's not an entertaining picture. The rifts that occur between the Ludlow Brothers fester for years to come following the Big War, as the presence of Susannah Fincannon (Julia Ormond) serves as a catalyst for a family's undoing. It's Susannah that my summary line refers to, spoken by Cree Indian One Stab (Gordon Tootoosis) who's understanding of the ways of Man and nature permeate this story with insightful recognition. Exceptional cinematography and an emotional soundtrack complement the flow of the film nicely, though one must contend with the director's sense of melodrama that at times tends to overwhelm the narrative.",Legends of the Fall
3,lee_eisenberg,possibly THE historical epic against which all others should be judged,10,10 May 2005,"There are occasionally people who find history boring. Well, anyone who watches ""Legends of the Fall"" could not possibly find history boring. The movie tells the story of Col. William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) who has become disgusted with the American ""civilization"" of the early 20th century and is raising his sons Tristan (Brad Pitt), Alfred (Aidan Quinn) and Samuel (Henry Thomas) in rural Montana (his wife has left him and returned to the East Coast). Particularly repulsed at the US government's treatment of Native Americans, Col. Ludlow has befriended several Indians and is raising his sons with Indian wisdom.Tristan remains ever rebellious and sometimes his actions cause problems for the family. Alfred feels that if there is going to be any change in the government's policies, he may have to initiate them. Samuel goes to Canada so that he can fight alongside the English when World War I starts.The title refers specifically to the theoretical (or sometimes real) fall from innocence, as described in the Bible. As this movie shows, sometimes in life, there are no innocent people.Two other achievements in the movie are the cinematography and the score. John Toll's cinematography majestically shows the vast reaches of Montana's landscape, while the musical score is uplifting and somber at the same time.""Legends of the Fall"" was definitely one of the best movies of 1994.",Legends of the Fall
4,jboothmillard,Legends of the Fall,6,16 September 2008,"From Golden Globe nominated director Edward Zwick (Glory, Blood Diamond), this is quite a good epic drama about the life of a family. Set in the Rocky Mountains of Montana, there a ranch house, where discharged Colonel William Ludlow (Sir Anthony Hopkins) raises his three sons, Tristan (Golden Globe nominated Brad Pitt), Alfred (Aidan Quinn) and Samuel (E.T.'s Henry Thomas) who seem to have an unbreakable bond. Samuel brings home fiancé Susannah (Julia Ormond), who Alfred finds himself falling in love with, and so does Tritan. Despite Ludlow's objection, the brothers decide to fight in the First World War, and it is there that Samuel dies, and after Tristan goes off to try and live for himself, and comes back to find his father recovering from a stroke, and the bond between him and remaining brother Alfred still seems to be rocky. Also starring Karina Lombard as Isabel Two Decker Ludlow, Gordon Tootoosis as One Stab, Paul Desmond as Decker, Christina Pickles as Isabel Ludlow, Robert Wisden as John T. O'Banion, John Novak as James O'Banion and Kenneth Welsh as Sheriff Tynert. The mountains and valleys are stunning to look at, Pitt and Hopkins both do good performances, I might not paid full attention, but what I did was worth watching. It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score for James Horner. Very good!",Legends of the Fall
5,sunwarrior13,Not A Classic But Above Average,10,29 December 2011,"The sweeping, melodramatic saga of three brothers, their powerful father, and a beautiful woman, the popular period drama Legends of the Fall presents a romanticized view of rugged masculinity against lush Montana scenery. Based on a novel by Jim Harrison, the film covers decades in the lives of Alfred, Tristan, and Samuel Ludlow, the sons of retired military man William Ludlow. Legends of the Fall is an epic film based on the 1979 novella of the same title by Jim Harrison.It stars Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Aidan Quinn together with Julia Ormond,Henry Thomas,and Karina Lombard.The movie was directed by Edward Zwick.Raised by the unorthodox Ludlow after the departure of their mother, the boys grow up close, sharing an appreciation of the land and a pioneering spirit. The family becomes divided, however, when young Sam enlists in World War I over his father's objections, and his brothers follow suit to protect him. Despite these efforts, Sam dies in battle, leaving Alfred and Tristan to return home and deal with the lingering torment. Further complicating matters is the presence of Sam's beautiful fiancée, Susannah. After Sam's death, she attracts the romantic attention of both the responsible Alfred and the brooding Tristan, a conflict that threatens to drive the brothers apart. Aspiring to epic status, the film utilizes period detail and attractive landscapes as a backdrop for tragic, doomed romance.This is a magnificent melodrama that has a combination of emotion and grand historical scale similar to the James Dean 1956 classic,The Giant.Aside from that,it has brilliant performances from its cast especially Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins.Although it lacks an emotional punch to become a compelling and absorbing film,it is far from being a classic but it still is an above average film.",Legends of the Fall

7,Theo Robertson,Too Sprawling And Shapeless,5,22 April 2003,"I think director Edward Zwick has a massive inferiority complex . Primarily a maker of TV shows he sets out to make LEGENDS OF THE FALL the biggest cinematic epic the world had seen for many years and it goes without saying he fails ***** SPOILERS *****The story starts in 1914 in Montana where one of three Ludlow brothers - Samuel - is getting married to Susannah . All this is accompanied by great cinematography but the music is often intrusive and unwarranted . Not content with marrying a beautiful young woman Samuel and his two other brothers Alfred and Tristan enlist in the Canadian army to fight in the great war where Samuel dies . Alfred and Tristan return to the Montana landscapes where Alfred falls in love with Susannah but it`s Tristan who embarks on a sexual relationship with her to the strains of intrusive music , but then Tristan decides to become a hunter on a Pacific island , and after a few years he returns to find Susannah is now married to Alfred who is now a congressman Got the idea ? Got any of the ideas ? There`s so many ideas in the above paragraph to keep a Hollywood studio in business for several years . Oh and did I mention that we`re only half way through the film or that much of the film centres around Native American mystical mumbo jumbo ? This film makes THE DEER HUNTER look tightly plotted . And I`m sure I missed something . In fact I`m sure I missed everything because I can`t recall how all these subplots tie in with each other . What`s the reason for the Ludlows being so Anglophile ? Why did Tristan decide to become a hunter ? Oh I forgot to mention that several other of the main characters die which means their relationship to plot becomes superflous in the end .So in the end LEGENDS OF THE FALL is an overproduced mess instead of the epic that Edward Zwick hoped it would be . I`m sorry but sticking a bunch of massive subplots together and setting it to great cinematography and irritating music ( And I can`t tell you how annoying I found the music ) most certainly does not make a great film",Legends of the Fall
8,LeonLouisRicci,"A Beautiful Behemoth, Divisive and Demanding...Overall Entertaining",7,1 February 2016,"This Movie is Enormous. An Epic and Sprawling Scenario Designed to Elicit Awe and Emotion. Brad Pitt is Intentionally Photographed Like a Thing of Beauty While His Wild Nature is Forever Drawing Him to Conflict and Danger. ""There are animals here you can't find in books, and I've killed them all.""This Type of Overwrought Dialog Proliferates the Narration and can Bring Forth Unintended Laughter. The Acting too, At Times, can Do the Same if You have not Become Fully Engaged in the Melodrama. Anthony Hopkins, Post Stroke, is so Over-the Top, the Tragic Situations are Almost Lost in the Silliness.This is a Film that Divides Audiences. It's the Stuff of those Weighty Romance Novels with Bare Chested Hunks with Long Flowing Hair Given Wanting and Adulterous Looks from Females Below. It's a Beautiful Looking Movie with Postcard Images Capturing the Moment in Pristine Wonder.The Musical Score is Just as Stirring and Just as Overblown. It, along with the Aforementioned Scenery can do Nothing but Captivate. It's the Nature of the Beast and is Used Here for Maximum Effect. The Long and Winding Road of the Story is Rich with Human Melodrama and Depending on One's Point of View, is Either Ecstasy or Excruciating. Be Prepared for Heartstrings Being Pulled and for the Mind to Boggle. Overall, it is Nothing if Not for Lack of Trying and in the End it Probably Tried Too Hard.",Legends of the Fall
9,grantss,A movie of two halves...,5,22 December 2015,"Perplexing movie, as it is essentially a movie of two parts, and the two parts are vastly different in quality. The earlier part is boring, with a drifting, random plot and some incredibly cringeworthy acting by Brad Pitt (""overacting"" understates it!). The WW1 scenes are particularly unrealistic and style-over-substanceHowever, just when you've given up on the movie, it all starts to come together. A revenge thread is added, which makes for some of the more intriguing scenes in the movie. The family-drama thread also comes together, at last. Similarly, Brad Pitt's performance becomes more convincing.Would have been a pretty good movie if the first 45-60 minutes had been slimmed down and the plot tightened up.",Legends of the Fall
10,Boba_Fett1138,Might very well be the most overdone drama out of cinematic history. Powerful but not always effective.,6,3 September 2006,"Although certain good enough and beautiful looking ""Legends of the Fall"" is a drama that goes totally over-the-top and its story is filled with way too many dramatic elements and story lines to fill an only 2 hour long movie.First of all I can understand how a person could love this movie. All of its sequences are well made, acted out and filmed. The movie is filled with some dramatic powerful moments. But however the movie as a whole is a completely overdone one. Edward Zwick movies always are over-the-top and overdone in its drama but normally this works for the good, like is the case in Zwick movies such as ""Glory"" and ""The Last Samurai"". ""Legends of the Fall"" however really pushes it. Let's just analyze for a moment what happens in this movie, just for the fun of it. The boys their mother left them, their father is a war veteran, the three of them all fall in love with the same woman, one gets engaged to her and the other marries her while her heart truly lies with the one brother she doesn't marry, the boys go to war, one dies, their father gets a stroke, one brother goes mad and becomes a hunter, the woman commits suicide, Tristan's wife gets killed, they have a fugitive on their land who has an interracial relationship, there also is a crazy Indian who gets discriminated and in the end Tristan manges to get killed by a bear. Oh the drama! Come on, there is way too much happening and going on in this movie. The movie is only just over 2 hours long but there is enough happening in this movie to fill a 12 part mini-series with.Yet I can't help to still somewhat love this movie. It's mainly because its such a well made one, mainly in terms of its visual style and acting. The movie was nominated for three Oscar's- and won one for a good reason. ""Legends of the Fall"" is beautifully crafted. The John Toll cinematography is simply amazing and the musical score by James Horner is uplifting and effective. If you watch all the sequences on their own this movie is a perfect one. However when you put all of this sequences together the movie gets a disjointed, overdone and therefor also unlikely and even ridicules one. It's a movie to easily fall in love with but when you really start thinking about it and analyze it, you have to conclude that this movie is totally overdone. The movie tries to take epic proportions at times. A bit too much and too desperate really, for ""Legends of the Fall"" is a beautifully crafted movie but further more also a empty and distant one because too much is happening in a too short amount of time. I have to admit that the movie and story gets a bit better when it finally starts to concentrate on one character (the Brad Pitt character), rather than the whole Ludlow family. But after a while the movie starts to go downhill again once the drama kicks in again big time. It doesn't help to make the movie a engaging or realistic one to watch.All of the actors do a good job and the cast is impressive. Especially Anthony Hopkins and Julia Ormond give a fine dramatic performance. Whatever went wrong with Julia Ormond's career. Her career began really promising in the '90's but whatever movies does she play in now. Brad Pitt also gives a fine performance, from the period when he was still only cast in movies because of his pretty face. Something that ended after his performance in ""Se7en"". Other well known actors in this movie are Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas, who both appear in far too few popular movies these days. Still the fine acting can't help to make the movie convincing enough. They still put some life in the characters but foremost the characters remain pretty shallow and distant, as is the rest of the movie.Strangely enough still a perfectly watchable and good enough film to watch at least once. You'll be mostly still captivated by it but in the end the movie leaves a bad aftertaste. They simply overdid it. Too much good of something is bad in this case.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Legends of the Fall
11,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Great drama taking place before, during and after World War I",8,19 May 2004,"Normally love dramas don't interest me, since I find them boring and predictable. This film, while being more than ""just"" a good love drama, really impressed me. Many of the scenes are quite visually beautiful, some in cinematography, others in content. As a love drama, it's moving, and at times almost poetically beautiful. It involves three men, brothers, who are all in love with the same woman. She has a relationship with each of them, but ultimately realizes that she only loves one of them. The plot is very good, and evolves at the right pace for this type of story. Not terribly fast, but never stands still either. The actors all portray their respective characters well, nearly all of them giving a perfect performance. Anthony Hopkins is great, as always. There was not really anything in this movie that disappointed me. The ending scene involves some of the best cinematography I've ever seen. There is a very emotional scene near the end which is also one of the most visually beautiful I've ever seen in a movie. I recommend this to most fans of love dramas, and, to a lesser extent, fans of war dramas. 8/10",Legends of the Fall
12,evanston_dad,When Will Edward Zwick Stop Inflicting His Movies on Us?,4,17 March 2009,"Edward Zwick makes pretty but quite terrible movies, and ""Legends of the Fall"" is no exception.This leisurely yarn has something to do with brothers working on a cattle ranch falling for the same woman. I don't remember much about it except for numerous shots of Brad Pitt riding by on a horse, lovely locks flowing in the breeze, and a rather embarrassing performance by Anthony Hopkins, who plays the brothers' dad and spends the last half of the film stumbling around after his character suffers a stroke. Julia Ormond is pretty but vapid -- she's a less talented and less interesting version of Juliette Binoche.The whole thing might go down smoother if director Zwick didn't feel the need to constantly pound everything down your throat.Grade: C-",Legends of the Fall
13,FlashCallahan,Elliott never stood a chance.....,6,28 June 2014,"Colonel Ludlow decides to raise his three sons in the wilds of Montana, where they are away from the government and society he has turned his back on. The brothers mature and have an unbreakable bond, and when Samuel, the youngest of the three, returns from college, he brings with him his beautiful fiancée, Susanna. The eldest son, Alfred, soon finds himself in love with her, and things become complicated when he discovers a growing passion between Susanna and Tristan, Colonel Ludlow's favourite son. As the brothers set out to war, suspicion and jealousy threaten to tear apart their bond.....Sumptuous, scenic, smouldering, sensual, and anything else beginning with the letter S describes this would be epic, but come the end of the film, it leaves you feeling depressed and empty.Granted, it's beautiful to look at, and The acting is top notch, but any fool would know that Pitt was always going to get Ormond, the minute Zwick gives him his grand entrance.Pitt sizzles whenever he is on screen, and given the fact that Thomas doesn't look a day older than when he was in E.T., and witters away in more or less every scene he's in.Quinn is okay, but he is more of a spare part than a main character here, as the second and third act consists of Pitt's quest to find himself, and it all becomes a little convoluted toward the end, so we just get tragedy after tragedy happening to distract the viewer from all the pointlessness of the narrative.It looks as good as Pitt, Hopkins does his best staring into the distance, and it all ends with a big bear fight.",Legends of the Fall
14,Wuchakk,"Similar to ""A River Runs through It"" but more heroic and melodramatic",7,1 January 2021,"Near the close of the 19th Century, a disillusioned Army Colonel (Anthony Hopkins) sets up a ranch in remote western Montana with his Cree friend, One Stab (Gordon Tootoosis). He nurtures a family of a wife & three boys, plus his loyal personnel. One son is sensible and ""follows the rules (Aidan Quinn) while another is wild and well-versed in Cree traditions (Brad Pitt). After a harrowing involvement in WW1, the two brothers go separate ways during the Prohibition Era of the 20s and early 30s. Julia Ormond and Karina Lombard are on hand in the feminine department.""Legends of the Fall"" (1994) is similar to ""A River Runs through It"" from two years prior. Pitt basically plays the same character, just exaggerated here. Where these movies differ is the earlier one was based on Norman Maclean's memoir and is therefore thoroughly realistic whereas ""Legends"" was based on James Harrison's book and has a larger-than-life vibe. Like that earlier film, ""Legends"" effectively brings to life the era with its Model T's and bootlegging of alcoholic beverages.While I give the edge to ""A River Runs through It,"" this one ain't no slouch. It begins mundane and tedious with AmerIndian mumbo jumbo (I'm talking about the eye-rolling spiritual gobbledygook, e.g. the ""wild spirit of the bear""), but picks up when the boys go to Europe to fight. Like ""A River Runs through It,"" this is a character study of two contrasting souls, both generally likable and noble, but one functions successfully within the box of society whereas the other cannot be contained in this box.Although neither trips my trigger much, Ormond is very attractive and Lombard is stunning.At the end of the day, ""Legends"" is a well-done artistic Western that takes place in the early 20th Century with commentary on the masculine nature, duty, bravery, death, love, rivalry, commitment or lack of commitment, searching for meaning, familial altercations, following the rules, living ""free,"" tragedy, acceptance, forgiveness and honor. It's simply about life and every family will be able to relate, one way or another.The film runs 2 hours, 13 minutes, and was shot in Alberta, Canada (Ghost River, Morley & Calgary), and Vancouver, British Columbia (the Helena scenes), as well as Ocho Rios, St. Ann, Jamaica (the exotic scenes).GRADE: B+",Legends of the Fall
15,JamesHitchcock,"Despite its flaws, a film one can admire for its ambition",7,15 September 2011,"Edward Zwick is not the most prolific of directors; in a career which to date has lasted a quarter of a century he has only made ten films. He is, however, one of the few modern directors with a taste for the grand epic manner, evidenced by films like ""Glory"" and ""The Last Samurai"" which show the influence of earlier directors like David Lean and William Wyler.""Legends of the Fall"" is another epic drama in the same vein. Like the more recent ""There Will Be Blood"" it can be seen as falling within the Western tradition, although it is not normally described as a Western. Apart from the final scene, which is set in 1963, the action takes place during the years 1910s, 1920s and 1930s, and centres upon the Ludlow family of Montana. The family patriarch is the Cornish-born Colonel William Ludlow. Ludlow served with distinction in the US Army for many years, but has become disillusioned with war after seeing atrocities committed by troops against the Native American population. He has become not only a pacifist but also something of an anarchist who distrusts all governments and their works. He has come to admire the Native American peoples and the film is narrated by his friend One Stab, a member of the Cree nation.Central to the plot is that Ludlow's three sons, Alfred, Tristan, and Samuel, all fall in love with the same woman, Susannah Fincannon. Susannah is originally the fiancée of the youngest son, Samuel, but their romance is interrupted when he and his two brothers (much to their father's displeasure) all go off to fight in World War I. The old man's displeasure is increased by the fact that, because America is still neutral, they are not obliged to fight, but volunteer to join the Canadian Army to aid Britain in her fight against Germany. Samuel is killed in action, and when Alfred and Tristan return home both fall in love with Susannah.The two men are very different in character. The cautious, conformist Alfred goes into politics, becoming a member of first the Montana state legislature and then of the US Congress. Tristan, by contrast, is a wild, rebellious free spirit, but haunted by guilt over what he sees as his failure to protect Samuel during the war. He roams the world before becoming a bootlegger during the Prohibition era. Susannah and Tristan become lovers for a time, but their relationship is a doomed one, and she eventually marries Alfred. (It is perhaps significant that Tristan is named after the hero of a romance about doomed love).There are two particularly good acting performances. One comes from the normally excellent Anthony Hopkins as the ageing Colonel; the other from Brad Pitt as Tristan. Pitt is not always my favourite actor. In his more commercial ventures such as ""Troy"", ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" and the ""Ocean's"" franchise he often seems content just to stroll his way through the movie without putting in any real effort. Give him a more challenging role, however, and he often rises to the challenge, as in ""Fight Club"" and ""Babel"". Here as Tristan he brings a passionate intensity, as well as a suggestion of an underlying unhappiness to the role. Julia Ormond may have largely disappeared from sight since 1994, but here as Susannah (her first major starring role) she does enough to show just why she was regarded as one of the rising young stars of the mid-nineties.The film has its faults; it is overlong, at times moves too slowly and the plot, which is considerably more complex than my brief summary above might suggest, is a loose, sprawling one which does not always hang together well. And yet, despite its flaws, it is a film one can admire for its ambition. The photography, especially of the Montana landscapes is striking; the Academy Award for ""Best Cinematography"" was well-deserved. It is a film which combines an epic grandeur and sense of scale with a passionate family drama and some touching moments. It is not quite the masterpiece which Zwick and the producers seem to have been aiming for- they were, apparently, hoping for several more Oscars- but it is an honourable attempt at one. 7/10",Legends of the Fall
16,Smells_Like_Cheese,Better than I thought it would be,7,16 January 2008,"In 1994, my big sister had this huge thing for Brad Pitt, well, every woman did, I think it was Brad's hair, the hair every woman wanted to have, lol. But my sister's big obsession was with Interview with the Vampire and Legends of the Fall, and to me, Legends of the Fall just looked boring, and I never wanted to see it. But on New Year's day, my friend and I were flipping through the channels and came across Legends of the Fall and decided to go ahead and see what it was about. So we watched it and I have to say that actually it was a good movie. It was beautifully shot, thanks to Edward Zwick's talent as a director, and created this into a wonderful story. Also the performances were absolutely terrific, the cast really made the story a pleasure to watch.The Ludlow brothers are close and have a wonderful brotherhood, but as adults, their lives take on separate directions. Tristan and Samuel go to war and Samuel is tragically killed. Tristan comes back home to his other brother, Alfred, and his father, William, and Alfred has taken an interest into politics as well as trying to woo his crush, Susannah, but she loves Tristand and has an affair with him. But Tristan soon leaves to discover himself and when he returns, he finds out that Susannah has married Alfred. Tristan then marries a beautiful woman, Isabel, and has two beautiful children with her, but when tragedy strikes again, Tristan wants revenge and Alfred must learn the meaning of loyalty and brotherhood.Legends of the Fall is really a good movie I would say. I think besides the way it's shot, it's the performances that really make the film a good one. Because we know that this film could have been really boring, but thanks to Zwick, he made it into one of the semi-over looked films of 1994. Aidan and Anthony pull in the great performances though, especially Aidan, he was so heart breaking, he makes you hate his character and then love him again. I would recommend Legends of the Fall, for those who appreciate film, this is a good one to watch.7/10",Legends of the Fall
17,KineticSeoul,More corny than poetic,5,31 January 2011,"When I first saw the movie poster and the actors that was involved, I was expecting a pretty good story. In that department I was disappointed, it's basically a narrow love story that is cliché and very formulaic. The constant emotional or dramatic music that plays in almost every scene starts to get annoying after a while as well. The main highlight of this film is the young Brad Pitt and the makers of this movie knows this as well, and not because his character stood out or anything. But because it's the type of movie where the handsome man rides in with his horse and gets the female audiences to drool. The movie is basically about three brothers falling for the same girl and all the drama that goes with it. The story is also very slow moving and gets tedious after a while, I enjoy some romance movie but I can't really say I really enjoyed this one all that much. The pacing is awkward like some scenes were cut due to length, so I assume the book to probably be better. Some critics claim this movie is poetic, but I just found it mostly corny.5.5/10",Legends of the Fall
18,g-bodyl,Sweeping Epic!,9,4 March 2013,"Legends of the Fall is a sweeping romantic western that is one to remember for the ages. I love when they make these kind of films because they bring out the inner western solitude from me. This film reminded me deeply of Dance With Wolves which of course is better, but this is still a strong-willed film. This film is not only a showcase of great acting, but it features sweeping, gorgeous cinematography and just stunning landscape shots which are always necessary in movies like this.Edward Zwick's film is about the bond of three brothers and their powerful father who is a retired colonel. This film follows the storyline of the kids growing up to the time of World War One and Prohibition.As I said before, this film is a showcase for acting. It features top-notch performances from everyone in the film but Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins carry the film. Hopkins has one of his better roles as the retired colonel and he is just so good. Brad Pitt proves here why he has the makings of being a star. He had a few emotional scenes where he struggled to find his inner self.Overall, this is a glorious, sweeping epic that does not take itself too seriously. It has a few central themes about family and friendship and this movie does a good job on getting those points across. This film may not have much action, but the western aspect is done well as that is why I'm reminded of Dance with Wolves. I rate this film 9/10.",Legends of the Fall

20,secondtake,"Beautiful, yes, but overdone and absurdly epic to the point of embarrassment...",6,26 March 2015,"Legends of the Fall (1994)This movie looks and feels good, and it goes far. However...It ends up being an overblown, simplistic epic sprawl, redeemed by Brad Pitt. It is filled with scenes of high drama, and some of them are truly moving—mostly sad and tragic. But there is a long string of clichés here, as if real human depth is reached through excess and borrowed ideas.The war scenes (WWI) are so fake it's painful. Yes, there are bombs and terrific lighting, but the acting, and the reactions to fighting and dying, are stripped of any truth and honesty. Likewise, the conflicts between the brothers are oversimplified, and the one young woman in the movie, the siren, is admirable (and the actress is terrific) but so symbolic it's just pure sexism. Anthony Hopkins plays the patriarch of this family with three sons and this newcomer woman. The local Native Americans add a ""Dances with Wolves"" element that sometimes is a relief from the overdone drama, but often it too fulfills clichés. WWI intervenes. More clichés.Okay, I hated this movie and yet—trying hard—I liked the look of it. The director, relatively inexperienced Edward Zwick, seems to know movies better than life. It reminds me (in this way among others) of ""Shawshank Redemption"" which I also found filled with simplistic solutions to interesting human problems. (I'm sure this will get some thumbs downs for this review—go for it.) Put it like this—if you like sentiment, if you like to feel more than think (which is not a bad thing), and if you don't really analyze movies but prefer to just experience them uncritically, this might really be a moving and terrific experience. And Brad Pitt is terrific. Final note—the music is overbearing. I suppose this fits the grandiose themes overall, but it was so saccharine and heavy it pushes the emotional aspects very hard. Hey, look, this is an emotional film and filled with heartache and unbelievable tragedy. If you can turn a blind eye to all the contrivances that make it happen, you'll be okay. If not, run fast.",Legends of the Fall
21,The-Sarkologist,An excellent Critique of Civilisation,7,29 June 2013,"This movie is not, as advertised on the video cover, one of the best movies released. There are far better ones out there. Legend of the Fall is not a bad movie though; in fact it is quite a good and well constructed movie. There is a lot in this movie if one looks closely, the major theme being a criticism on civilisation.The movie is set on a ranch in Dakota and goes from the late 1800's to the mid 1920's and chronicles the life of three brothers: Samuel, Tristan, and Matthew. These three brothers symbolise three things: Samuel is naivety; Tristan is the wild; and Matthew is the civilised. Samuel's naivety kills him pretty quickly when World War I breaks outs. Matthew, an officer, is discharged after an injury, while Tristan goes wild after his brother's death and is discharged soon after. This aspect of the movie is very anti-war; the brothers leave seeking glory, all except Tristan who goes to look after his brothers, but all return in an unglorious manner. Matthew is wounded, Tristan is wild, Samuel is dead. There is a very strong animosity towards war in this movie, especially from the boys' father, Colonel Ludlow. Right at the opening he throws his sword down and walks away from an Indian Village. He has seen the truth of war and is very much against it and the government after this. The Colonel, as well as being against war and the government, has come to an understanding that the Indians are real suffering people and becomes a sympathiser.The ranch is on the border of civilisation and a number of times people come and go from the ranch and there is a symbolisation with the way that they leave. The mother, Isabella, is the first to leave and she leaves in a carriage, her destination is the cities of the east. When Samuel returns with his fiancé Suzanna, they come in by car. When the brothers leave to war they leave on horseback, and they return on horseback. When Tristan leaves to travel the world, he leaves on horseback. It seems that the horse symbolises travelling into the wild and the unknown. Even though the war is in Europe, the war is uncivilised, as Colonel Ludlow says, and is wild. The authorities arrive at the ranch in two ways, first they come on horseback, later they come by car and this seems to be merging the civilised with the uncivilised.As the movie moves on, we begin to see that what we once considered to be civilsed is really not. There is a large distinction at the beginning, but as we see with Europe, the centre of civilisation, plunging into war, so we see urban United States also plunging into a state of barbarism. This comes out with the prohibition act and how the authorities begin to use standover tactics to intimidate Tristan. When he is arrested, it is not for smuggling, rather it is for beating up a police officer. The corruption of the government is clearly seen in the congressman's party where the upperclass are drinking champagne even though alcohol is illegal.The point of Legend of the Fall is that there is no such thing as civilisation. Though we sit on the borderlands, everywhere we go is wilderness, even in the heart of urban America. The beast that is with Tristan is in all others, it is only that they have learnt to control that beast. The only truly civilised person in the movie is the Indian storyteller who never speaks a word of English (the narrative has been translated, the Indian is narrating it in his own language). He refuses to sink so low.",Legends of the Fall

24,Dr_Coulardeau,Damnation in Montana,10,18 July 2009,"A masterpiece in its genre, post Indian war frontier films, Montana in that case. A masterpiece too because of the three sons entirely entrusted to their ex-officer of a father because of the running away of the mother who could not stand the cold winters of Montana and was afraid of grizzly bears, that loving friendly species of furry animals more or less the cousins of our home-friendly teddy bears. Then the eldest son goes to the city of his mother to study and comes back with a fiancée, but it is 1914 and the three sons can only follow their patriotic call to go and fight in Europe on the English side. The father is furious but nothing can stop that call of the wild. The picture of the first world war is dramatic when you see these British soldiers running to the German lines with simple rifles and no helmets when the Germans have machine guns, helmets of course and gas masks against their poisonous gases. The eldest son is killed and the youngest son does what an old Indian rite tells him to do. He gets the heart of his brother out and eventually sends it back to his father for it to be buried in due place. Then he gets his Indian colors on his face and goes out to kill and scalp two German machine-gun operators, two of your teeth for one of my teeth. The middle son, wounded on one leg, is sent home and the younger son eventually comes back home. The real stake of the film then is Susanna, the fiancée of the elder son who was killed in the war. She was in love before the departure of the three brothers and still is after the war with the younger son, a wild but thrilling personality. A competition between the two surviving brothers starts then. Susanna chooses the younger one, but his wild side, what the Indian story teller calls his bear side, calls him away and he yields to that call and leaves the ranch for several years in order to discover the world and conquer his thirst, hunger and even his ravenous greed for the unknown and the savage. When he comes back Susanna has gone to the middle brother who has become a congressman in the meantime. The younger son, Justin, then accepts the situation and marries the daughter of the main family working on the ranch, from an Indian mother and an American father. He will get two children from her but he will try to compete with the prohibition traffickers who have the full support of the local sheriff. That will lead to a drama, the death of his wife, then his vengeance as soon as he is out of prison, on bail I suspect, and the attempt of the main moonshiner with the help of the sheriff to come and kill that rebellious man. And there the plot thickens and from dramatic we jump to tragic. And the main character of the story all get the ends they deserve, the middle brother, the younger brother, Susannah, the father and all the others, including the local moonshiner and his police friends. The end of the younger brother, in 1963 mind you, is absolutely brilliant. Add to that very strong story the beautiful and breathtaking landscape and mountains of Montana and you really enjoy every single scene. And after it all, when the last die is thrown on the marble of the tombstone you keep in mind the strong images about the first world war and the no less strong discourse of the father against all kinds of war that are declared bad by principle. Are they really bad by principle? Is there nothing to save a war now and then? For this film certainly not, and that is the fault of the politicians who are ready to do any kind of profitable maneuver to keep their juicy positions in government.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID",Legends of the Fall
25,filipemanuelneto,"Overlly sentimental and mushy, but still good enough to worth seeing",5,14 February 2017,"This film tells the story of the lives of Colonel Ludlow and his three children (Alfred, Samuel and Tristan) in the prairies. Marked by passions and conflicts, their lives are intertwined with one women for whom the three brothers fall in love (although they don't engage her at the same time, obviously). The film was thought of as a romantic drama of epic proportions and the script, in fact, exaggerates in sentimental appeals in addition to being overly ambitious. The use of big landscape plans, despite being a very attractive cinematography feature and giving the film a more accentuated elegance and beauty, further reinforces this addictive and almost senseless sentimentality, that permeates the entire film, not to mention the soundtrack. The soundtrack is beautiful, but it was used as a permanent romantic leitmotiv and it ends up wearing it and wearing down the public as well. Edward Zwick may now be famous but, when he directed this film, he had no experience with filmmaking, having limited himself to making some mild comedy movies for TV market. This inexperience and willingness to show off in the cinema are probably the origin of such a great film, so epic, so dramatic and so unbearably mushy. I must even mention the quality work developed by Anthony Hopkins (a veteran who shines in the role of the old colonel, as expected) and Brad Pitt, who performs regularly in the role of Tristan, the rebellious son, even if the latter actor cannot survive the wave of sentimentality and have his character transformed into a out-of-time romantic hero, eternally in conflict with the world around him. Either way, it's a watchable movie, especially for couples on Valentine's Day or on similar moments.",Legends of the Fall
26,funkyfry,Solid pioneer drama,7,5 March 2007,"Director Zwick takes elements that could be very forgettable (like the recent ""Cold Mountain"") and turns them into a very engaging story about a frontier family torn apart by jealousies and pride. Only the film's tidy ending lowers it somewhat from being an excellent film.The story concerns a former warrior in both the Civil and Indian Wars, Colonel William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) after he settles down in the Dakota territory to raise his 3 sons. Bright, well-educated and well-groomed son Samuel (Henry Thomas) brings home a lovely and also well-groomed fiancé Susannah (Julia Ormond) just before heading off to fight for France in WWI on an idealistic impulse that his father opposes. His other 2 brothers accompany him -- one older and feeling himself to be the most responsible, Alfred (Aidan Quinn), and the other younger and more wild Tristan (Brad Pitt), whose habits and inclinations match the adventurous spirit of his namesake. After Sam is killed in action, the other 2 brothers begin a decades long battle over Susannah's love which divides the family and brings great sadness to everyone's lives.The performances are reasonably well done. Hopkins is always good as a rough former gentleman, and I found his defensive attitude when his sons decide it is their duty to go to war very well done. I also have to admire his work in the second half of the film after a stroke has left his character unable to move the right side of his body. Hopkins' performance becomes more intense and sad as his character recedes more and more into old age. Ormond was suitable but little more.... not only was the character written so that we can't really understand why she ends up marrying Alfred despite being in love with Tristan, but she does little to add to the mystery with her understated way of showing depression later in the film. Quinn does the best work of the 3 sons -- the picture clearly emerges of a man who is trying hard to do the right thing and feels intolerable pain at the fact that his father and even his wife feel more love for the less reliable and amoral Tristan regardless. There are many points in the story where we don't like Alred, but for the most part Quinn enables us to see the character's actions through his own eyes. Pitt's performance varies from very effective to somewhat unconvincing depending on the nature of the scene he's playing. I thought his sadness over Samuel's death was very convincing, but I never 100% bought into the notion that he was so uncivilized that he would just run off for years without leaving a trace or sending word. I never really bought that he was this Davy Crockett type pioneer guy. Part of that is physical and can't be blamed on Pitt -- he's just too pretty to believe that he never sleeps on a bed. There are also some good supporting performances, particularly Gordon Tootoosis who puts in time as a former chieftain who Ludlow has more or less adopted. His presence greatly aids Pitt's attempts to appear as a kind of free spirit of the wild.The film's great strength is in the direction, which distracts the audience from various points that might have seemed cliché. The director's focus is on his characters and he never lets attention wander to the landscape or the scenery for too long, despite the excellent production values.The film's greatest weakness is the fact that distraction would be possible at all, or that you would need such good photography and direction to cover up the somewhat obvious nature of the script. (SPOILER) The death of Tristan's wife was the only real shocker for me, and everything after that point including Alfred's rejoining the fold in the final shoot-out was somewhat predictable.Overall, a very good film of its type.",Legends of the Fall
27,thinker1691,""" The Wounded Bear cries from the forest, but only a legend seeks out death with him """,9,8 May 2011,"The movie is called "" Legends of The Fall "" a novella written by Jim Harrison and directed by Edward Zwick. It follows the story of an aging American Cornel, who is betrayed by the U.S. government. Selecting a beautiful stretch of the high Alpine mountains of Montana, Col. William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) superb acting, set to raise his children. With the birth of three health young boys, Ludlow, tries to give them the benefit of his years of experience. However, each son is blessed/cursed to follow his own heart and this sets the brothers on their own path, often against themselves. Aidan Quinn plays Alfred the oldest and despite his father's warning, ends up working for the government. Henry Thomas plays Samuel, the innocent second son who believes the tabloids of the first world war and rushes to join the military. Brad Pitt, plays Tristan Ludlow, his father's and most everyone else's favorite. Gordon Tootoosis, plays 'One Stab' who becomes mentor and narrator of the story. The film is impressive as it follows the family through the seasons and with it creates a memorable narrative of an enormous grizzly bear who becomes the spirit focus of not only Tristan, indeed, of the generations which follow.

28,smatysia,"A wonderful, emotional melodrama",9,21 April 2000,"A really good film. Basically a melodrama. Repeat, MELOdrama. Hollywood used to churn out this sort of film all the time with no apologies. OK, many of them seem corny now, but why do people think that every movie made has to be stark realism? I was tremendously impressed with Brad Pitt's performance. (I'm a guy, so I mean that, and am not swooning over his looks). I had never seen him in anything before, and had barely heard of him.  Anthony Hopkins was, as always, fantastic. In fact every single actor hit every single note with the possible exception of Henry Thomas. One of Aidan Quinn's best films, also. The photography of Alberta is magnificent, and I think no one can begrudge LOTF its cinematography Oscar.The film makers have an excuse for the occasional credibility lapse, in that there is a story frame, the recollections of One Stab, the old Cree. This covers things like Susannah falling for Samuel, who seemed to be an empty suit, Tristan keeping his long hair while in the British Army, etc. Excellent performance by Gordon Tootoosis, by the way, although his manner of speaking is very reminiscent of Chief Dan George.I highly recommend this film, if you can watch it without trying to dislike it.",Legends of the Fall

Edward Zwick directs with a fine sense of realism and massive scope in vision. The battles and fights are as exciting as the tender romance moments. The score from James Horner is lovely, sweeping across the shots of fields and wilderness, cradling each scene carefully. It's one of Brad Pitt's best performances, if not his best. Anthony Hopkins is fantastic and over the top in a very good way. Julia Ormond, Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas all pick up the slack in their scenes as well.",Legends of the Fall
30,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Vast, sweeping, soul stirring romantic epic",10,13 September 2015,"Edward Zwick's Legends Of The Fall is sweeping Hollywood grandeur at its finest. It's a raging typhoon, one part family high drama, one part war film, wrapped in a nostalgic, old world romance that hearkens back to the golden age of cinema. It's an epic as only the pictures can show us, blowing a gust of storytelling wind at us and depositing us on the endless plains of the 1900's, in the monumental Rocky Mountains of Montana. The story focuses on Colonel William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins, gnarled nobility incarnate), living with his three sons in the desolation of an old world making way for a new, as the four of them deal with love, loss, war, nature and interpersonal conflict in a story that plumbs the chasms of human nature and spits out characters that bleed raw feeling, reach out to one another in the clamour of a nation only just being formed (like the land itself), and clash in tragic harmony, spanning years in their lives and showing us desperation, grief and brotherhood. Brad Pitt, in the fiercest performance I've ever seen him muster, plays Tristan, Ludlow's half Native son with a wild streak a mile long and a kinship with the tangled wilderness he calls home. Aiden Quinn plays the middle brother Alfred, a reserved, analytical type. When their younger brother Samuel (Henry Thomas), arrives home with his beautiful fiancé Susannah (Julia Ormond) sparks fly between her and Tristan, and an immediate rift is formed in the family that Ormond sees all too well, but cannot deny her love for Pitt. Samuel is a fragile, easily traumatized man, and when the boys are driven from their lands to fight in the war, it dampens his soul with a ruining force of horror that leaves him scarred forever. Tristan, being almost animalistic at heart, sinks into the carnage of combat with the keen resilience of a wolf, and is transformed in a different fashion. This to me is the penultimate sequence of the film, as it strays from the picturesque grandeur of their life before, removed from the world of conflict, into the sheer reality that befalls a country in formation, representing a loss of innocence so to speak. Neither of them are the same after that, and the cracks in their brotherhood only etch further after tragedy befalls Susannah, blackening their idealistic home life as well and tainting the memory with aching sadness. Tristan tries to move on, either to wrap the hurt in a cloak of new events, or because his instinctual nature spurs him on, but he almost seems to be cursed, and more hardships step into his path as well. I don't want to deter you from seeing this by laying all this doom and gloom into my review, because it's actually a very beautiful film to see unfolding, it just deals with incredibly tragic subject matter that will leave you breathless with tears, like Titanic, or Romeo & Juliet. Pitt.. What can I say. He's outstanding, giving Tristan the fearsome gaze of a wounded animal, and the love struck longing that's shot down by fate, turning him into a prisoner of his own ephemeral love for those who are taken from him. It's my second favourite of his roles (it's hard to top Twelve Monkeys) and he shines in it like a silver star over the Montana horizon. Montana itself basically screams to be pored over by a camera, and the cinematography will make you feel every gust of mountain air and gasp at the looming crags and sun dappled glades that leap out from your screen at you. It's one of the last of a dying breed: the romantic epic. Like Titanic, or Gone With The Wind and Doctor Zhievago before it, it posses that untouchably bold quality that showcases emotion, tragic happenstance and deep longing all set in a breathtaking setting that is meant to move and astonish you. A classic.",Legends of the Fall
31,gcd70,"Melodramatic, uninspiring and never legendary",3,7 February 2008,"Director Ed Zwick attempts to achieve what he did so splendidly with the civil war in ""Glory"" with a totally different genre in ""Legends of the Fall"", that of family drama. ""Glory"" depicted the first African-American regiments' trials and triumphs in epic fashion, yet ""Legends"" depicts the trials and triumphs of the Ludlow boys with little affect. Unfortunately Mr. Zwick has tried to turn small scale into large scale with not nearly enough material. The result is a melodrama that's way too soapy (much too much happens to this clan), totally uninspiring and pointless, and never legendary.""Legends of the Fall"" is episodic without creating any fascination for the viewer. In fact it is often dreary and suffers greatly from over length. Although the narrative is occasionally moving, it rarely threatens to get interesting and is too often implausible.As the three brothers, Aidan Quinn, Brad Pitt (ever the hunk) and Henry Thomas all give solid performances, as does the pretty love interest, Julia Ormond.

They're the sons of an eccentric ex-colonel (Hopkins) who lives in a beautiful ranch in the middle of Montana nowhere. His wife Isabelle dumped him and moved to Boston, but they are in friendly terms and write constantly to each other.The only other people at the ranch are: the annoying native One Something (forgot his name) who understands English but refuses to communicate in that language; an outlaw who married a female native and their daughter, Isabel Two. Seems too few people to manage all the land and the cattle, but still...Alfred, Tristan and Samuel are the brothers who in turn get to smooch Susannah. She's engaged to youngest Samuel, who dies in WWI, but she's secretly in love with Tristan. Once Tristan gets back from the war, the two love birds could get together, but Tristan is the wild one and feeling guilty for not having protected Samuel, he conveniently embarks in an adventurous tour of the world, writing the occasional letter home, while Susannah is supposed to ""wait forever"" for him.The ""forever"" is described in the film as if lasting decades, but from the last of Tristan's letters in 1918 to his return and the birth of his son with Isabel Two in 1921, it is only three years. During this time Susannah married Alfred, but she would clearly go back to Tristan.If you're not fed up with this melodrama, add some bootleggers, some dramatic departures, vengeance, native chanting, war painting and scalping and the most annoying soundtrack.One star by default, one to the photography and one to the beautiful young leads, Pitt and Ormond.

34,triple8,why SHOULDN'T this film have received an Oscar nomination?,10,13 August 2003,"There's something about Legends of the Fall that is haunting.

So what? I thought this was an excellent movie, very moving, actually exceptionally so. It's a superb movie with unforgettable characters, haunting music and some of the most gorgeous scenery I've ever seen. Don't expect just another period piece. Brad Pitt was delightful although it wasn't his best role(close enough) and I also really liked Aiden Quinn who put in an Oscar worthy performance. In fact, I liked everybody. I would like to know why Julia Ormond did not become an instant star from this or at least get an Oscar nomination, she was absolutely brilliant. My feeling is, had this movie been made with a different, more ""serious"" cast it would have received a lot more critical recognition. (Picture Legends Of The Fall:starring Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep.)So many people lump Brad Pitt as a pretty boy ignoring the fact that he's a really good actor.

35,eric262003,Very Flawed With Impressive Technical Features,6,11 March 2013,"Like the instincts of a sad puppy dog, ""Legends of the Fall"" is likely enough to manipulate the audience by staring at you in the eyes, jump at you and salivate at you with their big red tongues. It's an unsettling story that's way too oratorical for my tastes and seems more dependent on style over substance, but for some reason I can't explain, it still lured me because it was very entertaining. I could rattle on for hours of all the flaws in this movie, and yet after all the ranting I still find something that made this movie at least worthwhile. And the main element that made this film worthy to view comes in one person and his name's Brad Pitt. Just Pitt's performance alone eradicates all the flaws that have materialized in the entire movie alone.Situated in the great state of Montana in the early 20th century, it tells the tale of the Ludlow family as Col. William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) decides to resign from military life after getting frustrated over the government's neglecting the policies over Native People. The story begins in the year 1914 when the youngest of the three Ludlow brothers Samuel (Henry Thomas) introduces his family towards his new fiancée, Susannah (Julia Ormond). But her welcoming has quite a chain reaction because the oldest Ludlow brother Alfred (Aidan Quinn) is also smitten by her presence, but she has her eyes set on the middle son, Tristan (Brad Pitt). Soon the three brothers follow their father's legacy and go off to fight in the First World War. Sadly one of the brothers gets killed and a love triangle ensues between the surviving two brothers and leaving poor Susannah in the middle.For the opening half hour I actually was glued to the seat. At first I was given the impression that this movie was going to be a good, wholesome family drama with tons of positive issues going for it. All the performances were quite brilliant and the exchange in dialogues by the Ludlow Brothers felt natural like they really were brothers and the pacing was perfect in a way that it was neither rushed or lagging, but right in the middle. But once the brothers journey off to Europe, the movie starts to fall apart and never has time to recover. One minute I'm enjoying this confidently made movie and then next thing you know it falls off the tracks and like a bumpy ride you feel yourself relived that it's finally over. What transpires in this rubble is Tristan travelling the globe with a guilty conscious while he's selling alcohol to the Irish and we're treated to three funerals. And by making the story feel like a Native American legend, we see Tristan mysteriously befriending a bear, which not only looks comical, but contrived.Though the script and the performances may have looked awkward, I would have to say that the technical features. In 1989, director Edward Zwick created a brilliant atmosphere when he made ""Glory"" and he follows this flow with him in ""Legends of the Fall"". The war scenes look identical to ""Glory"" with only contrasting uniforms. John Toll's photography located in Alberta and British Columbia (passing off as Montana) is picturesque and that one scene where Susannah is reading a note as she walks through the coniferous trees was absolutely stunning. The musical score by James Horner is as smooth to the ears that you might hum to easily. As the story seems to progressively lack, the sights and sounds of ""Legends of the Fall"" get better through time.In spite of all that the best casting choice Zwick provides for us is the performance of Brad Pitt. From the early start, Pitt grabs our attention Sure he has to carry himself through the bloated melodramatic moments, but it's that intensity that plays a pivotal part in this role and is voided from being overdone and his tearful moments don't look superficial like crocodile tears that some of the male performers provide. The letdown here is that Pitt fades away from the narrative in substantial periods of time as the other Ludlow brothers and Susannah become the central characters. Which is too bad because the characters lack the panache to keep the audience from drifting off. The last fifteen minutes wraps up quite nicely with a retribution message similar to that in ""The Godfather"", but it hits the spot in this movie. All I can say now is that ""Legends of the Fall"" lacks originality and at times becomes a bit awkward. However, if you could put a mega-star in a Western film, it can only come across as satisfying enough to just be almost like a guilty pleasure.",Legends of the Fall

Almost a decade and a half later watching it on DVD, I'm glad I did. While not a complete turkey, this movie suffers from an overlong run-time, and the director's camera is magnetized on a younger up-and-coming Pitt to a fault. More than that though, there's too much angst and forced turmoil in the story, that was as subtle as a broad sword clanging on the floor - and top that off with strings/orchestra interlude music ad nauseum. The final epilogue was a waste and not needed.

Thanks to the fact that you can follow the characters during an entire period of their lives, you always seem to know them a lot better than you would in other movies.I can understand that a lot of people are a bit concerned when thinking about this movie. Some people seem reluctant to watch it because they fear that this movie will rather be a teenage flick than a serious movie, only because Brad Pitt is in it. Well I can assure you: it is a good, decent movie. It's story is very compelling and tells the tale of three brothers and their father who live in Montana. The men have a bond that could never be broken, until a woman appears in their lives and changes everything...This movie has several interesting things to offer. An intriguing love story, stunning landscapes, nature doing its best to make you forget about the entire story, historical facts like WWI and the prohibition, good drama... It may all seem a bit too much for one movie, but in my opinion it isn't. Of course you'll have to take your time to let it all get through to you and not everybody is willing to sit more than 90 minutes to watch a movie, but once you are willing to let yourself overwhelm by its beauty, you'll find this a very powerful and gripping movie.

Endless backdrops of rugged American wilderness - seemingly always filmed in a mellow sunlit evening, a solid all-American family of 3 strapping sons & their father, all pitted against the changing times and star-crossed destiny. And if that were not enough; an American-Indian voice-over, righteously moralising about life and family. After you with the peace-pipe.But its early 20th century and the lads fancy a bit of adventure in it'll-all-be-over-by-Christmass's famous WW1 mudfest. You know what's coming; high-spirits turned to disillusionment. Adventure dissolved in slaughter. The recreation of WW1 conflict was the most unresearched piece of twaddle I've even seen. Its directors had evidently never explored the effects of mustard gas. The last episode of 'Blackadder Goes Forth' was streets ahead of this in accuracy, poignancy and hilarious too. After watching two Germans busily setting-up a machine gun to shoot just one bloke (a brother) trapped on barbed wire, instead of just popping him with a rifle, whilst another brother went dashing about the battlefield, ranting like a maniac, but apparently immune to gunfire - I gave it up.The photography of the great American outdoors was splendid. But the rest? Frankly: garbage. Dunno how it ended, couldn't care less.",Legends of the Fall

40,sme_no_densetsu,A well executed epic drama,8,10 July 2016,"Edward Zwick's ""Legends of the Fall"" harks back to the epic historical dramas of the 50's & 60's, which were routinely sweeping in scope while sporting magnificent production values. The story, which begins in the early 1900's, revolves around the Montana-based Ludlow family, led by patriarch Colonel William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins). At various points over the next several years, Colonel Ludlow's three sons all fall for the same woman, adding friction to a relationship that is tested by war in Europe and subsequent challenges at home.The acting is generally well done with Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins in place as the film's main stars. Hopkins brought his usual level of professionalism to a role that, admittedly, becomes a bit showy at times. Brad Pitt, though he isn't nearly as refined as Hopkins, proved to be more than just a pretty face. Aidan Quinn makes a good contrast to Pitt but since his character is inherently less interesting he doesn't make as much of an impression. Henry Thomas plays the third of the brothers and he also makes a good contrast while contributing a slightly more memorable performance. Julia Ormond, meanwhile, is radiant as the female lead and is easily acceptable as the romantic interest that propels much of the story. Apart from the principle actors, the acting is uniformly satisfactory with a few others standing out from the pack.The film's strongest points perhaps lie in the visual presentation. The Oscar-winning cinematography makes the most of the often stunning locations while the meticulous costume design strangely went unnominated. Throughout, Edward Zwick showed a sure hand in the director's chair, effectively striking a balance between intimate drama and grand spectacle. The majestic score by James Horner was also a key contributor to the film's epic feel.While the movie's grandiose nature may be unappealing to some, I find ""Legends of the Fall"" to be a welcome throwback to a time when sweeping stories like this were much more prevalent on movie screens. The dearth of similar recent material makes it easy for me to overlook some of the minor hiccups in the narrative. Ultimately, even though ""Legends of the Fall"" is unlikely to ever attain the same status as the best epic films it nevertheless remains a well-crafted production with an engrossing story and impressive visuals.",Legends of the Fall
41,bobsgrock,A great epic amidst beautiful landscape.,9,9 October 2008,"Edward Zwick's epic tale of a family struggling against the internal forces of nature that threaten to tear the family bonds apart is one of great acting, beautiful cinematography and strong writing that covers many years but doesn't drag on forever like some movies. The cast is headed by Anthony Hopkins as the Colonel, a former US soldier who dealt with the Indians in the late 1800s but now feels angry at the government for their way of treating them. He retires then secludes himself and his family to the remote areas of Montana along with his three sons. Then, years later, the youngest returns from school with his fiancée Susannah, played by the beautiful Julia Ormond. This sets the ground for heartbreak and sadness as well as beauty and love for all these characters.As mentioned before, the acting is superb led by Hopkins, Henry Thomas as the youngest, most naive and idealistic son Samuel, Aidan Quinn as the oldest and responsible son Alfred, and Brad Pitt as the wild and fearless middle son Tristan. This is perhaps the role that Pitt really broke out in and cemented him as one of the biggest stars of our time. Ormond is good too, although it seems she feels a bit overwhelmed amidst all this testosterone. What really gets to you, though, is the cinematography which perfectly captures the beautiful and seemingly endless landscape that is the American West. Set against this backdrop, there is great drama with war, love, death, and many other aspects of life in a story reminiscent of Doctor Zhivago or Giant.All in all, this is a great movie very well directed and written and perfectly capturing the era of the time. The ending is a bit ubiquitous but is still a good way to cap a great story that is timeless in manner and context.",Legends of the Fall
42,jhclues,Engaging and Emotionally Involving Epic from Edward Zwick,10,20 June 2001,"According to the ancient lore of Native Americans, there is a story within each of us; the story of a life often guided by some inner voice, which some hear with great clearness.  Some live by what they hear-- and such people become crazy.  They become legend.  And so it was destined to be for a young man named Tristan Ludlow, who was born toward the end of the Nineteenth Century and grew up in the wide open spaces of Montana, where his father, Colonel William Ludlow, had taken his family to escape the imperfections of a society ruled by a government he could no longer respect.  `Legends of the Fall,' directed by Edward Zwick, is the story of Tristan (Brad Pitt) and his brothers, Alfred (Aidan Quinn) and Samuel (Henry Thomas); a tragic story of the life they shared and the wounds they suffered, many of which were never to heal.  And it's their father's story, as well, for it was he who raised his boys with only the help of his loyal friend, One Stab (Gordon Tootoosis), after his wife, Isabel (Christina Pickles), unable to withstand the harsh Montana winters, had left her family for the more civilized East Coast, never to return.	Colonel Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) had served his country during the Indian Wars, after which, disheartened by the government's treatment of those they had suppressed, the proud people of the Indian Nations, he turned his back on the `civilized' ways of his own people and carved out a niche for himself and his family in Montana.  And it was there, on their ranch, that the boys learned the ways of the West and the ways of the Indian, under the tutelage of their father and One Stab.  But of the three, only Tristan eventually heard that inner voice with such clarity that he could neither deny nor ignore it, and it awakened a passion within him that he embraced, and which set him upon the path he was seemingly destined to follow; a path that would ultimately affect the lives of everyone he had ever loved.	By 1914, Europe was at war, and the very tenets of truth and justice that had driven Colonel Ludlow away from society now compelled his sons to take a stand according to their own beliefs.  Despite his recent engagement, Samuel decides to go to Canada and enlist in the army in order to fight for England.  Alfred and Tristan refuse to let him go alone, and enlist with him.  And in the desolate, muddy trenches of France, they soon learn the harsh truth and the reality of war-- just as their father had before them-- and by the time the war has ended for them, their lives have changed forever; Tristan's most especially.  Back home, Tristan tries to settle down to life on the ranch, but the restlessness of his soul speaks to him of things he must do and places he must go, and the voices are too strong to resist.  So despite the ties that bind him to the home and the people he loves, he sets out on a journey of self-discovery that eventually takes him, physically and emotionally, into places he never knew existed-- and away from the woman who loves him the most.	Director Edward Zwick delivers a sweeping saga of life and love with this film that is every bit as big and grand as the country in which it is set. He presents his story through the recollections of One Stab, the one who saw it all unfold, first hand.  And it gives the film a narrative quality that is storytelling at it's best.  Zwick had a vision of how to bring this tale to the screen, and he realized it magnificently, aided by John Toll's breathtakingly beautiful cinematography (for which he received an Oscar), Lilly Kilvert's superb set designs and James Horner's compelling, dramatic score.  And most importantly, through the tremendous performances of Hopkins, Pitt, Quinn, Thomas and the lovely Julia Ormond. 
	Hopkins anchors the film with a brilliantly understated performance, creating a three-dimensional character who personifies the very iconoclastic ideals and principles he espouses.  And Pitt gives one of the best performances of his career as Tristan; watching him, you feel that restlessness and conflict raging within his soul, and you can sense his passion as he seeks his direction in life.  Quinn is also extremely effective as Alfred, the older brother, delivering an emotional and convincing performance, as does Julia Ormond, as Susannah, a young woman conflicted inside as she tries to sort out her feelings for the Ludlow brothers.  Zwick knew exactly what he needed from his actors to tell the story he wanted to tell, and he managed to get it all, from the principals to the least of the supporting players; and it's all there on the screen-- the passion, the intensity, the love and the care.  It's quite simply a beautiful piece of filmmaking by all concerned.	The supporting cast includes Karina Lombard (Isabel Two), Paul Desmond (Decker), Tantoo Cardinal (Pet) and Robert Wisden (John T. O'Banion).  A visually stunning film that will touch you emotionally and stay with you long after the screen has gone dark, `Legends of the Fall,' perpetuates the tradition of classics like `The Big Country' and `Giant.'  Engaging and memorable, it's a transporting experience, courtesy of the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",Legends of the Fall
43,gbheron,"Beautiful Scenery, Badly Chewed Up (***Spoilers***)",7,20 October 2002,"In the years just prior to WWI Colonel Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) retires from the Army in protest to their treatment of Native Americans, and settles his family deep in the Montana Rockies. His Eastern-bred wife can't adapt and quickly departs leaving a family dynamic right out of the TV show, ""Bonanza"". The patriarch aided by his three adult sons and assorted ranch hands, living the good life in splendid isolation. The oldest son (Aidan Quinn) is stolid, modern and business-like, the middle son (Brad Pitt) lives in close spiritual kinship with elements of the disappearing frontier, and the youngest son (Henry Thomas) is, of course, the family idealist. The family idyll is routinely disrupted by trouble, first by the arrival of the youngest son's betrothed (Julia Ormond), with whom the other two sons fall in love, then by the outbreak of WWI (all three sons volunteer for combat via Canada). And this is just for starters; the bad things inflicted on the family are right out of a Thomas Hardy novel; accidents, murder, suicide, racial conflict, and political corruption. ""Legends of the Fall"" is a cinematic epic; big scenery, big events, and big characters. And for the most part, it succeeds in capturing the drama and pathos of this ranching family (and the West) on the cusp of the modern age. The film follows each member of the family, documenting their many travails over a span of 15 years, from 1913 through the late 1920s. It's good, but it also allows for some real scenery chewing by the actors, especially Hopkins. But who cares? Shot against some of the most beautiful scenery in the world and given the staggering events of the story, what else can one do?",Legends of the Fall

More Like ""South of Podunk""",5,31 August 2000,"This beautifully mounted period melodrama sports fine performances by Anthony Hopkins, Julie Ormand and (especially) Aidan Quinn (looking phenomenally like he could really be Hopkins son). Nevertheless, this ""East of Eden"" wannabe is surprisingly unmoving.  Not because of Brad Pitt, whom gives a more than passable performance in a horribly underwritten role.  No, this film is empty at the core, not giving us enough to like in Tristin (Pitt) or to dislike in Alfred (Quinn) to understand what the fuss is all about.  Like another finely crafted failure, FAR AND AWAY, this film reminds us no amount of artistry can overcome an overblown, sometimes silly script.

But when i seen the action taking place, i knew that no more, it was also a guys movie.  Guys will really enjoy this movie, because of fights, and war, and bloodshed.  One of the best parts is toward the end when everything happens at once.Alfreds wife commits suicide, Tristan pushs a pitchfork through mans chest, and Tristans father-in-law shoots and kills man that killed his daughter. All of this happens at the same time, very good thematic element, if you ask me.  After that is the high point of the movie, when cops come to arrest Tristan, and hell  breaks lose.  A horse rares up, and cops turn, Tristans father pulls out an elephant gun, shots two of the cops, and one is about to shoot Tristan, when Alfred shoots him from behind.A very good and spectacular movie.

As form the movie itself: a long-epic-melodramatic story about an old man which lives in the mountains, far away from the American civilization (which he hates so much). Anthony Hopkins plays that old man in one of his worst works ever (especially when his character falls ill with some facial-paralysis); Pitt is one of his three sons, the wiser one, the more handsome (of course), such a wild guy. Lots of topics, lots of common places for a movie that aimed to be sort of a modern ""Gone With The Wind"": war, love, death...Well, there ain't many bad things to tell about ""Legends Of The Fall"", apart from the fact that everything is so obvious and predictable in it.

I love historical dramas because of they way they bring the past alive. The hopes and dreams of the times vivify what I've read in history books and novels.

The parents, not purposely, may express more sympathy or predilection to one son than to another. The problem of Indians in USA, their discrimination, particularly in the past, is not new, and it is quite similar to the problems phased by black population there. So all these problems were correctly assembled by the director Edward Zwick.

The love triangles are too many to count, but most of them revolve around the wild, black sheep, moody, rule and heart-breaking brother Tristan (Brad Pitt).Watching the film in 1994 at Union Station of Washington DC with my girlfriend Carolyn, we were delighted by the urban audience. Unlike the suburban audiences we were used to, this one - composed primarily of young black women, did not hold back on expressing their emotions. There was a lot of squealing from this segment of the audience during the sex scene.According to one critic Legends of the Fall is a ""cheesy melodrama with too much crying."" While the film did contain a lot of unfortunate events and obligatory tears, there is more depth to the film than this. For one thing, the cast of Aidan Quinn (Alfred), Anthony Hopkins (dad), Julia Ormond (Susannah), Pitt (Tristan) and Bart the Bear (bear), was captivating and fun to watch. The location is gorgeous and so is the cinematography. I also enjoyed the intriguing storylines, the captivating drama and wondering about how the love triangles would play out.

53,Dan1863Sickles,American Pastoral,8,30 July 2018,"I've always loved this movie and wanted to post a review, yet the power of the story always seemed too big and grand to put into words. Oddly enough, it was seeing a truly awful movie, AMERICAN PASTORAL with Ewan McGregor and Dakota Fanning, that helped me understand why LEGENDS OF THE FALL is a classic.An All-American patriarch tries to protect his children from the evils of the modern world, only to see the safe haven he's built utterly destroyed by the tragic choices they make. That is the plot of both LEGENDS OF THE FALL and AMERICAN PASTORAL. The difference is in the richness of the acting, the passions of the characters, and the truthfulness of the drama. Ewan McGregor is pitiably miscast and inauthentic as Swede Levov. You never, ever believe this guy used to be a great football hero and that everyone in Newark, New Jersey admires him. Whereas Anthony Hopkins, even though he's English, is totally believable as Colonel Ludlow, a tough veteran of the Indian Wars who's become disillusioned by the crimes of the government and wants a new start. When he says he wants to ""lose the madness over the mountains"" he could be speaking for Swede Levov, who moves from Newark to Old Rimrock! Just the way Swede puts all his hopes in his daughter Merry, so tough old Colonel Ludlow puts all his hopes in his three sons, Alfred, Samuel, and Tristan. It's a father's love that makes the Colonel call his sons ""damned fools"" for wanting to get mixed up in World War One, just as Swede Levov desperately wants his daughter to keep clear of the anti-war radicals during Vietnam. The difference is that the wildness of Tristan, the innocence of Samuel, and the ambition of Alfred, are all believably human and touching. In time love and war will shatter all three of them in different ways, just as Merry is shattered by the radical actions she undertakes during Vietnam. Except Merry's passion is never believable, nor is her anger, nor are her father Swede's pathetic attempts to stop her. Colonel Ludlow and his sons are a real family and they clash in realistic ways, before, during, and after the war. It is interesting that Tristan's postwar breakdown parallels Merry's in a lot of ways, right down to the long disappearances and the lapses in personal hygiene. But Tristan acts out of a real sense of loss and it's possible to believe in his redemption. Colonel Ludlow never stops believing in his boys, and when he tells Tristan at the very end ""you are not damned, Tristan . . . I won't allow it!"" It's unbelievably touching. Oddly enough, Swede Levov has exactly the same attitude towards Merry, except her crimes are disgusting and the Swede himself is ridiculously ineffectual all throughout the drama. These two American stories are so similar, yet different. As Mark Twain once said, it's the difference between lightning and the lightning bug.",Legends of the Fall

57,khatcher-2,A magnificent cast - the first hour is rather good; the second hour is frothy saga,5,2 May 2002,"This film seems to peter out around halfway, turning into a long slog of such beloved TV-styled epic melodrama with all the messy ingredients heaped on as if to fill out wherever the tale might be meandering to, and finally amounting to a heavy-handed overlay of froth and spume.The cast is right: `cute boy' Brad Pitt carries out a decent interpretive role for the first half and degenerates into churning his way through the second half; Anthony Hopkins plays the landed gentleman with British aplomb and conviction, but barely survives the second half, in which, anyway, his part dwindles somewhat; Henry Thomas and Aidan Quinn are both really good, as well as the children who played the parts of the three brothers, though in the second half Aidan Quinn gets lost somewhere along the road to big business and politics but lacking panache and conviction; Julia Ormond is magnificent and reminds us that her birth town is not now only famous for its horse racing. Indeed, she is really the only character to keep up a certain level of interpretation through the film. Having seen the film twice, I still maintain that one gets the feeling that the original story  which I have not read  published in Esquire Magazine, has been blown up out of all proportions; and totally unnecessarily. The first half of the film had all the ingredients working right, from a well-told story line, to the acting, and of course the magnificent photography. But from there the film seemed to veer off course so as to take on epic-like saga dimensions, unbecoming for what the film sets out to be. If we add to that James Horner's music becomes more and more strident as the film progresses  slogs on, I mean  it becomes evident that the overladen effectivism of the last 40 minutes or so turns into an undigestible mirky mess.On my scale 5½ at most, and only for the first half. Despite my wife lapping up Brad Pitt; but she also laps up Matt Damon, Richard Gere et. al. There's no understanding women .

Strange that no one brought in the Thomas Jefferson quote concerning the 'terrible legacy of this country when its birth was based on the ignoble treatment of the indigents.' You definitely got the idea that this Major (from Boston, of course) was a highly educated man, who turned his disgust with our government into building a highly viable ranch in Montana.The puppy dog looks given by Aidan Quinn at his brother's wife-to-be are embarrassing, as is his sad naivete, as he is rooked in by the Montana crooks to run for Congress. As such, the scene is set for his 'boys'...criminals one and all....to make life rough for our hero, Brad Pitt. Like my earlier idol, James Dean, he lives life in the wild, educated by his mentor, the noble savage (i.e., the same folks we stole this country from).The problem I have with this movie is with Miss Seductress, who is given carte blanche by the narrator, as though the producers knew that we the public wouldn't be able to buy her 'innocence'. It takes two to tango, folks, and I'm not buying her falling for all 3 guys without some hint of imperfection shown. Especially when she tells Aidan, ""no dice"" and THEN, as he becomes a wealthy Congressman, marries him. You can't be both: a paragon of virtue and someone who marries for wealth alone.Would love now to read the book, if one was written. The great beauty of my country is there for us all to see. Too bad that so many of the powerful human beings in it were models for the corruption in our government today.",Legends of the Fall
64,roghache,Moving masterpiece of family bonds ripped asunder,9,3 June 2006,"When I tuned in to this movie, I fully expected to see Hollywood trash, having heard that the story revolves around three brothers who all have relationships with the same woman. Much to my surprise, I found a captivating epic well presented and a very moving depiction of the close father / son and brother bonds torn apart by the unfolding emotions involving this woman.The legend begins with Colonel Ludlow, who is disgusted with the government and chooses to raise his three sons (Alfred, Tristan, and Samuel) in the Rocky Mountain wilderness of Montana. His wife and the boys' mother, Isabel, has retreated off to civilized city life, having no fondness for the wilds. The three brothers enjoy very close and loyal fraternal bonds until the youngest, Samuel, brings his fiancé, Susannah Fincannon, back from college with him to meet his family. The oldest brother, Alfred, falls in love with his brother's fiancé, while Susanna herself develops passionate feelings for the middle brother, Tristan. Meanwhile, World War I has begun and all three brothers enlist to go off overseas into battle, with the disapproval but blessing of their father.This movie is notable partly for its absolutely spectacular and majestic mountain wilderness scenery, filmed in the Canadian Rockies not far from Calgary. You can really see what they mean by the phrase ""big sky"". I love the bear scenes! Also, it features beautiful musical scoring, totally appropriate to the dramatic and heartbreaking events.The brothers are very disparate individuals, each a sympathetic and tragic figure with his own unique virtues. Samuel, the youngest, is innocent & naive but also tender & idealistic. As the baby of the family, his two older siblings seem especially protective of him even during war. The eldest, Alfred, is a responsible and honourable man of integrity who 'follows all the rules, man's and God's'. He later pursues a political career for worthy and noble reasons, though incurs his father's estrangement for doing so. The middle brother, Tristan, is wild and passionate, very tuned in to nature with a Native American foster father. His own father's favourite, he is a tempestuous and troubled individual who is haunted by his own personal demons but has many amazing strengths. Alhough Tristan is admittedly the obvious hero of the piece, I actually prefer and identify more with his two brothers.All three Ludlow brothers are well cast. The handsome Brad Pitt, though he doesn't make me swoon personally, nevertheless gives a compelling performance as the long haired, wild, and tormented Tristan. Aidan Quinn plays the much less exciting but reliable Alfred, while Samuel is portrayed by Henry Thomas, who (to my surprise) is the ET kid all grown up. As always, Anthony Hopkins is masterful as the boys' father, Colonel Ludlow. It is especially touching later in the tale when he exhibits the infirmities of old age.The lovely, well spoken Julia Ormond plays Susannah, the woman who unwillingly causes so much grief in the Ludlow family. Before watching this movie, I anticipated finding her a reprehensible character with loose morals and no concept whatsoever of loyalty. However, this beautiful & spirited young woman with no family roots of her own (her parents both having died), comes across as a very sympathetic character. I personally wouldn't judge her, seeing the way events unfold in her relationships with these brothers. Susannah herself certainly suffers greatly for any mistakes she makes. Two of the brothers' different attitudes are revealed quite dramatically in a scene early in the movie where Samuel confides in Tristan his fears of being unable to satisfy his future bride. Note the different phrases employed by these two young men for sex with Susannah, I think it reflects their underlying different emotions and values, not merely wording. As for Alfred, he genuinely cares deeply for Susannah and wants to see her treated respectfully. Upon realizing that Tristan has been intimate with her, he demands that his brother marry this lady he himself loves in order to make an 'honest woman' of her. As I see it, Susannah's tragic flaw lies in falling for the wrong brother. The unsettled Tristan is unable to return her love in the stable & committed way she seeks, especially at such a traumatic period in his life. After Tristan's abandonment, Susannah marries Alfred, whom she (alas) does not love, because he can offer this stability and commitment.Other interesting characters in these legends include the Native American One Stab.The viewer cheers for Tristan's dramatic defense of his friend's rights when a bigoted bar owner refuses to serve him. There's also the cute and endearing young half native Isabel Two, who blossoms into such a beautiful young woman.The threatened family ties are brilliantly depicted in this epic, the interactions between father & sons and especially between the brothers riveting and wrenching. It is a tragic and heartbreaking but ultimately uplifting tale of war, loyalty, love, betrayal, grief, and especially the unshakable bonds of brotherhood.",Legends of the Fall
65,jmbwithcats,Sometimes forever is too long,8,5 November 2004,"A remarkable cast for a remarkable tale, set in this stunning masterpiece of a film. I have always enjoyed the Hopkins/Pitt chemistry and this was no different. The entire cast was beautifully poignant, and thought I went into this movie not expecting to be impressed, I cried, moved by the profound depth of honesty this movie portrays.The eloquence of the narrations, Alberta so glorious, the music haunting and sweeping like an arc, or eagle's wing across the open sky.Legends of the Fall musical score is some of the most beautiful, and inspiring music to ever grace the silver screen. Every movie James Horner conducts rivals nearly anything I have ever heard next to the glorious sunrise of little birds, to the chirping of midnight crickets, he captures the essence of the heart as it flies. He elevates a film with majestic genius.Legends of the Fall is true to it's name. Confusing times beget confusing emotions beget loss, sorrow, destruction. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, and the wind blows the dust to the four corners, and no one remembers the memory is all that remains, behind the candle flame, in our eyes.The perfect cast, the perfect music, the perfect story. The problem with perfect is, it tempts God to take it away... and in this movie, it all gets taken away. And we are left with a poem. And that is why this movie won an Academy Award for best cinematography. The poetry was visual, but everything else elevated the poem to a muse, and a muse is forever, and forever turns out to be such a long time, sometimes forever is too long.Legends of the Fall is that parallel universe where everything falls into the wrong place. Squares fall trying to fit into circles, and we are cut by the sharp edges of the plot. Our hearts ache for the sandpaper of sense to save us, but we are only burned deeper by the memory of such folly. Cut deeper by it, until even hope lays scattered amongst the rock, like old bones. And one day when the sun rises at the end of your days, when you have lost everything but your soul, you might be fortunate enough to take a leap of faith for love, and in so redeem a lifetime forever more.",Legends of the Fall
66,emuir-1,Emily Bronte did it better,7,14 May 2017,"In the 1840's Emily Bronte wrote Wuthering Heights, which was considered so shocking that she had to write under a non de plume, Ellis Bell. The story told of the passionate burning love between Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliffe, the wild child found in Liverpool by Catherine Earnshaw's father, which destroyed everyone around them and lasted beyond the grave. The book has been translated into every language on the globe and has never been out of print.Legends of the Fall is a Wuthering Heights kind of family tragedy as the fiancé of one of the brothers (the wild one) falls deeply in love with him, but is rejected by him when he decides to go off alone to 'find himself'. He returns later to find she has married his straight laced elder brother, but she is still besotted with him. Ah, the grand passion! Brad Pitt plays the same type he played in ""A River Runs Though It"" the wild child, and Aidan Quinn the same role he played in ""The Mission"", the decent straight arrow brother who falls in love with the fiancé left behind for years by his wild seafaring brother. Have these casting directors no imagination? I enjoyed the film as you would a Hallmark Hall of Fame TV movie, but would not rate it a great epic or Oscar worthy. Many viewers rhapsodized over the scenery. What Scenery? All I saw was a green meadow with the shape of blue mountains in the background.I bought the DVD many years ago and watched it again last night. The overall feeling was that of over pretentious Harlequin Romance.",Legends of the Fall
67,FallenEye,"None is Fair, in Love and War.",8,26 March 2018,"The funny thing is, Sam was fortunate in being naive, because he left one war that could've and would've ripped his heart clear out his chest and riddle it with more ammunition than any machine gun could ever imagine to carry, for a war far less devastating, and was fortunate enough to never even know it. Life is not for the faint at heart. Sam lost Susannah long before they went off to war, Sam lost her as soon as her and Tristan's eyes met.Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, combined with the loss of your brother, topped with the failure of securing his life and survival - especially when that was your one and only objective, the only priority, and all you cared about, allows Tristan the room he needs to seem and be dramatic, because the motivation was wonderfully captured.Susannah's heart wanted what it wanted. She had the option to remain in misery, while causing agony for Alfred, or, be in misery with the hope that Alfred (who already knew that her heart belongs to another) would somehow be capable of healing her with happiness, while still providing him the remedy of herself. Both her and Alfred were in between a rock, and a hard place, and so it was best to try while already having failed, rather than to fail without having tried.Anthony Hopkins was amazing. Aidan Quinn and Julia Ormond were also terrific. Edward Zwick you genius. James Horner, once again; from below the ground, your music still reaches beyond the skies.Legends of the Fall is life. It's heart-breaking, it's difficult, unpredictable, unfair, harsh, mean... It's, uncaring. Sam deserved to be with his love. Alfred didn't deserve the broken heart, and Susannah didn't deserve the loneliness. Tristan was in the centre of it all; Sam didn't get to be with his love because he failed him. Alfred was heart broken because Susannah wanted him, and Susannah was alone because he failed one brother and lost another; that kind, level and amount of responsibility and accountability, isn't easy.""I followed all the rules. Man's... God's. And you... You followed none of them, and they all loved you more. Samuel, father, even my own wife"". - Life. 8.3/10.",Legends of the Fall
68,Jerique,Spiral of Death,7,1 April 2011,"It's an entertaining film, but it's so much about death, that's it ends up being quite depressing. This is a legendary film in the sense that it's a rare thing to see Brad Pitt, before he got famous and amazing at acting.Tristan Ludlow falls in love with his brother Samuel's (Henry Thomas) fiancée Susannah (Julia Ormond). After Samuel dies in the war, Susannah turns to Tristan for support and love, much to the dismay of Tristan's brother Alfred (Aidan Quinn). This causes friction between Alfred and his father, Colonel William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins).Eventually, Alfred ends up with Susannah anyways, because Tristan goes off to fight the war because of the guilt of not saving Samuel and she can't wait for him any longer.This movie revolves around death, as I lost count of the body count we see after around 15. It just continues to pile up. It's a complex love story, to say the least, and aside from Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins, there's not much of a cast here. It falls short in the supporting cast because they don't have much acting talent, and the cringe-worthy crying scene from Brad Pitt (near the beginning of the film) is something I can't stomach very well. Susannah's stupidity and heartlessness makes me despise her character and storyline, so much so that I can't love this movie.It's a good movie, but it's not great. Because of all the flaws, it's not a great film. But, because of Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins, we get a decent film with some pretty good acting despite the first crying scene of Pitt. The rest of the movie is a depressing spiral of death. It has a great soundtrack, composed by legendary James Horner and it really gives the final touch of sadness for the film. It's one of those tear-jerking films that will stay with you for decades. It's a classic, but it's just not up there with the caliber of say Interview with the Vampire.",Legends of the Fall
69,fimimix,..what an epic..,10,10 May 2006,"""Legends of the Fall"" is not a movie for ordinary entertainment. This film takes total involvement, otherwise you're wasting your time. There are several comments posted here which are truly poetic - I just want to agree with them, absolutely - I can't fathom anyone not liking this film.Yes, Edward Zwick got all of the magic from Susan Shilliday's script and directed an epic movie in every category. Hard to believe the film got nearly 17,000 votes and it didn't make it to a 9 ? Maybe folk don't recognize epics anymore? No doubt the editor had a ball with such magnificent cinematography and seamless filming. I found every role acted to the fullest. When I saw ""Legends"" the first time, the only scenes I could have done without were all those weird places Tristan went to - I saw no reason for them. Tonight (10/21/06), I finally heard ""One Stab"" (Gordon Tootoosis) explain how animal and human blood combine, making the human more animalistic. That explains why ""Tristan"" (Brad Pitt) could not kill the bear. ""Tristan's"" demons certainly showed he ""fell from innocence"" and how his wildness effected every member of that family. Pitt's acting is stellar. One commentary said a scene in a loonie-bin was cut - good ! I just watched this movie - fifth time - and am laughing at myself. I thought Pitt's character was named ""Christian"". ""Col. Ludlow"" (Anthony Hopkins) had to dig deep for that one ! Now I'm wondering who was ""Isolde""....could have been either of the ladies who loved him. Julia Ormand (Sussanah Ludlow) and Karina Lombard (Isabel Ludlow) were perfect in their roles, as was the entire cast. Wow! for Hopkins.Director Zwick surely made all of the characters come alive - the Native American chants were beautiful and so appropriate. Bravo! ""One Stab"" !This movie shows you can live in paradise without finding happiness in many ways. Give us some more like this one - although there was a great deal of real-life violence in ""Legends"", it was necessary to depict the folly of human-beings. shoot-em-ups....",Legends of the Fall
70,Bob Pr.,Beautiful scenery/photography; arbitrary narrative,4,18 September 2011,"Many consider this one of the best films they've ever seen while a much smaller ""many"" consider it nearer the worst. Between those two, for my taste, that second, smaller group is more fitting. Although not a typical ""chick flick,"" the demographics of IMDb voters show a typical 5% more positive rating by females (maybe a Brad Pitt effect?).To me, the narrative seems too arbitrary and capricious, mainly a vehicle to display Brad Pitt's (""Tristan's"") charms: here although he's handsome, he's also impulsive, overly inclined to physical confrontation with men and beasts, non-conformist, very loyal to some Cree Indian traditions, often indifferent to what's legal--but these traits, while very strong, unaccountably and rarely trip him up: they emerge only when called on by the proper cues in the script.There are too many other incongruous details for me: suits, white shirts & ties worn by working ranchers at their evening dinners? A career military man (""Col. Ludlow""/Hopkins), after 30 years of promotions and service, rebels against his government because of its treatment (ca. 1880-1900) of American Indians, resigns, and adopts many of their values and customs? No helmets worn by Canadian troops in battle in the first World War? Tristan/Pitt on a 60-80 ft. sailing vessel about 1920 and, with no previous sailing experience and no visible financial support, skippering it with his crew while exploring the Pacific for many years? Warm emotional relations across the distance of a thousand miles and many decades between the Colonel and his sons with his wife (the sons' mother) after she deserted them?

72,brianberta,A well-done and emotional drama and romance movie,6,11 August 2015,"While this movie has a powerful story, it has flaws which bring it down but it's still a great movie nonetheless.This tale follows a family growing up in the early 1900's in the country. It details how they go through many different obstacles and how their lives are effected.This movie won an Oscar for ""Best Cinematography"" in 1994. This movie does impress you with spectacular scenery and landscapes but that's the least this movie has to offer.Firstly, I do feel that this is a powerful story. It has a moving plot, several moving and emotional scenes, and great narration. It has the ability to move you. Although I feel that some scenes dragged on a bit too long, the movie was able to keep my attention for the most part. There were just a few scenes I grew bored in.The acting is really hit or miss. I didn't think it was absolutely terrible but it didn't impress me all too much either. Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins were the only 2 actors who gave good performances in my opinion. The rest were either mediocre or bad performances. They weren't completely terrible like some low-budget movies but they just didn't impress me.I mentioned that the movie has great narration. But while it does, it still has the tendency to get a little cheesy at times. It doesn't happen too often but when it does, I can't help but cringe.So in conclusion, this is a pretty great movie. I appreciate it for what it is but like most movies, it's not without its flaws and it can get on your nerves too. However, I for one enjoyed this film. It was well-done and I felt a lot of emotions while watching it. I recommend it to other fans of the genre.",Legends of the Fall

74,JaydoDre,A collection of pretty videos of good actors,5,30 January 2014,"This film occasionally shows up on TV. I didn't want to go to sleep and there was nothing else to kill time with so I watched it. Seemed to be going somewhere - was slowly shaping up to be a heavy drama...but then it went somewhere else...and then somewhere else. It kept going and every time I thought it was about to end...it kept going. I eventually tuned out and changed the channel, watched another movie, perhaps a show or two, then went to exile for 25 years, went into cryostasis as societies of the world collapsed and mountains were eroded by wind. Then I returned, found the old TV, turned it on and...the bloody movie was still going! And after it was finally done, with a somewhat anti-climactic finale, I could not for the life of me tell you what this movie was about. It went here and it went there. It went everywhere. In the end, it is a movie about a father and sons living a life in the first part of the 20th century. Well that is fine and all, but why is it worth making a movie about? What saves this movie: characters. Brad Pit and Anthony Hopkins can combine powers to make even the worst turd look like gold. And these two actors really shine in this movie and manage to grab your attention for a while, but even they cannot do it forever and sooner or later you are returned to the void that is the story of this movie.Yes certain scenes are really good and carry weight, but you need a good glue to bind the pretty pictures together. You need to keep the show moving. A book with great drawings still needs the words in between the drawings to be good.The movie wears a veneer of art and I have a sneaky suspicion that this is why the movie is so overrated: as it pretends to be smart and artistic, some people are pretending to like it so as not to appear stupid or shallow.In short: good actors, good scenery, but a long and flat story.",Legends of the Fall

The action, consisting of some battle scenes, knife and gun fights, and bear attacks, is fairly good and the acting is more than adequate all around.

88,ereinion,A beautiful film,8,29 September 2004,"This is one of the films that I enjoy watching the most.There is so much to enjoy.The performances,the atmosphere,wonderful scenery and the epic feel of it all.Tristan Ludlow is one of the best romantic heroes of the 90's cinema.Julia Ormond was wonderful and breathed more beauty and charm into the screen.Brad Pitt is seen here in one of his best early performances and he really does an impressive work.Aidan Quinn was also great as his rivalising older brother who is in envy of his love affair and marriage with Julia and turns into a capitalist,leaving his family ranch and his old ideals behind for a comfortable and profitable life as a railroad company executive in town.This also shows the old nature/civilization conflict,wherein Tristan,his father and One Stab represent the unspoiled and natural side,while Tristan's brother Alfred and the crooked O'Banion brothers represent the corrupt industrial side,which leads to an inevitable clash resulting in a tragedy for Tristan and a final showdown with the O'Banion's.In the meanwhile,Alfred has realized he was on the wrong side and makes peace with his brother.There is also another angle added to the story,the first world war.Here we see the idealistic spirit of the ill-fated youngest brother Samuel,the martyr character of the film.Samuel chooses to fight for what he believes in and his brothers follow him,uncertain if they are making a wise choice but reluctant to let their little brother fight on his own.It is this addition that gives this film an epic quality.As Tristan falls into a fit of berserker madness after Samuel's death and goes on a killing rampage against the Germans,there is a feeling that something has been lost in him and that a part of him had died,which will later create great complications for him when he tries to build a new life with Susannah.Not just that,but the bear in him has truly awoken and will not be silenced easily.This could have hardly been better.Anthony Hopkins and Gordon Tootoosis make a great supporting cast,Tootoosis' narration enhancing the epic effect further and giving it a wonderful,mythic touch.After all this,what more can you ask for?This is a clear winner.8/10",Legends of the Fall

So what could it be, a failed movie for TV or perhaps a farce fit to show neophyte directors and actors what not to do.Of course lover boy Pit does his hair thing and his acting is just so pathetic. But, then the entire story is so knee jerk predictable and hackneyed. It doesn't even begin to hold to the cultural standards of the period it was set it.Usually women who slept around too much in the early part of the century had secret visits to the helper lady. And, they were not respected, especially when they could not decide which brother's bed to entertain in.Especially funny was Anthony Perkins after his stroke. It was just too camp.It takes apparently very little of substance to entertain the public, as I am told this ""thing"" was nominated for several Academies.Total waste of time and complete gibberish.

First Henry Thomas brings home his pretty bride (Ormond) who happens to see Pit come in on his horse and right away we know Ormond has a wondering eye. Of course she wants him right away and Pitt seems all to willing to accommodate her. Of course Henry gets killed in WWI and Pit survives who comes home with Henry's heart in a box and then sleeps with Ormond. Pit can't commit to Ormond who is distressed by this so she settles for Adan Quinn who is the other brother. Quinn marries her but she is unhappy because she loves Pitt. Hopkins is nothing more but an observer. So it goes like this:1. Henry brings home new bride but bride has a wondering eye and falls for other brother Pit.2. Henry goes off to war with Pit in which Henry gets killed and Pit survives to come home to Ormond3. Pit sleeps with widow but that seems to be all he wants.4. Ormond in distress and in love with Pit marries Quinn for we assume to stay close by Pit.5.Ormond not happy with Quinn realizes she can't have Pit.6.Ormond cuts her hair off and kills herself.7.

96,hhfarm-1,Incredible story ruined in this abysmal movie,2,26 June 2007,"What's bad? Perhaps no one thing. A combo maybe: The overall feel is a cheap Disney made-for-TV job where little Amanda learns that it's wrong to lie when she tells an untruth about the hired man, who later turns out to be gentle with horses and has saved money for his pregnant sister.The screenplay is like something from Lifetime: stilted, badly paced, bitingly obvious, dull.Direction: several major scenes build up to a climax (yup, it's drama). You see it happening but when you get there, it's flat. Selleck Westerns have more intensity. Ron Howard has more depth.Soundtrack: My favorite. Much like one of those god-awful Ford Westerns where heavy strings help you see the grandeur of the vast plain (or John Wayne's impending gunfight). Here it comes in at the smallest scene. Say, to watch the brothers walk around and look at each other as they leave for war.Casting was my real favorite: Pitt is the rough and tough woodsman who was taught by the Indians. He has long hair and that pretty Brad Pitt face - but now and then they smear some blood on him for realism. Otherwise it's like watching Natalie Wood with her Prom Queen makeup in The Searchers.Special effects: On a par with a low-budget middle-European film: there's a shot, pause, a soldier clutches his chest, pause, he flies backwards from the impact. Watch the shootout in the penultimate scene at the ranch Aiden Quinn is the practical business guy/ politician who strives for dad's love. Henry Thomas is a wimpy non-entity 3rd brother. Julia Ormond is the love interest from Boston w/ a Brit accent. She gives great camera stare.At the very least, it would be a better movie if Pitt & Quinn switched roles. Quinn is a good actor and can show a hard edge. Pitt is OK but likes to smile and look pretty more than be a bad guy.Oh, Anthony Hopkins. One of the finest working actors. He's not bad in this. He never is bad. But this is a nothing role.No problem if you find you're not following the story. It's narrated by the old and faithful Indian friend.The narration is unpredictable so you need to get tough and FF without worrying about it.To recap: bad script, bad direction, childish special effects, horrible miscasting, dull and unnecessary narration, painful soundtrack.",Legends of the Fall

And there are those great films that have universal special chemistry. Legends of the Fall is definately of the latter. Built from a base so rich in character, this visual story of a families history through prosperity and tragidy is so beautifully expressed from all levels. Brad Pitt has yet to surpass his performance in this film or, will it always be his Gone with the Wind. I still cannot believe he wasnt at least nominated for best actor. Every actor from Anthony to Adian, Ormond to Pitt gushed in Legends, the breath of excellence accompanied with the elegance and talent of the direction and cinematography.

It was a symphony of talent portrayed wonderfully.  I WOULD have; COULD have; and SHOULD have LOVED this movie, but didn't.  I rarely knock a movie because of its storyline.  Often for the plot, but not for the story or idea itself.  So, this is a first.Okay, true the movie delivers the tale or 'epic saga' of a family of brothers and their father but I need more than that.  I think this story was ill-conceived.  Each of the characters were consistent except for the lead (I've provided a SPOILER section at the end to illustrate this point so don't read it if you don't want it ruined).  I am of the opinion that all characters can have some inconsistencies; but the lead role must be solid if he/she is to carry the reader or viewer through to the end.***SPOILER***SPOILER***SPOILER***Okay, he's wild and untamable.  You can't rely on him because he's the spirit of the bear.  But, oh, then he's not.  He's the perfect family man. Oh, except he's a bootlegger, endangering his very family that he loves. He's passionate.  But wait, no he isn't.  He's cold and mysterious and even cruel.  MAKE UP YOUR MIND!!!  Just tell him how you want him to act and he'll do it.  It wasn't his fault, I think he played each of the personalities well; so the movie should have been about a man with multiple personality complex; but it wasn't intended to be that.  Personally I think that Susannah was the most stable character in the story.  If you watch it more than once, you'll see that she really only loved one man her entire life; she didn't waver from that even if her actions did.  She only did what was humanly possible with the cards she was dealt in life (therein lies the real story if you ask me).SPOILER ENDEDSo, everything but the story was great in this film.

103,jehaccess6,"Cinematography Great, Julia Ormond Stunning, Screenplay Terrible.",6,4 July 2008,"WalMart had the DVD in the clearance bin, so I took a chance on this film. Thank God the film is on DVD so I can jump around to the good parts and avoid all the horrible filler material.First of all, I loved the scenery that formed the film background. Who would not enjoy this splendid area, some of the most beautiful in the whole world? The Ludlow home was very rustic and inviting. The perfect backdrop for the film.Then there was the idea of an Army officer becoming so disgusted with the abuse of native peoples that he turned his back on his military career. He attempted to redress the injustices by his incorporation of the old Cree warrior One-Stab into his household. Three sons are born to him before his wife flees back to the comforts of civilization. All this came out as promising material for a great film.Then a young Tristan Ludlow seeks out a sleeping grizzly bear and picks a fight. Amazingly, he survives with only superficial slash marks on his arm. For an animal that can easily split a large log with one swipe of his claws, that is a pathetic response to the provocation endured. The film goes downhill from there.The patriarch, Colonel Ludlow, is apparently content to live without the comfort of a wife in an isolated ranch in Montana. His cultured wife is too refined to stay with him in self-imposed exile. That would seem grounds for divorce even in the conservative America in the early 1900s. What kind of mother would abandon her young sons to allow her to enjoy a more comfortable life? Perhaps that explains why Tristan turned out so badly.The youngest of three sons, Samuel, returns home from college in Massachusetts with a stunning fiancé, Susannah Fincannon, who apparently has no close living relatives. How this woman managed to support herself and move in fairly privileged social circles is left a mystery. A woman in that era would find it difficult to survive outside the support of a family. Samuel is such a nonentity that one is forced to conclude that his fiancé latched on to him in desperation for a husband to support her continued social position.The actor Henry Thomas, who played Samuel, is six years younger than Julia Ormond who played Susannah. The age difference is so glaring as to be ludicrous. This pairing is obviously doomed from the start. I instantly knew that the plot would swiftly remove Samuel to make room for Tristan, Brad Pitt, to move in on the tempting Susannah.Susannah is actually an admirable person, for the most part. She tries to fit in to the frontier lifestyle and to bond with the people who work for the Ludlows on the ranch. She does her best to become a useful member of the family, able to help out with ranch work when needed. What sticks for me is the protracted engagement to Samuel. She is moved in to the home of her fiancée, the family welcomes her presence. Why is she not going through with the wedding? The answer is two words, Tristan Ludlow.Susannah has fallen for older brother Tristan, even from a distance. Samuel senses her growing infatuation and attempts to justify his claim to manhood by an absurd decision to join the British Army and fight in World War I. The two older brothers join him with lesser degrees of conviction. All the noble reasons for this decision are really covers for Samuel's feelings of inadequacy. The three brothers set out for nearby Canada, where they can join the British Army.The war kills Samuel, wounds elder brother Alfred, and drives Tristan nuts. The two surviving brothers are released from their service for reasons left unclear. I am sure many soldiers at the front would have liked to simply walk away from the carnage. Alfred comes home and tries to woo Susannah, with her firm rejection. She waits a few months for Tristan to eventually come home.Tristan wastes no time. He brutally takes advantage of Susannah's feelings and begins an affair with her. She hopes for a pregnancy to force Tristan to marry her, but that is not to be. How the two love birds could conduct their affair in Susannah's bedroom with no notice from the rest of the family is not explained.Tristan eventually can endure normality no longer. He abandons his home and the woman who loves him to roam the world to 'find himself'. I tuned out of the plot right there. The family goes through numerous disasters before righting itself somewhat after Alfred takes over from the incapacitated patriarch. Susannah marries Alfred as a poor second choice and eventually kills herself in anguish after Tristan returns and marries the young daughter of the hired hand.The movie shone in the first few minutes and went steadily downhill from there. I fail to notice all the riches other comments seem to find. Perhaps I was seeking more noble behavior in the Tristan character to make me enjoy the film.",Legends of the Fall

I kept waiting for some meaningful dialog to begin and oh yeah, a plot too, unfortunately they never showed up. I'm sorry but beautiful cinematography and sweeping waves of orchestral strings with some heartthrob actor walking through his part does not make a good film. What does, is a STORY and characters we care about, interesting dialog, character development, basic stuff really, unfortunately this one opted for the cinematography and strings and man it's nauseating.

This movie is much more than most people think..  I like to call it a tri-dimensional love story.  There are three stories going on at once; all of which are powerful. First, you have the relationship between three brothers and their father, which includes everything from sibling rivalry, parental favorites, and the bond between brothers. Next you have Tristan's (Pitt) search to find his soul as I interpret it.  To cease the fire that burns within himself and find his calling. Finally you have a sort of dual-pronged love epic that first involves the youngest brother Samuel, then moves to a rather interesting tale between Susanne, Alfred and Tristan.  There are some intersting but predictable turns in the plot, but it is all very powerful stuff. Topped off with a fairly good ending, this movie will cause watery eyes and sniffles, so tag along a box of kleenex, especially if your girlfriend is with ya :)    Super performances by Pitt and Ormond. 9 out of 10",Legends of the Fall

110,yddsp@aol.com,It should have been better....,7,3 December 2007,"With all of the star power this movie possesses, with its viable plot, an emotional story, impressive scenery and even better cinematography, why isn't this movie better than it might have been? Two words; Brad Pitt, I doubt if he even rehearsed with script-in-hand, if at all. Either that or there was some gosh darn awful editing involved, although my suspicions prefer to settle on the former. I believe the problem to be one of a lack of motivation on the actor's part. Mr. Pitt enjoys a ""super-star"" status on Hollywood's ""A"" list, although I believe he has fallen victim to rumors of his own legend, in regard to his talent or lack thereof, in this case. I can see this happening if an actor's head becomes too big for his own hat. I don't dislike Mr. Pitt as an actor, he possesses a very pretty face, only there's no correlation to acting ability, yet I have enjoyed some of the films he's made in spite of the ""pretty face"". If he had even attempted to better nail-down his performance, I believe this film could have been near excellent, as it stands now it is a bit better than average. The reason I've since changed my mind about this film's worth is thus; Mr. Pitt plays the role of one, Tristan Ludlow. Yet how can he play the part effectively when he can't even pronounce his own name correctly? It's not as if someone else mispronounces it, HE mispronounces it himself. At the close of a letter to his father in which Tristan's voice is narrating, he closes by saying his name....only he says: Tristian, not Tristan, as if his name was ""Christian"", only with a ""T"" instead of the ""Ch""...well, that's the point I lost my respect for this cinematic disappointment, I now laugh every time I come across it, I don't even stick around long enough to hear him mangle it once again...LOL...EVERY other character in the film pronounces his name with great accuracy, why he can't eludes me, after all it's only his own name, LOL...oh well, if you care to see a movie that has an impressive rise on the emotional scale, only to see it tumble down blindly after he reads the letter, then by all means see this film. I can't help but laugh whenever I see it though, if you believe you can still enjoy it knowing this, be my guest, it is a decent enough story...on further thought, perhaps they should have changed his character's name to Bob or something simple like that, LOL....",Legends of the Fall

Maybe the author did? The cynical point could have been made so much better and so much more rewarding. (a self centered, self serving, selfish soul makes all those souls around him as tragic as he is, even when it is Brad Pitt as a troubled, earthy, free spirit.) It dragged and there were so many things to cover better, there was no need to stretch it out and dwell. This did not result in a relaxing movie, as the ploy is supposed to and the soul of the movie wasn't intended to be so anyway. The characters didn't mesh and there was sooooo much character and actors to carry it. It seemed so much never got on film and if it did, it is on the cutting room floor.This film left me hollow, waiting, missing something, when there are so many other gut wrenching tidbits that were only superficially dramatized, and some corny!!. There was good material here but it received only a Best Cinematography Oscar and was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Sound, ???? What a waste.

112,annlevtex,Drunk On Its Own Whiskey,5,25 December 2017,"OK, can't really fault the acting in this movie, except perhaps from Brad Pitt. I can't fault the production value. It's beautifully shot. It held my attention well enough. But I had problems with it when I first saw it back in1994, and having watched it again more than twenty years later, I haven't changed my mind. The primary issue? Pitt's character, Tristan. He's the heart of the story, he's meant to be, if not heroic, at least sympathetic and compelling. Instead, to me, he's just a self-absorbed, arrogant, emo jerk. His hair drove me crazy. That might seem shallow, but he looked like a man on the cover of a trashy romance novel. It's like his hair WAS his character. Like Pitt was kind of acting with his hair. I found myself siding with Aidan Quinn's character, Alfred, instead. Not that Alfred isn't meant to be sympathetic too, but overall I think the movie judges him unfairly, as do the other characters. Maybe it's because Aidan Quinn is just a much better actor, IMO, but mainly I just felt he got a raw deal. I won't say why because I don't want to spoil anything. As for the others, Anthony Hopkins is great as always. Julia Ormond is GORGEOUS here and performs quite well. Her character broke my heart. Finally, I thought the treatment of the Native American characters and how they informed the themes was rather pat. Not racist, just stereotyped. And it's a sexist movie too. I'm not usually a stickler about that, but here, for some reason, it really bothered me. But again, I'd say Tristan is the central problem. And when the central character doesn't work for you, the movie probably won't work for you either. I completely understand why so many viewers love this movie. It's just not for me.",Legends of the Fall

Tristan, the bad boy, the troubled soul-the favourite son, how can we define him in such simple terms? How can we ever truly comprehend the emotions he feels during this movie and how his emotions destroy he and his family. This film explores so many kinds of love, so many kinds of loss.

I'd wasted my time watching a movie where Everyone dies, where there is annoying narration throughout the film, and where  Anthony Hopkins looked indescribably horrid.  And that's only the tip of the iceberg. Brad Pitt was too beautiful early in his career so people doubted his acting ability.  Now Brad is forty years old, his face has more character, and no one doubts his acting ability. Maybe its old age or he's getting some acting lessons, whatever it is, it works.The Cinematography is amazing and reminded me of ""Lawrence Of Arabia.' The incomparable artistry and vision of  David Lean is present in  Edward Zwick's directing. The Academy Awards made a great choice giving `Legends of The Fall' an Oscar for Best Cinematography.
 In the end though I couldn't believe that Edward Zwick directed this film. He directed  ""Glory"", the Great War epic that earned Denzel Washington an Academy Award. I didn't want to see ""Glory"" because the same director of `Legends Of The Fall' directed it, but when I saw ""Glory"" on cable I realized I'd made a huge mistake. I had unknowingly bought Zwick's worst movie when I purchased  `Legends Of The Fall.'

As in any good picture, there are no weak points.It is the age old story of star crossed love but told well with an original twist. Love more as a force of nature that must play itself out. Men must simply endure it and accept their fate.Invest yourself in the movie, it's worth it.",Legends of the Fall
116,DonB-5,Brilliant,9,8 December 2001,"The people that don't like this movie don't understand this movie.  This isn't the usual shallow garbage for the masses.  It is a very deep film, full of great cinematography.  It illustrates the classic battle of good versus evil (both inside ones' self and in the environment), has many archetypes on display, forces self reflection.  The path between insanity and salvation is as thin as a razor's edge and we each walk that path. 
A very under appreciated work.  Brad Pitt is sensational as are the other cast members.",Legends of the Fall
117,DP-4,"I Don't Know Why, But I Love This Film",8,1 August 2002,"I had no idea what this movie was about before watching it. I instantly fell in love with this film. I'm still not sure what it was about. Perhaps it was meant to capture the spirit of early, western American culture. Perhaps its about the beloved main character Triston and how he destroys everything he touches. Perhaps its just about life and the consequences of its decisions. Maybe all of this, or none of this.For whatever reason, I love this movie. I love its melodrama, its sadness, the love, the pain, the sibling rivalry, the commentary on life. Its sappy, and in many ways overdone. In some ways its dark, and is not for people who like happy endings or tightly knitted cohesion in a story line.
So, I am not sure why I love this film so much. But, I do. I feel like we all know Triston. A man who never finds peace even after a lifetime of desperately searching. No peace, no joy, no fair. For some that's life.",Legends of the Fall
118,Popey-6,An interesting adjoint...,6,14 December 1999,"Not so much a 'classic' western, as an interesting adjoint to the genre. It's not very hard to see where the story is moving to as the music takes us sweepingly to the close.  Pitt does his sturdy best and Aidan Quinn is highly recommended as 'Alfred Ludlow'.  However the film never takes time enough to explain its characters intentions.  Beautiful scenery at times more than makes up for the haphazard storytelling, leaving the viewer at the very best, contented.",Legends of the Fall
119,Humphreywashere,Extraordinary movie,10,16 May 2016,"More than 20 years after this film was made, here is my contribution to these wonderful comments. This story is transformative. It is simple yet complex, tragic but uplifting, flawed yet perfect. It is the story of all of us, for we will all have tombstones one day, but whilst we live, we make right and wrong choices or life makes them for us. Life also creates moments that we treasure when those we love are healthy and happy and youthful. This movie permits us to share these moments with the Ludlows, frozen in time, looping over and over. I watch it and imagine different life choices: what if Susannah really grew to love dear gentle Alfred, for what greater gift in life is there than to be truly and deeply loved? What if she said to Tristan in that cell, wounded and crushed as he was, that she and Alfred will care for his children until he is free? What if Tristan didn't bootleg? The tombstones will still be there, the bear may still have raged within Tristan, but life would have been richer and kinder for all.",Legends of the Fall
120,emdragon,Turn of the century western of Americana,7,14 February 2008,"This is quite an excellent film. Anthony Hopkins anchors a fine cast to the tarmac of the Montana pre-world-war I countryside with an epic fatherly performance as Colonel William Ludlow. Ludlow has 3 sons, who are raised to be real men sometime before, during, and after the first world war on a ranch somewhere in Montana. Aidan Quinn plays his eldest son, Alfred, and gives a stirring performance. All 3 sons (the other 2, played by Brad Pitt and Henry Thomas) have an affair with the same woman (played ably by Julia Ormond) at some point during the picture. Brad Pitt, as Tristan Ludlow, the 2nd in line, is wild at heart, but ably seems to underline the emotional familial texture of the film. His performance is pretty good, though his 20th century modern style is sometimes too apparent (IMO). The movie is a tad long and drawn out, and takes the viewer through a series of tragedies. Tears will fall from the watching of this one. The musical score bothered me some for it's melodramatic stylizing, but the cinematography was among the best ever put upon the screen in capturing the beauty and wonder of the Rocky mountain scenery. The storyline is very well developed, engendering pathos and energy throughout. Give kudos to director Edward Zwick for this movie.

Not only are the characters engaging & vividly portrayed by an excellent cast, the subtle dynamics of their interactions are portrayed with inspired undertone & nuance. Star billing or even an Oscar should also have been awarded to the spectacularly beautiful scenery of Montana for the vast majesty it bestowed.This complex saga of love, grief & loyalty is narrated with stark simplicity by old Stab, long-time friend to retired Colonel Ludlow & his 3 sons: staid Alfred, the eldest (""old even for his years""); idealistic Samuel, the youngest (""There was nothing these brothers would not do for him.""); & wild Tristan (""Such people become crazy or they become legends.""). The conflict between Ludlow's fiercely anti-government anti-war stance & his sons' determination to do what they see as their duty is but a small part of the story; the heart of the tale is the rift that threatens the mutual devotion of these 3 loyal brothers as they all come to love the same woman. ""She was not to blame,"" Stab tells us, ""She was like the ice that freezes in the rock and splits it apart.""A tragic tale, yes; heartbreaking at times, but never boring. Every time I felt certain I knew what was coming next, the plot took another unexpected turn & I sat there riveted, softly breathing ""Wow!"" now & again into the darkness.

James Horner has never been one of my favorite composers. With a few exceptions, his scores don't differ much from each other.The cinematography is pretty nice. Bright colors, nice contrasts, very pleasing to the eye. Good costumes, props, all that jazz.My biggest qualm with this movie is the story, which is colossally convoluted. It jumps from event to event without much purpose other than to make the audience cry. Plus, I don't have much patience for movies centered around love triangles. They should add tension to the plot, not BE it.I gave this movie six stars because of how it looks. A lot of time and money obviously went into it and that I can appreciate.

Ed Zwick even says in the commentary that at the time this was made, Brad wasn't the super star and box office draw he is now. The studio didn't even want him in the movie.Ed saw the light and made a great flick which was unfairly labeled a ""chick flick"" at the time of its release. Sure its got romance but for me personally, the youngest of three brothers, its focus is the brothers and how they relate. I felt the relationships between the brothers, and how one woman changed all that, was really engaging.And what a beautiful woman, Julia Ormand is stunning in this film. She is exactly the type of woman who sort of floats through life without realizing the effect she has on the men around her. Anthony Hopkins does an awesome job as the old (gentle) man, and all the smaller roles are filled out by wonderful character actors.I love this movie, its not very realistic, nor is it trying to be.

But oh, the melodrama. The extended montage of Brad Pitt circumnavigating the world as a lost, anguished stud . . . just priceless. I mean, freaking hilarious. The relentless hackneyed score ain't bad, either. Cue up the weeper scenes, yes? How Anthony Hopkins was able to play the post stroke scenes without coming apart at the seams laughing is beyond me.

129,onewhoseesme,American Myth,10,24 January 2010,"America like England before us, does not possess it's own mythology. We borrow from the European, Roman and Greek. This begins and ends like an American Myth - and I mean that as a compliment. It is such a well told story. Indiscriminate in it's scope, and beautiful to look at throughout, it is hard to imagine a more finely crafted tale at an important time in our history that gives us a sense of place as a nation. We see here so much of the contradiction in both our nature and existence. That of good intentions with unintentional consequences, deep loyalty peppered with lifelong jealousy, the desire to honor while carelessly injuring, hating what was done but loving the one who did it. Our attempts at harmony on the outside while yearning for the unattainable on the inside - are contrasted well here. It is a masterful display of unfulfilled desire and selfishness seeking it's own satisfaction at the cost of someone else losing theirs. With this and the other film of the same year, Brad Pitt goes from star to superstar. All of the parts are well cast and well acted, with the beauty and allure of Julia Ormond as a perfect compliment. This is one of the new American classics, and I believe one of the top fifty films worth owning. fullgrownministry.com",Legends of the Fall

131,Private Ryan-2,One of the worst movies of the decade!,1,4 May 1999,"I couldn't know where to start!I found just about every aspect of the movie poor and deplorable (except for a superb cinematography, to be fair). The acting is quite pathetic and embarrassing at times. The whole movie seems to gravitate towards beautiful poses of Brad Pitt with the sunshine through his hair and the wonderful Montana woods in the background, like in a bad shampoo commercial.
The character played by Julia Ormond is simply unbelievable! She is supposed to be in the 1910s, yet she behaves like a very promiscuous 90s woman. If the movie had any grasp on historical realism, this woman should have been ostracized from society, end up as an outcast. Instead, she jumps from bed to bed in her fiancee's house like there's no tomorrow, and nobody seems to be bothered about it!The screenwriters add some characters to the story for the sole purpose to be killed and make our ""heroes"" look sad and puppy-eyed. Literally! Otherwise someone please explain to me the character of Isabel in the movie. She doesn't even have two decent lines in the script!The worst element of the movie was the incredible amount of historical mistakes or anachronisms. There were too many to let you concentrate in this excuse for a plot. I'm a great enthusiast of movies that try to reflect an era, and pay lots of attention to every detail. The erroneous details were so numerous that I would burst in laughter at times. And this movie was made by the director of a movie like ""Glory""! From the way they talk, to their apparel, to the tools they use, to every other detail, the movie as bad as ""Titanic"" as far as historical accuracy is concerned.To illustrate with an example, at a point in the movie Susannah -Julia Ormond-  pulls a portable photo reflex-camera on a tripod and takes idyllic pictures of the brothers in the Montana landscape... They are supposed to be in the 1910s-1920s! Cameras were as big as a TV set! And portable reflex cameras were not available as consumer products until the 1950s! Anyone that knows a bit about photography probably caught that major goof!The movie is so plagued with goofs that makes it difficult for a serious movie-goer to concentrate on the story. I guess they really made the movie with one thing in mind: milking the cash out of those teenage fans of Brad! There's no other explanation for this awful flick.Please avoid this movie at all costs if you don't like 3 hour- long shampoo commercials with very, very bad plots.

However, it has everything anyone could ask for; love, violence, revenge, family values, politics...everything. Quite incredible.

That said, I have still found some excellent films in that category.  ""The Legends of the Fall"" was not one of them.The outstanding visuals in this film were the only thing that kept me going. The plot was overly dramatic and scattered - to the point of making you want to stop watching.  The sheer length of the film was unbelievable when you consider that the plot wasn't that complicated.  The story dragged frequently, mostly because the director must have felt the need for overly dramatic pauses - several in every scene.The story started out on a slightly happy note, then got more and more depressing as the film went on.  If you were looking for an uplifting romance tale, you didn't get it.  By the film's end you both bored and depressed - not my idea of entertainment.To summarize: Visuals - interesting backgrounds, visually stimulating, looked outstanding on the big screen.The rest of it - melodrama, depression, and a slow disjointed plot.If you rent this one, keep your No-Doze and Prozac handy.",Legends of the Fall

However, the music, which was an ever-present distraction succeeded in drowning out the dialogue, at times, and when it wasn't doing so it seemed out-of-place in its purposeful attempt to add grandeur to scenes that needed no such addition. In fact, the music's loud volume was so off-putting, in its attempt to unnecessarily telegraph emotional content, that it only added an overblown pretentiousness to the proceedings. With that said, I gave this film a rating of 8, which - without the overwhelming musical score - probably would have netted a 10, for all the other elements it had going for it. Sometimes less is more and if the music had been a subtle background inclusion, rather than an overpowering entity unto itself, I believe this movie would have benefited rather than suffered as a result.",Legends of the Fall

My second review: ""You know, this wasn't that good of a movie, I need to lower my rating."" My third review: ""OMG, THIS WAS A GOD AWFUL FILM!""Hard to imagine, but sadly true. This movie deprived me from the bottom up. It was depressing, it was bleak, hopeless, atrocious, sinister, dispiriting, distant, gloomy, and remorseful.To brake it down, this was about stupid people doing stupid things. NO WAIT, scratch that! The main character Tristan (Pitt) was a stupid man who did stupid things and about a stupid woman named Susannah (Ormond) who did a VERY stupid thing.They would call themselves lovers, they would call themselves soul mates, but they were wrong. What has Susannah got? Samuel , the youngest of the three bothers, and the man who loves Susannah. He brings her to his family to meet his two brothers, Tristan and Alfred and his father,Col. William Ludlow. She meets his brothers, one of them steps in too close. All three go off to war, the brother in love gets killed leaving his lover alone with his brothers. There somethings wrong going on between between Susannah and Tristan. Tristan is someone who I would like to call dishonest, back stabbing, disloyal, untrustworthy, disgusting, vile, wicked and cruel.On going through the movie Susannah ends up marrying Alfred. Someone who deeply loves her and gives her the best she'll ever have. Despite them not having children, to me, she's living a wonderful life. Though despite all that, she still insists on emotionally falling for Tristan. After all that he's done to her. Use your head woman! Not your heart! Think! Think! Think! The heart is misguiding and only leads to bad things (suicide). Even after all Alfred has done for her, because she let her emotions drive her, she wasn't appreciative for his love.That to me, is sick. I could and can go on but I want the fans to think about that.

The music actually came from ""The Last of the Mohicans"" and the real soundtrack proved to be horribly bad. But it is nothing compared to the movie. Before watching it, you had better know that everything is bad in this movie : the actors play so bad that it is hardly believable that the producer did not sue them. Brad Pitt plays as if he was starring in a Levi's advertisement, Julia Ormond is as forgettable as ever, and Anthony Hopkins is so ridiculous that I doubt he mentions that movie on his career resumes. As to the plot, it is worse ! You don't need to see the film to know what happens to the characters : it has the more predictable plot you will ever see ! The only quality could be that this melodrama is really melodramatic, but after one hour, it is so melodramatic that you begin to wonder if it is not a caricature. One thing is sure : some characters in that movie are REALLY unlucky, so that you can understand why they are SO depressed.

This movie SO deserved (and won) the Oscar for cinematography - it is a five star visual feast and is done much more justice on a large screen than anywhere else. The cast is spectacular, and whomever it was that casted the roles as they did simply could not have chosen better actors than they did. This was my first encounter w/ Aidan Quinn, whom I've adored ever since, and Brad Pitt IS Tristan. Anthony Hopkins was perfect as the Colonel, the patriarch of the family. This film makes me wish I'd have moved south and gotten into the ""business"" vs. staying up here and squandering my talents in the Sillycon Valley (still the Santa Clara Valley to those of us who are natives).

But looks alone do not make a good actor, he is one. Without further ado I want to point out that the cast is extraordinary. Hopkins's drawing out of his gun from out of his bear-skin coat to defend his son must move every hardened heart, as did Alfred his brother. I am not in favor of every-man's rifle-bearing, but in this particular instance I could not see another end to this dilemma. I, the pacifist craved for this conclusion (the American word escapes me). At this point I must admit that I am a particular fan of Mr.Pitts. Many may disagree with me but there is no compare. He has an amiable smile, wet lips and never, never, tries to be anything but himself. But I was going to to review the film. Actually there isn't much to say apart from it's excellence as a piece of cinematographic work. The story is Tristan who outlives everybody who loves him despite all odds. I find it heart-rending.

A family saga with many dimensions and profound themes. Love, death, jealousy, revenge and redemption. Filled with melodrama and tragedy, this sweeping epic set in early 1900's Montana is at it's core a soap opera for guys, a tremendously dark journey both beautiful and brutal. Big sky country meets father/ son issues. A bold and masterful James Horner score wrenches your senses throughout. There is no doubt that we are all splintered souls. Herein lies the haunting echoes of Cain and Abel and a brother's broken bond. And what exactly is behind a father favoring his wayward son? Warning: this motion picture is too strong for children. How quickly life passes us, almost unnoticed, and how things taken for granted disappear before we even have a chance to glimpse their presence as they melt away. A strong Native American theme underscores this film, hinting at our inner mystical voice. This movie is nothing less than a spellbinding feast for the soul. There's something very special here. Be prepared for unforgettable buttons to be pushed.",Legends of the Fall
149,gary-224,How did I miss this film when it first came out?,9,4 May 2010,"What World was I living in when this film appeared in 1994? I sure would have loved to have seen it on a big screen rather than on a 19-inch wide computer monitor flat screen. As a person with a talent for outdoor photography, I can readily understand why Legends of the Fall won the Academy Award for cinematography. But there's much more to this movie. The acting is superb. It does not appear to be acting. The sets are beautifully produced. And the music by James Horner is so beautiful that I can hardly allow a day to pass without playing tracks 1,2,6 and 13 of it from the original soundtrack CD.I actually found this film through the music instead of finding the music through the film, my more usual arrangement. As an avid fan of Jay Ungar and Molly Mason, I own all of their great CD's. Jay Ungar did the violin solos for the film though I could not find his name in the movie titles. At least he is given the credit he deserves on the music CD. Having discovered the main theme on the Jay Ungar - Molly Mason CD, ""The Lover's Waltz.""I then purchased the music CD for the film. Next came watching a Netflix DVD and I soon will purchase the movie DVD.I have rated this film at 9.0, even though I really cannot relate to much of anything in the story, but it is so well done and that great music. and to see Henry Thomas, the boy from E.T., that was a real surprise.",Legends of the Fall

At this writing, this is my favorite movie to watch. I am not saying it is the best movie/film of all time, but for me at this moment...but it could be.Now, for the negativity...OK, there are some things/errors that i read about that I didn't even pick up on when I watched this movie. I will give those people a nod for pointing that out, but if I am honest, unless it hurts my viewing of the movie in some way, I really don't care if a character used a camera that wasn't invented yet, continuity issues, other technical errors... This movie is FANTASTIC! and whatever I read, and was informed of after I saw the movie that was incorrect, didn't affect my viewing at the time, and & doesn't affect my viewing of it again and again. I own this DVD and it is a must for my collection. OK, I did have a few issues with Tristan at some point, and I watched the deleted/extra scenes to clear up some of it (I'm sure many know what I'm talking about), and I don't think that should have to happen. I'll cut a little slack for a film when it's based on a novel, that one can read, after all, they can't get it all in sometimes (though this one was a little odd). These are things I consider when/if voting for awards, but if you want to put all that aside, this movie has great acting & cinematography, the story is top notch and it all combines for an all -time favorite for me.",Legends of the Fall

Anthony Hopkins did a good job, as did the other suporting actors, and Brad Pitt was great as he always is. Some people say Brad Pitt is too ""pretty"" for this movie.  That just doesn't make since. The story is about how women fall in love with him as soon as they meet him(Suzanna, Isabelle) so it would make since that he is good looking.  The only problem i had with the movie is that it tried to be too much.  I tried to be a romantic movie, an action movie, a drama, and an epic story all in one.  Some movies pull this off well, like Gladiator or Braveheart, but legends tried to be too dramatic with all the people dying and everything.  It is almost as if it could have been an epic story, but tried too hard to be one.  If that makes any sense.     Well, it is a good movie, but it is not a great movie.  If you like Brad Pitt because you think he is sexy and want to see him cry a lot, you will probably love it.  If you like him more like he was in snatch or fight club, you probably will not like it as much.  Good watchable movie, but nowhere near Brad or Hopkins best.  For a better drama with them in it, rent or buy Meet Joe Black.  And if you do not already own fight club, go and buy it RIGHT NOW.  7/10",Legends of the Fall

Such an inspiring epic tale of romance, war and family, all told through the wise words of the native One Stab.I was quite hesitant before I started watching it as it seemed like such a long film. I was scared to get bored. The opposite happened. I felt inspired and intrigued, because this film is about life. About happiness and sadness, death and birth, loss and wisdom. A film about being wild and lost, about true love and family.The screenplay is amazing and I simply cannot understand that Sir Anthony Hopkins didn't receive an Oscar nomination for his role; he's brilliant. 90s Brad Pitt is irresistible as usual with his blonde locks and the rest of the casting is perfect as well. I always feel a strong appreciation for the Native Americans and I love how they are so much involved in this epic.The film can feel a little dated at times but the breathtaking cinematography of the wild Montana makes more than up for it. Dreaming away into the wilderness through your screen makes you forget that this movie is not perfect. Yes, it can be a little corny at times. And yes, there are credibility flaws.

The acting is finely tuned and never heavy handed even though the story skates right up to the edge but never crosses into melodrama. LOTF is the exact point between a chic flick and a guy movie and from beginning to end it's has a great mood that flows like a river. Every movie has a group of haters and that's just the nature of responses to art. You might be one of those haters but if you love early 20th Century westerns and epics and bonded families and love stories and can handle the violence you're more likely than not to enjoy this finely made film and thrive on the abundant joys and sadness and spiritual complexity of Legends Of The Fall.,Legends of the Fall

However the cinematography is amazing and the vistas of the American wilderness and seldom looked as good as they have here. Why on earth would the 3 brothers fight for Julie Ormond?

Even gnawing off some limbs to escape seemed to me the perfect and logic measure at this time...What hits the roof...that this flick was actually rewarded with Oscar awards. Either the jury was bribed, threatened, tortured or in Novosibirsk during the award procedure.Seriously: there are way better ways of spending your free time, even if this includes watching a drama about life in times of war starring Pauly Shore, Michael Dudikoff and Paris Hilton as the lead cast.

Without going into spoilers the film lost its seriousness right in the first 30 minutes (with the war scenes and stuff). It is dumb and overly dramatic. The context is extremely bare-bones and badly presented - similarly to Ad Astra. Some of the scenes are actually laughable, like the death scenes which I would call downright ridiculous. Maybe 1/4 of the movie worked for me, everything else was more funny than not which includes writing and acting too. Perhaps LotF is not for me, even though I really liked Joe Black with some of the same cast. Perhaps the story is rushed which makes some of the character moments seem illogical, or I just cannot understand what drives these people to do what they are doing. Perhaps this is a movie about stupid people and how good Brad Pitt looks and that he can get everything while still being a jerk. I don't know.
What is actually good in Legends of the Fall though is the music, which while not going to be one of my favourites definitely adds a lot to the movie. As I see it also got an Oscar for cinematography. That came as a surprise to me. Maybe the bad writing took me out too much to see the artistry here...",Legends of the Fall

The tear-jerker for moi being when Samuel's face lights up with hope (during the war when he has been blinded by the gas and is stuck in the barbed wire)upon hearing Tristan's reassuring voice and then...well, dying. :P Followed by Brad Pitt sobbing, ""oh no! oh no!"" I personally thought that was a great scene. It's a story about family, a story about betrayal and trust, a story about finding yourself, a story about the journey of life and how little decisions can have great consequences... An unrealistic melodramatic way of exploration of those issues? A bit too Bold and the Beautiful?

165,Yasmin_07,"Could have been bigger than the Notebook, Braveheart and Titanic but failed. Spoilers.",3,28 October 2015,"I give three stars for this movie because of James Horner's amazing composition, the Cinematography, the potential of the main cast and Montana.This film made a mockery of true love and claimed that a man like Tristan was a legend. Movies are an escape. This movie left a bad taste in the mouth of anyone who kept their eyes open. Tristan was capable of loving his brother unconditionally, however could not do the same with Susannah? Everything about Tristan was contradictory. They had huge potential with this film if only they had cut out Isabel Two and created another scenario for when Tristan had returned to Montana. The true love story between Susannah and him could have continued when he had returned from his journey.It was also historically wrong. They showed how happy he was with Isabel yet they forgot how real bootleggers lived. They were reckless and selfish. This was really a way of Hollywood promoting huge age gaps like they usually do. Jim Harrison's book contained no love in this relationship and was even more awful because of how unrealistic it was. Isabel was also 16 in the book. At 20 years old she was still yet a child and developing in more ways than one. The character should have been cut out entirely yet all they did was try to make it look better by having her predict her marriage.They made a mockery of the native theme. Men like Tristan are not loved or upheld in a normal functioning society. Even in the time period it was set in. Susannah is often insulted yet all she did was love one man. The main cast had huge potential, but the movie turned out to be a joke and very contradictory. I think many women realize what it is like if a guy like Tristan has traded them in. It truly makes a mockery out of love and wasn't at all realistic. The writers made a huge mistake with keeping the child marriage in and it showed how uncreative they were for not being able to substitute the scenarios. It is truly sad that James Horner's music was wasted on this movie. The first half and ending scenes were nice. But the movie didn't flow and was absurd once you finish watching it. The character of Tristan doesn't exist. You may get men who just use women, or men who love their family and treat women nicely (alfred) or men who just think about themselves. But you will not get a man like Tristan who is so selfish yet shows his good sides by loving only one of his brothers! It's really sad that they didn't check in with others when they chose the storyline. The book was absurd enough. But the movie had potential. A shame. James Horner was the only legend here.",Legends of the Fall

He is now quietly running a farm in the west with the help of his three hardworking sons -- who like their father -- are so socially conscious that they volunteer to go and fight WWI without having ever set foot in Europe. The story is not one of those when you say such things couldn't happen in real life, and everything takes place in lifelike plausible situations. This epic movie has a lot going for it, and it achieves what many movie makers strive to do but fail. Majestic scenery of the American west, with glorious sunsets in awesome colors, to unimaginable scenes of horrific gore and human slaughter in WWI. The dialogue is perfect and the acting superb.

Legends of the Fall is poetry weaved into passionate storytelling - the look into the lives of one family, with one in particular, set at the backdrop of beautiful Montana.. A drama of epic proportions with those characters, the scenes, the screenplay.All of us react to emotion differently, some harder than most, some, not much.

The actors try bravely to make something of it, but while Anthony Hopkins' Welsh accent was believable for the period, I was incredulous when he suddenly appeared to switch to Irish for no apparent reason. The anarchist sentiments also left me feeling very uncomfortable: isn't Montana where all the survivalists and anarchists live? The film appears to have been released a year before the Oklahoma bombing; I doubt if these people would have been so glorified afterwards.If the music wasn't a cliché when the film was made then it certainly is now: all those sweeping massed violins just make me queasy.The icing on the cake, though, is the noble savage depiction of the Native Americans.

I am fascinated by the way you can see the movie from different characters point of view, and it's like seeing a different movie. 2: In this movie you can see Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins deliver some of the best acting they have ever done. They are really good as a team. (Watch ""Meet Joe Black"")The downside is also the diversity in the plotlines. The movie attempts to tell as different stories as possible, and at times it all becomes a bit sought and unrealistic.

You wanted them all to succeed but a great story is about more then just its characters. A great story is about finding that unsettling part hidden deep within you, that part you put so deep you forgot it was there cause you were taught how not to let go. How to hold onto those feelings. This movie will wrench those away, pluck those clinging emotions that dare not collaborate together, this movie will bunch all of those emotions you ever had and it will release them to the winds like a thousand doves that have just been set to flight.

It's easily one of the most overblown, stagnant, and unintentionally hilarious movies ever produced....

To be honest, I find myself enjoying it in the same way people will always love Plan 9 from Outer Space!!! If you miss Dr Quinn Medicine Woman or think those black and white posters of muscly guys holding babys are beautiful, I strongly advise you to see this movie, you'll love it!!! I think a lot should rest on the shoulders of Mr Zwick who is proving to be (along with Mr Chechick) one of the new hopes for provoking some sort of cinematic revolution!!!!",Legends of the Fall

So much praise already so I only have this to say.It shows how very foolish are the members of the Academy for not lavishing this movie with a batch of Oscars. Thecast were so well balanced. Julie Ormond was perfect in this role,sadly we don't see much of her now. She has a fragility on the screen which other actresses don't have. A young Brad Pitt is a revelation in this film and as always Aidan Quinn totally reliable. Hopkins is perfectly cast as the gruff father who adores his sons but cannot hold onto his wife. The total futility of war is more than proved in this movie. It is Samuel who sets off a terrible chain of events by going to fight the Hun ( as they were referred to). A once loving family are torn to pieces and the dreadful irony was that it all could have been prevented. Suzanna loved Samuel but Tristan sent her wild and poor Alfred the serious older brother who adores her also, has to wait patiently in the background. The real tragedy is Susanna's infertility juxtaposed with Isabel Twos fertility. The narration of One Stab was a masterstroke, especially as he never spoke English when addressing the characters. A great story that is very easy on the eye with wonderful cinematography. Look out for the 1080p blu-ray version.",Legends of the Fall

The only character in it that wasn't a complete idiot was the one played by Anthony Hopkins. I suppose it could be argued that it had a (slooooooowwwwww) plot, with twists, etc., but so what? I go to a movie to be entertained, to escape from the general crappiness of life, not to watch a movie that gets down in there and wallows in it.

The main actors, Hopkins, Pitt, Quinn, Thomas and Ormond are all fantastic. The story wrapped with two brothers being pulled into WW1, the Montana countryside, the love stories all make this well worth your 2+ hours.But the cherry on top of this movie is the music by James Horner (RIP).

The women in their lives are played by Julia Ormond and Karina Lombard. The Ludlows have many flaws but in the end they come together as the family they are.

195,zoltanc666,Dangerous Legends of Dysfunctionality,3,11 July 2004,"I found it really surprising what is presented as 'romance' here: A dysfunctional marriage/family (just look at the reasons why they married and why they separated) producing Tristan, the 'hero' of the movie. But he isn't a real man to start with. His very, very boyish or childish behavior doesn't stop during the whole of the movie, even after he's gone on his oh-so-important hunting/self-discovery trip. He seems to completely lack maturity and (consequently) the key to manhood. The woman waits for him which makes one wonder if she has got some problems, too. Indeed in the beginning of the movie Tristan's mother gives us some clues, saying that the girl has lost her parents and is 'fragile' (I think that's the word she used). The real tragedy here is that nobody realises what's the problem or tells Tristan to stop and to grow up. The problems arising because of his dysfunctional personality lead to him causing death and disaster and ultimately being isolated and dying alone. 'Pretty Boy' Brad Pitt indeed seems to be the ideal choice for Tristan, since he didn't need to use his limited acting abilities for this part, anyway. I think he suffers from the same problem as the character does. The only good scene he does is when he broods over the girl playing Tennis at the beginning of the movie. The other actors are decent to very good (I especially liked Karina Lombard, a great and underrated actress) but ultimately they are wasted on this movie (as is the good photography and direction and the score). It's surprising that on the one hand the scriptwriters  (and/or the writer of the novel) presented the personality problems so well but on the other hand make those persons (especially Tristan) heroes. They obviously didn't know what they were doing.",Legends of the Fall
196,treeroot,An excellent film,10,29 March 2004,"Profoundly touching and enthralling, this film presents:
Beauty. Well blended into one were the incredibly magnificent landscapes and strikingly attractive characters, which will move any hearts that are able to appreciate beauty.Love.  Deep affection between the father and sons, among the brothers and lovers, was the driving force behind everything occurring in the drama.
Fate. An invisible force that, more often than not, landed one with the opposite of what one desired to have. And no matter how hard people had tried to organize their lives, there was no escaping their respective destinies. The father, out of his hatred for wars and dislike of the government, had settled his family in a remote mountain area to lose the madness of the world, and yet had to watch his sons leaving him for the war. Samuel, the youngest brother treasured by the whole family, was the first to die. Alfred, who fell in love with Susannah at the first sight of her, had to wait ¡ª long and painfully, one brother after another¡ª to get her and marry her, only to lose her again in the most horrible way. And Tristan¡ª despite his strong, wild, handsome appearance, despite the fact that he was adored by those around him¡ª was the most suffering soul of the all: A man whose feelings had been torn between his beloved brothers and his lover, a man who had to sort out, but failed, what was wrong with him, and why was it that everything he touched caused disasters.A wonderful film is Legends of the Fall.

But I have never caught the point in these kind of critics. If a story is a bit used up and filled with clichés, why does it have to be mocked? Such films as Pearl Harbor, Titanic etc., are a bit over the top, but I honestly think that Legends of the Fall contains so many qualities that it deserve the credit it deserves. All along the film, we follow the life and times of the Ludlow family living in Northern USA in the late 1800's and early 1900's. It is always well balanced between ingeniousness and cliché. Just a few times this line is crossed (thereby 9, not 10 points), and in the end, you're left with a good feeling, 'cause this is really a ""feel-good movie"".

Unfortunately I was terribly disappointed, 'Legends of the Fall' is overlong, silly and very boring. For all the great cinematography and dramatic score it does not add up to a great film if you don't get the characters right, and i was disappointed in the performances of Pitt and Hopkins, being a fan of the latter I rather wish I had'nt seen this film as he clearly drops ricketts here; for example speaking with a welsh accent when his character isn't welsh, and at one point in another scene when he loses his temper for a moment there I thought he would break out in German. Pitt didn't come across a soldier from the great war, more like a protagonist from 'bill and Ted's excellent adventure' The storyline is soppy, sentimental and absurd and really doesn't bear going into, I did not like it and would not recommend it to other adults as a drama, I would only recommend it to fans of brad Pitt.

I will, however, give you a simple overview.A)Don't just stick to the one plot line, get a plotline, and while you're at it, get a convincing plotline that has some social significance.  The only plot that matters at all is the one at the end when the family is desperate and takes to smuggling.  That should have been where the story started, and ended.B)Because of all of the plotlines, some not only made no sense but had no significance, even if they framed the story, like Triscuit and his bear. Dime-store spiritualism: no thank you.C)Characters didn't play off each other well, or maybe it was the acting, or maybe it was both.  Either way they were too irritating to tell the difference.D)It got an academy award nomination...in anything!  Then again, maybe the academy deserves drivel like this...I could go on, but that's more than enough ranting.  To its credit, at least it elicited such a harsh response from me!  Not even a terrible movie like _Congo_ could do that.  Have a good day renting something, but make sure it isn't ""L o' the Fault.""

I was expecting a great romance but instead I got an early 1900s soap opera. Very predictable and drawn out- stiff dialogue and rigid acting (especially on the part of Aidan Quinn) doesn't help much either. Why do they have odd, semi-English accents and such proper grammar in old western America? I felt like I was watching paper dolls- and could barely even understand half of what Anthony Hopkins said (even before his stroke). Filmmakers should also realize that just because a movie has dramatic music doesn't make the movie captivating (although Legends does have a great score). All in all, I was quite bored and untouched.

Both brothers sam and alfred are jealous of his brother tristan, because everyone seems to like him. This applies more to alfred though, and you do notice that for samantha tristain is who see really loves.

This soulful story really captures your heart and is one of the few movies that can really make you cry.

Not only Brad Pitt, but also Anthony Hopkins, Aidan Quinn, and Henry Thomas, which played their parts excellently.

207,msmary,Legendary Portrayal of the Masculine Heart,10,26 May 2009,"Deep spiritual themes are easy to miss in the first viewing of Edward Zwick's ""Legends of the Fall."" I dismissed the film as a beautiful but slow-paced chick-flick ten years ago; but, upon later viewings I came to appreciate the film's messages about masculinity, grief, maturity, and responsibility.The film's three brothers - Samuel, Alfred, and Tristan - have very different motives. Samuel is immature and naive: he wants to fight in WWI to prove his honor and masculinity to himself, his family, and his fiancé. Alfred is the ambitious older brother, believing that success, power and prestige will satisfy his inner longings for love and respect. Tristan is the only one who truly listens to his inner spiritual voice, no matter how extreme and seemingly selfish his actions may be viewed by others. Ultimately, it is Tristan that everyone admires, both on screen and in the audience for the freedom of his heart. The imagery that Zwick uses in the Montana, WWI, and travel scenes are breathtaking and enhance the story's message. The dialogue is poignant and the feelings are powerful. I understand some of the criticism of the film. Anthony Hopkins and Aiden Quinn's strong supporting roles, perhaps, overshadow Brad Pitt's acting ability. The film is melodramatic, but I think the melodrama actually enhances its themes. Only true drama lovers would like this film. There is little comic relief and lots of depressing turns. But, you would be hard-pressed to find a better written screenplay or better cinematography than in this film.",Legends of the Fall
208,lanfisher-1,Beautiful Movie,9,7 February 2009,"It's 2009 and I have just seen this movie for the very first time. I must say that I am most impressed and wish I had seen this years ago when it first came out! What caught my attention to make me watch this movie in the first place was the beautiful scenery and amazing cinematography. Many people have already commented on how beautiful the Montana scenery is, and I must agree. However, the movie was actually filmed in Canada, and the scenery was only passed off as being that of Montana. However, my understanding is that it very much resembles the same rugged beauty of Montana.I have also read people's criticism about the clichés in this movie. I must disagree to some extent. Usually older western settings such as this we see much less civility than was displayed in this movie. The family and all their ranch hands held a tight bond together, and were upstanding, hard-working people with a lot of love in their hearts for one another and anyone else they met. The dynamics that existed between the characters, and the nuances of the performances that each actor brought to the table in their portrayals were very real, and makes you understand and care for the characters. We also don't see many movies in this time period and setting that explore human emotion in such detail. The characters in this movie are all very human and believable. The only reason I don't give this movie a 10 is because I thought the war scenes could have been a bit more realistic. The sum of all these parts -- the scenery, the characters, the tragedies -- make this a timeless movie that will always hold its own. I can hardly wait for this one to come out to Blu-ray so I can add it to my collection.P.S. - How fun it was to see Bradd Pitt fighting for the Canadian Army. This should give Canadians some sense of novel pride.",Legends of the Fall
209,llamadrama-11132,"So sad, so relieving for characters..",10,1 January 2016,"I was watching this movie for the first time with my parents on a school night. Honestly, we usually don't watch films at night but it had started at 8 o'clock on Encore (y'know, the premium channel?) and was supposed to end at around 10:20 or so, so it wasn't a big deal. My mom told me I would like it but I was kind of unsure at first because it took place in the past and I thought it was going to be boring. Oh, how wrong I was.I never really thought Brad Pitt was THAT attractive as every woman I know does. I mean, I had seen Spy Game with my grandfather and he WAS pretty cute in that;) but, oh my GOSH, when he was younger... wow. And the long hair... I don't even mind it because it's long and luscious and golden and looks better than my own hair.When the movie first opened with hardcore Tristan Ludlow (Brad Pitt) as a little kid with his 2 brothers and his father (Anthony Hopkins) living in the middle of nowhere, you just know that this movie is going to be hard to watch. And indeed, it was.Each of the 3 boys really has a role in the family.. Samuel being the baby, Alfred being the mature, responsible one, and Tristan, the favorite, who declawed a bear at a young age.K, so as of now, we have Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins. So, what's with the rest of the cast? Well, Aiden Quinn plays Alfred Ludlow, and if you don't know who he is, shame on you, and go watch Benny and Joon right now. The baby brother, Samuel, is played by Henry Thomas all grown up from the time he played Elliott in E.T. :'( Julia Ormond is the common lady in the film who honestly gets really irritating because she can't make up her mind and whatever.Samuel Ludlow comes home from school, I think? And when he does this, he brings home a GIRL, Susannah (Julia Ormond), whom he's destined to marry. By the end of the first 15 minutes, you're in love with all of the characters.Samuel, then, decides to go to war, and Alfred and Tristan are going with him to protect him, but as they're doing so, they let Samuel get away for just a moment to a point where he's gassed and cannot see. Because Alfred is injured, it's all up to Tristan to save his little brother. You hear him shouting ""SAMUELLLL. SAMUEL,"" running through the woods trying to find his pour innocent brother. You KNOW what's going to happen, where else would the story go?I cried. I mean, I've become a BIT of a softie lately to movies, but even my mom looked at me funny when I stifled up tears for pour Samuel and the heartbreak I knew the family would have to deal with. Then, the story progresses, whatever, it's dramatic, sad, a bit of a love story, everyone grieves Samuel's death. It comes to a point where Tristan leaves. Just LEAVES. He can't deal with the pain, I guess. But, he's gone for like 7 years or something. Obviously, I won't give everything away... But, it's so hard not to, because I think it's my favorite movie. No one I KNOW from school has seen it, no one from any groups or sports, either. Please understand my pain, it's such a great movie and I have no one to appreciate it with besides my family. Most feel really bad for Tristan by the end; he's been through a lot. And I mean, a LOT. So when he goes to get revenge, you're just so excited and RELIEVED for him because it's like he took all of his anger and your own and took it out on total losers. Overall, fantastic movie, and there are so many more surprises I DIDN'T ruin that the movie is worth watching for!!Watch it as soon as you can! Really, it's great!!!",Legends of the Fall

I have been wanting to see the movie for a long time, and I am glad I finally did see it! The beauty with which the film progresses is simply benumbing. There are no unnecessary scenes, each scene growing into the next. The acting too grows on you. You never know what significant role is to be played by an apparently insignificant character.What I loved about the movie is it's utter frankness in showing what's real, a complete departure from the normal fare turned out by the film industry in India. Some things just stay with you forever, and this film's one of them.My favourite scene? The one when Alfred tells Susanna about Tristan and the 20 year old ( I don't remember her name). The expressions evoked by Susanna are heart-wrenching. And of course, how can I forget Anthony Hopkins? He was perfect for the role.A must-see for people who want a paradigm of sensitivity enacted...

It's just a case of when.The start is a bit alarming with the old Indian - could this be Little Big Man's son at the age of 153? But the Indians in this film are lovely as are, for a while, our American family, even if Anthony Hopkins' alarming attempts at an Irish accent are a little upsetting. However Brad Pitt's long hair and his incarnation as a kind of American romantic hero, and Julia Ormond's beauty, make it clear from the outset which way this film is going to go. Part 2: the War!! The historical detail is apparent when you remark that the brave soldiers are not wearing tin helmets, but nonetheless the director has the good idea to give us a laughable, unrealistic, grotesque, attack sequence masquerading as a game of football. Then Brad Pitt goes completely feral. The film has become completely ridiculous without ever being sublime.Part 3: Brad Pitt has to come to terms with things. Of course! War can be traumatic after all. Our romantic hero goes through a Lord Jim phase - nice images of the sea and Brad Pitt trading with the cannibals.Anthony Hopkins, meanwhile, fed up at not having been able to show off his sporadic Irish accent decides to demonstrate his acting qualities by method acting his way through the sequels of a stroke - one half of his face refuses to move, an arm and a leg too, language is difficult, an Irish accent especially so.But the film is not finished yet, with bootlegging and politics and drama a-plenty still to come.The culmination is when everyone has to choose a Wyatt Earp character and take their places at the OK corral. But even that is eclipsed by our native American going native in a fitting final scene.

Yeah, right.And then, the prodigal son goes on to become a bootlegger, and I guess most Brad Pitt fans and anti-establishment people are supposed to feel sorry for him, because he put his wife and kids in jeopardy with his illegal activities. This kind of selfishness happens in real life all the time.The oldest son, who truly cares about helping his community grow, and who loves a woman so much, he's willing to take secondhand, nay *third*hand goods, ends up marrying a woman who is such a weenie that she'd kill herself for a man who doesn't even love her, in some kind of pitiful Sylvia Plath-like angst.Augh! All too realistic and demonstrative of the melodrama of people with certain psychiatric disorders.5 out of 10, rather than zero, because although it was irritating as heck, it is a true tragedy that I see time and time again in real life.",Legends of the Fall

It can not be labeled as a ""chick flick"" or a non-stop action adventure either. It is a combination of both. Making it the perfect movie to see with your significant other.My wife loved the romantic love story and, of course, Brad Pitt. As a historian I enjoyed the setting: the mid-west in the 1910s and World War I. This move in fact won the 1994 Academy Award for Best Cinematography. We both found Anthony Hopkins performance superb (as usual).Without giving away the story the movie shows the life of a family of three brothers and their father, the brothers love for one woman, and the families struggles for survival.See this movie today with the one you love!",Legends of the Fall

They showed how a family can love and be so very loyal to each other and how fast that love can turn to hate. It also showed that in the end family (in most cases) will always stand behind each other.Awesome acting in this film. This to me was Brad's best role.

Not only was Legends of the Fall cinematic ally beautiful,but it was also wonderfully acted. There was not a misstep among the cast. Definitely Brad Pitts best acting cred to date. As for the story itself, I laughed, I cried, I ran the full spectrum of emotions watching this film. I am a complete sucker for a love story with a happy ending, but the ending of Legends of the Fall was an awesome twist. And surprisingly enough, it was quite fitting.

Three brothers raised up by a severe but at the sametime lovely dad (Anthony Hopkins); but who clearly has a preference by one of his sons: Tristan Ludlow (Brad Pitt). The other two are very different of him. One is totally fragile, and overprotected by the family; and the other one is the old brother, who has apeaste been underestimated by all, because of Tristan. These three lives will be radically modified with the arrival of a woman that will stay with one of them, will be loved by other, and will fall in love by Tristan!

It is also LONG at 2 hours, so if you can't take anything over 1.5 hours, stay away again. This story deals with mental illness of various kinds, so some things won't be entirely rational here and you meet some dysfunction in this movie. If you can handle those things, there's a great chance you will really enjoy it! It has aspects of a romance story, action movie, family saga, war movie, period piece, and western--how's that for a little something for everyone? The problem is that for people who are very into one of those genres it can't be all that expect, but Zwick surely did try! I have some minor gripes about the cuts & directing of certain scenes and how this affects the storyline (the reason I knock off a star)--which you should see is very complicated/convoluted if you read the spoiler reviews! The loudness of the soundtrack in some places made it difficult to catch all the dialog.Although not a ""feel good"" movie, I thought it had many important messages and gave some food for thought. I also applaud the work that the screenwriters did in adapting this work and in not being afraid to make some changes to make this story work on the big screen (though some fans of the book might think them unnecessary/weird). I thought they did a good job. If you have seen the trailers you might expect more violence or romantic intrigue than what this story is about--the strength of this story is the consideration of devotion, family and other kinds, and being able to come to grips with the past.",Legends of the Fall

As a viewer, I know from the beginning that Tristan's story paralleled a Greek Tragedy, and that he and Suzanna would never be together.

If 2 hours and 15 mins of swooning, overwrought melodrama with no character development is the kind of thing you like, definitely watch ""Legends of the Fall"" right away. The story centers around Brad Pitt's character, a man who ""listens to his heart"" and gallops around looking pretty, and does a bunch of free-spirited stuff. No explanation is offered for his actions, because apparently the fact that he is ""free"" and ""wild"" explains it all. That and the fact that he is really good looking, so everyone really loves and admires him even though he acts like a selfish dick constantly. Also, he has about 10 lines in the movie and 8 of them are within the last 20 mins--but he does make at least 4 grand, corny entrances and re-entrances accompanied by soaring orchestrals, a herd of galloping stallions and whooping native Americans. BARF. Speaking of horses, Julia Ormond's horse face gapes openmouthed at various male characters, as she in turns gets engaged to/has sex with/marries 3 brothers. She acts like and is treated like an object for men's adoration and nothing more. And, she cries through 3/4 of the movie. But on the positive side, ""Legends"" explores the power to heal family rifts through the killing of corrupt government agents.

Aidan Quinn was the perfect guy for the sophisticated guy and Henry Thomas has the perfect complexion for the smallest brother. Anthony Hopkins also made the perfect father figure! I absolutely love these period love stories, but people who can't stand them still seem to really like this movie because of how ell it was done.

What a wonderfully acted, directed, filmed an scored movie! Sweeping panoramas of Montana, with an equally beautiful score which could stand alone as a symphonic masterpiece. The acting, the depth of the characters, their interactions with each other, the unexpected plot twists, the majesty of realized love and the tragedy of its being just outside of one's reach, or the devastation of its loss. There is jealousy and favoritism that can erupt in and wound a family, and there is healing at its reconciliation. To reduce this film to the epitaph of ""a love story"" is a grossly misleading and undeserving characterization.

The drama is exciting but ultimately ruins the rest of the movie. Last quarter is possibly the most enjoyable part of the movie, so if you can sit through the boredom this might be a 9 for you.Sound: 7 - 7.5, perhaps the second best thing about the movie, the hints of notes for intensity, drama, happiness all on point. The soundtrack for the movie beautiful, not exactly memorable but allows the audience to remain calm until the best parts arrive.Acting: 7.5 - 8, Aidan Quinn (Alfred Ludlow), Anthony Hopkins (Col. Williams), and Gordon Tootoosis (One Stab) are possibly the only reasons why this movie has any replay-ability. Aidan without a doubt was the main character who seemed realistic, with his emotions and facial expressions pouring out like a steady stream he undoubtedly carried the movie to its final conclusion. If you saw Brad Pitt (Tristian Ludlow) and assumed that it would be a masterpiece, sorry to disappoint you his emotionless character just takes up time which could've been used in plot direction.Action: ? not really an action movie more of a drama genre, if you're into conflicts regarding families feuding and bickering over sub-trivial matters this is not bad if you can make it through the first half.Watch score: 6.8, worthwhile if you have time.",Legends of the Fall

The glimpses of the Great War and the time that followed struck me as very powerful. The movie seems to highlight the romantic angles, and I feel it took away from the power of the characters of the Col. and the narrator. Brad Pitt and Company seemed shallow.

Tristan will not be home for many years, many winters. Yet, when he comes back Susannah married a couple of years ago and his father had a stroke many years ago... but then Susannah writes him in 1921 congratulating him with the birth of his son? What? Meaning marrying and 9 months of pregnancy including etc. he was just gone 2 years maybe ? Am i missing something ? He wrote Susannah in 1918 to marry someone else? She did just that?

239,Lester07,Masterpiece description of how life happens,8,17 September 2015,"To summarize this move is one sentence: Life happens.This movie is a terrific description about how life just goes on. We fall in love, we live, people die, we make mistakes, we get closer to each other, we run away and come back. The consequences of our actions aren't always what we expect.. but they happen nonetheless.It's a story of how a simple family is torn down to pieces and it cannot be attributed to one person or one's mistake of why it happens. People die in the movie, but spirit never does. It flows through generations. It's interesting to how the calamities of war happening far far away can cause rippling affects to a family living in a quieter part of the world. This is one of the few movies I stopped rooting for a protagonist.. or searching for one, and just accepted them as they are. The characters are layered, well written and splendidly enacted.

242,emeraldkimmy,Surprisingly Great Movie,8,13 February 2014,"This is an interesting movie to talk about. Right away, it appears that the movie might have been seen as merely a Brad Pitt vehicle and it's easy to understand why. Pitt plays Tristan Ludlow, the incredibly sexy and appropriately troubled son of Colonel William Ludlow, played incredibly brilliantly by Sir Anthony Hopkins. While the Colonel's oldest and youngest sons, Alfred (Aidan Quinn) and Samuel (Henry Thomas), have ambitions to become great men like their father, they do not share Tristan's indecision as to whether or not they even deserve to be alive let alone happy.Tristan Ludlow is one of those characters you just know is a good boy, really; he is just a bit distracted by some gloriously bad behavior. At first, this doesn't really seem to hurt anybody. But like anything else that moves the film dangerously close to being formula, a beautiful woman comes along. She is Susannah, fiancé to young Samuel, and, as the story moves along, lover to Tristan and finally, wife to Alfred. On the face, this situation looks bad, especially if we judge it by today's standards. The story, however, is set in the early 20th century and opens on the eve of World War I, which makes Susannah's options drastically limited after Tristan abruptly breaks their engagement after they'd already been lovers. In this way, Susannah was likely to have been left no choice but to marry Alfred since she was not married to either Samuel, with whom it was never made clear if they did as intended, which was not to wait until marriage to have sex, or Tristan, whom she clearly did have sex with when they were not married. Either way, Susannah's situation would have been quite bad but it did reveal a trait of Alfred Ludlow: he loved her regardless of her previous engagement to Tristan.Throughout the movie, there are examples of formula at work, not the least of which was Tristan's return amid a bunch of wild horses complete with scoring. And yet, the score itself is one of the most beautiful things about this movie. James Horner's score, done before Titanic, is nothing short of breathtaking. Just listening to the soundtrack album reminds you of how the film takes us to some of the lighter, more tender moments of the Ludlows' lives just before it takes us into the darker sides that are as full of realistic heartache as they are good old fashioned Hollywood drama. Except this film makes that old fashioned drama more realistic in terms of the feel and tone and the way it still reminds us that even this can happen in real life.The movie, released in 1995, was based upon the novella of the same name by Jim Harrison, first published in 1979. While no adaptation is completely true to the book, there are still some significant departures from the book that the movie took (i.e. Tristan and Susannah were indeed married in the novella but divorced), but it still worked. It's hard to explain in only a few sentences how the movie managed to work despite some differences from the novella, but it did. One of the film's most stunning features was the cinematography. There just aren't a lot of films with cinematography as breathtaking as it is in this movie. Considering the budget limitations for location that even moved the production from Montana to Canada and the unpredictable weather during filming, among other things, this is a fantastic accomplishment, to say the least.Everyone in the cast gave a performance that made you forget you were watching Sir Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt, Aidan Quinn, Julia Ormond, and the rest of the cast. You were watching the Ludlows. The argument that this movie, like other formula, does little else except make the toes of the female audience curl for Brad Pitt falls short, as Pitt can never be accused of being cast merely as eye candy meant to sell an otherwise mediocre film. He was eye candy alright but he also played Tristan Ludlow so believably that I doubt there were or are very many other actors who could have done as fine a job. This movie should be considered a classic before too much longer--or just right now.",Legends of the Fall

244,martoskirov,Waaaaay overrated!!!,3,9 August 2012,"ATTENTION: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! This is one of those movies that aim at a specific target audience. Only women really love this movie because it's about love and tragedy and what not. But seriously this movie is completely pointless. I mean half of the characters die for no apparent reason. The problems that the characters have they themselves create. And the thing that I hated about this movie is that I predicted more than half of the events in it. The moment the three brothers went to war I knew that the youngest would get killed. OK that wasn't too hard to guess. But it wasn't just that. When Tristan left and Susannah told him she'd wait for him forever I just knew that she'd wait like a year tops and then run after Alfred. I predicted that Tristan would marry the young Indian girl, I predicted that she'd get killed. But when it came to the final scene where the Mafia and the Sheriff came to kill Tristan and when after two of the guys were shot and a bullet flew in out of nowhere and shot the Sheriff I was like ""ok, if this is Alfred that shot that last one then this is definitely the lamest movie I've ever seen"". And what do you know, it was Alfred. But I still give this movie a 3 instead of a 1 because I can't say that it was completely uninteresting. There were some exciting moments however there were very few of them. And the only reason that this movie has such a high rating is because chicks are suckers for this kind of movies.",Legends of the Fall

246,stelmarta-1,exit pursued by a bear,6,24 April 2005,"This is the story, told by voice-over by an old, wise Native American, of a family of three sons whose lives really suck. Anthony Hopkins is the old army captain who brought his family into the frontier to protect them from the corruption of the outside world. So his sons, Alfred (Aiden Quinn) the serious one, Tristan (Brad Pitt) the virile one, and Samuel (Henry Thomas) the nice one, grow up in a wild and beautiful country full of critters and lacking in womenfolk. So when Samuel's fiancée Susanna (Ormond) shows up, she causes quite a stir, and this is the beginning of the story. War, peace, marriage, big game hunting, nude scenes, death and bears ensue -- though not necessarily in that order.The story spans a period from roughly 1914 to the mid 20s, so it's a long movie. As a mini-family saga we get to know the characters very well, but as a series of unfortunate events I found myself getting a little bored at times. None of the actors (at least of the ones I'm familiar with) gave the best performance of their careers, but there's really nothing to complain about. A young Brad Pitt, looking like he stepped off the cover of a Harlequin novel provides plenty of eye candy, as does Julia Ormond and the beautiful, beautiful Montana scenery. It is well-filmed, with great sets and costumes, and the score is unremarkable, but not bad. It is very gory, and contains nudity (mostly Brad Pitt -- not that I'm complaining) and a bit of cussin'.It's less substantial that it thinks it is, and it's essential to keep this in mind when watching it.

249,Atte_Peltonen,My take on the well recognized drama of Legends of the Fall,4,1 February 2014,"I suppose this film has a reputation of being recognized as a sort of a classic in some views, to which respects I'm trying to explain my differing take emphasizing on why I only rank it a hair above average, at best. Although I find myself seeing this film only until now I have had the score over decade, as it was too, reputed. I wished a lot of things from this movie, yet it falls evenly short from its aim on a wide front. The story is to tell of the life and events centered on a family of men destined for great things and rich life. Yet the red line and meaning of all of this is missing and viewer is kept unmotivated and unengaged. There's nothing wrong with the performances of the cast, but there is also nothing great with them in ways it would raise the film to higher category on its own. The score is supposed to elevate the film and act as a coloring paint brush for the intermittently beautiful scenic photography and strong moments, yet it is thoroughly uncreative and uninspiring and I have always thought it is much overrated, as an attempt at sentimentality is not a redeeming quality on its own. In my opinion the relatively short ending moments are where the movie is at it's best.",Legends of the Fall

How did it go so wrong!? it was like it was written by a 5 year old, predictable, flat, uninspiring, went nowhere!

255,Mastermind303,One of the most spritual experiences of my life,10,12 February 1999,"When I first heard of Legends of the Fall I could not wait to see it. I don´t know why but I felt I had waited to see it for a long time, even though I had only seen the trailer once. I literally counted the days and hours to its release and I was there the day it opened. And it was indeed one of the most spiritual experiences of my life. Only five minitues into the film I could hear myself think ""This is absolutely the best film I have ever seen"". It was so intelligently made that I could hardly believe what I was seeing.The way that it opened, presenting Brad Pitt´s character Tristan with such honesty from the first monent and never throughout the film letting go of the characters tremendous integrity, making every word he says come from the exact same individual. No other film has such a graceful and grandiose opening.This is by far Brad Pitt´s best perfomance ever to come, the guy should retire now because his purpose as an actor is with this film attained. I can not understand how a film can be so well made, everything in this film so perfect, the storytelling, the dialog, the acting, the music and the direction is so well done and so thought through, that along with the deep messages and the morale of the film, you could write an entire bible in filmmaking.This film containes so many messages and has so much to say that one can not take it all in by seeing the film only once. And it is funny how, even though I change and grow older, the film always has new things to tell me every time I see it. There is nothing you could want or expect from a film or story that is not found here. This film has so much to say about life, destiny and the choices we make and the consequences they bring us to. And the monologue of the Indian is so beautiful and so true, I get shivers down my spine only thinking of them.The film takes us through one individual's life, his effect on his fellows, his wins, his losses, his happiness and sadness. And when the film is over hopefully we have learned to recognize that integrity is the key to a life well lived. That it is only through truth and honesty, to oneself and others, that happiness can be attained, and the simple fact that if this fundamental law of nature is not followed, we will fall...""Legends of the Fall"", in this case does not necessarely mean autumn. It is just one of the many metaphors in the Indian's way of speech. There is not any special scene in the film that is better than another, it is the experience combined that makes it into the most well made film of all time. True spiritual aspiration is the only thing that can result in pure art like this film.",Legends of the Fall

When the movie reaches Samuel's death, you will totally be in tears, crying your heart out asking God ""Why did you let that happen?""...Brad plays an exceptional Tristan Ludlow as he goes from ""man"" to ""bear"" throughout the movie.

I literally find myself transported back to the early 1900's to that ranch in Montana. There has never been a movie that has taken my breath away like this one. When I watch it I have to set the mod and sit alone quietly in a dark room with only the image on my TV screen. I will not be interrupted or disturbed. I absolutely fell in love with Julia Ormond and have a little boy crush on her. She is so beautiful and has so much class, and for a British actress she hides her accents well. I am an avid fan of all James Horners movie soundtracks and this is the best.When I first bought this movie it was on VHS tape, I later bought another copy on DVD.Others can have Casablanca, Citizen Kane or Gone With The Wind, all fine films on my favorites list ... but I'll take Legends of the Fall as the most touching , emotionally moving film of all time for Me. Can't wait to view it again and transport my mind back 100 years to a peaceful place. I feel that the movie was real, and really happened. Loved it T. B. Roochester NY",Legends of the Fall

The cinematography is truly the best part about this movie, even though it relies on Brad Pitt who, with a face so perfectly symmetrical it's hypnotizing and a jaw so sharp it could cut through steel, doesn't even have to put on a good acting performance to draw you in.I honestly I don't understand the appeal of Tristan's character though... besides the fact that he's played by a living and breathing sex god. And literally the character development of Susannah is so unbelievably dull and non existent that it's almost pathetic. The whole movie revolves around her and all three of the boys falling in love with her... for no other clear reason besides her pretty face and the fact that she is the only women within miles on the ranch apparently. And the other two poor brothers... Samuel was a poor pathetic sap that was, as predicted, killed off immediately... and Alfred, well--they tried to make him into villain of sorts even though it was unclear why this was even the case.While it is depressing for its mediocrity, it's also depressing for its plot and series of truly unfortunate events... so for that reason it is a movie worth watching in my opinion.

Set in a majestic and mystical (mystical thanks to the noble and mysterious Native American narrating the movie and living with the family) rural Montana in the early 20th century.  The landscapes are breathtaking The family endures all, and  tests its ties through death, life, love and hate. I disagree with other reviews that label this as overdone or poorly acted, some reviews posted here are so misplaced I wonder if they actually saw the movie or guessed after catching glimpses from a friends rental or description.  The family is not a bunch of losers, ultimately, they win much more than most. To those unaware or missing the point of the movie: it is about the endurance of family, regardless of circumstances.

Julia Ormond manages to tug on the heart strings and Brad Pitt gives a great performance. Anthony Hopkins again provides a flawless performance............absolute quality acting....say no more.

Although it only won an Academy Award for Best Cinematography, it is deserving of many more awards. You can easily see how it would win for the camera work. The landscapes throughout the movie are breathtaking filmed primarily in the Rocky Mountain foothills west of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. While Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt show phenomenal acting skills the same can be said of every single cast member. The emotion Pitt portrays throughout the story, through his character of Tristan, is amazing. Since Johnny Depp was originally offered that role, and turned it down, it is hard to imagine that Depp could have done a better job.

264,jwick76,Great movie to watch over and over again.,10,25 October 2002,"This is one of those rare epic sagas that you can watch over and over again. The soundtrack alone is enough to move you.  I'm a James Horner fan, and I would have to say that this is one of his best works.The movie plays off each character brilliantly, and touches on a myriad of emotions in the process.  For anyone who's nostalgic about this era (early 1900s), loves the Montana scenery (get this on DVD and watch it on the big screen for full appreciation), or just wants to watch a tale of how blood really is thicker than water...this is your movie.I watched this as soon as it hit the theaters, before Brad Pitt was even a name.  The trailer they show on this site is after he became a heart throb...and it's a shame that the only movie posters that are easily found for this movie are his sexy poses.  You really don't get the feel that the movie pays undo attention to his character, as they develop the other characters just as well.  Anthony Hopkins and Aidan Quinn really shine in their performances.This movie won't expand your mind, but it will strum your emotional strings at just the right pace and intensity.I agree with the previous comments about this movie being in the top 200 of all time, with the only reservation being the ending.  If you want to fully experience the movie the way it should have been done, you should turn it off after One Stab performs his series of scalpings.  I will say no more.
The only other movie I can think of that would touch a similar thread of family tragedy would be Jack the Bear, directed by and starring Danny DeVito.  I will warn you though, that you should not watch that movie unless you really want to wallow in sadness and depression...and feel the satisfaction of triumph through perseverence.",Legends of the Fall

In human-relationship dramas, not so much.Writers Shilliday and Witliff create Susanna (Ormond) as a human MacGuffin. She is beautiful; end of story. No back story, no motivations, no personality, nothing.The fact that a cardboard cutout could alter the courses of their lives made me lose interest in the characters of the three brothers, and when Susanna was finally removed from the story line, I was still wondering whether the audience was supposed to care.20% visual delight; 80% irritating script.",Legends of the Fall

For the curious, those incredible mountain vistas and Ludlow ranch were all shot in the Canadian Rocky Mountains half an hour west of Calgary, Alberta.  Other recent movies movies shot in the vicinity were Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, and Jackie Chan's Shanghai Noon.The film takes you through a series of emotional ups and downs as members of the Ludlow clan and their loved ones deal with their demons and die tragic, almost Shakespearean deaths in several cases.  To many viewers, this qualifies it as a bad film.  Well guess what?  Life is like that in many cases, and I, for one, thoroughly enjoyed the fact this film wasn't a lame, saccharin, feel good excuse of a movie.  The real majesty of this film is that it shows the reality of life.  It isn't easy and it isn't fair.  You have to deal with it with dignity and move on.  That's what I liked about the film, and viewed to be a nice change from the typical drivel that plays in theaters.  That, and the incredibly beautiful Canadian scenery.",Legends of the Fall

I honestly can't believe this movie was not nominated for about 8 or 10 Academy awards.  It also baffles me that some people think this was Anthony Hopkins worst portrayal. He was absolutely brilliant in this, as was Brad Pitt. THIS was the movie that made me take a look at Pitt and see that he's more than just a pretty face. After watching this, he became, and is still to this day, my favorite actor.  In this movie he was rustic, yet thoughtful.  He was strong and vulnerable.  He had a great love for family(especially his father) and for a woman he knew should not be his. This film a true epic with history, talent, superior cinematography,  and most of all(and what many movies of today lack)..  closure.

Although the movie itself starts quite promising, it declines quite soon and becomes tedious and silly. And when Hopkins started putting on his funny face, I did burst into laughter, much to the annoyance of my closest neighbours in the movie theater, but I really couldn't help myself :) This movie takes itself way too serious and the storyline becomes more and more ludicrous towards the ending. At least for me, it was a huge disappointment. There are far better epic movies out there than this one.

The woman replies that what he just said was the film he pretends to be his favorite film. In reality some other crappy film is the all time ""fave""! Which is so true!

Another thing is the acting, there are some wonderful bits and pieces in this film that I can just watch over and over again. (Can, and have) For instance, Susannah's laugh when she explains how she packed so carefully she couldn't find anything. - What a genuine little laughter! How about the scene where Albert confronts Tristan about sleeping with S. -FANTASTIC! Tristan crying by Samuel's grave, Tristan crying and exclaiming: I'm happy too! - Moving.

This movie is one that expresses the fall of man at its best, and it does so with a good story line and a well drawn out plot. The actors did a fine job, especially Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt. The actors worked well together. I recommend Legends of the Fall to those who enjoy a good romance or a good western. It would also be a good movie for anyone who appreciates fine acting and an all around good story line. I can't compare this movie to any other. I can, therefore, say that it is pretty unique. I think it is some of Pitt's finest work as an actor. This movie is right up there with classics such as Dances with Wolves and the more modern Open Range.

Both Julia Ormond and Brad Pitt performed excellently in this movie and every other major performers are good because after watching it, you still want still savor and contemplate story. I believe this movie is far under rated and it surely deserves an 8.0.

I do not know why this movie was not nominated more than it was because it ranks up there to me as one of the best movies of all time. Yes, that's right.

I remember watching it time after time when it first came out and yesterday was the first time in eight years I have seen it and HOLY COW!!!it was sad!!!!! Usually when I finish a movie, I am talking about it with friends, but with this all I could do is think about how depressing it was. It seems that Tristan didn't have anything good happen to him and if something good happened to him, it never lasted long. Does anyone actually have luck this bad? I haven't met anyone I can't name one happy scene in the whole movie.

It's a poorly written romance novel that is completely unbelievable.  I kept waiting for the cheese to end and the drama to begin...It never happened.  It's painfully implausible and no character makes sense.  I can't imagine why I'm supposed to like a story about inane, back-stabbing people who don't have an honest word in their body.  The dialogue is pure cliche (see the quotes).If your wife is a big Brad Pitt fan, you may be forced to endure this tripe.

298,juliank-2,unjustly criticized,9,21 October 2000,"After reading the comments on this message board, I feel reminded as to how jaded some viewers are.  'Legends of the Fall' is a great, moving film.  In case you're wondering whether I am just someone who loves this type of film, in fact, I hate overly sentimental films.  In my book, for a film to be considered overly sentimental, the emotions usually feel manipulative and calculated, which in 'Legends' is not the case.  Movies such as 'Forrest Gump,' Saving Private Ryan,' or 'The Green Mile' all fit this category.  These are the types of films that usually answer all questions one could possibly ask about the character's intentions and emotional conclusions, which 'legends' most certainly doesn't do.  For all of the people who laughed throughout this film, my guess is that you probably either went in wanting to hate the movie, or you just weren't paying attention to it.  The performances are very subtle.  The film does not rely on long explanatory speaches (leave those for Spielberg) to show the characters emotional developments, but on quiet, honest portrayals of very realistic characters.  None of the characters are saints and none are devils (once again, you can leave that to the Spielberg school of film), they are flawed, and make difficult, realistic decisions.  The story is about characters who hold in their emotions, which drives the characters into their own tragedies that moves along the dark, and very, very engaging story .  The film is a sweeping epic, with epic music, and all the other attributes that could bring people to criticize it for being overblown, but it is an epic story, so why the (curse word) not?  The acting is great, the story is moving and engaging and the charaters are well-thought, complex, interesting, and most of all, very human (just watch how Aidan Quine makes the character that could have easily been the stereotypical enemy/anti-hero into one of the more moving, relatable characters in the movie).  I found the relationships between the brothers and with the father to be quite beautiful, realistic and moving, and the real underlying theme of the movie (not Julia Ormond's character). On top of all this, it has some of then best photography seen in  the last twenty years.  Yes, the movie does ride the line between melodrama and somber epic in a few scenes, but I never felt it slip into that trap. In fact, because of that, I found the film extremely clever and brave. I am disheartened that the deafening cynicism that is moving through America has found its way onto this board and is unjustly criticizing a very good film.  Just watch it again with a closer eye, and maybe (probably not) you'll see what I am talking about.  Thanks for reading.",Legends of the Fall

300,ryanocerous612,"Director Edward Zwick and screenwriter Susan Shilliday struggle to interpret Jim Harrison's tale of brotherhood, passion, and wanderlust.",1,25 April 2006,"In typical Hollywood fashion, this film appropriates the basic premise and cast of characters from an outstanding piece of literature, then twists and mangles it into something so far removed from the sensibilities of the original work so as to be nearly unrecognizable. Jim Harrison's lush, flawed characters are turned into primitive movie archetypes and the complexity of the story dumbed-down so heavily that it may as well have been a made-for- television film. More an excuse to show Brad Pitt's glowing mane bouncing behind him as he rides horseback than a challenging exploration of the instincts and motivations of men, this piece of ready-made blockbuster tripe falls flat on its face as it follows Harrison's trail of machismo and consequence, then abandons Harrison completely to follow the well-traveled path of generic melodrama and safe predictability. Unlike it's parent-work, this film feels not like the product of a woodsy American man challenged and inspired by masculine impulse and the weight of history, but rather a soft California milksop longing to identify with the cavemen and cowboys of his dreams.",Legends of the Fall

At times, fine; let the music 'take the lead' for five seconds or so, but for extended periods the soundtrack seemed way loud, way 'front and center,' when it should have remained in the background.Anyway, I liked the movie so much, I'd like to know what style of hat Anthony Hopkins (Col Ludlow) wore, particularly in the scene where they welcome Julia Ormand (Susannah) to the ranch.",Legends of the Fall

It shows that families can stick together and that you can really only love one person truly in your heart when it comes to a man and a woman. It is just the all time favorite movie of the century, no of ALL times.Would love to have lots of pictures of the farm and inside the farm houses.

309,gcjrandall,Why was this film so underrated?,9,3 September 2007,"It's the wee hours of the morning on Labor Day 2007. I've just finished watching Legends on Showtime. I was riveted once again, and completely blown away at how well written, shot, directed, acted and scored the entire film is. The fact that it was so overlooked at Oscar time the next year astounds. (Kudos however to John Toll and his Oscar for breathtaking Cinematography.) Wake up Hollywood, and start voting on quality vs. the influence of the studio marketing machines. I lived in LA for 12 years and spent most of those years in the entertainment industry, working for 2 of the major studios. No longer there, I no longer care as much but continue to be disappointed at the dearth of quality films coming out of the studios.Have we run out of good writers and directors? Or is it studio senior management that is to blame? It's the latter I believe. I can only continue to voice my dissatisfaction by refusing to shell out $10 for mediocre entertainment.I salute Edward Zwick, and everyone connected with this film for producing one of the finest films of the 90s, and arguably one of the best films ever made. (Perhaps this film was too ""hot on the heels"" of Dances with Wolves.)",Legends of the Fall

311,chaviaral,A war between love and rage,8,16 May 2021,"I have enjoyed watching the film a number of times during several periods of my life and, as time goes by, I believe that it is gaining the general recognition it deserves! This is an epic drama about people dealing with personal demons within an amazing western scenery at the beginning of the 20th century in Western America. Everyone, including the father, the 3 sons and the ""girl"" is trying to heal the wounds inside. Tristan, the protagonist, is a wild spirit playing with fire, unable to form attachments for long. There is a constant battle going on inside him (between life and death, love and rage, passion and ethics, the visible and the invisible) affecting everyone around him. I would like to emphasize a point that I haven't read in other reviews: the boys' mother, even though hardly appearing on screen, has a key-role in the story: she practically abandons her husband and three sons, staying detached all the way, not even coming back for some major family events (funerals-weddings-births)! Such an abandonment causes tremendous emotional pain, relationship issues and deep trauma to everyone. The brothers are antagonistic, trying desperately to find their place in the world and prove their worth, one way or another: fighting at the war, excelling in politics, winning a woman's love and more! Tristan's magnetism seems to be so great that everyone (including us, watching) is willing to accept almost anything from him. He's something like a Sun for the women who loved him - they couldn't take their eyes off him, and we all know what happens when you stare at the sun... Does love conquer all? Sometimes yes, sometimes no... The movie is at times becoming overly dramatic, but I love it whatsoever. In my humble opinion, this is not a superficial soap opera - if you can read between the lines, there is a great analysis that can be done... Acting and cinematography are superb!",Legends of the Fall

A decorated Colonel in the U.S. army(Anthony Hopkins), appalled by the atrocious acts of the US government towards American Indians around the turn of the century, resigns from the army to live in the plains of Montana. There he creates a prosperous life for himself and three sons, untill the youngest son returns from his schooling with a beautiful woman (Julia Ormond)who he wishes to marry. Fueled by the boys' competitive nature, the fire of love and betrayal takes its toll on the otherwise thriving family. Riveting performances from ALL of the cast members help to make this one of the only true epic's of the modern era.Academy Award winning Cinematographer John Toll exhibits his best work to date.

A music of all times by James Horner and classical acting by all the stars made this movie an epic surprise that you will never forget for the rest of your life.

It has complexity, drama and warmth of feeling as well as the pathos. The breathtaking scenery be it Montana or Canada is stunning. As a family history it leaves something to be desired (not the happily ever after scenario.) Integrity between the Indian and the white is warming. It almost seems as if the only people that cannot live in harmony are the ""white folks"" caught up in prohibition and all that meant. The destruction and resurrection of the family is spellbinding. If there was one scene that stands out as I see the film for the second time, it would have to be the Brad Pitt scene when in the battlefields he knows his brother is at risk, flying headlong into battle to save him, only to arrive too late.

I guess you can't go wrong with a great script and a combination of an elite cast like this movie had. Julia Ormond was also very good.I do think that this was one of Brad Pitt's best performances, he became the character of Tristen. He brought that guy to life. I don't think anyone could have played that role any better.Great movie that anyone will enjoy. If you don't like this movie, you are probably not that intelligent.",Legends of the Fall
319,poor-uncle-rich,The whole package - what movies should be.,10,22 January 2008,"This is easily one of my top ten favorite films of all time. I loved it in 1994 and I loved it more last weekend when I caught it on cable.I am someone who thinks most 120 minute movies are too long, but Legends of the Fall could easily add another hour to the 133 minute running time and I would watch it again and again. I feel there is still so much more to be written about these characters.Mostly love story, a little bit Western, a little bit War, Legends of the Fall is an epic in the truest sense of the word. This is probably the vehicle in which Brad Pitt delivers finest work. (Written for Tom Cruise?? What a catastrophe that would have been!!) Pitt delivers a range of different motions not only convincingly but authentically.However, the best performance of the cast might have to be Julia Ormand. (Where has she gone?) She was a perfect choice. Every emotion plays just below the surface of her skin and eyes. Her first appearance in the film leaves the other characters spellbound, and it strikes me the same way every time I see it. Critics raved about her work in this film in 1994, and she followed it up with a couple other starring turns, but still deserves more attention than she has gained so far.The cinematography is amazing too. Whether the camera is aimed at the glorious mountains, a sun dappled landscape, Brad Pitt in clothes or out, or the gentle beauty of the lovely Julia Ormand, your eyes drink eagerly from scene after scene.The romantic, the adventurer, the historian, and the sentimental viewer will walk away from this film craving for at least a second to live one of the lives so beautifully crafted on film here.",Legends of the Fall
320,adam_clone,"Though you'd expect better from the start cast, I wasn't entirely convinced",5,17 February 2013,"There's a lot about this movie, that obviously would get you involved, especially, if you're a woman. I wouldn't argue about this movie with a woman, that is for granted.But if you really open your eyes, the central plot is about a selfish guy who doesn't care enough about his father (and the younger brother whom the movie claims he loves more than his life), and others who have been around him all his life. And about a Susannah, who just can't seem to ""get enough"", if you know what I mean, even after she's long married to the elder brother.While I've loved almost all of the drama movies out there that are rated good by the average IMDb user, I felt this one was a rotten apple. Most of what the movie highlights as subtle emotions felt cheap to me, as Tristian's selfishness for one, and Susannah's questionable frailty in moral character, for another. While a movie doesn't have to be true to socially/morally accepted values, I felt that the movie was trying to portray the ugly sides of these two characters in good light, which is where it failed for me, or rather should I say, irritating. It was like ""these two need a good lesson of the whip"".And yes, the war scenes left a lot to beg for.",Legends of the Fall

And I'm not just saying that because I'm a girl who likes Brad Pitt or something. I'm a dude who's mostly into De Niro and Pacino films. The way the bonds of family are portrayed in this film is more than enough reason to watch it. And not just that, but this film is great all around - good supporting cast, soundtrack, etc.. Brad Pitt as Tristan is freakin' killer - one of his greatest and most memorable characters. I think this is one of the most under-rated movies scored on IMDb. Don't be misled by the 7.1 rating - this movie is much better than that. (Then again, ""Heat"" only got an 8.3 rating and is currently just ranked at #133 on IMDb.

These ideals are what made America great...anything else is merely a compromise in a man's values. The Ludlows, in 1900's Montana, epitomize the struggles of a once innocent nation. The sibling rivalry over attention and love are timeless...as well as the ultimate sacrifices made, and the bonds between those that survive! Without giving anything away, it was truly a ""Good Death"", and encompasses man's willingness to succumb to what is God's Law...not Man's Law! In this movie, Brad Pitt proved that he was not just a ""pretty face"" in Hollywood. Combined with Anthony Hopkin's awesome acting, and Julia Ormond's beautiful presence and capability, this movie should be considered a benchmark for both dramatic and historic portrayal!

When the war breaks out is definitely a great part of the film but it is hard to choose the best moment of a film that is full of great scenes. When I watched this film it threw me I didn't know how to feel, I was smiling at how great this film was and didn't know whether to be upset at certain moments because the emotion in the film was so real.I definitely recommend this film to anyone no matter what your preferences this is a truly marvelous film.",Legends of the Fall

In 1994, there were many good movies, but in my opinion, I would like to say this movie is the best.This is the second time to see this movie, because I learned some frontier culture about the USA, first time I saw this movie, I just feel this is a very heart-quake film, it is a legend, but after i saw this film, I wanted to cry, it touched my heart deeply. this time i saw Legends of The Fall, I paid more attention on the detail of the hero, just because I learned some feature about the American hero, such as they always take a hat, ride a house, take a gun on the waist, also , they always narrowed their eyes, and alone. they never need help, and less emotion. they do not have stationary family, and always break girls' heart, because they never stop traveling. In this movie, Tristan matches all of the characteristics that I imagined. His father was a retired soldier, and was weary of the war, so his father took his whole family moved to the west. but his mother could not endure the lure from the city, and left them back to the city. Tristan has two brothers, the old brother called Alfred, the younger brother called Samuel. they lived very happy, until the younger brother Samuel graduated from university and bring his finacee Susannah back to home, it brake the balance, the old brother loved Susannah, but Susannah hidden loved Tristan. at the same time, the world war 1 started, so, the three brother join the army and went to the battlefield, but the younger brother died, Tristan felt very sorrowful and he did not know how to face his family, so, he began on the tramp. he experienced many hardships, and finally he became a real man, a hero. he back to his home, married and had a baby, he tried to have a normal life, but his wife was killed, so he strayed again.He is a legend, he likes freedom, no one can catch him. in this film, I feel that he is a hero, but he also is a man, he can kill many enemies, but he can not protect his family. in the end of this film, it said that no one know when he died, just some said he was died in a battle with a bear. finally he became a legend.",Legends of the Fall
331,snower_27,love and death,10,28 November 2011,"The film has two very famous actors, cheesy Pitt and sophisticated Anthony Hopkins. Brad Pitt, who has set a case for himself that will last forever. After the watching the movie, my first thought was: she is in love with a legend! Who fell in love with a legend, Susannah fell in love with a legend, legend is who, the legend is Tristan. I can only use this sentence to explain the love between them.It is her destiny because Susannah in love with Tristan, loving a person when suffering in the situation of cannot have, when she found out that she can never get Tristan, she chose to end her life. The entire movie was telling from a Indians perspective, it's a kind of special technique.what more important is the whole piece of displaying the beautiful landscape of western United States. Samuel,the youngest brother in the movie, there is not too much description of him, but I pay special attention to this role, someone said it is sad when Tristan was crying in front of Samuel's grave, but I think the whole aspect of Samuel broke people's heart. He is pure, integrity, impulse and enthusiastic. Tristan had a chance to kill the raccoon, but he gave up, and I'm not sure the reasons why he gave up , but I believe it reminded him of the Samuel's cry for help, such as the Indians said, it is the roar of black bear in his heart, and he can't let it go, as Samuel's death had been his pain. James Horner has a great contribution to the entire movie, his tone very ancient bleak made by Japan, deep congruence tunneling, plays a great role on shaping the image of Tristan who sometimes wild unruly, sometimes erratic, sometimes Shouting wailed, sometimes thoughtfully whispers. At that moment, my heart has really been burning up. It is unforgettable that Brad Pitt is mad wild and Susannah's emotional profit, even the Japanese bleak.",Legends of the Fall

That was one of the better choices we've made in a long time! Julia Ormond was superb, and Brad Pitt was superb. Anthony Hopkins was his usual brilliant self. Some elements were a little more than we needed, but it was offset by brilliant acting, that really got to the heart. Since all emotions center in the heart, that is what acting should be about, and this one hit the nail right on the head.

334,don_mystique,Brilliant,10,5 February 2004,"This movie serves its purpose. If you don't like dramas don't expect to like it.Rather watch Van Damme or Dudikoff movies. As simple as it gets. I was amazed how such a story could be told in less then 2 hours. I've seen this movie for 5 times so far and everytime I discover something new and everytime it will touch your heart again because its a story of life, in its full joy and its sadness. There is a whole untold story beneath the script. After this movie I started thinking about my life in a different way. How Fragile it is, how time is waiting no one and how things can twist overnight...this is one of my favourite movies of all time (next to the Godfather 1 and 2). p.s. the soundtrack is wonderful while scenery is stunning.",Legends of the Fall
335,caesarganz,Legends of the Fall,8,31 August 2006,"I have read most of the comments and agree with almost all of them. What surprises me is that no one has mentioned the POSSIBLE symbolism of Brad Pitt's character's name, Tristan. The Tristan of Tristan and Isolde is sent to accompany the betrothed fiancée of the king to his homeland. On the way, they fall MADLY in love (ass'td by a love potion). So you have in both stories the idea of the betrayal of friendship, the inability of one lover to exist without the other, and the destruction of a solid relationship which accompanies the tragedy. Another classic reference could be to Gwenevere of the Camelot tale. Again, betrayal of friendship, of loyalty, and again, destruction of a heretofore ""indestructible"" relationship. The old Indian says, ""She was like the ice that split the rock"" (approximate)Gwenevere, Isolde and Susanna, all ""split the rock."" For those of you who found the three brothers in the same unit unbelievable (includ Roger Ebert) I suggest you get out of your little minded parochial playpens. ""Pal's Brigades"" in WW I were most common, where British soldiers came from the same towns and cities and where brothers fought side by side. It was one of the great tragedies of that war in that entire towns were decimated of their young men. There was something similar in the Amer Civil War. So you'll have to figure out another reason why you hated the film. Stick to Brad Pitt's long hair.You all sound ridiculous.",Legends of the Fall
336,stefan_ferreira,Overrated melodrama,2,17 May 2004,"This is Hollywood melodrama at its worst. An endless saga wherein the viewer is left with no escape but the vain wish that the last tedious family member will finally die so that escape may be found to the nearest pub! This tale teaches us very little about the human condition, does not inspire great acting and leaves us desperately urging the slow-moving plot to its unremarkable conclusion. Brad Pit looks fantastic and there's some nice cinematography, but certainly nothing else to get excited about. The biggest disappointment is the fact that Anthony Hopkins' talents are wasted in such a comical piece of overacting.",Legends of the Fall
337,ep007f6071,My favourite scenes,10,19 May 2004,"Spoiler I think the most touching scenes are; the scene where Tristan is sat by Samuels grave crying and Sussanah comforts him(this scene had me in tears). He says ""i couldn't save him"" and i think that is when we can first start to understand the guilt he feels about Samuels death. Another scene i think is brilliant is when Tristan leaves his home and Susannah and he can't bring himself to look at her. She then asks him to look at her and says ""I'll wait for you, no matter how long it takes. I'll wait for you forever."" I think when she tells him that she truly means it and she would have waited for him if it had not been for the note. I think the only reason she really married Alfred is because she believes that Tristan would not be coming back. But he does. When he comes back and finds out she has married Alfred i think he expected it but was really still clinging to the hope that she may have waited for him. I believe he did truly love her. He goes to see her and when their eyes meet again the actors show extremely well the love that is still there between them. The first thing Susannah says is ""Forever turned out to be too long Tristan."" I think this is very touching and once again it had me in tears.A brilliant film that I will continue to watch again and again.",Legends of the Fall
338,find_rich,Great!,10,12 October 2012,"I love the fact that because they lived with an American Indian they lived forever. The whole film seems really spiritual. Hopkins, by my calculations, is about 250yo. Although he does actually grow old. The others though, don't Other than a bit of hair growth. Saying all that. I love that bear. He's brilliant, a real talent. Old timers are hilarious in this. Especially the bear. Where did you get him from? I can't believe I have never seen him before. He must come from a really good drama school in either London or New York. Anyway, highly recommend 10/10. One of the best bear films I have seen. And, mind you, I have seen a few.

Only one thing's remain,Pray for it to happens at the expected moment.Tristan's alright infacts all of them,but they're suppose to know that strange woman as beautiful as that, she's wild to love,I'm saying we shouldn't love beautiful women but when everybody's eyes is on her she's the most wild.through kindness of col. ludlaw he ask her to stay only if he's known that the strongest bond can be broken by woman, he'd have let her go....so nobody's right........EVEN THE MOST LOVING FATHER",Legends of the Fall

I can believe until now that Brad pitt was just acting in that film.

341,dlblattenberger,Every son and father should watch this,10,18 July 2005,"Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt are perfectly cast for these roles as Colonel Ludlow and his beloved son Tristan. The story is told in third person, which allows for reflection on the impact the Ludlow lives has on others, especially when the lovely Suzanne (Julia Ormand) enters the family. Tristan's life is best described in stages when he is either a bear or a bear in hibernation. The analogy stems from a childhood encounter with a bear as they mutually shared spilt blood.The score and cinematography are the best the year has to offer...and will truly join the ranks of classic films that you'll want to share with family for many generations to come.",Legends of the Fall

Its about love, loyalty, family and in a way that it is not predictable or cheesy. The score of the movie tells a story all by itself, its wonderful.The performances in this movie are incredible. I think this is one of Pitt's best performances. Its the first time I've watched a movie and completely fell in love with a character and not the actor playing it. You completely forget that these people are just characters in a movie. Every single performance is convincing and absolutely heart-filled. Tristan is one of the most complex and interesting characters of all time. My affection for this character has stuck with me, so much so that my only sons' name is Tristan (no joking). I can't say enough about Brad Pitt, Aidan Quinn, Anthony Hopkins and the rest of the cast without sounding like a commercial, just watch it!!

It traces their beginning of life all together on a ranch to the point where they each go their separate ways, yet family ties still bond them to each other.While the movie does not raise any enduring questions, it is a moving picture of one family's life in the first quarter of the 20th century.

351,Minymo16,Love this film,9,26 October 2019,"I always watch this when it's on and am currently watching it now but also reading the reviews (seen it many, many times). It's interesting that so many people dislike it and there are bits I don't like, but I actually love the overall story. It's about 3 brothers and how their lives and relationship are affected by the women they love, war and politics. On another note, i personally don't believe Tristan was in love with Susannah, he wouldn't have left if he was, I think he was in love with the idea of her being in love with him, I personally believe his true love was Isabel and it's obvious that she had always loved him. No one seems to have considered their relationship to have been of any significance, yet she eased his soul and that's pretty much what this story is about, Tristan and his demons, even Susannah acknowledges that they were meant to be together. Anyway, let the haters hate, it's a great film for a rainy day if you're an unashamed romantic, male or female, it's not something you need to think about but it is still quite affecting.",Legends of the Fall
352,kasperlys,A perfect love story,10,14 July 2005,"This is not a huge movie that goes down in history, but still loved by people watching it, including myself. The story, written by Jim Harrison, is a very strong, sad and all the way beautiful story about brotherhood, jealousy and most important: Love - dangerous as it is!The acting in the movie is perfect. Brad Pitt fits perfectly in the role as Tristan Ludlow - the wild brother who's loved by everybody, but loses so many people around him, which gets him to the edge of insanity several times. Henry Thomas is doing a fine job as Samuel Ludlow - the young and naive brother who's killed in war. Aidan Quinn is doing the best performance he has ever made in Legends of the Fall as Alfred - the old brother, who seeks love, but loses it all. Julia Ormond had a difficult role as Sussanah - the girl in the family that all the brothers fell in love with, but still she did a very great job. And finally Anthony Hopkins as the father Colonel Ludlow, who has to experience all the pain around him which hits him very hard. He's really giving a good impression of the father in all the situations - anger, sadness, love and illness. The movie is very good directed by Edwark Zwick. I didn't notice anything to criticize about the direction. Actually I'm extremely impressed by the perfect direction of it. There's not much more to say about that. We watch the life in Montana in the early years of the 20th century. Of course there's the ranch in the mountains, but also the city Helena and the first World War. It must have required great producing, and the production turned out great. The houses, the clothing, the weapons, the train... All of it makes a great impression of the years we're following. But there is another very important person who makes this movie so good: James Horner. He did it again! We've heard his music in many movies, such as ""Braveheart"", ""Titanic"" and ""Troy"", but I think this is by far his best job. The melody (""The Ludlow"") is a very sad, but beautiful one, that keeps spinning around in your head as a memory of the movie. The other scores are great too, but it's this one I remember the movie best for.I love this movie very much, and I know that many people feel the same way. It's a movie you'll remember in a very long time, and it certainly doesn't end, when the credits have rolled, because you will spend a lot of time thinking it all over. If you haven't seen it - do it! You wont regret it.",Legends of the Fall

The stage is set for a grand spectacle, also supported by the quite impressive cast with a lovely Julia Ormond as the cherry on the cake. But as the movie progresses, the storyline becomes thinner and when Sir Hopkins start pulling his ogre face, it's faith is sealed. As in the storyteller's last words: 'It was a good death'.If this movie had been put out as a documentary I'd say: fine job, but I think it crumbled under it's own inflicted weight.Oh well, thank god there are other and better movies out there in the void ;) If you're a Hopkins fan, go and see 'The remains of the day' if you haven't already, that's what I'd call a rocksolid classic!",Legends of the Fall

Cutting out hearts, suicide, impalement, scalping, and murders galore. It becomes ridiculously comical. Brad Pitt traveling the world to find himself and his own chartered ship.

Julia Ormond made me sympathise with her and she even made me cry. Hopkins is a great actor; he played the role of a father who adores his brave little spoiled son although that little son is not descent as his elder brothers are! His a strong father who defended his sons and fought for them. Brad Pitt risks his life in order to protect his younger brother who went to the war but he was not a professional soldier when it comes to using the gun. Being killed in the war, Brad Pitt gets his brother's widow married but they did not have any child, so they get divorced and Julia Ormond gets married with Brad's eldest brother; nevertheless, she remains in love with Brad and she could not get him out of her mind, so she committed suicide.

The cast is excellent, the landscape is that of my ancestors the Blackfoot and the drama that has its roots in the antiquity of every race on the planet should hit home with anyone who views it. The series of events set in motion with the family is awesome in its scope, perhaps even on the level of Karma: the idea that what one has done in a past life must be dealt with in the present. But who's past? I never cease being amazed by the circle of life and experience happening over and over again. Tristens relation with the animals and the animals and the narration is excellent. OK.................... on to whats really on my mind: Does anyone out there know the name of the song Samuel and Susannah sang in the parlor? Who wrote it? Was it a popular song of the day?
