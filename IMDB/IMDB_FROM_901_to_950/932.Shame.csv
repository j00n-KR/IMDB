0,Leofwine_draca,Harrowing downward spiral,7,21 November 2014,"Director Steve McQueen and star Michael Fassbender team up once more after prison starvation drama HUNGER to star in an equally realistic and depressing movie. For SHAME is a harrowing and heartfelt movie, a slice-of-life effort that explores one man's downward spiral as a result of his sex addiction.SHAME avoids the sniggering attitude of its subject matter by playing it straight throughout. Through McQueen's lens, sex itself becomes a disturbing thing, as abhorrent as drugs or violence. Fassbender is perfectly cast as the outwardly charming and confident businessman secretly hiding some very dark secrets indeed, and both star and director should be commended for their approach to the subject matter.SHAME isn't a film for everyone; it's extremely explicit in terms of subject matter and the relentlessly nihilistic narrative makes for depressing viewing (although not as depressing as, say, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM). It's certainly a very well made film though and one I was engrossed in throughout.",Shame
1,SnoopyStyle,could be even better,7,24 September 2013,"New Yorker Brandon (Michael Fassbender) is struggling with sex addiction. His sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) is also a complete mess, and moves in with him. They have a dysfunctional relationship.There is a lot things Steve McQueen has thrown in to shock the audience. It's all very superficial. Shocking we see him walking around naked. Shocking to see the sexual perversion. But the heart of the story has to be the oversexualized sibling relationship. They could expand on this even more. In fact, they should concentrate all the effort on their story and their history. Although it is good, it could have been even better.",Shame
2,claudio_carvalho,Good Performances in a Shallow and Empty Story,4,29 July 2012,"In New York, the empty thirty and something year-old Brandon (Michael Fassbender) is a sex-addicted man that works in an office. His longest relationship lasted only four months and Brandon does not have any friend. Brandon has casual sex with women that he meets in bars; has sex also with hookers; visits porn sites in Internet; and collects sex magazines. However, he is unable to have sex with an acquaintance.When his also dysfunctional younger sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) unexpectedly moves to his apartment, she has one night stand with Brandon's boss and the world of Brandon turns upside-down. ""Shame"" is one of the most overrated films that I have recently seen. Brandon is a man that was probably sexually abused when he was a child and is sex addicted. The plot is limited to show his empty existence shagging women and masturbating. His sister Sissy is also a dysfunctional young woman, weaker than him, that needs support from her older brother but he is unable to help her. In the end, ""Shame"" is a film with good performances, but with a shallow and empty story. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Shame""",Shame
3,nogodnomasters,GET OUT OF MY ROOM!,8,17 September 2018,"This is an artsy adult film about a socially inept man addicted to porn, particularly Internet porn. His NY apartment is furnished a bit Spartan. His boring life is interrupted when his sister, Carey Mulligan comes to stay. There is an awkward scene where he stares at her naked body while she showers. It is designed to show how dysfunctional and creepy Brandon has become in life, like the long drawn out subway scene. His sister is in a bad relationship and is as dysfunctional as Brandon. She is a nightclub singer. The suicidal Carey is desperate for intimacy as is hinted in so many scenes.Brandon's dysfunction is apparently from living a semi-isolated life on a computer. His obsession with casual sex, porn, and masturbation causes problems in his life which escalates as the film progresses. Brandon realizes he has issues and takes steps to resolve those issues, but has trouble moving forward toward a normal sexual relationship that involves intimacy and only compounds things.Fassbender and McQueen did an excellent job in capturing the character of Brandon as we see his despair, grief, and isolation. This is the type of film in which I had to watch the whole thing to decide if I liked it or not depending on the ending. After seeing the ending, I am still not sure, which is why I have opted to sit on the fence post at 3 stars. Oh wait! I will add a star for nudity...but I'm not a pervert.F-bomb sex, nudity and some full frontal nudity (Michael Fassbender, Carey Mulligan, Mari-Ange Ramirez (first prostitute?),Nicole Beharie, Elizabeth Masucci, Hannah Ware (Internet girl?)

4,kosmasp,Emotion less ...,8,16 September 2012,"Yes there is nudity and yes there is intercourse too. But this is not titillating or trying to excite you in any way. It actually tries to tell you what addiction and a loss for empathy (or feelings in general) can cause. There are extremes shown in the movie, Fassbender being one of them and Mulligans character the other one. You might know where some of the things shown here are going (the thing with the computer being one of them) and it doesn't have that much dialog in it than other dramas. But Fassbender does not need a lot of dialog to express his character or the actions of said character.Fassbender shows a lot (sorry for the pun, but I guess the movie is infamous for the full frontal nudity shots and I couldn't resist), especially that he is an amazing actor. It's tough making a character like that a bit likable, but he did it.",Shame
5,jboothmillard,Shame,6,6 February 2013,"From British director Steve McQueen (Hunger), I think I saw a short review for this film from Claudia Winkleman and Danny Leigh in Film 2010, and when I heard more about it I was certainly interested to see it, especially as it was a recent edition to the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Basically thirty-something Brandon Sullivan (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Michael Fassbender) is the ambitious, well-educated and professional career city dweller with an outgoing and sociable lifestyle, but he is also a strong sex addict who masturbates frequently to magazine, home entertainment and online pornography, pays escorts and prostitutes to satisfy his needs, and thinks about sex when he's not having it, eyeing up women in any situation in the hope of having sex with them. There are people around he does not want knowing about his sex addiction and he does everything he can to hide it while being friendly towards them, but he does not have to do this as often with his boss David Fisher (James Badge Dale), who despite being married is very open talking to his male work colleagues about being promiscuous with other women, but his work computer and hard drive are full of pornography. The problem with Brandon having this addiction is that he cannot fully understand the emotional meaning or reason for sex, even when he is attracted to someone, this is made clear when he tries dating female colleague Marianne (Nicole Beharie), and when they do try to have sex he cannot maintain an erection, so sex seems like more of a need than a desire for him. The big change in his life comes though when his younger sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) arrives at his apartment, she works as a part-time singer who has small gigs in the city, and she asks to stay with him, and he overhears the reason she may be asking this is because she is having trouble with her lover, and as time goes he tries to accept her presence. With her being around Brandon finds it very difficult to do what he would normally do in privacy and sanctity, such as masturbating and going somewhere unannounced for sex with someone, and of course she sees the much more emotional attachment when it comes to sex, and with she is causing his life to spiral out of control. His shame for his obsession forces him to pay money for hotels to have sex with prostitutes elsewhere, he throws away all his magazine and DVD pornography, and he even puts his laptop computer in the trash, but trying to change his life he still has tension with his sister, it is after one particularly aggressive argument that he walks out and leaves her alone in the apartment. Following this Brandon goes on a one night bender, in other words a whole night of sexual and intimate pleasure, so he goes to a gay men's club knowing that he can easily get a blowjob and some kissing from someone there (so he may be bisexual), and he even ignores calls from Sissy while he is busy having a threesome with two prostitutes, of course he is angry at himself when he returns home. Brandon finds Sissy has slashed her wrists, she has cut herself many times before, and she is bleeding very heavily, but she survives and they reconcile in hospital, and sometime later we see Brandon on a subway train trying to not look at a married woman as he is trying to give up his obsession, but feeling desire he cannot help it. Also starring Mari-Ange Ramirez as Alexa, Lucy Walters as Woman on Subway Train, Hannah Ware as Samantha, Alex Manette as Steven and Elizabeth Masucci as Elizabeth. Fassbender gives a very poignant performance as the man who has a loathing for himself and keeps continues pursuing his next conquest for pleasure, Mulligan also gets some good moments as the sister who unintentionally catches him in some of his acts and cannot fully empathise or connect with him, the plot is pretty much just seeing the daily life of a man with a problem, naturally there is a lot of nudity, including from Fassbender himself, but you need that to understand his predicament, it is a dark and complicated story for the character, but it is certainly compelling, a most watchable drama. It was nominated the BAFTA Film Award for Outstanding British Film. Good!",Shame
6,rmax304823,"Long, Deliberate, Involving.",5,21 February 2013,"Michael Fassbender, a relatively well-off office worker, has two problems. He is, as all the ads put it, ""addicted to sex,"" whatever that means. And he has a sister, Carey Mulligan, a sloppy but unrepressed night club singer, who has come to New York and wants to stay in his apartment.I can't possibly go into all the plot details because it isn't a short movie and, although sluggishly paced, is full of details. The details are mostly of the ""ordinary life"" variety. Some of the shots almost seem ""stolen."" If a couple has dinner in a restaurant for the first time, the camera sits there and watches more patiently than the viewer as they trade suggestions about what meal to order and what wine they should have, and then we watch the waiter pour water into their glasses, go through his spiel about today's specials, take their order, leave, and come back later with the wine, which he pours for tasting into the patriarchal glass, and Fassbender tells him to ""pour it."" Then the waiter pours it.There's an abundance of nudity and some sex but it's hardly more stimulating than watching the waiter pour the cabernet. We get the picture early on of Fassbender's attraction to sex. It's not surprising that he's attracted but it seems to come in all forms -- masturbation, the internet, stroke magazines, a gay bar, humping in alleys, threesomes. It gets him into a bit of trouble at work, as it should, because after all man doth not live on broad alone. The guy's sex life evoke's Errol Flynn's -- a good thing there were no pine fences with knothole around.His sister is a different story. She's promiscuous but not shy about it, not all pent up about it, not about to explode like a ripe zit. Fassbender has constructed a kind of cocoon for himself in the city. His life is all arranged. And her arrival disrupts his tidiness. His life loses its metric quality. I mean, here she is, boffing her boy friend loudly in Fassbender's own bed, and the boy friend is Fassbender's boss. Lamentably, Fassbender doesn't quite get to pick up a cute young woman he flirts with on a train -- Jennifer Butler who looks sweet and innocent through her flattered smile, and who resembles Naomi Watts.Clearly, a good deal of thought went into this film and it's an intelligent drama that doesn't spell everything out for the viewer. But it's also relentlessly sad, at least until the end, when we're left with a little hope that Fassbender's vision has been broadened a little by the acts of others. Overall, though, torpid.",Shame
7,sunwarrior13,A Look On A Sexual Addict,9,17 July 2015,"Brandon is a New Yorker.He happens to be avoid relationships with women but does enjoy having sex with them.But he wants to do it often as he suffers from sexual addiction.He feeds his desires through many sexual encounters with women,compulsion to pornography through videos and magazines, and frequent masturbation.Things become worse when her sister moves into his apartment without warning and memories of their painful childhood are brought back.This is definitely a no-holds barred look at a sexual addict.We get to see his personality and the sufferings that he undergoes due to his constant desire for sex.While many viewers would probably see this expecting many sexy bed scenes and numerous naked scenes from the cast involved,too bad that this movie is far from being sexy as it focuses more on the characteristics of a sexual addict.Michael Fassbender provides a nice portrayal of Brandon as he provides the viewer a good insight of his addiction towards sex.",Shame
8,preppy-3,Great acting...but that's it,1,17 December 2011,"NC-17 rated film about a sex addict. Brandon Sullivan (Michael Fassbinder) lives in NY. He has a very successful job, lives in a big apartment...and is a sex addict. No one knows and he hates it but can't help himself. His sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) shows up unannounced and moves in with him. He doesn't want her there but she has nowhere to go. Slowly his life falls apart.What a lousy film! The first half of the film (a good 45 minutes) is ridiculously dull. It shows Fassbinder at work, jogging (for a good 5 minutes which adds NOTHING to the plot), on a date (another pointless 15 minutes) or him just staring into space. Mulligan pops up and sings a ridiculously slow version of ""New York, New York"" which (I swear) lasts forever and (again) adds nothing to the plot. I dozed off TWICE! I seriously considered walking out! It was so slow and pointless I couldn't believe it! It DOES pick up in the second half but insults the audience with predictable dramatics and manages to make the sex scenes dull! It all ends with no resolution or ending! Also WHY is Brandon a sex addict? Don't bother asking because the movie won't tell you! That's inexcusable to give us a sex addict and give NO reason for his problems! Also as for the nude scenes--Fassbinder is nude but in only a few scenes. It's mostly butt shots and a few shots of frontal (Fassbender is very well endowed). Also Mulligan has a full frontal shot. The acting was great by Mulligan and especially Fassbinder but it can't overcome a deadly dull beginning. By the time everything ramps up at the end I was too bored to care. Over praised and a really terrible film.",Shame

10,Boba_Fett1138,When sex becomes an obsession and when an obsession becomes an addiction.,7,28 January 2012,"Of course not all movies are made just to entertain and I'm glad about that. Movies can often be something provoking and a true experience, when it's handling an original and intriguing concept such as this movie does.This movie might sound like a one note movie about a sex addict, fulfilling his needs, day in day out, like a real junkie, getting his daily fix. But there is of course more depth to it all. Its premise perhaps makes it sound like this is a very black and white movie concerning sexual morals and themes but the movie actually more so is being placed in a very gray area. The main character is not completely despicable and also not completely devoid of any human emotions and the capability to care for women, no matter how poorly he treats some of them, just for his own needs. He can still tell good from evil but that doesn't hold him back from doing some bad stuff.It's a movie that shows that sex can truly turn into something addictive and that this ain't anything hot or pretty. It's a pretty nasty movie, that can also get quite graphic at times with its sex and nudity and not in a very hot kind of way. The movie could had been about any sort of addiction really and I feel the movie would had probably still had been the same, with perhaps as a difference that it would had made less impact, since this movie is treating a not so much handled or talked about subject.And still, the movie would had not been as great if it wasn't for a couple of other things as well. First of all its directing. It had a great directing approach, which felt more indie-filmmaking like but totally not in a pretentious sort of way. And with saying it feels like an Indie film, I don't mean to say it's a cheap and simplistic movie visually. On the contrary quite really. Obviously lots of time and effort went into the setup of this movie, with its lighting and camera handling. Visually it's a really great movie to look at, that is slowly and subtly being shot and told by director Steve McQueen. But also the acting is great. This is not an easy and ordinary role to play of course but Michael Fassbender does a very convincing job at capturing the disgusting and despicable sides or his characters but at the same time keeping him human and still a character you could feel and care for, for its entire duration.But you may want to ask yourself at the end what exactly the conclusion of the movie was and what exactly it was trying to say. I'm not talking about a message or anything of that sort but more what the entire point and purpose of this movie was. It's because the ending is not entirely satisfying. The movie just simply ends, while you are wondering what has changed exactly. Or perhaps this simply was just the point of the movie. But still, I saw this as a downside it did prevented me from giving it an higher rating, which the rest of the movie probably does really still deserve.Still an unique and powerful movie, that is definitely worth checking out, if you feel you could take and handle its main subject.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Shame
11,george.schmidt,"Fassbender & Mulligan are Oscar-bound in fascinating character study of sex addict and McQueen's straight-forward approach is refreshingly, brutally honest.",9,10 January 2012,"SHAME (2011) *** ½ Michael Fassbender, Carey Mulligan, James Badge Dale, Nicole Beharie, Lucy Walters, Charisse Bellante, Chazz Menendez. Fascinating yet depressing character study about a NYC sex addict (Fassbender in a tour-de-force, Oscar-worthy performance sure to sky-rocket him to international fame) whose 'fixes' can't come fast enough and only hampered when his equally psychologically damaged sibling Mulligan (equally compelling and award pendings) who re-enters his life with disastrous results in the process. Co-written with Abi Morgan, filmmaker Steve McQueen wisely depicts a likable character with a downward spiral most unsavorily with details none would otherwise experience and the ultimate decisions facing a daily habit to hard to break. Fassbender transcends the possible sordidness by allowing his vulnerability to lurk just beneath the surface while the polar opposite Mulligan clearly is heading for a breakdown; you'll never be able to hear ""New York, New York"" again without thinking of her poignantly saddened interpretation. Personal note: nice job to my bud Menendez (""Hey Romeo!"") ; good on ya sir!",Shame
12,evanston_dad,No Shame in Michael Fassbender's Performance,8,27 June 2012,"Michael Fassbender seemingly appeared in every movie released in 2011, but it's his performance in ""Shame"" that stands out among all the others.He plays a slick, handsome and on the surface successful New York professional who's secretly plagued by a host of emotional demons. He keeps them at bay through aggressive and compulsive sexual habits, but a surprise visit from an equally troubled sister (Carey Mulligan) brings them bubbling to the surface and facilitates a crisis in both of them.The details of this pair's messed up past are only hinted at, but given the degree to which they are sexually comfortable with each other, it's fairly obvious that they were both sexually abused and possibly physically abused in other ways as well. Even cutting him some slack for being an emotionally damaged person, Fassbender's character acts in such unlikable ways throughout the film that it's amazing we end up caring about him as much as we do. It's a testament to Fassbender's strengths as an actor that he could pull this tricky balancing act off.The film is bleak and haunting and deeply uncomfortable to watch at times, but it's also bracing in the way that watching the laying bare of emotions can be when done well.Grade: A-",Shame
13,ferguson-6,... *but were Afraid to Ask,5,11 December 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. Can a film be a beautifully crafted work of art AND also a movie that very few will enjoy, or even have an interest in seeing? Clearly, I am in the minority here as critics are raving about the insight and genius of writer/director Steve McQueen (""Hunger""). McQueen is an art school graduate and has a terrific eye for color, tone, texture and visual acumen. Those talents (and much more) are all on display in ""Shame"".For me, there are two separate aspects to discuss: the look of the film, and the effectiveness of the story. The first deserves recognition and kudos, while the second has resulted in a total lack of interest and ambivalence. Evidently the goal was to detail and humanize the diagnosis of sex addiction, specifically the lack of emotional connection that follows this most personal of activities.I will not itemize the number of ways in which Brandon (Michael Fassbender) tends to his addiction. On the surface, he is a normal looking guy with a normal job in a generic Manhattan office building. We quickly learn that he is always alone ... regardless if he is in a group at hour hour, hooking up with one of his endless stream of partners, or handling his own business. This guy is unable to find joy in anything that his life offers.His isolated world is one day invaded by his sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan). We learn that their up-bringing has something to do with his always dour moods, and her desperate need for attention and care. They are both a mess ... just in different ways. She has a line via voice mail that says ""We aren't bad people. We're just from a bad place."". That is meant to explain the rotting foundation without exposing us to another story of poor parenting skills.The clearest indication that Brandon's emotional issues are well beyond frayed, occurs when he actually starts to see a glimmer of relationship hope with a co-worker, only to have that end in performance failure. He quickly fixes the problem by resorting to what he does best ... with no meaning attached.Carey Mulligan is building a strong film career and her performance here is wonderful. Michael Fassbender has had a remarkable year with the latest X-Men, Jane Eyre, A Dangerous Method, and Haywire. That is a dream year for this fine actor. The film is beautiful to look at and has stunning performances. All that for a movie that is not really very interesting and certainly lacks substantive entertainment value for the normal movie-goer.",Shame

His longest relationship lasted only four months and Brandon does not have many friends. He has casual sex with women that he meets in bars, with hookers, visits porn websites and collects sex toys. However, he is unable to have sex with a potential girlfriend once they become close. When his also dysfunctional sister Sissy unexpectedly moves to his apartment, she has one night stand with Brandon's boss and the world of Brandon turns upside-down....Another movie from the great director Mcqueen, and if you have seen Hunger, you will pretty much know what mood this film will leave you in after you've seen it. It's a fascinating portrayal of a mans hedonistic lifestyle making him empty, and unable to feel or really be himself with someone. Fassbender is amazing as Brandon, and makes many of the scenes devastatingly real. the most powerful part of the film for me was when he was unable to 'perform' with someone with whom he had a slight connection with.Feelings in conjunction with passion does not work for Brandon, and it's heartbreaking to see. Mulligan puts in another fine performance as the disturbed sister, and her rendition of New York, New York, is also heartbreaking, if you use the right connotations.All in all a marvellous movie, which isn't too dissimilar to Amercan Psycho, which would make a great companion piece for this, and also Roger Dodger",Shame
15,gradyharp,'We're not bad people. We just come form a bad place.',10,19 April 2012,"SHAME is a brilliant, courageous, visually and emotionally stunning film by a new team of collaborators – director/writer Steve McQueen, cinematographer Sean Babbitt, and actor Michael Fassbender first gave us the unforgettable HUNGER and now they have teamed to present yet another unique work that will likely go down as one of the finest films of the decade. Abi Morgan (The Hours television series, The Iron Lady, Tsunami, Sex Traffic) co wrote the screenplay with McQueen; they seem to have an affinity for each other. This film has been controversial from the first mention that it was being made and controversy usually means that people are reacting strongly (both positively and negatively) to an art work – the true indication that this is by definition Art.The extraordinarily complex story of 21st century isolation and inability to connect with other people except on a unidirectional level of sexual contact is distilled in the role of Brandon (Michael Fassbender, in a multifaceted yet intensely focused performance): Brandon's life is dominated by near anonymous sexual encounters, internet pornography, and multiple daily escapes into onanism, He is quiet, handsome, and utterly irresistible to women and he takes advantage of this preoccupation with sexuality as a loner, living in an apartment, free of relationships, holding down a fine job as an account manager. This changes when his sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) 'moves in' and her unwanted presence alters Brandon's modus operandi. Brandon's boss, the married with children Dave (James Badge Dale) envies Brandon's way with women, always losing in his unpracticed approaches to pickups to Brandon's superior techniques. Dave meets Sissy at a nightclub where Sissy is singing (Mulligan's rendition of Kander and Ebb's 'New York, New York' was apparently shot in one take at 3 AM while cameras focuses on the three actors – genuine responses to t a deeply moving moment) and ends up sleeping with Sissy. Brandon, frustrated with Sissy's presence and behavior ultimately leads to his throwing her out of his apartment – an act that has an impactful result. Meanwhile Brandon attempts to 'relate' both emotionally and physically with fellow office worker Marianne (Nicole Beharie) with embarrassing results. And in his frustration he walks the night streets having sexual encounters with multiple partners out in the open, in a gay bar, and in thwarted attempts to pickup a girl whose boyfriend beats him severely.Much of the success of this art piece is due to the manner in which McQueen presents his story. Many of the scenes ore simply faces on the subway and Brandon's fantasies, all accompanied by a musical score by Harry Escott who has elected to use multiple recordings of Glenn Gould playing Bach's Goldberg Variations and Preludes and Fugues – the sublime simplicity of Bach's statements in marked contrast to the chaos in Brandon's mind and actions. In a splendid scene as Brandon awaits a subway, when his mind is tortured and out of control cinematographer Babbitt distorts the image like an acid trip. But most impressive is the choice to concentrate on Brandon's face as he eyes tricks or faces the world in which he lives in his out of control state - a face so misguided and needy and yet sensuous that it makes the film draw us inside a character's psyche like few other films have been able.Michael Fassbender does the impossible; he creates a role that despite the behavioral abnormalities remains a man about whom we care about deeply. At film's beginning there is subtle male frontal nudity and Fassbender's remarks about that are mature and enlightening: 'To be honest with you again, I think it's the idea of male frontal nudity. It just baffles me: Women can parade around naked all the time, but the guy conveniently has his pants on. I remember my mom always complaining about that to me, saying, ""This is such 'b-s', it's always the women who are naked"" ... so I did this one for you, Mom! Everyone involved in this film is to be commended for the highest level of artistic achievement. And that extends to the credits at film's end: each participant's name is flashed on the screen with a single musical chord on the piano. The effect is respectful and in keeping with the brilliance of the movie. Grady Harp",Shame
16,zetes,Fassbender's not very good in this repetitive slog of a film,5,10 November 2013,"Michael Fassbender stars as a sex addict in New York City. Not only does he screw chicks constantly, when he's not doing that he's watching porn. When he can't do either of those, he's masturbating, even at work. When his messed up sister, Carey Mulligan, asks to move into his apartment, it cramps his style. This film is beautifully shot and directed, but it's pretty darn thin. We watch Fassbender's descent into oblivion in great detail, but who the Hell cares? This character isn't interesting whatsoever. It's kind of hard to feel too bad for a guy who's major problem is that he gets laid too much. Fassbender acts the Hell out of it - frankly, he overacts the Hell out of it. Honestly, Mulligan is much better, and much more subtle, in the film. Fassbender's definitely a good actor, but he's certainly overrated. Really, the major things he has going for him are that he's British and handsome. Notice here that his sister says they're from New Jersey. Mulligan has a near perfect Jersey accent, despite being English (seriously, at this point I barely remember she's British at all). Fassbender sounds like he's just off the boat. He claims to have been born in Ireland - really, that was the only way they could pass off the performance - but he has to have lived in the US for 25+ years. Accents are just one thing, of course, but an actor of his supposed caliber should be able to pull it off at least a little.",Shame

18,StevePulaski,The saddest sex I have yet to see,9,18 April 2012,"The Oscars made a huge mistake for Best Actor when they looked past the performance of Michael Shannon in Take Shelter, and they've made the colossal, nearly unforgivable mistake of not even nominating Michael Fassbender for his extravagant work in Steve McQueen's latest film Shame. Here, we have a movie with a touchy subject matter that will without a doubt turn people off, and a rating of NC-17 that will likely do the same. This is the kind of film audiences need to see. Allow me to reiterate what I've said numerous times; we can't always be shown the bright side of life.Shame is a deeply disturbing, psychological drama about a man forced to confront his sex addiction out in streets occupying bitterness upon the arrival of his manipulative, needy sister. The man is Brandon (Fassbender), a good-looking thirtysomething who has become a successful office worker in New York. Despite the crowded streets, Brandon is lonely, and feels detached from his emotions, seemingly unable to reach a point of genuine affection. His sister is Sissy (Mulligan), who, after numerous failed attempts to contact him, unexpectedly shows up at his apartment and moves in with him.Because Brandon spends much of his time in his apartment with magazines, tapes, internet porn, one night stands, and prostitutes, he is now forced to take his desires to the cold and upsetting streets of New York.While Fassbender clearly steals the show here, I feel that there is still not enough praise for Carey Mulligan's role. She is marvelous, exchanging, and undeniably attractive in an ugly and unwanted role. Both actors show incredible versatility by doing roles that I'm sure mainstream celebrities would've rejected in a heartbeat. I believe too many actors see this film as a dead end picture. Because of its concept and rating, they see it as a doomed opportunity because by having that NC-17 rating, it most likely forces the film into a modest run in art-house theaters in big cities. Though despite noticeable limitations, Shame goes for broke, making a film not so much about garnering revenue but more about informing, disturbing, and giving audience members insight on a common problem uncommonly explored. I'd also like to tell mainstream actors that Shame has stayed in my head longer than most big-budget efforts.The cinematography is absolutely tantalizing. Impressive scenery of New York is conveyed appropriately and efficiently, and very nice long shots are used to give us the feeling of intrusion or even subtle voyeurism. There's an impressive shot that continues for around three minutes of Brandon running along a sidewalk downtown listening to music. The shot is visually intelligent, somewhat mercerizing, and reminds us it's the simple things in film that continue to amuse us.Shame is not without a few imperfections. Some will recall my review of Another Earth; a film of impeccable art direction, but sterile, uncompromising storytelling that left a lot to be desired. The main point of complaint I had with the film was that it relied way too much on subtle, distracting ambiguity which overcomplicated things, making too much seem metaphorical rather than seemingly serving a divine purpose. Shame relies somewhat on ambiguity too, some of which I think too vague and indistinct. We never get backstory on these characters (perhaps we don't need it), and it always seems that shots have a double standard towards them (the running shot I was talking about).Ambiguity is certainly not a bad thing. It's like hot sauce on food; it makes the movie-going experience more zesty and interesting, but too much drowns out the dish's main flavor. Shame, at times, just seems to vague and uncertain, expecting the audience to fill in the blanks more often than necessary. But that small element can't overlook the barrage of smart, crafty filmmaking still at large here. This is McQueen's second feature (his 2008 film Hunger also featured Fassbender) and it seems he is already on the path to perfecting indie cinema by populating it with efficient and intelligent pictures, both dark and insightful.There is also a heavy amount of brutal honest plaguing the film. It is destined to ""show it all,"" never neutering the subject of sex addiction. We are shown full frontal male and female nudity, and the reasoning is anything but gratuitous. While the film features a number of sex scenes, they are not erotic, pleasurable, or even remotely sexy. They are fierce, saddening, and lack intimacy, seeing as our main character feels no mental or emotional connection or fondness for his partner. These sex scenes are probably some of the saddest I have ever seen in film. They are simply cold and unmoving.Shame is a wonderful film, but not in the usual sense. It is hard to watch, difficult to decipher, and gives your mood a complete one-eighty degree twist. We are left contemplating if any change has happened, or if Brandon is the same way he has always been. It's open for heavy interpretation. Let's put it this way; I don't want to see a sequel. It was hard enough to witness it the first time.Starring: Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan. Directed by: Steve McQueen.",Shame
19,blanbrn,"Excellent film of character study, a complex man enjoys pleasure despite having a deep dark emotional side.",10,21 May 2012,"""Shame"" I have to say is clearly one provocative and pleasure type viewing joy that one can watch, and true this film may not be everyone's cup of tea it's worth a watch as it showcases an amazing character study. On one hand Brandon(Michael Fassbender)is just being a man he's enjoying the pleasure of causal sex with very beautiful different women. And on the one side this is a man with a very dark destructive secret. It's clear that when you enjoy something to much and become a sex addict, life can become dangerous just the way it does for Brandon.In a powerful and raw outspoken performance from Michael Fassbender, ""Shame"" is the story of Brandon a single good looking New York city business guy who's successful and wealthy and his one passion is sex. Yet this pleasure has turned Michael into a dark and wild human being. And it gets more complex when his younger sister Sissy(Carey Mulligan)arrives in town as clearly little sister is a damaged and weak soul. As thoughts and memories of dark times and wicked past are revealed.""Shame"" is highly graphic and raw as Brandon is a man who enjoys sex to the fullest you name it from sessions with escorts and having sex with sexy girls in colored bras combined with his love for on line porn to his love of touring erotic clubs, viewing nude magazines and having threesomes this is one wild and kinky boy. As watching you as the viewer should feel as I did you see the pleasure yet thru the experience you see Brandon as a broken down and devastating soul. As this movie clearly explores the dark side of human behavior. Still it proves and shows that sex, pleasure, and erotic nature is a powerful and visual experience that can still enchant and control one's every thought and action. No matter how you feel about the issue of sex addiction ""Shame"" is one film not to be missed.",Shame
20,lasttimeisaw,Shame,9,6 June 2012,"Finally a film could knock down HUGO (2011) and a leading male performance could overcome THE ARTIST's Jean Dujardin from the crowns of my favorite film and leading actor in 2011, SHAME, the second feature film from a perfect-pitched alliance of McQueen-Fassbender (after the daring and jaw-dropping HUNGER 2008) is an intensive exploration of human's raw sexual desire and its dysfunctional repercussions.Fassbender is Brandon, a white-collar in NYC, who has been a victim of his insatiable sexual lust while also being a sterling case of intimacy-impotence, and things complicate when his feeble and mentally-jaded sister (Carey Mulligan) arrive uninvited.The film embraces a snappy narrative and visual stunt to laboriously account the tribulation of Brandon's eccentricities, a thorough exposure and exposition of the peculiar life of a sex addict satisfies one's curiosity and magnificently intrigues some ripple effects to coerce oneself to self-introspection, furthermore, it impacts an in-depth afterthought which doubts one's liability of the most primitive sex drive and the vast void after. The film grittily finds its mesmerizing deliveries both from the director team and actors. The script from McQueen and Abi Morgan is concise and incisive, brilliant cinematography from Sean Bobbitt captures even the subtlest turbulence underneath every single gesticulation, stunning long-takes could never spoil the attention, let alone the exotically gripping threesome scenes under the xenon-scrutiny. Harry Escott's fluent score has a juxtaposedly infused function to accompany the graphic visual voyage.Mr. Fassbender's destructive performance is straightforwardly eye-popping, a quasi-AV-esque bareness reveals what the word ""actor"" stands for in all respects and in a most paramount grade. Carey Mulligan's superb rendition of NEW YORK, NEW YORK is so far her career-best and her devastated reading of a troubled soul gives her a shot in my BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS list. The snub from the academic awards is not totally unexpected, the film is not an easy piece for anyone to swallow and assimilate, but a complete zero-nomination does blow the whistle on the cowardice of the clique, luckily the pair will soar along for the third time in TWLEVE YEARS A SLAVE (due in 2013), so at least the future is auspicious!",Shame
21,KineticSeoul,Emotion driven but lack in plot,6,20 August 2012,"Now it was Michael Fassbender's ballsy move to play a sex addict and a chronic masturbator. This movie shows the sexual tendencies of male and female and what they tried to hide sometimes but can become too much to handle. Brandon(Michael Fassbender) is a successful guy that works at a company, add to that his good looks and it's easy for him to get girls. And he uses that to feel his deepest lustful desires. Throw in a very awkward relationship with his sister played by Carey Mulligan and it sort of becomes a uncomfortable movie to watch. And yet the movie doesn't try to hid anything but show how sexual tendencies can sometimes break some apart. While the movie ""A Dangerous Method"" which is a previous movie that has Michael Fassbender in it, has psychologist's theories of these sexual tendencies. But in this it gets put to use in modern time. This isn't a movie with a big plot or anything but it's very emotion driven with some great acting.6.9/10",Shame
22,Hellmant,NC-17 rating seems unwarranted but it's good to see it's much more accepted!,8,14 March 2012,"'SHAME': Four Stars (Out of Five) An NC-17 rated drama about sex addiction! Steve McQueen directed and co-wrote the film (with Abi Morgan) and Michael Fassbender stars as the tormented addict (Fassbender also starred in McQueen's first feature 'HUNGER'). Fassbender is good in the lead but it's not one of my favorite performances of the year, the Oscar snubbing talk might be appropriate to some though (he's definitely better than at least a few of the actors who were nominated). The film as a whole is slow paced but definitely leaves an impression. Worth seeing if you don't mind a decent amount of film sex or male frontal nudity.Fassbender plays Brandon, a New Yorker with a decent job and apartment who also happens to be extremely addicted to sex. He spends a lot of his time meeting women who are in to one night stands, calling hookers over, watching a lot of porn and jacking off to it (including at work). His obsessed life is interrupted when his sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan), drops by needing a place to stay. It becomes apparent that the two are both damaged by a troubled childhood but the details are never made clear. Brandon starts to question his livelihood and attempts to change while dealing with his depressed sister.The movie is very cold and methodical. We get to know Brandon as kind of a machine as the movie slowly begins to show a little more of a human side to him throughout. He's not a womanizer or sexist in any way, he only seeks out women who are after the same thing he is though and always treats them with respect (never leading them on). His character is a little hard to like and somewhat robotic but he's definitely not a bad guy. His sister is quite the opposite, she's very emotional and full of life (although severely depressed). It's a flaw in the film (I think) that we never find out the details of their history and why they are the way they are and at film's end we don't know a lot more about them. The lead character goes through a few major changes but we never find out what happens to him or if anything is truly resolved. Still the movie is definitely memorable and a unique film going experience.'SHAME' was the first NC-17 movie I've seen in the theater (and we actually got it here in Corvallis, OR for a change, at Regal 9th St. Cinemas) but it wasn't really that much more explicit than any hard R rated film. There's a decent amount of male frontal nudity (and Fassbender is well-hung) but it's always flaccid and the sex isn't any more graphic than I've seen in other R rated films (the quantity didn't seem much greater either). So to me the NC-17 rating seems unwarranted but the studio kind of used it to better market the film anyway and it's good to see the rating is much more accepted now. So if you mind sex and nudity you probably wont want to see this film but it's definitely not much worse than sexually explicit R rated films. If you don't mind the subject matter as well I'd say it's definitely worth a look.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rje99p8QSz8",Shame
23,Buddy-51,When sex becomes an addiction,8,30 December 2012,"His name is Brandon and he is a sex addict. He spends virtually his entire waking life either having sex, planning on having sex, or watching others have sex.How he got to be this way is never fully explained in the screenplay by Steve McQueen (who also directed the movie) and Abi Morgan, though it is darkly hinted that it might have something to do with some form of sexual abuse in the character's past. This is particularly likely given the unhealthy proclivity he seems to have for his even more lost and dysfunctional sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan), who comes to live with him in his Manhattan penthouse early on in the movie. Brandon will do it with just about anyone - though he seems to have drawn the line at Sissy, at least based on the struggling and angst he undergoes in her presence, though we're never quite sure about what might have happened between the two of them in the past. Of course, the fact that Brandon is sexy and handsome means he's never at a loss for willing and attractive partners. It is also no surprise that the one woman (Nicole Beharie) who actually gets into his head and possibly even his heart - a co-worker who thinks there should be more to relationships than mere one-night stands - is the one for whom he is unable to perform in the only way he knows how.""Shame"" is a subtle and provocative drama that explores how sex and sexuality have changed in the modern era - in some ways for the better and in many ways for the worse. Certainly Brandon and Sissy demonstrate some of the pitfalls inherent in a world where sex is so readily available, thanks in large part to advancements in technology, the proliferation of porn, and relaxed social mores. But ""Shame"" never feels the need to preach to the audience nor to look down on its characters. It presents us to them in all their physical and emotional nakedness, then lets us render our own judgment on them - or lack thereof.In a brave and soul-baring performance, Michael Fassbender brings a rawness and a vulnerability to the role of Brandon that allow us to feel for the character without ever begging for our pity. The same goes for Mulligan, whose craziness and desperation are infrequently tempered by moments of clarity and wisdom.Not for all persuasions and tastes, but rewarding for the adventurous and open-minded.",Shame
24,thesar-2,Pain,8,3 March 2013,"Well, let's get this show off to a running start: within the first six minutes of the definite NC-17 flare, Shame, you'll see full-frontal male & female nudity, male backside, peeing, showering, prostitution and masturbation.Is this a reason to watch this movie? Well, if you're a voyeur or addicted to sex. Ahhh and that's the point of the movie. Perhaps the 2012 documentary Bully should begin with full on bullying for the opening six minutes to get its position started up. (Maybe it does – I haven't seen it, nor do I have plans to.)Honestly, I knew this was coming, so to speak, but that is not the reason I wanted to see it. Reasons twofold: I've heard nothing but good things about this film and Michael Fassbender's fantastic performance of the sex-addicted businessman, Brandon and because I never found little Mikey attractive. THAT helped me stay objective.(Oh, and backing up a little bitspoiler alertthere's nothing LITTLE about Mikey. Damn, I can see he waited for the right project to show *him*self off.)And right project this indie film was. It was, indeed, a very well shot movie. It's titled: Shame, but I would've probably went with Pain. These characters in this movie center around pain and don't know what to do about it.It's not an all-around original idea, a group of main characters in misery, but the spin of sex-addiction, dependency, anti-dependency and infidelity juxtaposed with a fairly good script, fantastic cinematography and score, make this is must-see for film-lovers.Brandon's ""perfect life"" of wealth, position and a kickass apartment is highly disturbed from a female attempting to come back into his life. Naturally, we think this is an ex of his, but after awhile, it's his needy, self-absorbed and highly-dependant sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan.)Brandon was already on the edge due to his increasing need to either pleasure himself or others – all but 22½ hours a day, and when Sissy comes in to acquire a place to live, he spins further into the abyss.I'm not sure if there's really a message here. I've already stated this is about more pain than shame, but it might bring to light to some folks to realize there's more addictions out there than nicotine, alcohol or pain meds.For those who do NOT buy into the sex-addiction disease, you're a fool. Although this fictional movie shows one side, keep in mind you can be addicted to all kinds of things, or everything, and it is destructive. Learn what yours is, for we're all subject to this, and get help if you need to.Stepping off the pedal stool, this is a very good film, purposely slow and wonderfully shot. I loved the instrumental music, even the track also played in Hannibal. It's sad, yes, but mesmerizing at the same time. Recommended.Side Note: Aside from the lack of killings, strangely, this movie reminded me a lot of American Psycho and oddly made me want to watch Lost in Translation following. Not sure why. Perhaps I'm addicted to cinema and it's destroying me.",Shame
25,paul2001sw-1,Compelling and discomfiting,9,3 April 2015,"Before watching Steve McQueen's 'Shame', I had in my head images from his previous film with Michael Fassbinder, 'Hunger' about the I.R.A. hunger striker Bobby Sands. 'Shame' is also about a difficult topic - superficially, sex addiction. But it's actually a sensitive story about a man in whom the thrill of the chase, and its consummation, have come to dominate his life, to the extent it has eliminated any capacity for empathy with his fellow humans, even (or maybe especially) his sexual partners. McQueen is simply a brilliant film-maker: this is a movie about essentially unlikable characters not behaving particularly well - some scenes reminded me of Neil La Bute's 'In the Company of Men', but here more horrific because less stylised - but McQueen's use of music and imagery, and a note-perfect performance from his star, keep you watching. Even the physical stuff is done well - neither pornographic nor ridiculous, but appropriate for the overall theme of the movie. The only thing I didn't like was the end, which seemed a little too pat - and unoriginal - in a film that otherwise forces its viewer into consideration of uncomfortable viewpoints. While not exactly cheery viewing, it's easier to watch than 'Hunger', and almost as compelling.",Shame

It opens with an overhead shot of Michael Fassbender in bed and the camera just stays on him lying there for a whole minute. I had to check I hadn't accidentally paused the DVD by mistake. That's a taste of things to come. There's not as much dialogue as you'd expect from a film. Many scenes are just him looking at someone. Then they look back. Then they look away. Repeat for several minutes. Then there was the singing and the jogging scenes. I ended up fast forwarding them.Anyway, I've slated this masterpiece for long enough.Most people liked it. I didn't.

28,Irishchatter,Too slow for a Michael Fassbender movie....,2,16 September 2016,"Even though I think Michael Fassbender is one of the great Irish actors out there, him being named wouldn't even give the movie a chance to be successful. I found that the whole movie was dragging on and I felt there was no plot to this. Yeah it's about a man who has sexual fantasies and his sister unexpectedly showed up but, that's pure bland in my opinion. His character was hard to understand and he was always been a whinger the whole time. To be quite fair here, Fassbender is actually a better fit in action or history type films. I don't think a film like this such as 50 Shades of Grey, is for him. He should've thought twice to join this film and not be involved in this kind of thing again in future. This really isn't one of his best movies I've seen, I give this movie a rating of 2/10..",Shame

He does his best to hide his addiction from her, but somethings aren't that easy. First of all I have to say that this is a really good movie. That said it's not easy to watch. Fassbender is amazing in this and I have no idea why he didn't get nominated. I'm guessing because the movie is NC-17 and there is a lot of sex and nudity. That aside watching him struggle with his addiction with few words is really mesmerizing. I can compare this to ""Drive"" in the style and the pacing, few words but powerful actions. Brandon is one of the most unlikeable characters I have seen lately but the entire time you really want him to change and you end up sympathizing and identifying with Sissy through out most of the movie. Movies that polarize you like that are an adventure to watch and you seem to get more out of it. All that said I do recommend this. Overall, A great but hard movie to watch, very emotional.

30,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,7,28 April 2012,"Shame When it comes to sex addiction in males, it must be extremely hard to diagnose. Thankfully, this drama about the carnal affliction shows the symptoms, and their repercussions, up close and personal. Brandon's (Michael Fassbender) rampant sex addiction finds him preying on married subway commuters on a daily basis in order to sate his insatiable appetite. But his lascivious temperament is tested when his equally amorous sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan), appears out of the blue, and stirs up the long suppressed events that served as gateway drugs for both of their devious dependencies. Plagued by a perverted past and an inability to commit, Brandon begins to spiral out of control, threatening his career and safety. A somber depiction of the much-maligned hardship, Shame puts a face to the problem with intense performances and restrained storytelling.

However, it does not seem to have a point either. McQueen seems to be obsessed with getting Fassbender naked, and the actor obliges, leading to the NC-17 rating. Fassbender's character has fondness for three things: getting naked, having sex in various permutations, and crying (not necessarily in that order). The script is meandering and eventually peters out. Mulligan can't overcome her poorly defined character and her rendition of ""New York, New York"" probably had Frank Sinatra turning over in his grave.",Shame
32,The-Sarkologist,A powerful film that exposures the destructive nature of pornography,9,8 August 2014,"I stumbled across this film when I was trying to find out a bit more about a new movie coming out called Frank, and this film was recommended to my by IMDb. When I found out that it was about a sex addict who has his sister move in with him, I became even more intrigued. It wasn't until I read a couple of reviews, and the plot on Wikipedia, that I decided that it was definitely a movie that I wanted to see.What initially struck me was that some people suggested that Steve McQueen was on his way to becoming a solid performer within the art house scene. I began to wonder whether Steve McQueen, the guy that made a bunch of action movies back in the seventies had reinvented himself as a director of art house movies. Well, it turns out that this Steve McQueen is certainly not the action movie Steve McQueen because, well, this Steve McQueen is black and the other Steve McQueen died in the early eighties.However, enough said about the name of the director because what this movie is about is, well, no laughing matter. Basically it is about sex addiction, and it brilliantly paints the picture of a man whose life is little more than seeking the next orgasm, or more likely, THAT orgasm. This is the first Michael Fassenbender movie that I have seen, but I have noted that the critics seem to love the guy, and to be honest with you, now I understand why. The way he seems to capture the emptiness and the desolation of Brandon is nothing short of profound. Brandon would not be an easy character the play, and the way McQueen and Fassenbender paint the portrait of a man who has lost the ability to be able to intimately connect with other people, and to do it without using dialogue, is clearly the work of a master.What about sex addiction? Well, it was interesting that I came across this film the same week that I read a testimony written by a self confessed porn addict, and while Brandon's addiction went well beyond porn, it is in effect the same thing. The thing about sex addiction is that it is an addiction that is done in secret. Thus the title of the movie, Shame, because it is not something that one who is effected would be willing to admit to people. Granted, one may boast of the women that they have slept with, but only when one has picked this woman up in a bar or a nightclub. Go beyond that to prostitution and porn and suddenly no one wants to speak about it. As David says in the movie, when speaking of the contents of Brandon's harddrive – it was dirty, absolutely filthy; whoever was looking at that must be truly sick.Okay, I can be a bit of a loner, a lot of times preferring to sit alone and read my books, but the thing with books is that one can go out and tell your mates about all of the books that you have read (and that is certainly something that I do). That is not necessarily the case with porn (though I do realise that people will swap porn). However, with porn, and with sex, it is getting into that zone, reaching the orgasm, that takes your entire focus, and this is seen when Brandon is caught masturbating in his toilet which sends him into a rage. It is not just embarrassing (as was the case with Sissy), but to Brandon it was like a heroin junkie being prematurely brought down from his high.We also see the isolating effect that it has on people in that the last thing Brandon wants in his apartment is another person. His apartment is his own personal space where he can retreat and indulge in his passions, yet when Sissy arrives that place is suddenly taken away from him, and his desire to seek that perfect orgasm is denied to him, which drives him insane. When David is having sex with Sissy in another room, we see the torment on Brandon's face as his privacy has been taken away from him: he so wants indulge in his pleasurable pursuits but is unable.The last thing that I wish to point out is how Brandon has lost the ability to be intimate with other people. Throughout the film we notice that he does not say much at all, as if he is unable to relate and communicate, unless it leads him to the end result – the orgasm. He tries to have a relationship with a woman at work, and discovers that he is impotent, yet when the prostitute comes around there is no problem at all. What is more striking is how he pushes her away when he realises that at that one time he is impotent. Let us also consider his relationship with Sissy. He does not want her close to him, as if the mere touch of a woman is enough to set him off, yet Sissy is his sister and therefore off limits. Like the woman at work, and his sister, he eschews the intimate relationship.Some have suggested that we can all relate to Brandon, especially us guys, because it is a struggle that many of us go through, or have gone through. It is not so much that we are like Brandon – he is the absolute extreme – but rather we see this extreme and it makes us think, and understand, where this behaviour can take us. Unlike drugs, which you have to procure, this is a part of our body – a part of us – and we can utilise it as we will. Some people suggest that porn (and promiscuous sex) his harmless, however McQueen, in this masterpiece of filmmaking, demonstrates otherwise.",Shame
33,sol-,Ashamed,6,2 June 2017,"Not the Ingmar Bergman classic of the same title, this contemporary British drama follows a young man who begins to reevaluate his obsession with sex and pornography when his sister moves in and begins to date his even more sexually depraved boss. In a performance consisting more of glances and stares than real dialogue, Michael Fassbender does well in the lead role as he wrestles with his conflicted emotions regarding his new home life. The title is especially interesting to consider along these regards; is the presence of his sister (and the knowledge of what his boss is doing with her) the very first thing in his life that has ever caused him to feel ashamed of his sexually active lifestyle? Intriguing as all this is, the film never tackles such ideas in much depth, not really exploring whether or not one should be ashamed of one's sexuality and/or the role of societal expectations in how open one is with one's sexuality. Much visible tension between Fassbender and Carey Mulligan (as his sister) sadly goes unexplored too with only the slightest hints of abusive childhoods and a possible incestuous past between them. And yet, with Fassbender in such good form with his longing stares (especially on the train near the end) conveying so much, this is an easy film to appreciate for the bits and pieces that do work. Harry Escott's moody music score is a particularly commendable touch.",Shame
34,tomgillespie2002,Fascinating exploration of a relatively unexplored subject matter,8,6 May 2012,"The idea of sexual addiction has, at least up to now, been viewed by most as a pathetic way for celebrities to justify their debauchery and sleazy activities. It has never been given a serious portrayal in film (not that I can see remember), but this has not stopped director Steve McQueen tackling the subject in his second feature, after 2008's quite sensational Hunger. He approaches the subject head-on, and rather than trying to investigate what causes the problem, he instead shows it for what it is, personified in Michael Fassbender's emotionally damaged Brandon.Unknown to the people who claim to know him, Brandon has a seemingly high-paid office job and an ocean-view apartment. This life of emotional distance helps him to indulge in his sexual addiction, where prostitutes, online porn, bar pick-ups, and daytime wanks-at-work provide temporary relief for his ever-growing sexual urges. His life of routine is rudely interrupted with the arrival of his equally damaged sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan), who throws Brandon's life upside down. At first the two seem to get on, but after Sissy sleeps with Brandon's boss David (James Badge Dale), and then catches Brandon masturbating, his once-private affliction is revealed.Similar to Hunger, Steve McQueen takes a very artistic approach, breaking the film up with long moments of silence and panning shots, and in one bravura sequence, the camera follows a raging Brandon as he jogs through the New York night, as the neon-lit city opens up before him. Yet it's the character development and the truly exceptional lead performance by Fassbender that makes the film, as given that Brandon is really quite an unlikeable character, in Fassbender's hands he is sympathetic and tragic, and McQueen's and Abi Morgan's script make him a fully-realised, and utterly fascinating character.It would be easy to make Brandon one-dimensional, but as the film goes on, we learn more about him. He fantasises about office colleague Marianne (Nicole Beharie) and the two go out on a dinner date. Brandon talks about his inability to understand or maintain a relationship, which perplexes Marianne, yet the two still seem to hit if off. Later, on a second date, the two are tearing each others clothes off, when Brandon seems to look her meaningfully in the eyes, but he is unable to sustain an erection. He tells her to leave, then in the next scene, and not long after his encounter with Marianne, he is having hard sex with a prostitute up against the window. It is clear that any idea of anything remotely meaningful terrifies Brandon, and therefore turns him off.Sissy is equally as intriguing, but is given much less screen time. Her encounter with the truly loathsome David reveals that something happened in the past, possibly involving both siblings, yet like Brandon, Sissy reveals nothing. Mulligan has already established herself as an effective actress, but her character serves more as a way to develop Brandon, who is in every scene. The two siblings' backgrounds are not revealed so we are left to guess how to the two have become so damaged, but the film is much more effective this way. It can be a hard watch at times, but Shame is a fascinating exploration of a relatively unexplored subject matter.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Shame
35,Floated2,Amazing Performances But Rather Emotionless,6,31 December 2013,"Shame was promoted very quickly and received a lot of buzz for the performances of Michael Fassbender, and for the film having many sex scenes giving it a NC-1 rating (for accurate measure). However I found the story lacking and felt there could have been much more done. It was an interesting take on a sex addict and the film wasn't predictable but in general Shame was dull and at times boring. Many of the sex scenes were unnecessary to the story or added very few to lead the plot. With limited dialogue, some of it works while at times I felt it could have added more. I understand many people have different opinions but I can't see how Shame is a ""masterpiece"" in people's eyes. Fassbender shows a lot as he carries the film in a tough drama, his portrayal is great but there was a lacking of character development. Carey Mulligan was decent playing the trainwreck sister whom barges her way in Fassbender's life. But again the story wasn't too much as it wasn't holding my interest in the end. I would have figured there would have been more of a back story as to why Fassbender was like that as well as his relationship with his sister (were they abused when younger? Did something bad happen between the two?). Nothing was answered by the end. Overall there is a certain audience for these type of films.",Shame
36,TheMovieDiorama,"Shame is provocative, seductive and unforgettable.",9,2 March 2018,"Wow. This was an outstanding film in both the acting and technical categories. I warn you, this is a heavy film and is 18 rated for a reason. Naked bodies left, right and centre. This is an uneasy story about the nature of need, being desired by other people and actually wanting to matter in life. We follow a middle aged man who lives a precarious yet carefully managed lifestyle. His sister comes along and he is unable to control it. Both of their lives spiral out of control. Brandon's addiction for sex and pleasure becomes unbearable as he does whatever he can to fulfil his requirements. Sissy's love life is unrepairable and she relies on Brandon to try and help her, but he views her as a burden. The consequences are horrifying to watch, this is an extremely powerful drama. We do not hate either of these characters. We may not understand them fully but instead we empathise with them. These are dark moments in their lives and yet the phenomenal portrayals by Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan convey a type of depression to an extent. Sex addiction, or any addiction, can and will destroy parts of your life. Social, career, family...all these important elements slowly crumbling away due to something that you just cannot control. The inner torment that Fassbender is able to express was palpable, sheer masterclass in acting. Director Steve McQueen was the standout. This was the very definition of confident filmmaking. So many long takes where the characters just come alive on screen. A 2/3 minute shot of Mulligan singing to then cut to a 2/3 minute shot of Fassbender becoming emotional. A technically perfect tracking shot of Fassbender jogging down a street. A 5 minute take where Fassbender is on a date. I was in awe of McQueen's style, adored every scene. The ending may not have been as hard hitting as I had hoped for, but still poignant nonetheless. A delicate subject matter explored thoroughly and intricately, driven by fantastic performances and perfect directing. Loved it.",Shame
37,l_rawjalaurence,The Empty Life of a Sexual Athlete,7,24 August 2016,"Not much happens in SHAME. Brandon (Michael Fassbender), a successful thirtysomething in contemporary New York, has a series of brief flings with both men and women and ends up dissatisfied as a result. His sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) pursues an equally hedonistic life and tries to commit suicide.The point about Steve McQueen's film is that there is no point. Brandon remains pathologically unable to engage with anyone; he knows his own shortcomings and tries to compensate for them through visceral means - watching endless porn videos, masturbating in the bathroom, paying for soulless sex with a series of whores. The ""shame"" of the title refers to his gradual understanding of his own inadequacies, and his inability to deal with them. There are shameful moments - such as when Sissy discovers him masturbating - but they are nothing compared to Brandon's overall sense of shame.The film gains much of its power from the contrast between the opulent New York settings - Brandon's well-appointed office, and his equally classy apartment with its stunning views over the Hudson River - and the squalid existence he pursues in seedy bars and ill- lit clubs. The degenerate nature of his life is summed up in one sequence taking place in a darkened pool hall, where he tries to pick up someone else's girlfriend by offering her instant sexual gratification. The result, inevitably, is that Brandon is given a good hiding by the jealous boyfriend.Yet perhaps Brandon actively seeks after such retributive treatment; unable to achieve any form of fulfillment, he harbors a masochistic desire to be punished. The film's end is strongly reminiscent of the beginning, with Brandon sitting alone on a subway train ogling unknown women. Nothing, it seems, can distract him from his path towards destruction.Director Steve McQueen's handling of the material is highly sexually explicit yet un-erotic. The screen sex is mechanical, devoid of any passion, despite the participants' attempts to spice it up with a few well-timed moans of pleasure. What is perhaps more memorable is the sight of Brandon's and Sissy's expressionless faces as they either walk through New York's unfriendly streets or try to forge an existence together in Brandon's apartment.Years ago Martin Scorsese painted a bleak picture of New York and its endemic violence in TAXI DRIVER (1976). SHAME offers an equally pessimistic interpretation; the city might have spruced itself up architecturally, and more money might be made in the bourgeois Manhattan streets; but the inhabitants are equally alienated from their environment.",Shame
38,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Slow but powerful character study in sex addiction,8,14 June 2012,"Sex addiction has yet to get a serious film treatment until ""Shame,"" the sophomore feature from filmmaker Steve McQueen. Generally we feel inclined to put a comic spin on anything that taboo (see the adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's sex-addiction novel ""Choke""), but here we see how it ruins lives and relationships.Like any addiction, main character Brandon (Michael Fassbender) becomes preoccupied with sex, participating in everything from prostitution to Internet pornography to relieving himself in the bathroom at work. The film's first act is a long sample of how sex dominates most of Brandon's thoughts as he goes through a typical week, a character study in perversion but not one that demonizes his habit so much as displaying it for what it is. We don't feel bad for Brandon nor do we despise him. Shame, aptly, might be the most applicable emotion.As with any character study, a lot hinges on Fassbender's performance, and he delivers. Brandon isn't given a line of dialogue for what feels like ages at the beginning, yet Fassbender perfectly (albeit somewhat horrifyingly) telegraphs his internal thought process. McQueen is in perfect sync, injecting us into Brandon's brain as best he can by subtly sexualizing a lot of what Brandon sees. A sequence on the subway is entirely silent but especially powerful as Brandon eyes a woman across the way.Stretches of ""Shame"" will bore some viewers to death, but it's a sacrifice McQueen makes to convey the solitude and loneliness of a man with Brandon's condition. His lifestyle simply does not allow for extended periods of human contact or long-term relationships. When he makes efforts to do so in the film, it's painstaking for him. Much of the movie feels superfluous (it could rank among the longest 100 minutes in film history), but to some extent we cannot truly understand Brandon unless we are fully treated to that isolation, to a complete lack of interest in anything but sex or something that might lead to sex or sexual satisfaction.After our first series of trials observing Brandon, McQueen and co-writer Abi Morgan drop in Sissy (Carey Mulligan), Brandon's equally troubled (in a whole other way) sister. Her on-screen introduction features her completely nude and arguing with Brandon in the bathroom, which sets the table for their relationship. Sissy is the opposite of Brandon, a jazz singer completely dependent on human contact and emotional connection. Her intrusion on Brandon's life understandably causes him to get angry and emotionally volatile.Brandon is not entirely averse to change, but he struggles mightily with it. The third act is an experiment that achieves both positive and negative results and digs into the question of whether or not one can personally overcome something of this magnitude. Never, however, does the film confront its themes or questions through dialogue. Only once does Sissy even allude to Brandon's perversion, telling him he has no right to chastise anyone else's sexual choices.Fassbender and Mulligan ultimately anchor ""Shame."" Without them, the film would be deemed powerfully told, but completely un-engaging. Their raw performances and willingness to bare all physically and emotionally create the hook that makes such a brooding character study work. McQueen certainly deserves credit as well for working with them to create captivating performancesThe subject matter of ""Shame"" is not an easy one from a filmmaking perspective as well as a cultural one, but McQueen does an honorable job with it. He recognizes which traditional storytelling practices he must sacrifice in order to truly capture sex addiction tonally and emotionally.~Steven CThanks for reading!

39,Turfseer,Writer/director's second effort proves to be an uninspiring portrait of a sad sack sex addict,3,21 January 2012,"I'm still trying to figure out why this film has received so many accolades from the media. Perhaps it's director Steve McQueen's visceral style and the performer's intense performances. But none of this can make up for the vapid, manipulative screenplay, featuring characters we learn next to nothing about.McQueen's protagonist is 'Brandon', a sex addict who appears to be angry at the world for largely unknown reasons. The one thing that Brandon is clearly resentful about, is having to put his co-dependent sister, Sissy, up in his apartment. Sissy alludes to the fact that they were both abused as children but we never learn any significant details about the abuse. Sissy turns out to be a wholly unsympathetic character, a freeloader who expects her brother to take care of her.We end up getting a brief peek at Brandon's work world when we're introduced to his obnoxious boss, David, who flatters every woman he meets, and gets nowhere. In contrast, bad boy Brandon acts disinterested with the same women David tries to score with, and becomes an instant babe magnet. The best loser David can do is bed Sissy at Brandon's apartment, with the angry brother, seething, as he's forced to listen to the sounds of their lovemaking, from inside the bedroom.McQueen has an annoying habit of holding shots for too long. There's a wholly unnecessary scene where we see Brandon urinating in the bathroom from a distance. Ditto when Sissy sings an awfully slow rendition of 'New York, New York' during her gig as a lounge singer.Eventually, Brandon has a 'normal' date with Nicole but admits to her over dinner that the longest relationship he's ever had was four months. When he attempts to have sex with her, this time he's a complete flop, as he's unable to cope with the intimacy of a more genuine encounter.By now, we realize that Writer/Director McQueen has no additional aces to play. Brandon is hardly someone we can care about because McQueen doesn't know how to develop his characters. Yes, we 'get it' early on that Brandon is an emotionally stunted, cut-off individual who uses sex do dull his inner turmoil, just like any addict. After watching one mechanical sex scene after another, culminating in Brandon's particularly dull encounter at a gay sex club (which is supposed to represent the apotheosis of his desperate fixation), our sympathy for this loser of a protagonist, has reached its lowest nadir.Now McQueen aims to redeem Brandon through a decided, manipulative, sleight of hand. The police action in the subway station which Brandon is about to disembark at, leads one to believe that someone has jumped on to the tracks. Could it be sister Sissy? Brandon runs out of the station and up to his apartment, only to find that Sissy has opted for a much more conventional attempt at suicide—she's a bloody mess after slitting her wrists. It's taken the shock of almost losing his sister, to wake Brandon up. At film's end, director McQueen implies that Brandon will no longer be cruising the streets for his next pick up.Take away all the slick cinematography and one is left with the standard melodrama of a sad sack who can't stand himself and hates the world. McQueen, and other uninspired film makers like him, believes this is enough for character development. But for those who appreciate the craft of screen writing, only fully realized, BELIEVABLE and sympathetic characters, should populate the pages of a screenplay, the particular type, that truly deserves all the honors bestowed upon it.",Shame
40,billcr12,cold and dark,7,8 April 2012,"Steve McQeueen seems to be fascinated by Michael Fassbender's nude body because the director has him disrobe within the first two minutes of Shame, including a totally unnecessary shot of the star standing in front of a toilet, relieving himself after an encounter with a call girl in his apartment. Brandon(Fassbender) then rides a subway and a fellow passenger smiles at him, crosses her legs and so he places his hand touching hers on the handle near the exit doors. He follows her up the stairs but she disappears. Back at home he hears frequent messages from a needy caller. He meets a girl while drinking at a bar with co workers and they end up having sex up against a wall outside at the side of a street; so romantic. Turn out that needy caller is his sister, who he finds taking a shower at his place, and, guess what, it's Carey Mulligan, and she must have signed the same contract as Mr. Fassbender, because she is also nude.The next morning, Sissy(Mulligan) is in the kitchen wearing a thin t shirt with no bra and hugs her sibling from behind tightly; strange behavior I tell ya.Bro takes a friend he works with to watch his sis sing an extremely slow version of New York New York, and afterwards the happy trio head back to Brandon's abode and his buddy has carnal relations with Sissy in the next room. She moans in ecstasy, and he finally has the good sense to leave and go for a jog through the streets of Manhattan. Back at work, his boss informs our hero that his computers hard drive is filled with hard core pornography, which Brandon blames on a hacker.A black girl at his office arranges a date with him and at the restaurant this leads to the most interesting moment of Shame. She brings up a recent separation and he tells her that marriage is not a realistic goal and that the longest relationship he has had was four months. She is astonished at this revelation and they part at a subway stop. He gathers all the giant collection of Xxx tapes and magazines and throws them in the garbage. He attempts a normal sexual encounter with the black girl from the previous night but he is unable to connect with her and she leaves unfulfilled physically and otherwise. He reverts back to his previous kinky behavior, argues with his sister and more trauma follows. Fassbender and Mulligan are excellent, but in the end Shame is a cold and dark view of humanity.",Shame

Too many scenes connected to showering and several scenes showing urination - opposite to action movies where heroes never use the bathroom? The song New York, New york performed by Mulligan's character is terrible and annoying. Fassbender is excellent, of course, deserving Academy Award, and all actors have great bodies :) But the movie itself is over-appreciated.

42,freemantle_uk,The grim life of a sex addict,8,2 December 2011,"Steve McQueen made a real impact in the film world with his powerful debut Hunger. But like with musicians, there is always the risk that a director's second film will not live up to the high expectations the first effort sets. Yet McQueen has a good go with his dark exploration of human character in Shame.Brandon (Michael Fassbender) is a successful and well off man living in New York City. He is also a sex addict who constantly picks up women, hires prostitutes, views internet porn daily and masturbates at any given opportunity. It affects his day to day life and he lives a lonely existence. His life is made more complex when his singer sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan), a woman with obvious problems, crashes at his place. She interferes with his life, including sleeping with his boss, David (James Badge Dale) and sets Brandon off to tackle his addiction.Brandon is depicted as a really despicable character, but he is a man struggling with an addiction. There is a number of sexual scenes throughout Shame, but there is no eroticism as Brandon explores more depraved and disgusting acts and his life spirals out of control. Shame plays as a drug addition movie, similar to Requiem for a Dream as someone struggles to give up something hazardous.Fassbender offers a powerful performance as a dark, sinister man with strong interplay with Mulligan as he becomes threatening towards her. Compare him to Mulligan, a much more brittle character, on the edge for different reason. She gives a heartbreaking performance as a woman who does not know how to do deal with problems and has a sadness in her eyes. Their scenes were enhanced by McQueen's direction, using hand held cameras to follows Fassbender and the conversations stick to one point, making you feel like you are really watching them in a voyeuristic matter. This makes the movie more tense as the tone changes in an instant.McQueen employs a grainy filter, giving Shame a dark, grim look which is perfectly fitting considering the atmosphere of the movie. The visuals have a similar feel and tone as other gritty and grim New York set films such as Taxi Driver, Midnight Cowboy and American Psycho, all of which follow the horrible underbelly of the city. He has shown that he is a great actors' director, but McQueen also had some great visuals, such as a long tracking shot of Brandon jogging and Brandon watching two people having sex in their apartment.There are many moments in the movie that have little dialogue, relying on Fassbender superb abilities as an actor, particularly key in the beginning and during a long montage of Brandon wandering alone in New York, playing like a scene in the great novel Last Exit to Brooklyn. This is a movie about Brandon's continuing descent and self-sabotage and Fassbender should hopefully gain an Oscar nomination to back up his award buzz in Europe.Shame continues McQueen's reputation as being one of the best emerging directors around, sticking to his no holds barred, brutal style which keeps a stage play quality to the presentation. Shame is tough, but worthy just for Fassbender's performance and keeps to a tradition of grim New York based film.Please visit www.playeraffinity.com",Shame

Am I really supposed to take this decidedly-laughable tale about sex-addiction and the All-American Masturbator seriously? Eh? Am I? With a sneering, little title like ""Shame"", I'd sure like to know who the hell the self-righteous makers of this picture thought they were? Like, if I, myself, am a sex-addict, is seeing Shame really supposed to ""shame"" me into changing my tune? Well? Is it? And why is it that, in a strictly adult film such as this one, the censors allowed me to see a guy's penis (a flaccid one, of course), but, I'm not allowed to see a woman's vagina? Eh? Why? In my opinion - Right from the word ""go"", Shame's wafer-thin story was already running on empty. I swear that as they went along they were making up the story and all of its truly dreadful and clichéd dialogue, as well.I loathe movies where it takes someone resorting to a serious suicide attempt in order to get their loved-one (be it a brother, sister, or whoever) to start to show signs of caring about them.Shame's absolute lowest moment was when Sissy (the sex-addict's trashy sister) sang her half-assed cover of the song New York, New York - And at the end of this absolutely unbearable performance the audience in the bar literally went wild with approval. (Sheesh! - Spare me!) And, last, but not least - If this film's point was to make sex-addiction appear to be so shameful, and all, then, why the hell were the explicit sex scenes in the film the only scenes worth paying attention to? Eh? Why? As far as I'm concerned - This film offered one absolutely no attractive or worthwhile alternative to the ""so-called"" shame of sex-addiction. No, it didn't.",Shame
44,dfranzen70,Come see the world's dullest porno,3,11 January 2012,"Watching Shame is worse than the clichés of watching paint dry or grass grow, because in those instances you know there'll be some sort of satisfying conclusion, some point to it all. If there's a point to Shame, it's so subtle as to be apathetically invisible, which is so say you can't see it and it doesn't much care if you do. It features performances that range from stoic to histrionic, plot development that is nonsensical, scenes that drag on for no discernible reason, and awkward conversations that don't even show the promise of less-awkward conversations later on. It's a soulless, dead-eyed film. Brandon (Michael Fassbender) is supposed to be a porn addict who has gigabytes of the stuff on his PC at work and his laptop at home, plus a lot of magazines; he has anonymous sex with anyone he can find. He's a bit of a nihilist, not moving through life so much as wafting through it like an unpleasant odor. But his sex addiction, let's be frank, is really rather tame. There are probably millions of loner males who indulge in the same behavior. That is, this ain't the same guy played by Christian Bale in American Psycho or by Robert DeNiro in Taxi Driver. Brandon, a well-off exec at some Big Company, simply finds outlets for his desires, sometimes tempting danger, but never resorts to crime or anything requiring emotion. We're meant to take that to mean he's repressing something.Enter his sister, named – seriously – Sissy (Carey Mulligan). Our first glimpse of Sissy is her emerging, startled, from Brandon's shower; she's arrived unexpectedly (to stay) while he was at work. She is naked, and we see it all. We're supposed to be shocked, and we are. After all, Carey Mulligan is an up and coming star, and this is no stand in. Brandon's reaction is a little more of the enraged type, but he merely bottles it up and stomps away after closing the door. There's a lot of door slamming in the movie.Over the course of the movie, we get some clues to the nature of the siblings' relationship. They have been out of touch for some time, although Sissy does have her brother's apartment key. She's flirty and works as a torch singer in various New York clubs. He seems to be perpetually seething at her immature behavior. Is it because she's disrupting his happy fun time, or is it something moredecadent? The movie's title gives us an idea.The movie promises to be intriguing. Why have these two been apart? Where has Sissy been, and why does Brandon hold her in such contempt? We're supposed to assume that his constant masturbating and hooker- engaging portends something, a way perhaps of acting out an emotion or two. But what? We're never told. The hints are there, and one can make an educated guess to the root of the problems, but it's a fool's errand. It's not just that we might not find out the entire truth, we might not find out anything, period. That leaves us with two opposite characters who, under less-profane circumstances, could have starred in a buddy sitcom about mismatched roomies.The movie looks grimy and feels slimy. You want to take a long bath afterward, not a cold shower – despite the frequent sex and nudity. Sometimes, the movie shows us one thing, leading us to one conclusion, and then shows us a different conclusion. Whammo, you've been hit by a red herring. There's more depravity in here than there was in Abel Ferrara's Bad Lieutenant but without the compelling plot. Novice director Steve McQueen (no relation) seems to have little idea on how to end a scene, as long silences seem pointless rather than pointed. People stare at each other, then off into space, as if this meant something. Maybe it does. You won't care.Shame is an ugly mess. It's an unhappy, inconsolable wreck of a movie. It's not a train wreck from which one cannot avert one's eyes; it's just a generic wreck that is faceless, dispassionate, and distant.",Shame
45,meeza,Have Shame!,9,22 December 2011,"Director Steve McQueen's arousing film ""Shame"" is not for everyone; and I could see why many would be ashamed of it and why many would feel shame in liking it, but one cannot deny the brilliance of Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan's Oscar-worthy performances. ""Shame"" stars Fassbender as Brandon Sullivan, a New York executive who moonlights as a sex addict, and to think of it daylights as a sex addict also. Brandon's primary fixation with sex controls his lifestyle; he constantly masturbates, he reels in prostitutes, he is a sex-cam aficionado, his computers both at home and at work are a pornapalooza festival, and he swiftly hunts down his sexual female prey; call it just your modern day male humanoid. Brandon's lothario lifestyle does get rear-ended (ouch) when his sister Sissy makes a surprise visit. Sissy is a down-and-out aspiring singer who has made her share of mistakes throughout her life. She is relatively homeless so after some sissy begging, Brandon lets her stay at his place knowing that it will have a profound effect on his life. Brandon's boss is the egotistical David Fisher, who randomly goes out on the town with Brandon and other colleagues to try to fish down beautiful New York women, even though he is married. There is more to ""Shame"" than sex, just as there is more to sex than shame. Uhh? Just go with it Remember, I have no shame! Anyways, what I mean to communicate is that Director Steve McQueen does not bite the bullet with this one, ""Shame"" is primarily an excellent character study on the sex-obsessed psyche and its effects on a person's priority decision making, and McQueen nailed it! The film's screenplay was devoid of silliness and was orgasmic (sort of speak) with its masterful dialogue, thanks to McQueen and fellow scriber Abi Morgan. My only dead wood of ""Shame"" was that McQueen did go a bit overboard in one particular scene of the movie, but it did not diminish the film's climax. Fassbender is on fast track to be one of the best actors working today. His performance as Brandon was masterful and it would be a shame if he is not nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award. Carey Mulligan was also stupendous in her emotional role as sister Sissy. The score of ""Shame"" is one of the best of the year! It would be a shame if you miss out on the cinematic spectacle that is ""Shame"" ***** Excellent",Shame
46,MBunge,"In their own minds, this is probably what 1970s porno folks thought they were making. They were wrong.",7,24 July 2014,"When Carey Mulligan getting naked isn't the highpoint of your motion picture, you've really accomplished something. When your movie includes multiple full-frontal shots of Michael Fassbender's Magneto-dong and that isn't the lasting image left in your mind, you've made something pretty remarkable. And when you can fill up your film with long, single-camera shots of actors neither saying nor doing a whole lot and I'm not left squirming in my seat, you are an adept storyteller. The subject matter and style of Shame isn't for just anyone but anything this good will be enjoyed by a lot of people who wouldn't expect to.Brandon (Michael Fassbender) is a good looking guy in the big city working an undefined job at and undefined company. What is starkly defined is Brandon's sex addiction. From porn to masturbation to prostitutes to banging complete strangers and a whole lot more, Brandon's entire existence seems to revolve around doing things to, for and with his penis. That includes his relationship with his estranged sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) who forces her way into his life despite Brandon's every effort to ignore her. When he catches her naked in his shower and neither Brandon averts his eyes nor Sissy tries to cover herself, you know there's a damaged history with these two.That's not what Shame is about, though. It's not about a lot in most conventional senses. In lieu of a plot, director/co-writer Steve McQueen slowly peels the apple of Brandon's sexual compulsions until he's revealed to be an addict no different than most. Whatever pleasure sex used to give Brandon, he now needs greater and greater sexual extremes simply not to feel bad. His addiction consumes more and more of his life while losing any power to distract Brandon from his crushing misery.McQueen's filmmaking here is quite noteworthy. He doesn't tell us anything about Brandon. McQueen lets the audience discover it all for ourselves by showing us Brandon's actions, his inactions and the environment he's created for himself. Let me give you an example. After finding his sister nude in the shower, Sissy enters the kitchen the next morning to find Brandon making breakfast and her wearing nothing but a virtually see-thru t-shirt. When you watch them have ""normal"" brother-sister interactions with Sissy's nipple clearly visible, you realize the shower thing wasn't some bizarre event. A lack of sexual boundaries is fundamental to them and their relationship. Shame isn't shot like a stage play but with a largely static camera and very few, if any, cuts during its scenes, Shame is closer to a book than a movie in certain ways. It doesn't feel like McQueen is telling you a story. It's more like you're observing and deciphering things happening in front of you. His technique here is a reminder that fast edits and visual tricks can distance you from the emotional and intellectual heart of a film.Fassbender and Mulligan are great, with Mulligan perhaps shining a bit brighter because Sissy is able to express her needs more openly. James Badge Dale does a fine job as well as Brandon's boss, someone who's ineptness as a pickup artist and capacity to live a fully functional life is a wonderful contrast to Brandon's stunted manhood.Shame is very good. You might start watching it for the sex. You'll keep watching for the humanity.",Shame
47,estebangonzalez10,Fassbender and McQueen make for a great duo,8,10 January 2013,"¨We're not bad people, we just come from a bad place.¨It is a shame that Shame did not receive more love from the Academy voters last year because it truly is a powerful film with one of the best performances of the year coming from Michael Fassbender. This is the second time that Fassbender teams up with director Steve McQueen after his feature film debut, Hunger. That film opened up a lot of doors for both McQueen and Fassbender who have outdone themselves again with this raw and dark film about a man who is so addicted to sex and porn that he has completely lost touch with human interactions and relationships. On the surface he looks like a very successful man, living on his own in a nice apartment in New York and being congratulated for his work by his boss who enjoys hanging out with him at night and hitting on women. The viewer could assume that this man is very privileged, however from one of the early scenes we see how out of touch Fassbender's character really is to human interaction when he hits on a girl on a subway who is feeling uncomfortable with his glances. She tries to avoid contact with him showing him her ring and that she's married, but Fassbender completely misinterprets these signals and follows her, only realizing later that she is not hitting on him but rather running away from him. We later come to understand his character when he tries to go on a normal date with a co-worker and mentions how he doesn't believe in relationships. Many people probably don't consider sex an addiction, but McQueen makes a valid point here showing how negative and destructive it can be on a person by making them completely lose their touch on reality and human interaction. It is similar to Hunger in that the main character begins to lose touch with reality, but on a whole different level here. This film is rated NC-17 because of the strong sexual content, but believe me this is not a sexy or romantic film, it really shows you how addictive sex can be and the toll it can take on people when there is no love or relationships involved.Brandon (Michael Fassbender) seems to have a very successful life living in New York City and meeting a lot of attractive women. He seems to spend all day obsessed with sex however as we see him with prostitutes and looking at porn in his computer. From the very beginning we see how Brandon enjoys his life while delving into this sexual addiction he has. His boss David (James Badge Dale) even warns him that they have found a large amount of pornography on his computer in the office, but concludes that it had to be an intern that was playing a joke on him because it would take a very sick man to have all that filth on a computer at work. He ends up congratulating Brandon on closing a very important deal at the office and they decide to go out and celebrate with the rest of their co-workers. When David tries to hit on a hot looking girl in the bar, we see how Brandon manages to flirt with her without saying a word and ends up sleeping with her. Brandon seems to have a perfect life, he enjoys the control he has over his life and the fact that he doesn't have to have a serious relationship. However he loses that sense of control when his sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan) shows up at his apartment and asks him if she could stay with him for a couple of days. They share a very strange relationship, and Sissy seems to come with some baggage of her own, but you can tell that they love each other in a very bizarre way. Nicole Beharie plays Brandon's co-worker, Marianne, who goes out on a couple of dates with him and is probably the closest thing to a relationship that he has experienced in years.I already mentioned how well Fassbender and McQueen worked together in this film, but I also have to give credit to Carey Mulligan who gave a very strong performance here as well. She doesn't get as much screen time as Fassbender, but she holds her own next to his powerful performance. She even has a three minute scene that was shot in one take of her singing her own version of New York New York at a restaurant. She did a wonderful job here as well in this very complicated, dark, and raw human drama. The film plays out really well as this character study and explores sexual addiction in a very different light than most Hollywood films do. This shows you another side to sex and pornography in a very dark light. I think it will play out as a cult film in the same way Requiem for a Dream did. This film delves more on sexual addiction while the other one had to do more with drug addiction. I still can't believe Fassbender and Mulligan didn't receive Academy nominations for their strong performances here. This is a very powerful film, but probably not for all considering the dark subject matter.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Shame
48,arthur_tafero,Better Than Manhattan by Allen - Shame,8,20 October 2021,"Steve McQueen is a fine director, and he does some of his best work in this film. Michael Fassbender does a great job in the lead role and Carey Mulligan does a fine job as his neurotic sister. Brandon is a sex addict, a disease every bit as destructive as alcoholism or drug addiction. I personally know of someone who lived in Manhattan who went through a lot of the scenes this young man did. The music in this film is outstanding and is a bit reminiscent of the haunting theme of Hans Zimmer in one of his war films. Woody Allen had set the standard for films about New Yorkers with Manhattan, but this film is better and more accurate than Allen's. Catch it if you can, but be warned; it is fairly intense.",Shame
49,davispittman,Wonderfully acted film,9,30 November 2017,"Shame (2011) is actually the first NC-17 film I've ever seen. NC-17 is a very rare rating that the MPAA gives out. But I will say that this film earns it, be forewarned that there are very explicit sexual scenes with both full male and female nudity. Honestly this film needed to be explicit because of the film's content. The plot surrounds the character of Brandon, played by Michael Fassbender, who is a single man who lives in New York. He seems like a normal single man, but he is actually a sex addict, he has sex with anything that walks basically. He is always searching out sexual satisfaction. That satisfaction can either come in the form of masturbation or actual sex acts with other people. His life is interrupted when his singer sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) moves in with him for a period of time because she has nowhere else to go. This film focuses on two things. It focuses on Brandon and his addiction to sexual activity. And two, it focuses on Brandon's relationship with his somewhat dependent sister Sissy. I love how the filmmakers are able to accomplish both of these things so well. There are scenes where we as the audience don't hear a lot as far as dialogue goes, but we see the characters actions, and you are able to see what their lives are all about and we're taken into these people's minds. The performances by the two leads, Fassbender and Mulligan, are absolutely fabulous. I adored their acting and they do it in a way where the audience is sucked in and captivated by what's going on. This is an absolutely fabulous film and I suggest it 100%. I'll admit that this is isn't a movie for everyone. If you are uncomfortable with the subject of sex or with strong sexual content shown on screen then I'd say you need to stay away. 9/10 for Shame.",Shame

It is about sex addiction, and what could be more controversial than that. Of course, it is also a rated NC-17 movie for explicit sexual content, thus further bolstering its controversial reputation.""Shame"" tells about Brandon Sullivan (Michael Fassbender), a New Yorker who seems to be very successful in his career, but he is pathologically hampered by insatiable sexual urges that leads him to seek sex anywhere, with anyone. When his psychologically-fragile younger sister Cissy (Carrie Mulligan) comes to live with him, his routines are thrown into a loop. Can he take care of her and still deal with his own morbid addiction?The movie is very slow, almost lethargic, despite the supposedly ""exciting"" subject matter. There were several very long scenes that led nowhere like Cissy singing a languid ""New York New York"" or seeing Brandon urinating or walking around naked in his apartment. I was shocked to see Carrie Mulligan do what she did in her first scene in the shower! This is definitely NOT for everybody. It is not for me.",Shame
52,adamjohns-42575,What a shame!,3,16 January 2021,"Let's be honest shall we? Nobody tuned in to this film because the plot sounded good. We all turned up to see if the legends were true about Michael Fassbender's massive schlong. I certainly didn't ever think I'd like the story, but I did like what I saw of Michael. Maybe that's where all of Magneto's power comes from? Even the straightest men only watched this to see if it was real and to check out Carey Mulligan's foof.It's a shame that his penis is the only thing that is good about this film. Yes he gives a fairly good performance as always, but of someone that isn't particularly interesting or likeable.
The whole film is centred on the fact that he likes sex and so it shows grotesquely overlong sequences that actually take the titillating element away through boredom. Maybe that was the point, but some sort of conversation, ie with a counsellor or a friend or family member, regarding his issues, might have got the point across better.
It is actually quite painfully slow throughout and could be shortened to at least an hour and a half. The dramatic pauses feel like the editors forgot they were supposed to be cutting it down, having got stoned. And Carey's version of New York, New York was interminable. A seemingly never ending torture.I might have enjoyed it more, maybe appreciated the artistic value of the film if I hadn't been watching it with my Mother and Gruncle, but it's quite unlikely even then.Also, I noted that he runs and sometimes walks a bit funny. I suppose it must be quite hard with 3 legs? He must have to strap that thing down. At least he doesn't have to take poles when he goes camping? I could go on for days.Needless to say, I have visited the relevant sites and screenshot the bits I need to save for later, so that I don't have to watch this again.",Shame
53,dierregi,"Emotional troubles, more than sex addiction",5,15 January 2012,"This movie is a character study, following a few days in the life of a 30-something New Yorker with serious emotional troubles. Nowadays it is very fashionable to describe this type of man as a ""sex-addict"". However, sex is not a chemical substance and one cannot suffer withdrawal symptoms lacking sexual encounters.Brandon (played by Fassbender, a truly gifted actor, no pun intended) is a lonely man, with an office job whatsoever which affords him enough independence to indulge in a sad routine made of online porn and sexual encounters with prostitutes. One-night stands are also part of his repertoire, but he is otherwise unable to connect with other human beings.This inability to bond with fellow human creatures is causing him pain, but apparently not enough to push him to find a solution. Enters his emotionally unstable sister Sissy (played by Mulligan) and Brandon's gloomy life goes off balance. Sissy is just as emotionally unhealthy as her brother, but on the opposite side of the spectrum. She feels too much and would like to connect with everybody, even with her detached and creepy brother.While Brandon is portrayed as meticulously clean and well-organized, Sissy is chaotic and messy. Very soon the co-habitation of the two reaches boiling point. Explosion ensues. On paper sounds like an intriguing story, and the actors are indeed very good to portray two emotionally messed-up creatures in a cold and inauspicious New York.However there are some problems. Much was written about the Brandon-Sissy relationship, but in the movie there is not much of a relationship to speak off. The two appear busy getting on each other nerves or shouting insults at each other. It is difficult to understand why Sissy would consider moving in with somebody who clearly does not like her and cannot even be bothered to answer her phone calls.Some scenes are overlong, like Sissy singing a sad version of New York New York, the camera glued to her face; Brandon having dinner with a colleague without being able to connect (it is clear that his date finds him weird - move on); Brandon having a bad time during and orgy (again we got the point, thanks for moving on).Perhaps since the plot is so thin some of scenes are stretched. It is not a big fault, but a bit detrimental to an otherwise interesting – albeit gloomy – movie. In any case, not an Oscar-worthy masterpiece.",Shame
54,Samiam3,Holy Fassbender,8,3 December 2011,"With Hunger, first time director Steve McQueen showed that he had potential. With Shame, I think he's reached it already. This is the kind of heartless movie that could make you cry almost, considering perhaps how depressing it is to be the character's that Shame is about.Brandon Sullivan is the kind of white collar New Yorker with the office on the top floor of the building. Secure though he may seem from first glance, he is quite modest and non materialistic, but also isolated and very vulnerable. His only recreational indulgence is superficial sex with whomever, usually classy call girls.With each movie he makes, Michael Fassbender shows how diverse he is, and this movie, he carries beautifully. Fassbender brings authenticity and humanity to what is arguable a not very human character. It's almost like watching American Psycho without the panache. Brendan struggles with inner demons, which shut him down and then open him up again, creating a somewhat frightening and unpredictable character.The direction that Shame takes is to show us what happens to his life when his little sister moves in for the week. Carrey Mulligan shows a nice bit of range in the role. Her character was not all that original, which is why I found it smart of McQueen to present her using the smallest means possible; such as the way she performs in a glittery high rise lounge. She sings an optimistic classic tune, which a hint of pessimism.From a photography point of view the film aims for minimalism, and pulls it off nicely. The generally stagnant frame and long duration of McQueens shots shows that he pulls complete trust in the actors to carry the scene.In it's way, Shame is a dark masterpiece. The film is bold and unflinching yet it's told with maturity and refinement, and it gives Michael Fassbender a chance to bring his A-game. Which he does.",Shame
55,jadepietro,Sexual Heeling,5,12 December 2011,"This film is mildly recommended.Sex can be many things to many people. It can be passionate, wild, restrained, comforting, sublime, ridiculous, affectionate, hot. The one thing it should never be is boring ( that is, if you're doing it right ). And Shame isn't, but it is boring. Brandon Sullivan is a single attractive man living in New York City. He looks the part of the successful well respected man: stylish apartment, the best of clothes, a wicked night life, women at his beckoned call. Well, perhaps, too many women, as Brandon has a rather big problem handling all that attention and adoration. He is a sex addict. He loves porn, prostitutes, masturbation, one night stands, anything that can meet his sexual needs, any time, any day. At home, in the office, on the streets, anywhere.Suddenly, his private world is altered by the impromptu visit from his needy sister, Sissy, who is looking for some temporary lodging. The siblings are diametrically opposed to each other in their views and habits: Sissy feels too deeply and Brandon doesn't feel at all. Sissy yearns for love and affection in the guise of casual sex, hoping to find Mr. Right as soon as possible, while Brandon only wants sex with no complications. He isn't remotely interested in love or real affection to complete his life. The film has a NC-17 rating. Its director, Steve McQueen, refused to make any cuts to his film ( and rightfully so! ). Shame is an adult drama about adult themes and can be brutally honest in its depiction of sex addiction. It is filled with explicit nudity and many sexual acts. One has to admire McQueen's fortitude and lack of compromise with a difficult subject. He does a nice job composing the shots without the big ""money shot"". Unfortunately, once he firmly establishes Brandon's destructive pattern of behavior, McQueen allows each scene to linger at a languishing pace. ( Talk about a slow hand! ) Yet with such an intriguing and compelling topic, he sucks all the joy out of the film's sexual candor and makes a thin and unappealing clinical case study of a sex addict and his need for instant gratification. With all the Kama Sutra positioning, full frontal nudity, and simulated sex scenes, Shame never registers any pulse or any emotion for that matter. The fault is mainly in its script, also written by McQueen ( and Abi Morgan ). With his minimalist dialog approach, the film's enigmatic characters show no depth. His screenplay chooses not to provide any background exposition for the dysfunction of the siblings and relies on the actor's instinct and improvisational lines to add a gritty realism to his tale. At one point, the main character, usually speaking in clichés, states that actions speak louder than words. That seems to be the philosophy of its director, who seems more concerned in depicting the sexual acts and creating the visual look of the film rather than fleshing out his characters and needed story lines about their odd relationship. It would be hard to recommend this film were it not for the exemplary acting of Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan in the main roles. Their performances are fearless and unabashed in their honesty. Fassbender, in particular, has much to offer in his portrayal ( and not only in the physical sense ). The actor tries to fill in the sketchy void he is giving to play and brings a startling clarity and complexity to his part. Mulligan again brings a vulnerability and quirkiness that enlivens her character, although she is becoming typecast with these victimized women roles of late. In one memorable scene, this talented actress sings an interesting if stripped down, ( and extremely slow ) version of New York, New York that never really builds to any emotional conclusion. My description of that rendition perfectly sums up this film, word for word and note for note. It's a shame that Shame never completely satisfies its voyeuristic goals or its audience.

56,EdgarST,Sex Melodrama,6,3 August 2012,"Perhaps unfairly to Steve McQueen's ""Shame"", I watched it last night a few hours after I saw Laurent Hasse's documentary ""Le bonheur: terre promise"" (2011), a much simpler and satisfying film that deals with true feelings. Compared to films as Hasse's documentary (and Théo Court's ""Ocaso"", Alejandro Fernández Almendras' ""Huacho"", Lucrecia Martel's ""La niña santa"", among others) that enter the spaces of noble spirits, showing their fragility, artifacts as ""Shame"" seem too prefabricated and mannered. As it is well stated in a scene where Brandon, the protagonist, attends a meeting in which someone talks about the social effects of internet (including Brandon's avid consumption of every virtual pornographic offer), cynicism has become a cause of awe among people, including film audiences who take this as great art. The film does not lack a brilliant initial spark, which needs to be exposed, discussed and analyzed frankly on films: sex addiction. But it gets lost in old formulas, clichéd discourses and jaded images that make it lose impact. It is true that what screenwriters McQueen and Abi Morgan came up with as ""solutions"" is evidently based on things we human beings usually do, desire or imagine. But in the final act there is such an overwhelming accumulation of negative events, from the moment on when Brandon asks his sister Sissy to get out of his apartment, that ""Shame"" reaches a melodramatic surfeit that weakens the possibility of a high-leveled dramatic final effect. In the end it says nothing, neither to the sex addict nor to the common folk. The film is as exhibitionist as it is voyeuristic, but at the same time it is not explicit enough (if there is one film that needs a bit of explicitness, this is a good contender), also applying the suggestive tactic to the incestuous subtext. In the end ""Shame"" seems a foolish display of gross impersonal sex that sheds no light on its main subject, that may excite a few, and works as a futile effort on the limits of soft pornography.",Shame
57,p-stepien,Sexual despair,7,26 August 2012,"Nonchalant and reserved Brandon (Michael Fassbender), a successful corporate ad specialist, leads a derelict life focused around matters of sex, somewhere deep in sexoholism territory with lunch-time breaks for bathroom onanism a regular habitual occurrence. Set in his ways of sexual adventures a visit from his sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) invites a degree of change, which disrupt the comfort zone safeguarding his sexual behaviour.Michael Fassbender in a mind-boggling full-frontal role filled not only with several peeks at his manhood, but also with an in-depth performance on a higher level of acting artistry. Confined within the on-screen tension of self-defeating restraint Fassbender delivers yet another tour-de-force performance full of uncontrollably controlled emotionality. Opposing him a stand-out backing role by Carey Mulligan highlighted by a terrifyingly disturbing rendition of ""New York, New York"" (yes, you heard me right).Inasmuch as the acting Oscar nomination snubs for Fassbender and Mulligan are proof of undying Hollywood hypocrisy, the movie itself comes off limited and essentially threadbare. Sissy basically functions as an manipulative instrument for bringing in emotional turmoil and a premise for unnecessary drama, whereas the director omits any in-depth analysis into the issue of sexoholism, diverting its attention to cyclical nudity and cumbersome dramatism by overfilling Fassbender's character with tragedy left unspoken. Little analysis or character study lurks within the script and focus diverts to exposure (showing the issue, not dealing with it). Ergo character study is thrown out the window, an cumbersome wanton burden to the director, most interested in wringing out strong reactions from viewers. On the shoulders of this emotional exploitation ""Shame"" delivers little credible punch with several false notes, but lingers through its strong cast, which heightens the overall quality of the experience.",Shame

Then he goes wild, touching up a slut in a bar and storming into a gay club for some relief. Patrick Bateman lite, without the humour.There's lots of humping in this, but the only erotic bits are in the are-they/aren't-they moments with the sister, and the touching up scene. It's all good, although I thought the touching up could have been spectacular with a long, uninterrupted view of the whole sequence, including the sexual electricity and the beating.The ending is inconclusive, but turns out he's not a lost cause. The sister? Well, they could have looked at the notion that self-harm gives an endorphin release, making her more interesting than ""screwed up heart of gold"".I didn't see the point of Bach on piano in the soundtrack, and the phrasing of NYNY while nice was not inspiring.

His addiction of sex is interrupted when his young troubled sister comes and stays with him. He starts losing control and cannot tolerate her in his life. Mr. McQueen has presented Shame in most Shameless manner. He didn't even blink for a second in presenting the most riveting or shocking truth or manners of human sexuality. There are multiple scenes which raise questions between the weird relationship between Brandon (Michael Fassbender) & his sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan). For example, when Brandon enters his apartment, thinking someone has break in to the apartment and accidentally walks into his sister who screams and stand up naked in front of him. In this scene not even for a second both realize or try to walk away from this weirdness. That shows how much things are open between these siblings. There are many scenes like when Sissy walks into Brandon, while he is masturbating or entering his bed half naked or kissing and having sex with his boss right next room to his brother are shocking. There are many many things in this movie which are never seen or shown on cinema e.g I've never seen a main protagonist of the movie shown peeing openly. (I think only McQueen could have done that). Michael Fassbender delivered the finest performance of his career and his Oscar snub will remain a shocker. I still cannot believe that demine Rice gets nominated for his goody goody predictable acting and Michael Fassbender gets ignored by the academy. Carey Mulligan never disappointed and its amazing how nicely she transforms herself into the character given, she even doesn't put lots of make-up fit into the role. It's only and only her acting that makes her different in all of her movies from An Education to Never Let me Go to Drive to now Shame. Nicole Beharie is really charming. Shame is almost perfect in presenting the sexual addition in the society, but my major problem with the movies these days is not giving the proper ending to the story and leaving for the audience to decide the end. P.S At this time on top of my mind is with ambiguous ending movies is Andrew Garfield's ""A Boy"", then Anton Yelchin & Felicity Jones's ""Like Crazy"" then recently Liam Neeson's ""The Grey"" and now Michael Fassbender & Carey Mulligan's ""Shame"".

63,frankde-jong,"There are a lot of films about sex and a lot of films about addiction, but films about sex addiction are really scarce",7,26 August 2021,"There are a lot of films about sex, and there are a lot of films about addiction. Examples of films about addiction are ""The lost weekend"" (1945, Billy Wilder, alcohol), ""The man with the golden arm"" (1955, Otto Preminger, drugs) and ""Leaving Las Vegas"" (1995, Mike Figgis, alcohol).Films about sex-addiction however are scarce. The theme is a courageous choice of director Steve McQueen and lead actor Michael Fassbender.It is only naturally that someone addicted to sex seperates this sharply from love. Looking at the facial expressions of Brandon (the lead character played by Michael Fassbender) during a sex scene, he even separates sex from pleasure. It looks like he is not having fun but is only giving in to a compulsive behaviour.In this respect the films differs from ""Eyes wide shut"" (1999, Stanley Kubrick), the only other film I can think of that comes close to the subject of sex addiction. ""Eyes wide shut"" ""limits"" the addiction in making only a sharp distinction between sex and love. More precisely in ""Eyes wide shut"" the main character thinks that only men can seperate sex and love and that these two are inseperable for women. He is shocked when he finds out the opposite.The second lead character in ""Shame"" is Sissy, the sister of Brandon played by Carey Mulligan. Her character enriches the film in two ways.In the first place she too has emotional problems, although very different ones from Brandon. One suspects a single root cause situated in the upbringing of the two. Director Steve McQueen is wise enough to make this not very explicit.In the second place the relationship with Sissy is the first one in which Brandon invests some kind of commitment. This is a family relation and not an amorous one. In this way the film avoids that in the end sex and love finally come together, even for Brandon. This sort of happy end would, in my eyes, be out of place for this unconventional film.",Shame

Even more so, let me pay its creator the ultimate compliment: if I could get films of my novels made I'd want McQueen to direct them. Shame is great art, and hopefully it will do for the NC-17 rating what Midnight Cowboy did for its predecessor X rating- earn some major Oscar nominations and damn the puerile American film ratings system for good. Another plus it bears is, given that the whole cast, save for Marianne, is white, and set in America, that this film reaches such heights, directed by a black Brit, making it all the more remarkable, and a good herald for a time when, hopefully, in a few decades, critics like me won't even have to mention such things, for, Steve McQueen shares far less in common with hack filmmakers of all backgrounds, especially black hacks like Spike Lee, and for that little bit of heaven I can only end this review as I started it.",Shame
65,napierslogs,Shameful characters learning about themselves and each other,8,9 January 2012,"There's a lot to be ashamed of in ""Shame"". But are the characters actually ashamed of their actions? That's an interesting question which the film attempts to answer. Brandon (Michael Fassbender) is a sex addict; Cissy (Carey Mulligan) is Brandon's wayward sister and is a needy drama queen; David (James Badge Dale) is Brandon's boss and is an offensive womanizer. These aren't easy characters to like or even necessarily care about, but they certainly are compelling.Brandon is introduced to us as a very cold person. He does what he wants despite how taboo his hobbies are. We have been taught that what he does is very inappropriate. But is it really wrong of him to live for himself and only for himself? If the film was as perfect as I would have liked it to be, the answer would be no. Problem is, he doesn't live only for himself. He downloads porn at work and at least we can see the concern on his face when his computer gets shipped off to the IT department. And then his sister, Cissy, enters the picture.A lot of people have praised Michael Fassbender's performance, and rightly so as he subtly draws your attention to the varied nuances of his modern and successful and yet troubled character. Surprisingly, not as many people have been talking about Carey Mulligan's performance. She tore me apart with the power she gave to Cissy's fickle feelings. Quickly, and sometimes quietly, she turned the film into a story about a younger sister's need for an older brother rather than the struggles of a sex addict.Of course ""Shame"" is still a character study. And it really does proceed as you would expect character studies to go: slowly, thoughtfully and quietly (except for when Cissy is breaking up with and simultaneously declaring her love for her current boyfriend on the phone).

The film is directionless and completely unrewarding from the audience's perspective. What's in this film for the viewer?

67,brchthethird,A sobering portrayal of sex addiction,8,14 November 2014,"This is a sobering character study of a lonely man, with affecting performances by Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan. Although at times it felt the film was wallowing in its own misery, it still felt very real and hit close to home emotionally and psychologically. The story follows a man named Brandon, played by Fassbender, who either is afraid of intimacy, or prefers not to be intimate, but who fulfills his sexual desires by basically being a man-whore. However, his life starts to come apart once his sister moves in with him unexpectedly. This disrupts the life he's constructed for himself, and as a result, takes him to some very dark places. There is a glimmer of hope as he attempts to build a relationship with a co-worker, but that too ends because of who he is, or has become. What I especially like about the film is that it dares to show things explicitly that others would only hint at. It's fearless in that way. I also liked the depth of character as Fassbender portrays a man who is forced to confront himself and his whole modus operandi. He's forced to think about other people besides himself, and to see how his actions (or inaction) affects those around him. Overall, this is a brilliant film by a relatively new director, Steve McQueen (no, not that one). Highly recommended, but for adults only.",Shame
68,sharky_55,We're not bad people. We just come from a bad place.,8,29 July 2017,"Steve McQueen made his debut with Hunger, which held up a microscope to the hunger strikes of Bobby Sands and IRA co, and made political protest into exquisite martyrdom. Faeces was smeared onto walls in mesmerising, concentric circles. Urine trickled out from under doors like a cascade, in an almost silent, unblinking long take. Never had starvation been given such serene treatment. The decay of Fassbender in that film was purely physical, a pivotal political icon reduced to a withering shell. And to a lesser extent, Shame is also guilty of that touch of extra elegance. The beginning and end of the film is bookmarked by Harry Escott's haunting soundtrack, which sounds as if it was personally in mourning. Yet in the meat of the story, as Brandon's addiction and life unravel, it is a classical accompaniment that smothers the most visceral moments. His insides are churning, his mind running a million miles as he listens to his sister having sex with another man. He is aroused by this, and ashamed by this arousal. He must leave, and pours his frustrations into sprinting around the block instead. But what should be as aggressive as his mindless thrusting is watered down by a tinkling piano, and a heavy moment is made lightweight. Fassbender, to his credit, is fully committed to scrubbing the film clean of any sexual enticement. On any other day he might be a winter wear model himself, with those piercing eyes and windswept hair, but the numerous sexual conquests dangled in front of him only provide brief respite. The editing makes sure of that, cutting to and away from murky street trysts with hardly a moment to even orient the viewer, let alone allow them to savour it. Early on the camera caresses coworker Marianne, and she returns the favour as they struggle between the sheets, tenderly running her hands over his face and scalp, drinking in his gaze. But Brandon is unable to process intimacy like this, having scarcely been this close with his sister let alone an acquaintance, and his body rejects the idea. That scene builds upon an earlier one which lays out the attraction as a mutual, but also purely physical. The dinner date is a masterpiece of timing and body language, of nervous chuckles and furtive glances. Their dialogue dribbles from opening small talk to a quietly desperate attempt to find any semblance of similarity, to no avail. If she had a cat, he'd have a dog, and her final goodbye expresses a sentiment he is all too familiar with. He sees dating as a means to an end, and sex as the drip that allows him to last until the next encounter. Brandon presents himself as sleek and successful, his apartment a sterile front to hide his degeneracy. Hurricane Sissy arrives to threaten that image, and with her returns a backlog of traumas thought to have been hidden away. When he hears her moaning pleasurably in the other room he spews vitriol and venom, but some of that anger is directed at himself and his inability to experience the same. When they hurl spit and insults at each other Brandon must will himself to not make the wrong move; he doesn't know whether to hit her or bend her over. He all but straddles her after she catches him masturbating, and her laughter is like a slap to the face of his denial. Mulligan is Fassbender's antithesis. While he conceals and festers she doggedly pursues, never minding the fact that her past has left her ill-equipped to stabilise and find peace. McQueen offers her the film's most audacious moment, a near five minute unbroken closeup of a performance in which she bares her soul, practically pleading for an inkling of hope, begging the city of lights to respond, and seemingly awakening a part of Brandon that has been long buried. That McQueen immediately follows this tenderness with a humiliating sucker punch is a testament to his daring. It is as close to a human being as Brandon has been for years, and now she is in bed with another man. He returns to staring at strangers' wedding rings. It is in the climax of the film that both brother and sister willingly throw themselves into oblivion, having once again decided that the scars they bear are too great to be overcome. Brandon's vice is characteristically showy; not one or two but three lovers, including a man, tangled in an embrace of frozen ecstasy. But 'lovers' must be the wrong word. Brandon has had sex too many times, but has love ever been the focus of them? Over the shuddering bodies is a line so simple and sparse that it rings truer than any of McQueen's flourishes. The confession is what breaks the cycle. There is urgency in his step. There is care for another human being. There is an acknowledgment of grief, and perhaps even change.",Shame
69,KnightsofNi11,Intense,9,20 December 2011,"The NC-17 is notoriously difficult to take seriously because of its explicit connotation. NC-17 is rarely thought of as being a rating one could attribute to an art film. But director Steve McQueen didn't let these misconceptions get the better of him when he made Shame, a film that attempts to legitimize the NC-17 rating as something that can be given to a film of a higher calibre than pornography. Shame stars Michael Fassbender as Brandon, a man who lives with a terrible sex addiction, but one he has learned to cope with. However, things get complicated when his sister, Sissy, played by Carey Mulligan, comes to live with him. Sissy's arrival sends Brandon into a downward spiral as his simple and straightforward life begins to crumble around him and his terrible addiction begins to catch up to the things that matter. Rarely do we see this kind of sexual intensity on screen, at least not in a way that can be taken so seriously and be so unsettling.This is simply one of the most provocatively powerful films I have ever seen. The intensity is so raw and so real, and the film such an unsettling portrayal of sex. It's daring and dangerous, never holding back and never withdrawing before things get really heated. It draws out every scene, dragging us into the quiet madness and chaos of Brandon's life. Even the simplest scene maintains some undertone of subtle intensity that keeps you on the edge of your seat. We delve so deep into Brandon's mind and his life that develop an uncomfortable attachment to the character, one that we can't shake and don't necessarily want to. It's amazing what this film does to your mind and the way it works on your senses. It's a film you can't take your eyes off of as you absorb every brilliant thing about it. It's masterful filmmaking achieved through one of the most provocative stories you will ever witness.You have to give this film credit for being able to maintain such a consistent level of intensity. No moment of the film feels safe from what lies underneath, and there is no breathing room that allows us to escape the disturbing downward spiral we are forced to travel along. Shame is absolutely amazing in what it achieves. It's an unforgettable film whether you love it or hate it. It's a work of art that turns sex into something so thrilling and so disturbing. There are things in this film you will not see coming, and you can't really prepare for what Shame entails. Only know that it is intense, but also masterfully artistic. It's a psychological whirlwind packed into a visually brilliant montage of sexual art. Shame is like nothing you've seen before, and I'm prepared to call it a harrowing masterpiece.",Shame

This year it is ""Shame"". The biggest shame is this was made and released. Another shame is Carey Mulligan, a talented actress, appears nude in this career side track.There isn't much dialogue. Not much needs to be said about a sex addict who can't ""do it"" with anyone he likes. He must not like himself much as he does it mostly with himself.The dialogue is atrocious and actually includes a waiter telling the specials. Many of conversations are shot from behind the actors. You would think that would provide an opportunity to dub intelligent or meaningful dialogue at another time. It didn't happen.Repeated subway rides, the painfully slow, extremely long ""New York, New York"" song and a long run through the streets assure a spot on most ten worst lists.

71,joebloggscity,Provocative film on the empty life of a man who has everything yet has nothing...,8,7 April 2012,"This ain't no feel good movie. 'Shame' is a voyeuristic look at the life of one unsatisfied man. On the surface he's got the lot. The great job, cracking apartment in NY, young, handsome, virile and attractive with all the material vanities that you'd ever need. Hangs out at some of the swankiest nightclubs and he can get any woman he wants. Yet it's not working. His life is vacuous, and his escape is sex in whatever form he can get it: picking up women from bars, pay for prostitutes, watch porn on the web, pay for live cam action on the web etc. It's his belittling way to get a quick hook to relieve the depression and pain. He wants to escape but seems trapped in his own personal hell. Michael Fassbender is terrific as our lead who is locked in this perfect yet unsatisfying life. His sister crashes into his world and they are two peas in a pod. Watching them is like watching a car crash you know is about to just happen. The greatest star is the camera work. Dazzling us with some great work, such as one scene where we follow him as he chases a woman he takes a shine to on a train. This film is really is a set of lessons for any budding film maker. Be warned, this film does not take half measures on sex. Graphic and explicit, some may not be impressed. There's lots of sex and nudity, and little is on tame side. This is a very provocative film. It won't appeal to everyone. There's next to no humour and few will find any of the characters likable. You will pity them as the story unfolds, but this is no redemption story. It's a sad and disturbing story, a critical story of our modern age.A great film that those willing to give it a try will find to be worth it.",Shame
72,itamarscomix,A lot of fuss over nothing,6,13 May 2012,"I wanted to like Shame more than I did, honestly. Halfway through I was considering giving it an 8 or a 9, but by the end I had to admit to myself that it just wasn't that good.I applaud director Steve McQueen for trying to tackle a subject as tricky and controversial as sex addiction. Even more than that, I applaud Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan for agreeing to appear in a film like this. Fassbender and Mulligan actually deliver wonderful, painful performances that alone make the film worth watching. McQueen's directorial job is powerful too; there are several scenes in Shame that are truly gorgeous and haunting, and stayed with me a long time after watching. On the surface, Shame looks and sounds great.The script is where it begins to fall apart, but it's far from being the film's only - or worst - weak spot. The big problem with Shame is all over - it's the sense of emotional detachment. It may make some sense considering the film's themes, but it's a big problem with a film that hinges on our ability to sympathize and relate to the characters, and to feel their pain; Shame left me completely cold. I never felt any attachment to Fassbender's character, and I was never convinced that he's as miserable as he's portrayed. Worse, his addiction never felt real - there's nothing to indicate that he really can't resist the urge to have sex constantly, he just comes off as selfish, indulgent and misanthropic. None of this is Fassbender's fault - he does amazing things with the scenes he has. The problem is that while some scenes are truly powerful and effective, everything in-between does nothing for the viewer, and nothing helps to immerse him in the characters.Shame is definitely worth watching - from a filmmaker's perspective there are some precious lessons here, and some scenes work terrifically well as short segments. Don't bother watching it for the sex - nothing about it is arousing or very shocking, in fact there's a lot less of it than the hype and controversy might make you expect.",Shame
73,abisio,Not a masterpiece but worth seeing,8,2 January 2012,"SHAME's NC-17 rating; is another example of the double moral and standard that is destroying the cinema industry in USA. MPAA has created a world where violence and gore are good and welcome, but sex and nudity are very very bad and punished with NC-17 and the refusal of distributors and theaters to show them. Which is rather stupid when you see same movie in many empty auditoriums while refusing to play a film targeted for adults. In this particular case, distributors used the rating for their own benefit, suggesting a more sexualized and shocking movie than it really is. There are some (brief) sexual moments but compared others like REALM OF THE SENSES (Japan), 9 SONGS, INTIMACY (British imports like this one), or less explicit fare like SEX AND LUCIA or ROOM IN ROME (both from Spain) the movie is really tame. The movie is suggested to be about sexual addition; but it is not true. It is about human insecurities, selfishness and lack of understanding of other people problems; even when ours are the same or worse. The main character is a sex addict. He likes to have sex with women (or internet porn); but we never see him committing any act of violence, abuse or diminishing on women. In fact, he is so captivating that he can pretty much seduce any women around (even when expressing his lack of interest in commitment). He could be a cake or sweets addict for what it matter; but obviously the movie will lose its appeal. Brandon has issues; but has learnt to live with them. He has a good job in a normal company (with the typical stupid boss that wants to be ""one of the guys"" but is continuously showing off), an awesome apartment (he must be making a lot of money to pay that rent). One day, his depressed (and needy ) sister, he is trying to avoid, installs in his apartments. The invasion of privacy upsets and shames him (he is caught in self-gratification mode) . He tries to change but keep but become more aggressive with her. She is basically a younger and inexperienced version of himself. The movie is really very good, however as many ""art"" films, there are scenes unnecessary long like the full NEW YORK, NEW YORK song (Carey sings very well but the song is not really motivating for other than New Yorkers), or the un-erotic MENAGE A TROIS filmed trying to suggest without really showing anything too sexually explicit. And that is my big criticism with Steve Mc Queen. He did not dare to cross the line as Winterbottom did with 9 SONGS. I am pretty sure Fassbender (in performance deserving any possible award) should go a little further. In fact Mulligan (in a role that seem written for her ) did it.As many ""ART"" movies, SHAME could not be taken literally. Yes, the main character has a sexual obsession (or addition), but the movie Is really about the incapacity to accept our problems while criticizing and judging other people similar defects; and above all, the selfishness and destructive tendencies, tied up with obsessions in our day to day life. We see Brandon as a ""sexual addict ""; he has sex with hookers, looks internet porn and sexual chat; but he is not a psycho. He is a quiet (very few words) person; charismatic enough to seduce many women around him.",Shame
74,tonypeacock-1,No shame in exploration of sexual addiction,8,22 January 2021,"I didn't know what was in store with this film just a basic premise of a character with a sexual addiction.That character is Brandon (Michael Fassbender), a New York singleton who we see in several scenes that to some audiences are pornographic in nature.Brandon is a thirty something, office worker who lives alone in a Manhattan apartment.The film shows Brandon's hypersexuality in several scenes that start to impact on his work life.Another complication is the appearance of Brandon's sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan) who has her own demons of mental health issues.Fassbender and Mulligan deliver excellent performances. Fassbender reunites with director Steve McQueen who directed him in the excellent 2008 film, Hunger about IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands.Troubled Sissy starts to impact Brandon's single lifestyle and his demons, walking in on him in the bathroom mid masturbation for example.The bathroom door either doesn't have a lock or it isn't used as in an earlier scene Brandon walks in on a naked Sissy!We see Brandon use prostitutes, a gay club sequence as well as several masturbation scenes that show the full extent of sexual addiction, something that is rarely explored unlike traditional addictions such as alcoholism, gambling and substance misuse.Sissy's mental health problems are a mirror of Brandon's own issues culminating toward the film's end.Definitely, an adult only film exploring issues rarely explored. It is only films like Eyes Wide Shut, or going back further to the 1970s Last Tango In Paris that explore 'adult' issues.",Shame
75,CountZero313,"not an excess of sex, but a lack of emotion",9,3 February 2012,"Brandon leads a compartmentalized life. He is good at his job, and manages to handle his boss without getting too involved. He has banter with his colleagues and it is all on a very superficial level, just as he likes it. They call each other 'slacker' or other insults, but we never learn their names. Women enter and leave his life at the time of his choosing, and those times roll around frequently. Family are conspicuous by their absence. Until, that is, his sister Sissy becomes a very conspicuous presence, and starts to destroy the carefully managed boundaries that Brandon has created.McQueen's examination of sex addiction is an unflinching dissection of a condition more mocked than pitied. Part of the problem is that ""sex addiction"" is a misnomer, framing the problem in terms of a need for constant sex, a stance that has most men responding in terms of 'if only.' The essence of the problem is not an excess of sex, but a lack of emotion, an inability to relate to another human being with consideration and respect, a problem whose core is a lack of self-worth and self-esteem in the perpetrator. The triumph of Shame is its accurate portrayal of this essence, through its excoriating examination of Brandon's lifestyle. Seldom has there been so much sex and so little sexiness in a film. Near the film's end, Brandon is in the midst of an orgy with beautiful, willing women. The camera moves to close-up mid-coitus. Brandon's eyes glaze over; where there should be ecstasy there is only pain. And emptiness. That one shot encapsulates the suffering of the sex addict.Fassbender nails the part 100 percent. He has the charm, the good looks, and the unsettling chill that defines such men. Carey Mulligan as the disconcerting Sissy plays off Fassbender's cool bravura perfectly, with her manic antics and needy whining. Equally damaged, we wonder at the childhood that brought these two to such a crippling impasse. Parental abuse? Incest? All are hinted at, but while the familial dysfunction is there for all to see, the backstory remains rigidly absent. Parents, other siblings, past events, are never mentioned. Brandon cries when his sister sings. She parades naked before him. Something, somewhere, went badly wrong for these two. Sissy thinks they can heal each other. Brandon knows they can only make each other worse.As in Hunger, McQueen pares the narrative down to that which can be visually conveyed. You leave the cinema with as many questions as answers, in the thought-provoking sense, rather than incomplete narrative sense. I had to see it twice to appreciate the full impact. This is mature filmmaking, executed with style and restraint.",Shame
76,Likes_Ninjas90,"Everything in this film, including the sex, has purpose and intention",9,14 February 2012,"Brandon (Michael Fassbender) is a man addicted to sex. Living alone in his New York apartment, his life is entirely circular. He meets with hookers, women on the Internet, women in bars and then goes to work in his office, where his computer is also littered with pornography. However, the careful order of his life is disrupted when his sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) comes to stay with him. He has tried to ignore all her messages but she lets herself into his apartment uninvited. She is extremely messy and also finds company with Brandon's sleazy boss David (James Badge Dale), which upsets him too. The unspoken past between the siblings adds further damage and tension to their relationship. Brandon must decide whether he is going to continue with his own lifestyle of no commitment or make more effort to help his sister.When I went to see Shame what surprised me was the number of middle-aged women watching the film in the audience. On paper Steve McQueen's film sounds like a blokes movie. The title 'Shame' is said to be a reference to the feeling a man experiences once he has ejaculated. Yet the subject of sex here is not for casual exploitation. McQueen is too intelligent for that. He is a trained visual artist and a director who has already challenged us with films like Hunger (2008). Everything in this film, including the sex, has purpose and intention. This is courtesy of the director's unique formal properties and composition that build a world of stasis, followed by an unwilling removal from that safety zone. Brandon's apartment and office are both filmed with white, sterile tones and large panes of glass. These are the cold, physical barriers that disconnect him from sustainable human connections. He is a character who is not interested in making long-term relationships with women but is content with brief sexual encounters and fleeting moments of pleasure. His cyclical nature is reflected in the opening scenes as he walks past the same still shot naked, the steady framing showing his stability and control. Outdoors, he is much the same because he wears one grey coat for most of the film, showing his repression and unchanging ways, but perhaps also an attempt to mask his shame too. His intensity is both an attraction and detriment towards women. His unflinching gazes makes a girl on a train deeply uncomfortable but there is also a very funny scene in a bar where he and his boss meet a group of women but only he succeeds. After trying and saying absolutely everything, his boss David fails because he lacks Brandon's control and self-assurance in knowing exactly what he wants and finding people who match that desire. Fassbender, unlucky to not be nominated for an Oscar, is astonishing in the haunting and intense qualities he gives this character, followed by savage outbursts of anger to counter his repression. Sissy is Brandon's polar opposite and provides the perfect contrast to the controlled and isolated lifestyle. Mulligan in her brief career has proved to be an actress of great emotion and innocence. She is one of the most promising young talents but we've never seen Carey Mulligan like this before. She gives us something unique to her personality: flamboyance. Due to her entirely erratic nature Sissy is completely disruptive to Brandon's structure. Inviting herself in unannounced, she has a bath and plays records at full blast, drinks straight from a carton out of the fridge and becomes blindly entangled with Brandon's boss. These details build a picture of someone who is subconsciously disruptive of other people's spaces, which is a lot like Brandon, only in a different way. Her character is not a bad person, just one who has the desire to be noticed in this dynamic city. The most poignant representation of this is a classic moment in cinema where Mulligan, who sang live no less, provides a leisurely but soulful rendition of 'New York, New York', emphasising her character's desire to adapt. As with Brandon, Sissy is defined by her costume too. There's a great two-shot in a train station photographing the pair of them together. We see her clothes, a leopard print coat and a bright red hat, juxtaposed against his dark, gloomy outfit. That one shot perfectly reflects what contrasting characters they are. A gutting climatic scene further shows this contrast in colour but under the most dramatic and powerful circumstances. Smartly, as she disrupts Brandon's life the formal qualities change as well. When she brings David to the apartment McQueen switches to a hand-held camera, and makes the framing tighter so that the action is intensified and shows that Brandon no longer has control of his whole life. Countering this is a wonderful sequence where Fassbender is photographed running down the block in a single tracking shot. It looks beautiful but also servers to restore stability to his character. What amounts from these formal techniques is a film that has to be read because it is subtle and beautifully understated, visualising its characters with balance as flawed human beings. The film is marred only by a few extra endings but when the last one comes it is not cheap or overly ambiguous, just perfect. And who can argue with that?",Shame
77,DonFishies,An expertly crafted and shocking film that will divide audiences,8,24 September 2011,"Despite having never seen Steve McQueen's Hunger, the smouldering and sensational acclaim for Shame was simply unreal. Having heard terrific things about the film, I ventured out and snagged a last minute ticket to the premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. Weeks later, I am still trying to decipher what may be one of the most shocking and raw films I have seen in quite some time.The titular Shame in question is what Brandon (Michael Fassbender), a posh yuppie living in New York City, must live with every day. He is a sex addict, and his addiction knows no bounds. His estranged sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) has also just dropped by his apartment for an extended stay, making things all the worse.The plot may not sound like much, because there really is not all that much to it storywise. Shame is more of a portrait of a man struggling with his inner demons than it is anything else. There is a story at its very core, but the primary focus is always on Brandon, his addiction and what boundaries and limits it pushes him to. I had read about some of the more ""unconventional"" and decidedly non-mainstream sexual escapades (for lack of a better word) Brandon gets himself into, but I was still incredibly surprised and downright shocked by just how far McQueen goes with this character. He is brazen and uninhibited in what he shows on screen, bravely defying the conventions of what we typically can and cannot see in mainstream cinema. McQueen does not shy away from hard truths, and does not even try to mask the explicit nature of some of the sexual acts. Seeing how far Brandon will go to satisfy and suppress himself is simply harrowing, not unlike films like Trainspotting and Requiem for a Dream were with their characters' drug addictions. While the film and its frank depiction of sexuality are sometimes difficult to watch, I found myself mesmerized by the choreography and cinematography at play throughout. McQueen frames the film with the audience in the position of a voyeur. Early on, we see Brandon's morning routine, featuring Fassbender roaming around his chic apartment totally naked. We see him at his most honest and his most vulnerable, a man who is unable to hide the truth about himself. Later, we watch him as he interacts with his office co-workers from behind huge glass windows, and from a table across from him at a restaurant while he is on a date. McQueen uses a lot of unbroken shots to help depict this slice of Brandon's life through tracking shots and an immense amount of long shots. They help set the very somber mood, and allow the audience to continue watching as if they were an actual character peering into the events that transpire for him. McQueen also expertly uses music to help dictate the action on screen, tearing away the dialogue or sounds of the scene. It makes for an awkward feeling, but one that evokes a response with every new scene.But for all of the shock and audacity, McQueen still managed to make a deeply troubled film that leaves a lot unsaid, and even more unresolved. He does not give out simple answers for what causes Brandon's addiction, or even the reasoning behind the troubled and strained relationship between Brandon and Sissy. While leaving some things enigmatic and up to the viewers to decide (many have already voiced their concerns regarding incest, which seem a bit too outrageous for this kind of film) is incredibly intriguing and help further propel the voyeuristic means of viewing the film, it also makes for maddening thoughts afterwards. What exactly is McQueen trying to say? What is the point he is trying to make? It all feels like it builds towards nothing outside of an unsatisfying and deludingly ambiguous climax. As mentioned earlier, it feels like the story and just about everything else came second to the portrait he wanted to paint through Fassbender's canvas. I can appreciate the film as it is, but it makes it hard to love it the way I thought I would.Fassbender is stunning as Brandon, magnetizing the audience from the beginning all the way to the end. He propels the film, using his reactions and emotions to define the character. He makes Brandon's struggle one that is very real, and almost horrific. He is unable to feel intimacy, and watching him struggle to fulfill his urges is fascinating and deeply disturbing all at once. Watching his face through candid closeups, you can see just how much raw power went into the role. But while it is a stellar and tortured performance that more than proves his weight as an up and coming actor, I never found him to be nearly as incredibly impressive as we know he can be. I still find myself at odds with how great it was, and how much greater it could have been. While James Badge Dale is effective in his small role as Brandon's smarmy and sleazy boss David, it is Mulligan who truly compliments Fassbender. Her role does not ask a whole lot of her, but her pained expressions and infinite desire to be loved by everyone is more than enough to make this a memorable turn for her. While the full frontal nudity was near useless, I only wish that she could have done more.Shame is a very well done film, but one that will divide audiences. On one hand, it is an expertly crafted film about addiction that packs a great lead performance. On the other hand, it is a maddening film that answers very little it asks and sometimes shocks just for the sake of it. It is an impressive feat for a second feature, but one that I think could have been even better.8/10.",Shame

Quite an interesting premise for a film that could be a psychological drama, perhaps. But Shamed disappoints in the way it sets up questions and then doesn't bother to explore them, instead getting sidetracked in the puerile joy of depicting desperate, obsessive sex.I quickly knew Shamed was going to fail, though, when the whole performance of 'New York, New York' as sung by Carey Mulligan (Brandon's batty sister) was left in. She can't sing, 'New York, New York' doesn't work as if sung by Marilyn Monroe, and nightclubs don't go quiet when the singer steps up.Why does this matter? Because the rest of the movie is presented as if it is rooted in reality: we see Michael Fassbender pee twice in the first ten minutes, for goodness' sake.

Something fresh, although we have been around this course before. Successful, independent, good looking new yorker, Brandon has a sex addiction. He's forever using prostitutes, wiling around the hours on the internet, looking at pretty sick porn, whatever, or having sexual encounters with hot looking women, he meets at bars with his mates, one in particular who's strikingly beautiful, although I did like the red head on the subway train. But underneath, this guy has a real problem, and like everyone of us, we all have our flaws. Now cramping his style is the unexpected intrusion of his suicidal kid sister. She's much more f****d than him, her wrist covered in scars from prior suicidal attempts, or may'be she wanted attention. Who knows? She's a very lonely, mixed up girl who has a dependency on men, including Brandon's married boss. I love the scene where she's singing 'New York, New York' in this top of the class restaurant with it's elevating view. Her character brings a lot of heart and soul to the song that moves at her singing pace, around 5-6 minutes. I didn't mind either. It's wonderfully sung and as much I love the song, I have never quite heard it sung like this before. As expected with these kind of adult films, there's a few sex scenes, nudity, whatever, but it's not excessive. What we have here is a good drama with wonderful and truly believable performances from it's leads. Carey Mulligan's great and Michael Fassbinder is something of a great acting revelation. I never heard of this guy before. He delivers a top shelf performance and the opening scene with him staring up at the ceiling, naked in tangled sheets, is something of wonder. Who knows what going through his mind. This film has a few of these moments from his actors characters. The end is fairly predictable and sad, we so feel for this guy. It all explodes when he gets drunk prior, and really loses it, getting bashed by a heavy, the boyfriend of a girl he puts the moves on, with obscenities that are far less than inviting. The weird thing is, this trashy girl actually seems to like it. The only thing I found wrong with Shame was that it was missing something, like that one ingredient.

He's the sort of smooth bloke who notices the colour of a girl's eyes from 10 metres away, but afterward doesn't call them back. Indeed, he can barely get it up when his date is a decent, normal sort of girl. So the one thing he doesn't have is a steady relationship. Another problem is that once in a while he goes on a sex bender. The director shows us that Brandon is a sex addict.We find out more about his background when his messed-up sister (Sissy, played by Carey Mulligan) comes to stay. She's his exact opposite when it comes to relationships: clingy and desperate, but without apartment, job, etc. He helps her at first but then tries to blow her off after she starts to cramp his style. Also, they're a little too physical with each other. Clearly something went wrong with this family. The director wants us to realise that he's messed up too.Michael Fassbender plays half this movie with his clothes off, often engaged in acts of a physical nature. Just to be clear: there is full-frontal male nudity and sex, a lot of it. For a movie called ""Shame"", this is one way to get the audience into the right sort of mood.The director shows us that for Brandon all this sex is an expression of some unhappiness. I got the message that Brandon's life of endless sex is rooted in dysfunction. However, I couldn't help but think that it didn't have to be this way. I suppose my problem with the film is that I didn't see the connection between his addiction and his dysfunction, between his addiction and the bad things that happen to him. He seemed to be doing rather well before his sister showed up. His problem seemed to be his inability to cope with his annoying, dysfunctional sister.Sex addiction is a terrible problem that can ruin lives, but this movie didn't really succeed in showing why. It did succeed in showing graphically that people can have sex when they're unhappy.In the end, this film was a modern morality play: don't have too much sex because it's wrong, it means you're an addict, and bad things will happen. You may even sink so low as to have gay sex. I suppose in a sex-soaked society this is a difficult message, but how does it differ from religious moralising?However, in spite of my reservations, this was a pretty good movie dealing with a dark subject difficult to portray on film.",Shame
84,asda-man,Steve Mcqueen has nothing to ashamed of here!,9,16 December 2014,"Shame took me by surprise. I thought it would be good, but I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. Steve Mcqueen made a striking directional debut with Hunger, a film which I thought looked great but left a lot to be desired over the screenplay. I of course saw 12 Years a Slave before Shame and was completely bowled over by it. Shame isn't quite the masterpiece which 12 Years a Slave is, but it is nevertheless a brilliant film and is well above average in pretty much every department.Steve Mcqueen has absolutely nothing to be ashamed of in the directing department. Visually, Shame is flawless right from the opening where we see Michael Fassbender, stark bullock naked and staring into space on his bed. In fact, the wordless opening 10 minutes is one of the best moments in the film. There's a beautifully realised moment where Michael is eyeing up a woman on the tube and it just goes to show how powerful actions can be. During this moment we also get to see how Michael goes through his days using prostitutes, watching porn and masturbating all to a fantastically emotive score. Right from the opening, you know that you're in good hands.Michael Fassbender gives a fantastic performance as the sex addict. His American accent is extremely off, but thankfully this is brushed off as his character explains how he emigrated to New York. He's very convincing and there are plenty of powerful acting moments. I was also really impressed with Carey Mulligan who normally plays cute mousy types to match her childlike features. Here she plays a loudmouth wannabe singer who's far clingier than her brother. I found the undertones of incest very interesting too. The film hints that they've had quite a horrific past, but we're never let in on it.There are plenty of uncomfortable moments in Shame. At times it makes you feel intrusive as we explicitly see private moments played out regularly and in long takes. Whilst the film is full of sex, it is never sexy. In fact, I barely had a semi-bone throughout! Instead you feel sorry for the poor man as he never uses sex for pleasure, more like a coping mechanism.Shame isn't just about sex though, it's full of brilliant drama which makes you feel involved in the character's lives. There are a handful of great scenes. One of the most memorable is a painfully realistic first date which is full of awkward moments. The best part of the film is probably towards the end though, where we get a montage of images (like at the start) whilst the haunting score plays over. It shows Michael Fassbender going out and looking for sex desperately, at a time when his sister needed him the most. The results are suitably tragic.Shame is phenomenal filmmaking. It's a involving character study which doesn't lecture or patronise its audience. The film is full of haunting and memorable scenes which will be playing in your mind the next day. The acting is brilliant across the board and the screenplay is also suitably ambiguous. It's the directing and visuals which make the biggest impact though. How Steve Mcqueen wasn't Oscar nominated for this film, I don't know. Perhaps it's subject matter is a little too sensitive for the Academy. This is an essential film for those who love the art of filmmaking.Read more dazzling reviews at: www.asdaman.wordpress.com",Shame
85,cinematic_aficionado,Directorial finesse meets focused acting,8,10 January 2012,"Hollywood talks sex addiction. I was not aware that such condition existed until just over a year ago where a close friend confided in me that he is a recovering sex addict and in my ignorance it initially occurred to me that he implied a very ultra-healthy libido and this was the case until he opened up more about it and were able to realise, just like any other form of addiction, how dark and destructive it is.The movie ""Shame"" opens up with a poignant scene a long, silent one of Brandon sitting naked in bed and staring pointlessly. As he goes about his day, it does not take the audience long to realise that sex is the only thing in this man's mind and he has got to get it in any way he can be that intercourse, pornography or masturbation. McQueen does great job as a director as he introduces the theme delicately yet effectively, a refinement that is present throughout the film. There's another great scene taking place on the train where he fantasizes over a female passenger and as he tries to follow her there's a close up in which though none of the characters speak, in their expressions you can tell he is the predator and she is the terrified prey. He does not hesitate or even try to control himself.His hedonistic world is turned upside down by the unannounced arrival of his sister who perhaps became the voice of his consciousness and brought him face to face with this reality, a reality he refused to acknowledge. His sister caught him in the act of self-gratification and on another scene she discovered he was in the middle of an online dirty chat; both times she tried to confront him and not only she did not get anywhere but she was labelled a burden. Brandon's world revolves around sex and nothing is supposed to get in the way. We also discover, as perhaps ought to be expected, that our character has intimacy issues as this indulgent personality could not perform when he lay with a girl he actually liked.Overall ""Shame"" is a subtle but powerful film, intense in a placid kind of way. The scenes are stylish with an emphasis of visual sensuality; a great job is done to portray Brandon's loneliness and isolation, thus making him the object of the audience's sympathy despite his errors. The sexual undertones never get too explicit though succeed in getting the message across.I cannot tell how I will feel watching this movie a year or more down the line but its directing finesse and the focused acting, specially the finale, make it one unquestionably worth watching.",Shame
86,owen-watts,Requiem for a Cream,5,9 November 2021,"Delving further into McQueen's filmography after being wowed by Small Axe, this bleak 2011 psychodrama hit me like a ton of bricks. Fassbender plays a hypnotically detached addict in a downward spiral. It's mesmerically unpleasant, yes, but it's also overwhelmingly characterless which sinks it for me. Because there's so little context for what drives the pain; unlike other films on addiction, Shame's dehumanizing plunge makes it difficult to feel anything. I don't care if he lives or dies. If his flaccid extended date or the painful Mulligan singing scene are meant to be the shreds of reality and expression, bring on the void. Just me and it.",Shame
87,rubenm,Very intense movie,6,21 January 2012,"Intense is the word that comes to mind after having seen 'Shame'. Every scene is intense. Even the music is intense - Carey Mulligan performs the most intense version of New York New York I've ever heard. The story is simple: Brandon leads his life, filled with work and casual sex, until his sister shows up and threatens to disrupt his usual routine. Brother and sister don't get along well, and a dramatic event makes Brandon question his own lifestyle. The film is special. It's not like any other movie. It contains wonderful scenes, like the very first and very last scene. But it's also pretentious and intellectual. The scenes are extraordinarily long, the shots are peculiarly framed and there's not much story development. Some people will love this film for its unorthodox approach to film making and its refusal to be politically correct. Others will hate it for its uncompromising content and its mannerisms. I'm glad I've seen it, but I'm not convinced that I saw a masterpiece.",Shame
88,dragokin,self-indulgent and hollow,1,5 May 2013,"Nudity and intercourse on screen might be exciting and provocative, but with the amount of flesh displayed it might loose it's appeal. Shame goes one step further and dulls the viewer's receptors to the point where you stop caring about what goes on.On the other hand, main characters sister is introduced, clearly deranged, yet there is not even a hint about the reasons for her condition. Moreover, there is no development neither of her character nor of the relation to her brother.Overall, i wonder why movies like this even get the funding. Could it be that there is nothing better or more creative out there?",Shame
89,TheSquiss,Shame is a film about sex addiction & has willies & tits. Get over it. It isn't remotely titillating.,8,16 June 2012,"Yes, Shame is a film about sex addiction and has willies and tits. Get over it. For the most part it isn't remotely titillating.Brandon (Michael Fassbender dominating yet another excellent film) is obsessed with all things sex. He can't keep his hands off himself, every woman is a potential conquest and his computer is riddled with disease due to his liberal, habitual use of internet porn. Meanwhile, his sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan in a role that will shake off the typecasting caused by An Education) crashes back into his life bringing her own destructive demons. And then there's the boss who thinks God put him on this earth to seduce but is actually just a nob.Director Steve McQueen has crafted a riveting film that stays with the viewer all the way home and through the night. He's uped the ante after the stark, compelling Hunger but, though dressed better and with a little more meat on its bones, this is just as bleak a film and not much warmer in tone than his directorial debut.Apart from the morons in the row in front of me, no one could find Shame funny. It isn't. There is humour but there's nothing about either of the protagonists' situations that induces laughter. It's a sad, disturbing tale of two severely damaged people who have great attributes but may just be beyond all hope. Such is the entanglement of their relationship, emotions and issues that neither is quite sure where they fit in with the other and for one horrible moment, we're shown the possibility that they may dive into something together that would be irreparable.But covering the bleak truth of Shame is a stylishness that has stepped out of A Single Man and taken a left turn down an unlit street. There characters are dressed to with great care and even something as mundane as scaffolding on a street scene looks a cool silver in the night light.The long tracking shot as Brandon runs through the city to escape a scene at home he'd rather not witness, though not as breathtaking as those in The Player and Atonement or as obvious as that of Notting Hill, is absorbing and beautifully choreographed. Even the office lobbies and the backs of the alleyways are composed flawlessly and in two separate scenes the windows of his apartment block are revealed like a dark, salacious, corrupt advent calendar.Disturbing in an entirely different way is that Brandon, compelled to debase himself further, turns to a gay club for raw, anonymous release. The implication that this is as low as he can stoop is troubling. Is McQueen saying that gay sex is the ultimate in perversion? Surely not. There are very many darker places even a stubborn heterosexual could investigate that would better emphasize his internal battle. If he were really called upon to make a decision between morals and compulsion, then we might damn him more readily but maybe we'd better understand his constant fight with his inner demons.But that's a small gripe in an otherwise excellent film that will repel more of you than it will attract. Whether you watch Shame or not, keep a close eye on the relationship between director and actor. Fassbender is proving a very effective muse for McQueen and their third film together, Twelve Years a Slave, is in pre-production. This could be a partnership that blooms as effectively as that between Scorsese and De Niro.Another film review from The Squiss.

90,davidgee,Porn disguised as art,6,25 January 2012,"This is something very close to pornography masquerading as an art-house movie. It's also territory that's been visited before in films like LOOKING FOR MR GOODBAR and American GIGOLO. The sex in SHAME is relentless, like American PSYCHO without the killing - or the clumsy attempt at humour. I was occasionally reminded of MIDNIGHT COWBOY which was similarly set in a world of sleaze, but all the characters in Schlesinger's movie (even the 'punters') were given great depth and in the end Jon Voight's Cowboy Joe achieved a kind of redemption, which Michael Fassbender's Brandon does not.SHAME has received high praise from the critics. I wonder why. Yes, the acting is good, as is the direction and cinematography, but ultimately this is a bleak and soulless film about a soulless man. Of course this is what it sets out to be, but it comes across as a celebration of sleaziness. Another of those movies which congratulates itself for pushing the envelope a bit further than the last one. Is it perhaps time the envelope was pulled back a degree or two?",Shame
91,jordan2240,Didn't like it as much as I thought I would,6,2 September 2012,"Had heard a lot about this movie, so was anxious to see it when I found it On Demand. Frankly, I found it a bit slow and somewhat boring for the most part. The acting is excellent, and I admire the performers for having the courage to be in such a film, but it just didn't leave the impression I thought it would. Some of the scenes, like the one where Carrie Mulligan sings an entire somber version of New York New York were a bit of a torture.Perhaps I'm being shallow, but I would have liked to have seen more back-story of how these people got the way they did, and what the relationship was exactly between the brother and sister. I realize you shouldn't have to tell the moviegoer everything though, and some may have liked the fact those things were left to be imagined.In the end, it wasn't the sort of movie that left me staring at the screen thinking I'd just seen a masterpiece, but it's worth a look nonetheless.",Shame

93,dfle3,Sex. Obsession. 75+%,8,22 February 2012,"A dour movie about a dysfunctional man - Brandon Sullivan (played by Michael Fassbender) - obsessed with sex. He has a good job in a white-collar occupation but you wonder how he has time for any actual work, given his obsession with sex. The movie is rather explicit and perhaps we should be grateful that it's not in 3-D. In fact, I do wonder if the sex in this movie is real...it is rated ""R"" here in Australia but presumably the only difference between an R-rated movie and an X-rated movie is camera position? Have heard of porno movies trying to have more story to them...""Shame"" is arguably that type of porno...but with a broody mood no doubt more suited to the art house crowd than the raincoat brigade. In any case, be warned, there is full frontal nudity in this movie and simulated sex (at the very least). Lots of it.Since the movie got good reviews on ""At the movies"" here in Australia, it was on my radar. Perhaps the 'hook' to watching this movie was the presence of Carey Mulligan. I was quite smitten with her in her role in one of the good episodes of the rebooted Doctor Who series. In fact, I wished that she would land a role as the Doctor's companion...probably good that that didn't happen...she gets to act in potentially 'worthier' projects now. Anyway, Carey plays Sissy, the sister of Brandon.Watching a good part of this movie, I was wondering where the film got its title from...the guy is constantly getting laid with different women...what's so bad about that? The narrative does eventually stray into territory where you can say that the film's title is earned...and you may or may not find that believable (there is also an inference to be made, apart from what is explicit, as to what the ""shame"" may involve). As an aside, I think I saw a snatch of a docu on SBS TV over here where a woman was discussing how she was in perpetual state of sexual arousal. And the problem is...? The way she described was akin to a nightmare, and you did pity her. That was more extreme than Brandon's situation, but perhaps the film would have been better for basing itself on something real like this, rather than melodrama or symbolic sex scenes (e.g. the scene where Brandon is in a hotel room with his co-worker...the scene seemed representational to me...symbolic...fodder for a Cultural Studies course).For most of this movie I was thinking it was a 70% kind of movie. What tipped this into a higher score for me was the end of the movie...it just gave the movie a sense of direction that it had lacked up to the point. Some may question what happens, but for me it provided a sense of narrative arc to proceedings.A good part of that narrative arc swings on the relationship dynamic between Brandon and Sissy. As a temporary resident at Brandon's apartment, she proves crucial to giving this movie a sense of direction...eventually. It is hard to get a read on Sissy...one can only speculate to what her (and Brandon's) story is. As with Brandon, there is no real insight into their character...just blurry shadows in the distance as to what might have 'caused' this condition of Brandon's.Random observations: * Brandon sometimes has an odd wardrobe...ostentatiously so.* The score is moody at times, which works well for the kind of atmosphere director Steve McQueen is aiming for.* Some scenes don't really seem to belong in the movie...e.g. Sissy's song...it just goes on for a long time...she sings it well and perhaps it's there for the sake of irony, but still......another thing...not really a fan of these extreme close-ups I've been seeing in movies lately...Carey in this movie, Chloë Moretz in ""Hugo""...they're unflattering, I find...Carey is cute, but she has a touch of the Renée Zellweger's in extreme close-up...all scrunched up features. No matter how great the actor, would you really want to see up their nose? Even Robert De Niro's?* Early on in the movie I did think that Fassbender was overplaying a scene, but I think that's because the context wasn't really given to justify it...you can reconstruct what happened later on, mentally, but I think that the context should have been given first (I mean the scene about the computers in the boardroom...it's just disorientating/incoherent).* I did form a hypothesis about what happened in the train near the end of the movie but I was wrong...in a way...this point relates to my view that the film eventually had a sense of trajectory to it.* Oddly, I was aware of the camera in a scene near the end, where Brandon is in the rain...you can't see the camera...it's just obvious that it is there.I was going to call this film a flat 8/10 for the eventual sense of direction to it, but I'll call it 75+%...a last minute decision.",Shame
94,ethanbresnett,A powerful tale of addiction,8,25 July 2020,"By god the direction from Steve McQueen was astoundingly good. So simple in parts yet so extraordinarily effective. He has such a talent for drawing out power and emotion in his films in bucket loads, and really getting the best out of his performers. McQueen tackled sex addiction in an unflinching and uncompromising way, displaying the contrasting moments of hope and despair that are coupled with addiction. At the time Shame felt like it dragged slightly (despite the incredibly short 90 minute runtime), however looking back everything had its place, every extended scene and lingering shot. They all just worked together beautifully, and upon finishing the film you can stand back and appreciate how all of the pieces of the puzzle fit neatly and intricately together into this well crafted and delicate story.Fassbender and Mulligan were awe inspiring. The camera work and framing of the shots was often so personal and invasive on the two of them, there really was no hiding in this film. The acting and performances had to be spot on and they really were. This is perhaps the best Fassbender performance I've seen, with so many layers to his performance. He portrayed the steely eyed and clinical sex addict scarily well, but was able to flip in an instant to moments of intense vulnerability. It really was fascinating to watch. Carey Mulligan was a great on screen partner for him, similarly bringing jumping between moments of joy and despair.This film (as one would expect) does come with the caveat that it is in no way shape or form for the prudish out there. Its borderline full on pornographic in parts, but it isn't gratuitous. It serves the plot and character of Fassbender's Brandon very well, and is an essentially part of the storytelling.It's unflinching, powerful, sympathetic, and thoughtful. Shame packs a real punch, and will stay with you for a while I'm sure of that.",Shame
95,moviemanMA,Addiction up close and personal,10,15 January 2012,"Shame, the real feel bad movie of the year, is only McQueen's second feature film to date. His first film, Hunger, focused on a man who made his life very public when he went on a hunger strike during the 1981 Irish Hunger Strikes. In Shame, McQueen dissects the very personal and often shocking sexual addiction of Brandon Sullivan (Michael Fassbender). Brandon is a well off business man. He has an apartment in New York where he leads a seemingly good life, but hides a dark secret that is on the verge of destroying him. His sex addiction has gone out of control. To make this even more difficult, his sister drops in unexpected and crashes at his place (played by Carey Mulligan). Her lifestyle begins to interfere with his addiction, forcing him to take drastic measures.Every waking moment is spent towards achieving one goal: orgasm. We see him smile, laugh, engage socially, but when he is alone he is focused, like a junkie going through the routine of drug addiction. Brandon's tools aren't lighters, spoons, and rubber ties. He uses prostitutes, Internet pornography, magazines, or his imagination. Even at work his mind wanders off, either at a passing coworker or something he has looked up on his computer. This is far from a private matter. His addiction is slipping into the open and he knows it. We assume he is aware of his problem. At the beginning of the film we see Brandon lying naked in bed, the sheet pulled over his private area. He lies motionless, only staring at the ceiling above, breathing in and out as if he knows that today is going to be a long day. We know he's not thinking about work. He has one thing and one thing only. Sex.Most people associate sex with pleasure. I'm sure Brandon has at one time or another had a pleasurable experience during intercourse, but he is long past that stage. During a scene on the subway he spots a woman. She's an attractive woman. She's alone. Vulnerable. She eyes Brandon staring back at her. The two have chemistry. In silence they are mentally engaging each other. His stare never wavers, he just scans her up and down. Suddenly her face changes. She gets up, showing the audience her wedding band. We can feel her shame for flirting with Brandon. He gets up and stands behind her. He follows her out of the train only to lose her in the crowd. His disappointment isn't so much in relation to not getting to know her, but that he will have to continue his search for sex elsewhere.Brandon is a tragic character. His only connection with people is linked with sex. How will this person help or interfere with me reaching my goal of orgasm? Brandon's limit's knows no bounds. Fassbender, who also appeared in McQueen's Hunger, gives a fascinating performance. It is fearless both in the sense that it is a physically challenging role and that he accomplishes the role with such honesty. He could have played it like some debonair businessman just looking to score. Fassbender knows that his character is truly disturbed. He knows that if people found out about his condition he would be ostracized. He also knows that he needs help and won't get it. All of these factors come into play and create an incredible performance. Much like Gosling pulled off in Drive, Fassbender uses his eyes and body language to express how he feels.Pain is a word often associated with addiction. We see videos of addicts going through withdrawals in health class. They kick, scream, shake, vomit. Evidence of a sickness in the body. Fassbender's character also shows great pain and uneasiness. During times of sheer euphoria, at least for a normal person, Fassbender gives us pain and suffering. He can't help what he's doing but he needs it to stay normal.Along with Fassbender is Mulligan, another one of today's rising stars. Her character is rebellious, dependent, and loving. She wants nothing more than to find someone to care for her and to spend time with her brother. Her brother is too involved with his addiction and her taste in men and willingness to fall in love with them brings her down even more. She plays a girl on the edge of a breakdown and really shines on screen. Like Fassbender, she gives her all for the role, exposing her true colors.In just two films McQueen has established himself as a major player in the art house scene. Both films are festival favorites with critical praise, but the general public isn't ready for his heavy storytelling. With hope (and some financial backing) he will continue to make the films he wants to make and hopefully garner enough praise here in the states to win over more of the public. It's going to be hard if he keeps getting NC-17 ratings.",Shame

100,markgorman,Mulligan's career low. Fassbender fails to match Hunger standard,5,22 January 2012,"There's a scene early in Shame where Michael Fassbender languorously wanders, completely naked, through his flat and stands at the toilet before slowly micturating as we watch voyeauristically. It sums the film up. Pish.Hunger, McQueen's debut, was my movie of 2008. McQueen and Fassbender pulled off a coup with a brilliantly thought provoking and totally engaging story about Bobby Sands and the dirty protests in the Maze prison in Belfast. It was a horrifying journey to hell and back with a miraculous central performance by Fassbender.This movie attempts to do something similar, performance wise at least, by stripping Fassbender back literally to his skin.It's a story about unsaid things. Clearly Fassbender and his sister (Sissy, played by Carey Mulligan) have a past that has severely damaged them emotionally and their on screen relationship hints, at times, of near incestual closeness but this is kept at bay by extreme aggression to each other.Sissy is a self harmer, Fassbender a sex addict. Neither evoke any sympathy whatsoever, because McQueen has set out to make a movie that moves glacially and observes the action with a remoteness and aloofness that is chilling and utterly unengaging.The truth is, this is a self absorbed piece of film making that leaves one cold, in fact, pretty bored actually.It's unsympathetic stance towards the central characters actually ends up with you not caring by the end.A cold, uninvolving self indulgence of a movie that I'd recommend avoiding.",Shame
101,nickmesafilms,"Shame (2011) - Rated NC-17? Oh Well, Adults Only!",8,8 April 2012,"""Shame"" is one of the first movies to receive the NC-17 rating, since decades ago, after ""Midnight Cowboy"" was received with an X-rating in 1969. Filled with male and female nudity, and strong, explicit sex scenes, ""Shame"" is for adults only. But this is one of the better movies of the previous year. Michael Fassbender delivers the stand-out performance of his career as Brandon, a handsome and successful thirty-something sex addict. He lives a devastating life-style where he tries to find the best sex he needs, from porn surfing, call girls, and one-night stands, but none of that is enough. His sex life is then interrupted by his sister, portrayed by Carey Mulligan, for an unexpected visit. No matter how hard she tries to contact Brandon, the more absent he is, and would rather live a sex life, instead of respecting his sister. Although the movie is filled with explicit sex scenes, ""Shame"" makes it very clear that this is not a sexy movie. This is a serious tale of a man who struggles through his sex addiction, hoping he can fill the emptiness inside him, by having sexual intercourse with a variety of women, without any romantic connections. I fell in love with Michael Fassbender's performance in this movie, and I felt every detail that this poor guy has been through. This is the type of performance that should have gotten a Best Actor nomination. Same goes for Carey Mulligan in a heartbreaking performance as Brandon's sister, Sissy. I respected her performance in this movie, as much as I respected her performance in ""Drive"". The sex scenes are dramatic, but just make sure that your kids don't see it. This isn't the type of movie that the whole family should see. I mean it, literally, that ""Shame"" is not for the younger audiences, since this being a dark, and devastating motion picture. I would say that I was impressed on how unique and different the movie was. Director Steve McQueen perfectly captures the dramatic and heartbreaking life-style of this sex-addicted individual. We are left with a interesting ""tour De force"" that's both graphic and heartbreaking. Well acted, well directed, this is one of the better movies of last year. ""Shame"", in my review, ""interesting and heartbreaking, beautifully portrayed"".",Shame
102,Ramascreen,Brutally honest,8,2 December 2011,"-- Ramascreen.com --Shocking, unexpected, raw, explosive, would be some of the first things that come to mind. I for one did not expect director Steve McQueen and actors Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan would push the envelope that much but they did and they did it so well. Never have I seen the subjects of obsession and addiction depicted on screen in such a brutally honest manner. Fassbender's going the distance for his character is evidence of his extraordinary skills as an actor. Just like Requiem For A Dream was more or less a full feature anti drug public service announcement, SHAME too shows you how sex addiction can be a danger to self and those around you..The lead character Brandon, played by Michael Fassbender, is fascinating to me because here is a man who has everything, a very comfortable lifestyle, a well-paying job, a glamorous nightlife, in a city that never sleeps, he has no problem blending in and yet he struggles with making real human connection, something more meaningful. The film, using New York city as its setting, wants to invite you to see how disconnected we can be despite our everyday interaction. That despite our best efforts, sometimes we're so afraid to get hurt again, we'd settle for anything that numb the pain away. The film doesn't let you in completely on what it is that may have troubled Brandon, perhaps he came from a home that caused this great hole in his heart that he constantly has to fill with sex, which is why I used Requiem For A Dream as comparison because even though sex addiction may not be as openly or as comfortably discussed as drug addiction, it too can be self-destructive, SHAME essentially shows you a downward spiral of a man as Brandon's addiction gets worse and worse and worse.When Sissy, played by Carey Mulligan, comes along, suddenly Brandon's routine gets interrupted. Sissy deals with issues of abandonment. Right from when she's introduced, the film shows you this needy woman disguised in a strong independent personality. Once again, the film doesn't let you in on what happened in their past, but there seems to be an abandonment somewhere because Sissy feels Brandon tries to push her away, just like everyone in her life has done in the past. Perhaps in their childhood, Brandon left her when she needed him the most. And Brandon has been living carefree all this time that when Sissy drops in uninvited and then makes herself at home, the notion of this entire responsibility comes across as nothing but a burden for Brandon. He sees that as more of a problem than his sex addiction is, which causes him to drown even deeper. Brandon turns to sex to stay away from the emotional connection that his sister so clearly desperately longs for.SHAME is a character driven story that's mostly told in the silence. Often times director McQueen focuses mostly on Fassbender's tremendous on screen presence to take us through the journey into his troubled soul. I don't know if I'd call the sex scenes hard to watch, I think how the scenes are done in terms of the visual style is artful and seductive. Yes, the scenes are no holds barred but I don't think people should judge it as softcore or dismiss it as merely a movie about a sexaholic because this movie is about sibling dynamics and human relationships and how hard it is for some people to obtain such things that may be considered as something that comes natural for others.That said, the fact that the film doesn't provide enough background or backstory to Brandon and Sissy does serve a big challenge, and at times I wonder if the film necessarily has to be so raw about it, because I truly would like for many audiences to come see this movie but it does carry elements that may turn people off. Michael Fassbender who hits stardom this past couple of years or so, gives an unbelievable, unadulterated performance. I haven't seen Fassbender-McQueen's previous collaboration, Hunger, but I can sense there's a level of trust and comfort in their working relationships that allows Fassbender to bare all, not just literally, for his role. Fassbender is bold, daring and highly committed. There's something about him that just draws you in. My favorite Carrey Mulligan scene in this film would have to be when she sings a slowed down jazz rendition of the iconic song 'New York New York' which I think speaks true about the nature of this film and about Brandon. As a lounge singer, Mulligan couldn't be any more radiant. As Brandon's sister, Sissy, Mulligan understands that that this is a woman who either looks for love at the wrong places or looks for love, finds love, love uses her and then love runs away every single time. There's fear, insecurity, pain, but also persistence in Mulligan's performance. You may need a cold shower after watching SHAME, but you won't be able to easily shake it off, this is the kind of film that would stay with you for days.-- Ramascreen.com --",Shame
103,dr_clarke_2,Once again demonstrates McQueen's knack for visually impressive and thematically bold filmmaking,9,25 October 2021,"English director Steve McQueen followed up his feature debut Hunger with Shame, another film that tackles a controversial topic and stars Michael Fassbender. The subject matter couldn't be more different however, with Shame following the troubles of a sex addict.Co-written by McQueen and Welsh playwright Abi Morgan, Shame follows Fassbender's Brandon a single professional man living in New York City whose life is dominated by his sexual urges. As addictions go, sex addiction seriously is one that most people probably don't think about or take seriously (and indeed there has long been debate amongst medical professionals as to whether it is really a condition and how exactly it should be defined), but Shame argues that it is just as destructive and all-encompassing as any other dependence issue. Brandon's need for sexual gratification distracts him at work, and leaves him socially isolated and unproductive outside of it.Having spent much of Hunger stark naked and covered in filth, Fassbender spends much of Shame stark naked and mired in filth, and completely immerses himself in the role of Brandon, conveying just how much the man is enslaved by his desperate needs. He also captures Brandon's barely suppressed self-loathing, with its outbreaks of hypocrisy during his interactions with his sister Sissy, perfectly. Brandon is contrasted with his womanising, flirtatious boss David, who sleeps with Sissy despite being married with a family. Brandon frequently looks vaguely disgusted with David, even as he himself pays for sex and pursues a highly promiscuous lifestyle, again emphasising the fact that for him, sex is an addiction rather than a fun pastime. Tellingly, when Brandon starts going on actual dates with co-worker Marianne, he proves unable to perform with somebody he's forging an emotional connection with, and ends up subsequently having sex with a prostitute instead.Like Hunger, Shame again demonstrates McQueen's considerable talent as a director. The film is set and filmed in New York City and McQueen turns his artistic temperament to making the most of the location, whether during the dark and grimy tube scenes or when Brandon goes out for a run through the city streets. As Brandon's spiral of self-destruction deepens after his disastrous date with Marianne and an argument with Sissy, the camera becomes more fluid and dynamic, hand-held and buzzing around Fassbender like a restless wasp. At the same time, the narrative briefly becomes non-linear and by the time Brandon enters the gay bar, right up to his discovery of Sissy with her wrists slashed, the film is completely dialogue free, with the incidental score instead providing an accompaniment. But if this briefly seems cathartic, the final scene - which brings the film full-circle - serves as a reminder that there are no easy cures for addiction. The film drew attention for its graphic depictions of sex: Brandon masturbates a lot, is a big fan of pornography, and hires prostitutes. The film is hugely sexually explicit, but rarely erotic, with McQueen's perfectly framed shots capturing the emotionally barren reality and the remorseless seediness of Brandon's world.Fassbender gets impressive support from Carey Mulligan as the troubled Sissy, whilst James Badge Dale is both charismatic and vaguely odious as David. McQueen reportedly insisted on getting strong actor to play even the bit parts, and it shows in every performance, however minor. Like Hunger, the film also benefits from another score by Harry Escott, which has a melancholy but dramatic feel that reflects Brandon's lifestyle quite well. Shame isn't quite as hard to watch as Hunger, but it provokes both fascination and disgust with Brandon's lifestyle and once again demonstrates McQueen's knack for visually impressive and thematically bold filmmaking.",Shame
104,jayjaycee,Depression in its rawest form,8,24 November 2020,"""Shame"" is 2011 drama directed by Steve McQueen starring Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan.
⚪
All in all, Steve McQueen's agonising drama reveals the rawest and most vulnerable sides of a depressive sex addict in a crushingly gritty manner, and performs a balancing act between realistically excruciating beauty and disgusting perversity, and due to a powerful lead performance by Michael Fassbender, a shatteringly natural screenplay and McQueen's empathetic direction, it becomes an indescribably melancholic and utterly depressing striptease of the ambiguous kind.
⚪
Will there ever be a time when the name Steve McQueen isn't automatically associated with great films? Well, while the name used to referred to one of the most charismatic action stars of the sixties and seventies, to the King of Cool who produced some revolutionary features, it nowadays refers to a man who made himself a name in another genre. Steve Rodney McQueen, a man born during his namesake's golden era, is responsible for some highly acclaimed dramas of the last few years, most prominently for the historical feature ""12 Years A Slave"". However, before he received his well-deserved Oscar for this film, he directed ""X-Men"" star Michael Fassbender in two other features, the Bobby Sands biopic ""Hunger"" and this title here. While I cannot say much about the first, I can guarantee you that this one here definitely packs a punch and knows to shake you in the very foundations. I don't know if there is such a sub-genre called ""feel bad movies"", but if there is, this title definitely would fall in the category, because it is just painful. The thing is, it is not the kind of pain you experience when watching one of the worse Adam Sandler titles, it is the one you can relate to since it is so utterly realistic. Michael Fassbender breathtakingly portrays Brendon Sullivan, a successful businessman with a decent job, a great apartment and seemingly with no worries at all. Well, that is what it is on the outside, because under the surface of this outwardly handsome and perfect man a tremendous turmoil lies dormant. Brendon is a sex addict who spends most of his time with drive satisfaction. From pornographic material on his laptop, over musturbation to random sexual encounters with prostitutes, he experiences all of it. One might think that he is happy leading his life in a way Hugh Hefner would be proud of, but it is quite the contrary. Despite of all the sexual activities his life is defined by, he is anything but blissful, because even though it is never formally mentioned, he suffers from depression. You don't have to be an expert to take notice of this, because it is evident, nevertheless. In this film, Fassbender bares it all, and I am not only talking about the fact that we get to see Magneto's rod on multiple occasions. Regardless of the graphic nudity and sex scenes, the film's main focus doesn't lie on it at all and only serves as an admittedly drastic but tremendously effective narrative device. Just like hand on hand combat is only a means to an end in ""Fight Club"", sexual activities are only there to veil the true meaning behind what is depicted. In general, it is a character study about a seemingly carefree man living as a bachelor in New York City, but on the inside it is a crushing examination of an addict who tries to cope with his past and other problems that burden him. As already mentioned above, it is never explicitly expressed that he is suffering from depression, but over the course of the film and almost casually, we learn about minimal details about the past of Brendon and his sister Sissy (equally outstandingly played by Carey Mulligan) that explain his behaviour. As the title perfectly suggests, it is about shame in its rawest form. All the sexual activities he engages in are only a way to temporarily drown out the void that haunts him inside, and even if it is far from perfect, it works out in a basic way for him. Until his sister arrives. The imperfect but functioning life he has established comes apart at the seams when she enters this troubled construct, simply because she reminds him of the haunted past too much. Involuntarily, he is supposed to cope with his and with his sister's problems, but you can tell by the look on his face that he is simply unable to master this task. In order to regain the control over his life, he then tries to escape from the cesspool of meaningless sex by dating his co-worker, but eventually learns that healthy relationships and true affection are two things he is incapable. He cannot reciprocate those two human emotions, since his past has scarred him irreparably, and Fassbender conveys this creeping realization and frustration gut-wrenchingly. Only after the attempted suicide of his sister (the most devastating sequence of this drama), he apparently begins to revaluate what is really important in his life, the relationship to his sister included. After having a mental breakdown (the peak of his powerhouse performance!), he encounters the woman on the subway again, the one that he chased after in the beginning despite knowing that she is married. The last shot, him speculating whether he should do it or not, this ambiguity, perfectly rounds up the drama. Will he go back to what he has been, or will he be better than before? The audience is left out in the cold, as then the credits begin to roll, and you don't know if history repeats itself or not. In the end, this film hit me more than I expected it to do. Of course, I was anticipating sadness, but this was just pure depression in blue colours. Raw, unadulterated and absolutely stopping at nothing. It's a soul striptease that also literally strips naked and knows no taboos. Cinema is rarely this devastatingly depressing, and I take my hat off to this brutally realistic gem. Treat it with extreme caution.",Shame
105,come2whereimfrom,Hard going but beautiful.,8,1 December 2011,"Artist turned director Steve McQueen first collaborated with Michael Fassbender on 'Hunger' the harrowing story of Irish republican Bobby Sands leading the inmates of a Northern Irish prison in a hunger strike. It was brave, bold and despite the subject matter, beautiful and now reunited they tread similar ground with 'Shame'. Here Fassbender plays Brandon a New York City resident with a crippling sex addiction and when his sister drops in for an unannounced visit it threatens his perverse routine to a point that will test them both and their relationship. Artfully shot in a style that McQueen seems to be developing it can at times be very intrusive, if you are easily offended by graphic sex then you should probably avoid this, its unflinching in it raw depiction and pulls no punches in stripping the actors bare both physically and mentally. The music is orchestral and sweeps up and down with the emotions of the viewer and as a whole package it is certainly a cinematic tour de force. Some people will no doubt be annoyed by the fact that the film asks more questions than it answers and being a snapshot of a time doesn't delve into why these characters are damaged or even how it will can resolved. But as with 'Hunger' the film is beautiful and striking in so many ways and if McQueen continues this career path then the art worlds loss is most certainly cinemas gain.",Shame
106,yris2002,Daring and painful. Astonishing acting by Fassbender,8,1 February 2012,"Nudity and sex abound, until getting nauseating and to make Brandon, the protagonist, look nauseating, but at the same time pitiful, and, in the end, I felt empathy for a sick, lonely, desperate man. Fassbender's performance proves astonishing, he's shameful, attractive, perverted, desperate, weak, furious, painful, miserable: a strongly committed and difficult role to perform, not only for the sense of shame he had to overcome, but also for this variety of registers he had to adapt himself. An intelligent direction is also to be noticed, talking about a sex-addict is no easy job, but here Steve Mcqueen proves capable of conveying all the squalor and tragedy of a perverted life, without indulging too voyeuristic a vision, avoiding all leeriness, but daring enough to represent the real thing, terribly crude and horrific, but where even the most steamy sex scenes escape any risk of pornography and get only to communicate a sense of anguish and dismay. A movie one may find too strong as to get disturbing, but undeniably also empathic, and human. I liked it for its honesty in representing with also an aesthetic taste for the perfect location, the perfect light, in a way that the perfection of exterior forms, from Brandon's body, house, and job have to counterbalance, but at the same time stress the inner abyss of his solitude and the brutality of his emotional, or anti-emotional life. Great acting is also offered by Carey Mulligan as Brandon's sister Sissy, she takes on an equally difficult role, one that certainly marked her life as an actress and as a woman, as well. A movie that cannot leave the viewer indifferent, it moves something inside, and leaves with a deep sense of sadness.",Shame
107,kijii,Watch this then go take a shower,5,6 November 2016,"Shame brings Carey Mulligan and Michael Fassbender together, as brother and sister. Here, they produce an intense drama about a man with serious sex-related problems and his sister with suicidal tendencies. Make no mistake about it, this movie is not for children to watch!!! This is what the NC-17 rating must have been invented for. In fact, it even stretched my imagination about how serious these problems can be when taken to extremes. This is Fossbender's second collaboration with director, Steve McQueen, and it is NOTHING like 12 Years a Slave (2013), but it does show the tremendous range that Fossbender and McQueen have as a team. About the only time we are lifted away from Fassbender's hypersexuality is when he takes his boss to see his sister sing one of the longest versions of New York, New York that you will ever hear. It is long and sensual. This movie is hard to explain so just watch the above-trailer for rave reviews about its stylishness and daring.",Shame
108,Chris_Pandolfi,Portrait of a Sex Addict,9,2 December 2011,"Brandon (Michael Fassbender) is an addict. His drug is not heroin, cocaine, meth, or alcohol, but sex. Although he can function in social scenarios, he's hindered by uncontrollable urges, and his only fix is to have an orgasm. He needs this many times a day just to get back up to normal. Several shots of his face throughout the film make it clear that the sensation has long since stopped giving him pleasure. One near the end, for example, which captures the moment of climax, reveals despair and self-loathing. For him, sex has nothing to do with intimacy, love, or even physical satisfaction; it has become a burden that consumes his every waking moment. There's no room left for anything else in his life, not even for something as ordinary as feeling emotions.With ""Shame,"" director Steve McQueen makes no grand statements about sex addiction. He merely observes what the characters do. They reveal themselves primarily through their actions. When they do speak, there are no sermons that sound uncannily like a written monologue; there are only simple, direct conversations. Most are quiet, as when Brandon has dinner with an office employee named Marianne (Nicole Beharie). Why does he pursue her when he has access to prostitutes, who demand nothing from him other than payment? Perhaps he thought he could have a go at a conventional relationship. But he's not wired that way. He isn't all that interested in what she says, nor is he all that interested in saying things to her.He makes a comfortable living in a Manhattan office building. His exact job title is never revealed, which is just as well because work is not foremost on his mind. Several times a day, he excuses himself to the men's room so that he can masturbate. His chatty, energetic boss, David (James Badge Dale), is married and has a family, although that doesn't stop him from barhopping and hitting on women with a slew of pickup lines. He usually brings Brandon along; he sits impassively saying barely a word, and yet women are more drawn to him, perhaps because David is simply trying too hard. The irony is, Brandon is not seeking their affections. Even amongst large groups of people, it's obvious that he has nothing resembling a social life.Into his life reenters his sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan), a wayward young woman who needs a place to stay. As of right now, she gets by as a lounge singer; we will eventually hear her sing what is arguably the saddest rendition of ""New York, New York"" ever, and indeed, a mostly uninterrupted shot of her face shows nothing but solemnity (when it cuts back to Brandon's face, we see a tear rolling down his cheek). Her visit is jarring for Brandon, who has isolated himself with his addiction. He doesn't want anyone to see the porn on his computer, or his hidden stash of dirty magazines, or his masturbation sessions in his bathroom. In other words, he doesn't want anyone to see his shame. When she crawls into bed with him, he immediately screams at her to get out. He doesn't care that she needs the support.Scenes late in the film suggest the possibility that Brandon is inching closer towards human feeling, that he's finally allowing himself to care about something. But the possibility of staying the way he is remains just as strong. At one point, he's so desperate for a fix that he enters a gay night club. This has absolutely nothing to do with orientation; when your sole purpose in life is achieving orgasm, who you're physically attracted to is not taken into consideration. His background is just as shrouded in mystery as Sissy's, although hints at something dark are dropped along the way. Sissy will eventually deliver a key line: ""We're not bad people. We just come from a bad place.""This year alone, Fassbender has appeared in films as diverse as ""Jane Eyre,"" ""X-Men: First Class,"" and ""A Dangerous Method."" In all three, he gave great performances. But I think his appearance in ""Shame"" will be the one that stands out the most. Rather than project dramatically, he retreats to an inward, solitary place where emotions go to die. As Brandon, he's walled off and yet extremely vulnerable. No matter how many people he's surrounded by, his is a world of pain and loneliness. In one pivotal scene, he's travelling by subway, staring at a woman who may be flirting with him; his eyes betray not malice intent but sad desperation, for he knows, even in the throes of his physical urges, that he has put himself into a repetitious cycle of destructive behavior. As to whether or not he's doomed to stay in it, there are some things we're never meant to know.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",Shame
109,adi_2002,It's such a shame,6,24 December 2015,"Brandon works in a office (although we don't see him struggle too much), lives alone in a flat and often pays womens to come and have intimate relationships surcharge. He is not too happy with this and tries to do the same with a female co-worker but without any reason he fails. Thing can't get any worse when his sister comes unannounced and says that he wants to stay with him because she doesn't have anywhere to go. A brawl between the two will lead to a tragic faith for Sissy.From the first minutes in the film after watching the main character walking completely naked with his ""sausage"" in plain view I thought ""what is this?, the name can be more suitable?"" but with the drama involved in it and the fact that this could happen and in real life made it more acceptable. Perfectly played roles by the two brothers makes the movie even more realistic. To be watched but only by an adult audience.",Shame
110,Ryan_MYeah,Fassbender and Mulligan manage to give the script a lot more than it gives them.,7,3 February 2012,"All in all, while I wouldn't call Shame a masterpiece, it could at least be called a courageous misfire. The screenplay is admirable stuff, playing out in an almost episodic presentation, but it turns out to be the film's biggest problem. Not all of the subplots are even, the film moves on the slow side (As evidenced by the many long takes), and the mild attempts at humor felt out of place to me.Still, the two lead characters played by Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan, and the direction of Steve McQueen give the script a LOT more than the script really gives them, and the movie is so much better for it. Fassbender's physically and emotionally naked performance is one with a cold, but unlikely charm. But beneath that facade lies anger, grief, and regret that's hard to shake. Mulligan as his sister is a dependent soul that annoys him, even frustrates him, but that too is a mask of an overwhelming grief (A scene in which she sings ""New York, New York"" as the camera closes in on her face is haunting). Steve McQueen's direction is ambitious, uncompromising, and visceral, even if the long takes are a few too many. Even though it's not very violent, it's a brutal experience, and one that I seriously don't think I'll be reliving anytime soon. Think of it like Requiem for a Dream: A movie that burns into the back of your mind.**1/2 out of ****",Shame
111,dallasryan,It's Unfortunate,10,3 November 2012,"What's unfortunate is that the Academy Voters almost never nominate a film for any awards that is at an NC-17 rating, if this movie had an R rating, Michael Fassbender would have easily been nominated for an academy award for his portrayal as Brandon. Also I think Steve McQueen would have been nominated for a Best Director nod. I can never say it and reiterate it enough, a movie needs to(most of the time) have a terrific music score in order for it to be a great movie. Not all of the time, but a lot of the time. But that's not enough, it can't just have a terrific music score, it has to have at least the lead actor be terrific in his or her performance. If the acting is bad, but there is a terrific music score, or the acting is phenomenal but the music score sucks, almost always you will have a mediocre to bad movie. But if the acting(in the lead role at least) is terrific and the music score is terrific, then almost always you have a very special and very great movie on your hands, and Shame is one of those very special and very great movies. Michael Fassbender's Brandon embodies the very soul of the music score or perhaps the music score embodies the very soul of Fassbender's Brandon. You can't not think of one without the other. And now after seeing this movie, the symbol for a sex addict will always be Brandon to me with that haunting music score behind him. Shame is a movie that deals with people to the core. It doesn't give away too much and that's why it also works. You know Brandon has had a very troubled child hood with his family and that has a lot to do with the way he is now. The same goes for his sister(which is brilliantly played by the terrific actress, Carey Mulligan, who in my opinion, is one of-if not the best actress out there right now right beside Meryl Streep). As someone gets addicted to smoking cigarettes, they constantly need it and then look for new ways to enhance the pleasure with that cigarette. Also the cigarette addict needs that cigarette more during certain times such as a real stressful ordeal, a break up, a fight, etc. The same goes for a sex addict. The sex addict will need a fix in certain times when things are going stressful, bad, when the urge suddenly arises. And they will look for new ways to enhance that pleasure. For example, many women pornstars like to have double penetration scenes in the entrance and exit parts at the same time because it's suppose to triple the pleasure of the whole sexual experience. I think most of us can agree that probably the majority of male pornstars and perhaps female pornstars are sex addicts and that the majority of their addiction probably stems from some rough childhood either with their family or friends or whatever the case might have been. Shame shows a little bit of insight and understanding into the pain one has in living with such a lonely and ultimately sad addiction. Also, I have not seen a silent character so wonderfully utilized within a film for many, many years now, so it was a pleasant surprise to see Lucy Walters do such a fantastic job with her scenes as the silent woman on the subway. They are very important scenes to the film and Walters does a terrific job with them. Her silent role was more fascinating then any of the silent characters from the much overrated The Artist.",Shame

114,mardalsfossen01,"Has some good attempts, but overall I don't think it's quite the masterpiece it could've been",6,5 January 2020,"So this is about sex addiction and since I have seen 'Hunger' of Steve McQueen I know he likes to visualize in a very descriptive way and I think that's fine as long as there's no shortcomings for other things due to screening time.Movie starts with Brandon (Fassbender) walking around naked, I think that's fine, but nobody needed the pee scene. The sexual open relationship between Brandon and his sister Sissy isn't well described; obviously they don't care being naked or half-naked in front of each other from time to time, why, we don't know, we only get the message from Sissy saying they have a tough background. Instead of giving more character description and background information we get more sex scenes and I think that's unnecessary plus I feel like that's just how McQueen wants to get attention and make it more 'scandalous'.Sissy's 'New York New York' singing scene was dragged out too much in my opinion. Again a stylistic way of McQueen, same thing as showing other scenes in a descriptive way this time we get the song very descriptively which wasn't necessary (Brandon crying during it: yes, dragging it out that much: no).When Brandon has the date with Marianne, she makes a way more forward appearance than he does at the restaurant, doesn't make sense to me in the hotel later he has to buy a hooker afterwards instead of making love to her. I think the intention here is to show that he's unable to have a relationship, but he could've had a one-night-stand with Marianne instead or maybe even just a sex based relationship with her since in my opinion she makes clear signs she's physically interested in him ('You look handsome' one of her first sentences in the restaurant) which would be perfect for him since he has a sex addiction.
When Brandon returns home he tosses out a bunch of sex magazines he owns, in the age of the internet and smartphones (since his PC at work got confiscated) not very plausible to me.
At the bar when he sits there alone, a woman who has a boyfriend walks up to the bar to order drinks but instead gazes at Brandon and says 'Hey', afterwards still gazing into his eyes and not repulsing any of his perversions, not very plausible either.Afterwards he goes to a gay bar out of the blue, it's not desperation, not once in the movie before it was shown or hinted that he has a homosexual side, so that was kind of pointless as a reaction to getting beat up before, but I'll take it, it just shows that he's really horny and doesn't care about gender.Then there's the suicide attempt of Sissy, which shows that Brandon was too blind, because of his sex addiction, to see that his sister needs him. I think that was a good moment in the plot. We already knew that she did cut her wrists before, but Brandon didn't see the warning signs, he was more worried about her catching him masturbating in the bathroom than finding a way to help her in terms of her living situation.",Shame
115,rlaine,Bit of a head scratcher..,6,10 March 2014,"Steve McQueen being a bit of a rising name at the moment, I went on and watched this as it was available in Netflix. I knew the movie and was planning on doing it anyway at some point. I've also watched Fassbenders rocketing career with great interest.Needless to say, the movie is about a sex addict Brandon (Fassbender) living in New York City. Other cast includes his sister, boss and a few co-workers. The plot is quite thin, Brandon's sister comes in to live with him - she's apparently a bit of a drifter - and Brandon is not exactly happy about this as he would rather just go on feeding his sex addiction.Where this movie seems to succeed, is showing that sex addiction is like any addiction. When it overpowers you, you only care about feeding the addiction. Nothing else matters, absolutely nothing. You just live for the addiction. That's very well portrayed here, Brandon cares about nothing else and it's tormenting to watch. He could just as well be using heroin or alcohol. Selfishness, unpredictable and angry - even violent - behaviour if taken away from, they are part of being addicted.Where this movie doesn't exactly succeed, is giving the characters any flesh. The relationship between Brandon and his sister Sissy - or the family past - is one big head scratcher. There is a brief scene that suggests problems in Sissy's past, but nothing that would explain - or even give a clue - of anything really. It's OK to a point to be vague and let people make up their own mind, but if you give zero background, it becomes a bit difficult to form any opinion or idea about these characters. Fassbender gives a strong performance, but shows us ultimately one of the most unlikable characters ever to hit the silver screen. And this is because we know absolutely nothing about him, other than the fact that he is a selfish sex addict. And judging by his effort in forming a normal relationship, he doesn't seem that nice of a guy anyhow.I also think there's a bit too much of what you'd call gratuitous nudity. Nudity is natural and as a European I have no problem with it, but knowing how US feels of showing private parts on screen, made me think that a few scenes had quite a little point other than - well - show private parts. Towards the end the content became much more relevant.It's an interesting, strong and gripping movie, but in the end leaves you feeling quite empty. I haven't seen Steve McQueen's other movies, so I don't know if this is his style of doing movies. Recommended, it's definitely worth watching, but not necessarily as good as it could've been.",Shame

WHY?! cleverness, no doubt.the only part I thought worked was the date... and even that was kind of ruined by the ""comic touch"" of the waiter being so overbearing. but the dialogue between the two at dinner I found touching/engaging what have you.the rest of the movie I could thoroughly do without. and... thank god it wasn't any longer. I counted 3 endings as it was. the last 2 being completely superfluous.speaking of the ending, and the scene it echoes.... how ridiculous that this man lost track of the woman... she was hustling a bit but she wasn't tearing off. there's no way a horned up sex addicted dude would have lost the trail of this woman who was clearly creaming over him ...",Shame
117,ghost_dog86,And the Oscar for Best Lead Male Performance goes to,6,4 January 2012,"It is a shame that I didn't like this movie more than I did. OK, now that I got that awful yet unavoidable joke out of my system, on to my review. Directed and co-written by the awesomely named British writer/director Steve McQueen (Hunger), ""Shame"" is the uncensored slice of life story of a successful businessman named Brandon, played with force by Michael Fassbender (X-Men: First Class), conducting his everyday life, while dealing with an intense sexual addiction; which includes visiting porn sites on the daily, paying for prostitutes nightly and sleeping with random girls he meets at bars in order to fill his unquenchable thirst for satisfaction. McQueen creates a very dark overtone in a successful attempt at showing how sexual addiction is very real and ruins people's lives, as would any other addiction. But while the synopsis of this film sets the audience up for something bold and gritty, some of the directorial as well as the script's plot-point choices (a storyline with his sister that is artlessly unnecessary) only work to awkwardly slow down a setup, which had so much more potential and a protagonist who may be one of the most mesmerizing and well acted characters of the year. In the end ""Shame"" serves to be the hardest film I have had to review in quite some time, because while there is some brilliant work here, there is also an equal amount of questionable choices from McQueen, that has all together forced my overall consensus (walking away from this film) to be (as unpopular as this may sound) only a slight recommendation for this OVERALL slightly above average film.Moments of directorial brilliance: Between the intense moments of intercourse (mostly in the, no pun intended, climax of the movie) to the mundane day to day minutiae of an addict, McQueen shows off his storytelling ability. There are even semblances of perfect scenes strewn about ""Shame"", most notably one that involves a close-up of Fassbender's face as the Brandon character engages in a ménage a trois, reaching an emotionally gratifying, yet self loathing climax. The expression on his face is part man having an orgasm and part man having an emotional breakdown, and by all accounts Fassbender, in conjunction with an intensely (in your face) thought provoking shot by McQueen, makes it clear that Brandon is having both. Very emotionally driven scenes, such as this one, demonstrates McQueen's true talent as he encapsulates the entire thesis of his story, about a man tragically suffering from a self-destructive disease, compulsion and an addiction, into one multi-layered moment.Moments of directorial failure: While ""Shame"" centers around Brandon the sex addict, a lot of attention is given to a subplot featuring his ne'er-do-well nomadic slut of a sister named Sissy, played almost annoyingly by Mulligan (but maybe that is simply how her character was written, so I don't really blame her), which distracts far too much from the very interesting initial storyline. A lot of her scenes come off as one big unnecessary thematic element. For instance, in one scene (another close up in fact) shows the Sissy character singing a somber rendition of ""New York, New York"" for more than five minutes. This sequence is supposed to evoke a strong emotional response from the audience, and it does have that effect for the first minute, but then becomes rather tedious as if McQueen had mistakenly forgotten to edit this clip post-production. Other scenes involving her nude interactions with her brother are awkward head scratchers at best. In fact, Mulligan's entire character seemed very much forcefully inserted into large portions of the script, if only to build on a flimsy subplot that this reviewer felt no attachment to. My thoughts with this Sissy character will forever bring forth the same question of Steve McQueen: If you had a potentially fascinating storyline with Fassbenders character alone, why the need to add in another damaged character on top of it all? And while some McQueen apologists may say that the Sissy storyline was only written in to show the dynamic between the siblings, aka while they lived in different financial classes, they both suffered similar emotional baggage, I find that argument flawed when thinking of the satisfying storyline which could have been, without that particular female character. While there are other flaws in this film that work to distract and slow ""Shame"" down, this particular aspect is clearly the most distractingly egregious.Fassbender's award worthy work: Beginning the film with a quiet but controlled performance, Fassbender's slow burn acting style peaks during the rising conflict with a one of the most powerful performances of the year! And while the situations are laid out in the script by McQueen, what Fassbender does with these scenes takes ""Shame"" to a whole other level. He literally breaks down before our eyes, displaying an intricate rainbow of emotions befitting the highest caliber of seasoned (award winning) actor. When he is seen making the slightest eye contact with a married woman on the subway, be plays it like a wolf stalking his pray, and once upon it, losing all self control. And when Brandon's secret life begins to bleed over to his working facade, Fassbender's every so slight facial expressions elicit the dread, monumental social embarrassment and self-disgust the character holds inside. Needless to say, the problems I have with this film had nothing to do with Fassbender's stellar performance.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland",Shame
118,digdog-785-717538,"Starts great, but has a hard time developing past the premise",5,26 January 2012,"The film in question, Shame, follows the plot of a (semi-successful) sex-addicted single and the impact on his life when his sister drops in to stay with him. Sample review keywords:""forces him to focus on his lifestyle"", ""to face his demons"", ""to take a second look at himself"".Yes, but that's not brilliant reviewing in any sense; Shame has a great character (honestly i don't know why people continually refer to the sister as ""broken"", while he's clearly the ""broken"" one) on-par with the lead from The Guard, and the sex-addiction theme is handled better here than in any other film around (excluding Quagmire from Family Guy, *joke*), but the film fails to develop past this introductory stage;What is good in this film: the premise. Explaining the character of Brandon Sullivan, sex addict in a bad way, his sister entering his life and - her being the one girl he can't treat as an object - forcing him into a stressful situation of either, having to face his addiction, or stay under the influence, but push her away.But then comes the bad in this film: tough premises are hard to develop.Yes, he is really the damaged one; Yes also there are really people who do ""random sex"" and sex addicts really do exist, but what? Is the target audience of this film that one percent of the viewers who doesn't know that? Because certainly school mums aren't gonna go in a theatre to see Shame. Unfortunately the director here says - very well - everything there is to say in the first half hour, and after that, there is little to keep the film going. Or should i say, nothing?Shame starts out as a great film, and i can recommend anyone to watch the first half hour; but be advised that the next hour is all the same, perhaps even a little worse. Great watch for filmmakers, both great material and terrible storyboard in one sitting.My vote: 5/10 - half a proper film.",Shame
119,asifahsankhan,"The ""Sex"" is not treated as prurient, erotic or, as the title would suggest, shameful. Give it a watch!",8,19 June 2017,"Steve McQueen's Shame is about a man who is compulsively addicted to sexual pleasure. Like any other kind of addict, his cravings continue to push limits and take control of his life. He takes new sexual partners (sometimes paying for it) with stunning regularity. He is also a, well he frequently masturbates, sometimes unable to hold off while at work. His boss informs him that the IT department came across a trove of pornography on his computer's hard drive, but assumes it must have been an intern.The sex is not treated as prurient, erotic or, as the title would suggest, shameful. For Brandon Sullivan it is a fact of his life and one that imprisons him in his own sense of shame. But he's not creepy. In all aspects he is a normal working man. Except that he's also got the movie star good looks of Michael Fassbender with his hard jaw line, piercing eyes and just a hint of an Irish lilt when he speaks. It's the eyes and body language that exudes a take-charge attitude that allows him to seduce a young married woman on the subway by doing nothing more than staring at her and allowing the slightest hint of a smile.Mulligan and Fassbender give unbridled performances, not just because they lay bare their bodies for McQueen and cinematographer Sean Bobbitt, whose lighting makes no attempt to conceal or obfuscate their physical presence, just as the screenplay, co- written by McQueen and Abi Morgan insists on being candid when it comes to the sheer duress Brandon and Sissy live under. They are broken individuals, scarred it would seem by a past that is never revealed. But Shame is not about how the past affects them, it's about the here and now, how each is a prisoner of personal demons and both have difficulty connecting emotionally with someone long term.Whereas Brandon mostly internalises the wreckage of his life, Sissy is more outwardly an emotional disaster. Trying to make it as a lounge singer, she invites Brandon and David to a gig at a swanky bar where she performs a mournful rendition of ""New York, New York."" ""If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere,"" she sings, reminding us that New York City is the toughest of towns, maybe too harsh at times for someone like Sissy. She is also quick to jump into bed with strangers, but when she does so with David, we see the first signs of Brandon's near inability to control his rage, an emotion that for him is inextricably wound with feelings of lust.Every protagonist needs to have an arc, should go through some kind of change and come out the other end of a story knowing more than he did at the start. It's hard to pinpoint exactly what change takes place in Brandon except that his sexual proclivities become more and more dangerous. His redemption is subtle, but comes in a moment when he stops being self-absorbed for a moment to understand the full ramifications of a voicemail Sissy leaves for him saying, ""It's not that we're bad people, we just come from a bad place."" The closing scene of the film is suggestive, though not explicit, of a change in Brandon, when he has another silent encounter with the same woman on the subway. When we see her wedding ring again, we recall his admonition of Sissy for not just going to bed with a married man, but continuing to call him after. It's an enigmatic ending, not unlike Brandon as a character, that McQueen wisely leaves to the imagination what he's going to choose.",Shame
120,theinaniloquent,"""Shame""",9,16 May 2012,"I heard about this film beforehand, and found it to be really intriguing. It sounded like one of those films that makes you think, makes you wonder, makes you feel shame. I'm a big fan of these, because they don't attempt to ""Hollywood"" everything, and actually try to convey emotion from the audience instead of trying to keep everything secreted and giving the audience a half-assed attempt at something. So I finished watching it about ten minutes ago, and I was blown away...Shame is exactly how I had foresaw. It was brutal, vulgar, and raw. It was one of those films you are embarrassed to talk about, but deep down understanding it's reasoning and meaning. I was, firstly, blown away from Fassbender's performance. He was spellbinding. Without him, I think the film wouldn't of gotten the same reaction it did. Whatever scene he was in, keep your eyes on him, because he knocks it out of the park, and gives a realistic and haunting approach that you will be thinking about for days. I loved Mulligan too, who gave a different performance then when I first saw her in Drive. It was interesting to see, and fantastic to see her with diversity. But what the film is built off of is it's context. I hear people complaining that the film doesn't even know it's own material, and I laugh at them. I found the whole entire film understandable and real, and almost to an extent where I can understand the character's feelings. Then I hear people saying the movie was just a porno in disguise. I laugh at them as well. I felt that the whole vulgarity of the film was a way to push realism, and make you feel like the character himself. I liked it this way, and can clearly see that the film deserved it's NC-17 rating... The film was slow, and was built as a character study. Some people can clearly be put off by this, but you need to know what you're getting yourself into. I loved it. Didn't exactly enjoy it (as it's not exactly an entertaining experience) but appreciated it's artsy direction and also it's clear understanding of an addiction. I thought they did it right.By the end, I was shook and shamed. The film is not exactly what you see everyday, and that's what made me love it so much. It has almost perfect acting, a realistic approach, a slow but fitting pace, and a depressing and haunting atmosphere that will leave you with a scar for days...9/10.",Shame
121,nesfilmreviews,Fassbender and McQueen make this work.,8,4 November 2014,"Teaming up once again after their stunning work on the 2008 Bobby Sands drama, ""Hunger,"" director Steve McQueen and Michael Fassbender share a special chemistry best detailed in bracing films containing little to no dialogue. ""Shame"" examines the nature of need with how we live our lives and the experiences that shape us. ""Shame"" powerfully communicates to the audience and leaves us to internalize our own thoughts, asking us to paint our own cinematic details in the gaps.The film's opening shot shows Brandon awake in the morning, staring immobile into space. He never reveals emotion. He lives like a man compelled to follow an inevitable course, and his life is a living hell. He is cold to everyone he encounters. On the subway, he trades eye contact with a woman his is flirting with. He boldly maintains eye contact, but doesn't smile. His is a dreadful life. His shame masked in privacy.Brandon (Michael Fassbender) is a good-looking, young man in his early 30's, who lives alone in a sterile condo in Manhattan. He works in a cubicle with a computer. Never mind what his company does. It makes no difference to him. Sometimes in the evening, he and his boss, David (James Badge Dale), go out to drink in singles bars. David is an outgoing and throwing out pick-up lines. Brandon just sits there, his face impassive, knowing he doesn't have to. He shuns intimacy with women but feeds his desires with a compulsive addiction to sex.The introduction of Sissy (Carey Mulligan), Brandon's sister, injects spontaneity and life into this almost emotionally desolate film. She is as passionate and uninhibited as he is the complete opposite. This encounter resurfaces memories of their shared painful past, and Brandon's insular life and addiction begin to spiral out of control. She needs him desperately and that frightens him most. She works sometimes as a cabaret singer, and in one scene, she performs a fantastic rendition of ""New York, New York"" in close-up. This close-up also shows pain and grief of both, a truly beautiful moment captured.McQueen's camera gives us a mix of the highly stylized and the stark, with frequent long takes giving the actors the narrative space to embellish scenes with depth. Fassbender for one, is often captured looking to the ground, almost failing to register the world before him. McQueen gives the audience an opportunity to absorb Brandon's mental process, understanding how the man struggles with his impulses. It's an opening into a foreign world of obsession and shame; an orgasmic thrill-of- the-hunt existence. The movie can get overwhelming and burdensome for some as the movie, as well as Brandon's addiction, progresses with terrifying consequences. However, Fassbender's powerful, gut-wrenching performance and Steve McQueen's direction behind the camera is what makes this film so extraordinary.",Shame

He is lonely and emotional weak. He lacks good relationships in his life. Shame is brilliant on several levels. It shows that things really are not as they often seem.

Everything it wants to tell us is perfectly shown on the surface. It is not meant to be very deep movie in that department, but it is thoughtful. Porn (and sex) addiction is much bigger problem than mainstream likes to acknowledge. It leads into depression and degradation of social behavior. Michael Fassbender's portrayal of Brandon fighting with it's inner demons, that cause him quite few shameful moments, is pleasantly calm and striking. His dysfunctional relationship with his sister Sissy (equally great performance by Carey Mulligan) is almost tragic. Two damaged people who need help, but don't know how to support each other. Unresponsible Sissy who can barely manage herself, and Brandon who's unable to let go of his addictions.'Shame' is very bleak view of someone's life spiraling down while they are perfectly aware of it, but in the end they do very little to escape.",Shame
129,colinrgeorge,Sex without the Pleasure,8,9 December 2011,"Sex without the pleasure — and you thought starving to death in an Irish prison was rough. Following Hunger, director Steve McQueen's new collaboration with Michael Fassbender is a similarly self-destructive character study. Shame stars the latter as Brandon Sullivan, a sex- addicted New York businessman whose explicit lifestyle is threatened by the surprise arrival of his orphaned sister (Carey Mulligan). Loaded with full-frontal male and female nudity and graphic depictions of sex, the NC-17 rated flick may not be coming to a theater near you.Far from crass or exploitative, however, McQueen's film succeeds in making Brandon's many lascivious liaisons feel obligatory rather than erotic. Shame is Requiem for a Dream for sex. A gorgeously shot but emotionally upending orgy late in the film drives home the utter desperation of the act in a prolonged close up on Brandon's contorted face. Excited yet?McQueen's flirted with minimalism before. Smack dab in the middle of Hunger is a seventeen and a half minute static shot in which Fassbender's character dialogues with a priest. While it showcases two terrific performances, such laissez-faire filmmaking techniques do little for me. Shame likewise features long, deliberate takes, but McQueen's evolution as a director is apparent from his dynamic use of the frame.For example, during a dinner date between Brandon and his coworker (Nicole Beharie), a subtle camera push-in (from the wide restaurant interior, bustling with the comings and goings of patrons and waiters, to an intimate two shot) keeps the emphasis on the performances without needlessly drawing attention to the process. It's the rare circumstance where more is actually less. Conversely, the extreme close up of Carey Mulligan's face when she performs a heart-wrenching rendition of ""New York, New York"" works because she fills the entire frame. By comparison, the aforementioned sequence in Hunger is visually flabby, full of superfluous space.But Shame isn't just a technical triumph — even more compelling is what's in the abstract. Fassbender's alluringly enigmatic portrayal of his volatile character is the centerpiece of a complex, cerebral story. Brandon carries his addiction like a ticking time bomb in his breast pocket, and things get particularly uncomfortable with his vulnerable (and oddly familiar) sister around. Their relationship adds a grimy layer of squeamish tension to the film.Unhappiness manifests itself in many shapes in Shame, from Brandon's insatiable carnal appetite to the loneliness of the women in his life. Incapable of transcending their physical connections, the characters share sex or blood, but don't understand each other or strive to communicate better. The result is intercourse that frequently comes across dehydrating, disgusting, or dehumanizing. Sometimes all three!Shame isn't without its moments of levity. McQueen's subtle humor saves him from slipping into the mire of downbeat melodrama. James Badge Dale plays Brandon's wingman (or is it the other way around?), whose paper-thin personality and repeated drunken strikeouts never fail to conjure a smirk. Also, I'm not sure there's a world where getting caught masturbating isn't at least a little funny. But leave it to Steve McQueen and Michael Fassbender to make it captivating too.The culmination of lesser successes, Shame sees both actor and director at their best. Fassbender makes Brandon's incongruities flesh (so to speak), and McQueen strikes the perfect balance between minimalistic staging and cinematic artistry. Shame is an ambitious, ambiguous film that ranks easily among the year's best. Plus, you get to see Michael Fassbender naked. There's also that.",Shame

132,patryk-czekaj,A controversial story for our times,7,26 April 2012,"I went to see this movie with my father. I came out of the cinema having a wildly amusing thought in my mind: Did I just watch a soft core pornographic flick with my own dad? But somewhere in the middle there was Shame. And I can't say that I didn't like it. What's more, I just knew that this could be one of the biggest indie movies of the year.If I'd have to summarize it in a few simple word I'd say: it's like American Psycho, but 80% less violent, yet 80% more erotic. Michael Fassbender gives a great performance as Brandon Sullivan, the wealthy and classy sex addict, who is trying to show the world that there is nothing wrong with his life. However, as we slowly begin to get a greater insight into his problematic 'disease' we learn that this disturbed young man desperately needs help and fast. And here, suddenly, comes his sister, who wants to move with him for a couple of weeks. Brandon's life is turned upside down, his hitherto chaotic way of life spins into more uncontrollable circles, as Sissy Sullivan uselessly tries to help him overcome his addiction. In the meantime we also find out that she has some big problems of her own, i.e. boyfriend and suicide related. What a family, one would say.But try to imagine how many of such disturbed families live on this planet. I have to admit, it is sometimes not easy to watch those two characters fighting and arguing about what went wrong in their lives and why they should live apart. And that is maybe because all of us are secretly struggling to become better and overpower our strangest fears and suppress our deepest needs.The emotional impact in this movie is depicted mostly through all sorts of frequent sex scenes, but I won't go into details in here. Steve McQueen didn't want to bore us with compelling dialogues, but he wanted to explain the motion of the plot by lengthy and obscene acts. I have to admit, I still have some of them in my mind, even though a few months have passed since I saw Shame. Due to its shocking presentation and utterly precise scenes many people wouldn't like the movie. That is probably why it didn't get the attention it deserved. I sadly knew that this would happen, because it also happened to American Psycho more than 10 years ago. People can't find genius in these kinds of movies, simply because they are overwhelmed by the drastic factors that are included in them. For SHAME...",Shame
133,axlrhodes,Astonishingly intimate performance from Michael Fassbender.,9,29 July 2012,"It's difficult to think of a film that deals with the very real issue of sex addiction with as much fearless truthfulness as 'Shame'. Michael Fassbender is Brandon, a middle class New Yorker with a good job and a comfortable life, that is until his sister, Sissy, played by Carey Mulligan comes along and throws his routine in to disarray. In terms of story, this is very much a character study of a man trying to function in the real world with an all consuming affliction that dominates his every thought. Brandon's shame is what propels him. With each selfish act of sex, he digs himself a deeper hole of self indulgence that distances him from any kind of emotional connection to the extent that he finds himself cut off and unresponsive, even from his own sister. Like any addict, it's as if in order to function, he needs a bigger 'hit' of shame to cancel out the previous one. The bravery and intimacy of Fassbender's performance is both surprising and captivating. From full frontal nudity to deeply emotional scenes, his honesty is admirable and utterly breathtaking. Carey Mulligan's 'Sissy' is similarly mixed up. It's hinted that both siblings have had dark childhood's which continue to haunt them into their present day. Both punish themselves in differing ways, though of the two, it's Sissy who tries most to reach out and emotionally engage. There are long sex scenes, but they aren't in any way erotic or exploitative. The sex is Brandon's way of numbing himself and his pain and desperation grows deeper with each sordid encounter. Steve McQueen's direction is a thing of beauty. For the most part it's unfussy and allows the fine acting to draw you in. One restaurant scene between Brandon and a potential female suitor features a slow camera push-in that almost subconsciously feeds the sense of being more and more involved in the conversation. Another beautifully captured piece of non verbal chemistry on the subway between Brandon and a female passenger is charged with a tangible air of mutually repressed sexual desire. Use of lighting and music is also powerful and exquisitely applied. Brandon's slow self implosion is a painful watch, his character isn't a bad man, just self repressed and badly damaged, and McQueen's full on handling of the subject matter combined with Fassbender's remarkable portrayal deserves great credit.",Shame
134,Tehmeh,Fassbender is a force.,9,19 May 2014,"With every movie I watch that stars Michael Fassbender, I become more and more impressed. This was no exception, Fassbender really displays his talent level and makes everything look so easy.""Shame"" is a well-constructed drama. It is sometimes subtle, sometimes not at all, and almost every decision that director McQueen makes is the right one. It simply works.There is no clear plot that needs to be resolved, more of a look into (mainly) two people's lives. There is a sense of realism and intimacy, even though both main characters aren't exactly examples of intimate and coherent life. I recognized myself and a few close people to me from some traits these characters had.I like exciting and fun spectacles, but I need to have these films too to balance it out. Thank God for movies like this, because the day we stop making these films and looking deeper into our lives as human beings, that will be the day we have lost something special.Don't expect exciting story lines. Expect characters, fantastic acting from Fassbender and Mulligan, good script/direction and a movie you can watch when you're in that certain ponderous mood.Highlight of the film was something we rarely see: A long, incredibly intense conversation scene with absolutely no cuts or editing. You'll know it when you see it. If that made you even a little bit excited, this might be your film.Recommended, but not a party movie. Watch it alone.",Shame

It's about isolation from family ties, friends and even your own self.The filming is just phenomenal. Nothing is redundant, every shot is substantial and necessary in the story.A rare film, not appreciated by everyone. I saw a lot of couples leaving the theater, 15 minutes in.

137,toqtaqiya2,An elegant film about a man who can't feel.,9,20 March 2012,"Shame is an unusual British drama by director Steve McQueen which opened in limited release in the United States. Michael Fassbender plays Brandon Sullivan, a man with a simple and patterned life. He's addicted to pornography, and he spends his time having sex with an assortment of pretty women. His life begins to unravel, however, when his sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) moves into his apartment. It is a simple story but it's a character study in the tradition of Fyodor Dostoevsky that tackles some disturbing issues. It was made like an independent film and it contains a good deal of nudity. Fassbender, a rising young star, is perfect in the leading role. Mulligan also acts the part, and scenes with the two of them are moving. With its aura of authenticity Shame is really serious filmmaking. It's a successful and memorable study of modern life that I'm sure took some courage to make. Shame is one of the best films I've seen this year, and I recommend seeing it.",Shame

139,dharmendrasingh,A Cinematic Landmark,9,17 January 2012,"'Shame' is an exceptional film, the kind which doesn't come around too often. More than a film, it's an education. Director Steve McQueen may be modest about his intentions ('All a director can do is hope to start a conversation'), but 'Shame' is, to my mind, a cinematic landmark. It lifts the lid on sexual addiction and presents it every bit as deleterious as any other addiction.Snubbed by their native UK, McQueen and his screenwriter Abi Morgan (who wrote the less interesting 'The Iron Lady') went to New York, a place where creativity still means something, and were embraced. A Turner prize-winning artist by trade, McQueen has taken to film like a wunderkind. His esteemed first film, released in 2008, was called 'Hunger'. Its topic caused controversy (it dramatises the IRA member Bobby Sands' 1981 hunger strike), but it established McQueen as a serious filmmaker. Now, with his lead from that film (Michael Fassbender), McQueen has created a sad, honest, brutal film of enormous power.Fassbender, here and elsewhere an acting powerhouse, plays Brandon Sullivan, a thirty-something-year-old professional, working for a New York advertising company. Everything about him shouts success. His sleek apartment, designer clothes and mod-cons - he couldn't do any better. But Brandon keeps a shameful secret: he's a sex addict.He organises his life around a routine of sex, sex and more sex. Work is no obstacle. When he gets the urge, he relieves himself in the staff toilet. At home, he accesses his Pandora's Box of porn to satisfy his craving: adult magazines, dirty DVDs, internet porn, on-line strip shows.Brandon's boss (James Badge Dale) is more like his best buddy. He's also a sex addict, but because he does the whole drinks and dinner thing we accept him as a typical bloke. At work, both are vehement professionals; away from the office they're sexual predators, living only to chase girls.Carey Mulligan plays Sissy, Brandon's estranged sister. Her depiction of a bruised young woman with a dark history ('We're not bad people, we just come from a bad place') is profound in its brilliance. There's a whole back story we never see or hear of but we know exists just by the way Brandon and Sissy react to one another. Something happened in their lives which has caused their relationship to be untenable.McQueen has a fluid way of telling a story; 'Shame' doesn't pause for breath. Each scene is more alluring than the next. It is photographed in varying shades of icy blues and dull greys which, together with melancholy music, mirror the colour and sound of Brandon's psyche.McQueen likes to linger on scenes he knows which will be remembered. Take the one where Sissy sings an unhurried rendition of 'New York, New York'. How many directors would have removed a verse or two? Or concluded it with a premature fade-away? Not McQueen. He allows Mulligan to sing the whole song. And why not? Her voice is terrific.Or another scene, where Brandon dines with a girl he considers his next conquest. The writing of this arresting scene is superb – so nuanced and yet completely realistic and revealing. It's also ominous because this one scene explains the point of 'Shame': Brandon could be any one of us, an outwardly ordinary person, harbouring a dirty little secret.The sex is shocking only because it's natural-looking (I wonder if any of it was real?). It has no likeness to any of the sanitised sex we normally get. This film shows an addiction, not a fetish. It isn't ecstasy on Brandon's face, it's pain. In one scene, while midway through sex, Brandon stops and moves away, disgusted with himself. Why? Because it as that point he realises he doesn't want sex, he needs it.The film takes a sinister turn after Brandon and Sissy have a particularly vicious argument. McQueen creatively merges three scenes to produce an effect that is at once profoundly disturbing and deeply sad.McQueen is different because he says what he thinks. When asked what he said to his actors to make them do the things we see, McQueen was offended by the question. He replied along the lines of, 'I don't consider them to be doing anything extraordinary. Actors should have no boundaries. If they don't feel comfortable doing what I tell them to, then I don't want to work with them'. Now, there's a director I could get used to.www.moseleyb13.com",Shame
140,JimmyCollins,"Michael Fassbender is a champion, everything about that man is great.",7,19 February 2012,"Films such as Shame usually come along around the awards season time, and each year they usually all go without winning anything, which is a shame in itself, just because these films are a tad quieter than the big performers, but sometimes quiet is good, and in this case it is. I will say that yes, the film does have it's flaws, it's rather slow paced and once or twice throughout the film I was a bit bored, but it wasn't long before I was back into the story. The film presents itself as being a story about a man who is a sex addict and the repercussions it has on his life, I however think differently, I don't really think that it was really obvious that he was addicted to sex, he watches porn and has a lot of sex, lots of people do that, i wasn't really convinced that he was a sex addict, to me the story doesn't really have a plot, it's more just scenes that you watch that kind if tell a story but not really, it's strange really, but even though there is a lack of plot it doesn't mean that the film isn't good, the acting saves it.Michael Fassbender is great, he's definitely becoming one of my favorite actors, and his performance in Shame is excellent, every time he is in screen you pay attention, very different to the usual kind of role I've seen him in, he nails every scene to perfection, and seeing him walk around naked ain't half bad either, let's hope he continues to do nudity in film. Carey Mulligan I'm still not sold on, yes she was good in An Education, and OK in Never Let Me Go, but since then i think she is a rather mediocre actress, she really just bores me, and I think her taking in this role she thought she would shed this good girl image but I just don't think it worked, and I also think her American accent was flawed.The overall feel of the film is quite cold and dark, which I rather liked, it kind of reminded me a little bit if American Psycho, the male characters were quite similar I thought, the score is also very fitting to each scene. Shame is probably a film you will either thunk is great or terrible, no in between, it has a bit of an ambiguous ending but a story like this probably doesn't really need a conclusion.I would recommend film enthusiasts to give it a go, people who will appreciate it for what it is, but if you're looking for a fun night at the movies, go see something else, but I'll let you all make up your own mind. Give it a go, the money shot at the beginning is worth the admission price. :)",Shame
141,jonnyfendi,Enlighten You About Sex,8,25 June 2012,"Viewer discretion is advised. It's about sex. First of all, Michael Fassbender deserves extra credit for his involvement. I realize not everyone is willing to play in thiz kind of controversial subject. Just like me, at first I also had a reluctance to review thiz movie. But on second thought, thiz movie is too good to miss. Previously, Michael Fassbender made his presence known with a breakthrough role as Magneto in the blockbuster movie ""X-Men: First Class"" (2011). Thiz time, Michael Fassbender plays in thiz controversial erotic drama about a successful New Yorker who looks ordinary on the outside, but on the inside he's struggling to hold himself as sex addict. At the same time, he has personal responsibility to protect his sister (Carey Mulligan) from the harsh realities of the outside world. There are some full frontal nudity and explicit sex scenes, involving two main characters, Fassbender and Mulligan. But it's acceptable. Eventually you will come to understand that it's for the depth of storytelling. Michael Fassbender displays his acting versatility, just like he did in ""Hunger"" (2008). He can explore his complex character attractively. Carey Mulligan also shows a little bit of her singing talent here. The man behind thiz psychological movie is Steve Mc Queen. Nope, of course not the famous legendary Actor, just the same name. His directing is provocative and effective. Sometimes he adds some relaxing piano instrumentals to calm the situation. Thiz movie invites us to contemplate something that may enlighten us. Sex is a basic part of human nature. Even each of us sometimes has a tendency to direct sexual desire toward the opposite sex. But you have to see it thiz way, in your heart you know that no one deserves to be treated as a sex object. The explanation is simple, because they might also be someone's sister, daughter or mother, and vice versa. Once you realize that, then you will be able to see sex differently. It's just because we are all human.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonyfendi.blogspot.com",Shame
142,rcolgan,A Tragic Masterpiece,9,27 August 2016,"Near the beginning of Shame we're given a glimpse in to Brandon's (Michael Fassenbender) life as he sits alone on a train. He catches the eye of a pretty young woman who gives him a smile. As he begins to look her up and down he notices that she's wearing a wedding ring. But this doesn't matter to him. Brandon is unable to resist and tries follows her off the train, before losing her in the crowd. He is completely controlled by his addiction and is trapped in his own self-loathing life style. Throughout this entire sequence, Fassenbender has a look of complete anguish on his face. He gains no pleasure from pursuing his sexual needs. He feels only shame. Steve McQueen represents sex addiction as a form of self-abuse, with the agonising pain Brandon's sex addiction causes himself being bought to the forefront of practically every scene. McQueen avoids the clichés of a typical Hollywood sex scene, with shots uncomfortably lingering for too long and maintaining a focus of Brandon's emotional fallout throughout the scene. In one of the most powerful and tragic moments of the film McQueen ends a sex scene with a close up of Fassenbender's face as he orgasms. His expression is a mixture of pain and misery, with the entire scene having such an overwhelming feeling of anguish that feels similar to a death scene a death scene. In spite of Brandons addiction controlling his entire life, nobody around him seems to notice. Every girl he meets seems to be perfectly fine catering to his every sexual need (although to be fair many of these girls are hookers just doing their jobs). His co- workers seem completely oblivious to the fact that Brandon spends most of his time at work jacking off in the bathroom. Even when Brandon's boss discovers that his entire hard drive is filled with porn, his boss quickly assumes that it belongs to his assistant and remains completely unaware of his addiction. The only person who seems to be aware of his addiction is his sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan), who moves in to his apartment whilst she has some gigs in the city. But she doesn't seem to be able to help much since Brandon appears to want to create as much distance between the two of them as possible, constantly avoiding her calls and remaining extremely aggressive towards her at any opportunity he gets. It also doesn't help that Sissy is just as self-destructive as Brandon is. But whereas he is cold and detached, Sissy is in dire need of emotional support with a history of self-harm who has cut herself several times in the past. We never know exactly what caused them to become this way, but it's clear they've both been damaged in the past. This history is instead told through both Fassenbender and Mulligans powerhouse performances that can tell a history of suffering and anguish without needing to say a single word. Sissy keeps reaching out to Brandon and Brandon keeps pushing her away, leaving them both completely isolated. And this is probably the greatest tragedy of Shame, as it is the lack of any real support that leaves addicts like Brandon unable to escape their lifestyle. They'll either keep their addiction hidden in embarrassment or actively push away anybody who could actually help them, leaving them trapped in their own self-harming life-style and unable to stop their path of self-destruction. The entire tone of Shame strongly resembles Requiem for a Dream. It creates a similar tone of complete despair and serves as a harrowingly realistic representation of the pitfalls of addiction. It's a true masterpiece, though also one that can be hard to sit through.",Shame
143,davek28,Tacky and pretentious,5,22 May 2012,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this film prior to viewing it on Blu-Ray. I knew it was essentially about a sex addict, but that was pretty much all. What I didn't realise that it's essentially a vehicle for Michael Fassbender to display his extensive credentials. In that respect, it certainly succeeds. I felt sorry for Carey Mulligan in that she seems to have been taken in by the director and screenplay into thinking that it's a worthwhile piece of cinematic art. It isn't.So we have two non-Americans as the leads, both delivering (or screaming) their lines in not-quite-American accents. Admittedly, there was a minor excuse regarding Brandon being brought up in Ireland. We also have Ms Mulligan delivering a wavering performance as a songstress in which she hits the notes most of the time. I can understand the expressions of amazement on the faces of Brandon and his boss. I don't know how she got the cabaret gig either. Will someone also please tell her to get her roots done.How this guy ever held down a job up till this point, I don't know. His computer is riddled with porn and malware, yet he's not fired. He arrives late every day. He doesn't seem to do any actual work. I think there's a presentation somewhere to imply that they're one of those mythical advertising agencies which only exist in movies. Spacious modern offices, gorgeous staff, freedom to come and go as they please, big salaries, little work.But I'm rambling.For some reason, just as the cameras are turned on him by Steve McQueen, he decides to have a breakdown. Somehow he fails to rise to the occasion with the most gorgeous, slinky, sexy co-worker and potential girlfriend (Nicole Beharie), yet he's still a pile driver with cheap hookers and indiscriminate gay guys. Maybe I'm just not getting the message that's being daubed on the screen before me (kidding).There are long periods of nothing much happening - or things happening that I don't want to see (Brandon peeing). There are arty-farty touches such as the two of them watching an old thirties cartoon that's deliberately kept out of focus while they argue on the sofa - shot from behind. There's the obligatory penthouse hotel room with fabulous views. There's the obvious bookends of the two New York subway scenes - initially perving (and following) the sexy girl and then finally feeling ashamed to perv the sexy girl.I get it! I really do! Sex addiction is bad. So is war, but I'm satiated with war movies telling me this. I sincerely hope there are no more films about sex addiction in development. I'm downgrading my vote from 6 to 5 after this rant. I just hope the Blu-Ray hasn't left a mess in my player.",Shame

Very rarely we've been exposed to so much sex without an ounce of erotic flavors. Well, that was not the intention, clearly. This is a remarkably serious film about addiction.To make matters even darker I had seen Michael Fassbender as Jung only a few days before. What an actor! Now I feel I'm as familiar with his anatomy as Mrs. Fassbender must be. I must admit the film stayed with me because within its mathematical coldness there is a palpable element of horror. Was it me or Fassbender shows the face of death in one of the many sexual occasions? Chilling really. I will take my chances and recommend it, as long as you don't take your children - I guess you can't NC17 - or your grandparents.",Shame

Somewhere in the middle, we see shots of him pleasuring himself in the shower and in the restroom at work.

146,chaz-28,"Quite effective during conversational scenes, but thoroughly dull in those long segments in between",4,18 December 2011,"Brandon Sullivan (Michael Fassbender) has an addiction. He does not struggle against it, seek therapy to cure it, or deny its existence; he learns to cope with it and attempts to shape his life around it to create routine and give it space. Brandon is addicted to sex but appears to be a bit more OCD about it than the regular sex addict looking to score at the club on a weekend. He has a handle on his issue enough to know specifically what he wants. This specificity is most likely his limiting factor when it comes to real life relationships and intimacy, but Brandon's life seems mostly manageable with the boundaries he sets for himself and the rigid schedule he follows.This routine is shattered when a person whose phone messages he has been ignoring suddenly shows up in his apartment, his sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan). There is a hospital bracelet around her wrist but the audience does not know why. It appears Sissy has interrupted Brandon's life before but the audience is unaware of that as well. There is a lot the audience is not let in on. Shame is set strictly in the present. There are no flashbacks, no conversations discussing the past, and only vague references to any events ever occurring from a day earlier than yesterday.Brandon has a job, goes to the office every day, seems successful, but we do not know what it is he does. His preferred M.O. is to get through the day, perhaps enjoy a drink after work, and then settle in front of his laptop for a night full of pornography to watch. Sometimes he ends up with a bar conquest engaging in sex underneath a bridge or pressed up against a window facing the world, but usually it is the laptop sequence at night.Sissy throws a wrench into this entire schedule. Since she is around, Brandon's boundaries, self-imposed limitations, and routine are altered which in turn alters his judgment and decision making skills. Brandon has some self destructive tendencies which Sissy does not intentionally trigger, but she certainly does not dampen them either.Unfortunately, the pacing and movement of Shame stutters throughout the film. Think of a pebble skipping across the water. When it strikes the water, something happens and the water ripples away from the impact. In Shame, this takes the form of a long conversation between Brandon and Sissy, his boss, or an awkward first date. However, when the pebble is airborne between water strikes, nothing happens. There are extended sequences and tracking shots following Brandon jog the streets of Manhattan, stare at a screen, stare out the window, or just walk around and ponder.Shame is not expressly about Brandon's addiction, but more about his lifestyle, how Sissy affects it, and how he responds to his sister in her extended hour of need. The film suffers a bit from those segments between conversations scenes where the camera just follows Brandon around as he accomplishes inconsequential tasks. The only reason Shame has the buzz it does in the public sphere is because of its NC-17 rating.There are numerous and explicit sex scenes, frequent shots of Fassbender in the altogether, and direct discussions of everything in between. It is refreshing to see a film which reflects reality as well as Shame does concerning sex, but just because this is a rare occurrence, does not make it automatically superior to an R-rated film which hides and sneaks around these matters. I do not recommend Shame precisely because it is quite dull in those long portions between dialogue; however, if you are looking for real situations which standard PG-13 and R-rate films gloss over, Shame is a fine way to experience it.",Shame
147,SimonD1900,Character study at its best,9,18 January 2020,"Great character study about a very empty man with a lot of inner pain. He is trying to use sex as a way to get away from this deep pain, or at least to numb himself from it. He uses escorts and has a severe addiction to ""adult content,"" and here the movie shows that this kind of addiction is like any other strong addiction, like alcohol or heroin. Also that functioning people can be addicts, it's not even uncommon. It can become the only thing the person really cares about, or more so obsesse over. And also that people that becomes addicts usually has some sort of inner pain. Which often has a base in some sort of childhood trauma. And that the addiction is just an escape or ""self medicating"" in a way. Also that it actually doesn't help the person to feel better at all in the long run, only worse, only shame.His sister seems as damaged as him but deals with it in other ways. She is an emotional wreck, clingy and needy, but perhaps the closest thing he has to a real human relationship. Beacuse although he's a high functioning individual in society, he has absolutely no real human connection in his life.Some of the first words spoken in the film is ""I find you disgusting"" with his face in frame, they're not spoken at him in that moment, but they explain what he really is behind his controlled and reliable facade. This is a man that has a long way to go to heal himself from the dark pit he's in.This is how characters study should be done, where every scene gives you a deeper insight to the character and what his inner world must be like.

148,marydm-43470,Fassbender is off the scale,10,16 June 2021,"Riveting. Harrowing. Disturbing. I don't like adjectives too much but it's hard to convey the visceral reaction I had to this film without adjectives.Fassbender is off the scale great and equally off the scale brave to take on such a challenge, with what appears at first to be risque material that has the potential to tarnish his reputation both as an actor and a human being.But thanks to his extraordinary acting skills and a beautifully calibrated direction by McQueen, the potentially ""sleazy"" material ends up having tremendous emotional and intellectual impact on the viewer.I could list a huge number of great aspects all converging in this film, including a brilliant turn by Mulligan, but suffice it to say that the addiction depicted is presented with such respect and integrity that it amounts to a human tragedy worthy of our attention and feelings.The expressions on Fassbender's face in the final stages of the film, when he tries so hard to have an orgasm with multiple partners, is like those ancient masks used in Greek and Roman theatre, depicting not pleasure but pain, suffering and even a soupcon of self-loathing. The contortions on Fassbender's face are just extraordinary.Not a pleasant or voyeuristic watch at all. A rather painful one actually, but a great piece of cinema depicting dark aspects of human personality in an unflinching and grown up way.And that's my final word, it's cinema from a bunch of brave cinema makers intended for grown ups as distinct from ""adult movies"" which are anything but.Brilliant job all round, but Fassbender borders on acting greatness.",Shame

His emotionally unstable sister moves in to stay with him which unsettles his routine ( which consists mainly of watching porn on his lap top and associated play). Things get worse in the siblings relationship when the sister sleeps with his sexual predator work colleague friend.There is not much more really to the plot. We see his attempt to forge a relationship with another work colleague but because emotion may be involved he cannot perform and so he reverts back to hookers and anything he can pick up, culminating on a night were both he and his sisters' appetite for destruction are partially satiated.Make no mistake this film is just controversy for controversy sake.

151,eonbluedan-1,Less than the sum of its parts,6,10 January 2013,"I was aware of Steve McQueen as an artist, whose work I even recall studying at GCSE here in the UK, but it was his debut feature Hunger that confirmed him as a serious film maker. Hunger also confirmed the suspicion I had roused by the movie Eden Lake, that Michael Fassbender was a screen force who demanded some real attention. Here in McQueen's second feature he plays Brandon, a thirty-something living on his own in New York, whose professional life remains steady, while his personal one is absolutely driven by a need for sexual gratification. Whether it be through pornography, random women like the one at a bar his boss wants to take home, prostitutes, or simply regular trips to the bathroom to have a friendly get-together with his hand, he is in need of release through sex. To understand a film is about such a topic, two things come to mind: it sounds funny, and even if it is not, it is undoubtedly going to be a piece of erotica not far removed from pornography. In fact Shame is neither funny or erotic. It is explicit, but that is to be expected. What it is actually about is far more interesting; a sincere examination of a lonely, lost soul in a vast, faceless city, and the need, and importantly the lack of desire, to find something more, to feel connected, to feel human. This need seems highlighted when Brandon's sister arrives in the form of the terrific Carey Mulligan, their fraught relationship and her attempt to connect with him managing to pull his life apart and force his self-reflection.There is a lot to be admired about this film, and here is where the problems also begin; it is a film to be admired in its bits and pieces, but not embraced as a whole. When it gets dynamic and dramatically gripping, it is primarily because Fassbender and Mulligan do outstanding work with what they are given; they have a terrific chemistry as siblings who are both disturbed in their own way, and particularly in scenes where a disturbed past is explored, they perform expertly. At no point are we told anything, and in the end it is down to us to consider their potentially unsavoury history. This has two functions: the absolute lack of exposition between characters who already know everything about one another keeps it realistic, and the sense that we never really get to know them properly keeps them devoid of something vital, preventing them from being utterly human, which is of course the point. It must be said, as superb as Mulligan is, she is not given a great deal to do overall, and so it becomes very much Fassbender's film in terms of performance. Once you get around the fact that you see a reasonable amount of his penis in this movie, you can easily see why many eyes were on him at the Oscars last year; Brandon is a difficult, quiet, damaged and complicated man to play, and the fact the majority of our understanding comes only from the actor's expressions and behaviour is impressive; that we actually see a character development and arc in Brandon is testament to Fassbender's talent. As was shown in McQueen's debut, he clearly works well with the man.The film has a stunning score, which is arguably the best thing about it. Sounding like Hans Zimmer half asleep, its haunting nature captures perfectly the sad tone of disconnection, loneliness, and ultimately the apparently futility of the effort to change the situation.McQueen has a keen understanding of how powerful an image can be, how one tableau can speak a hundred words, and that is very obvious throughout. The whole thing is shot with they eye of a man who is first and foremost an artist, so there is no denying the film's urban beauty. Such is his insistence, however, on getting across the points through visuals and long, protracted scenes in which so much is unsaid, or so much is about the internal, and which sometimes border on overdone, that I found myself often realising I might do just as well to read a memoir of this man, rather than watch it be played out. It looks and feels like a book. In terms of the story unfolding, it does so in quite a stagy way at times, and this highlights an issue McQueen has not really overcome with either film, which is his inability to drive forward with a narrative. His desire to put individual scenes together and create moments is a priority, and so the drive of the film seems laboured. This said, staging of said moments is impressive, much of the film having an almost Kubrick feel of precision, keeping us intentionally somewhat removed from the characters, which, given the subject matter, brings about an obvious comparison to Eyes Wide Shut. This is true for all scenes barring one towards the end, which seems decidedly unrealistic; set against the impressive realism of the rest of the film, this was strange and took me out of it.I consider Shame rather flawed, and can't say I liked it, yet I found it compelling and moving; in this way it is a strange movie to pass a clear verdict on. McQueen is very confident in his transition to film; his work thus far is admirable and does have a power, but in the end Shame equalled, for me, less than the sum of its parts.",Shame
152,Cinnyaste,It's A Shame,3,30 January 2012,"""Shame"" is an arty and pretentious extended perfume commercial abandoning narrative drive for lengthy and 'meaningful' objective shots (many of the back of the actor's heads). The result is ""Shame"" solely illustrates form over substance.Too much is left from this potentially juicy story of a sexually addicted man and the sister who forces him to revisit painful family memories when she crashes, uninvited, back into his life. While Fassbender's sexual exploits are covered from all angles, the whys and wherefores of the sibling's pain are maddeningly left unspoken. There's little caring for Mulligan or Fassbender (whose stab at baring the soul of male angst becomes histrionics). Mulligan's performance is wooden and both are further limited by the lack of something to say.There's nothing new in the admission people use sex as a salve for a damaged soul. ""Shame"" adds an unpalatable gloss to the subject; the appealing portrayal of sexual excitement and heat trivializing the sexually afflicted. The inability to connect is misplaced in the film's execution, not where it belongs - the story of people who can't connect.""Shame"" is a script with an incendiary topic landing in the wrong Director's hands. A far more potent and intriguing evening can be spent at a Sexaholics Anonymous meeting.",Shame
153,Manal1987,Whether you love it or hate it... hats off to McQueen!,8,13 April 2012,"It's official: Steve McQueen (Hunger) is the most artistic director in the movie business nowadays. If you don't know what that means, go ahead and watch one of his movies. McQueen is capable of stripping any concept, character or event down to its core and present it in its raw state, leaving the viewer with a condensed emotional experience. If you have already seen Hunger, you will understand what I mean; his portrayal of Bobby Sands' final days was anything but political. It was truly impartial and universal.Before watching Shame, I read a number of reviews accusing McQueen of pointlessness and asking the same question ""What is he trying to say?!"" Well, I don't understand why a movie should try to say anything! A movie, or any other form of artistic expression, is not supposed to teach or preach but simply show in a different way. In Shame, McQueen does not tackle the thorny issue of sexual addiction to dig for solutions or show sympathy, he just presents a purely unadorned human experience and leaves the rest to the viewer whether to sympathize, judge or even criticize. I've described McQueen as an artist because this is what he is. His ability to capture such emotional intensity without giving much information about the characters' past (and even present!) is pure genius. He is like a painter who depicts anonymous people with no attachment to time or place. This is not an easy job for both McQueen, as a director, and his viewers because they will feel obliged to infer meaning from this beautifully painted portrait to be able to explain the heavy emotional power it discharges.Another accusation leveled against McQueen is the heavy sexual content in the movie. Well, to be honest, I can't disagree with that. The movie is laden with too many unnecessarily explicit scenes. However, They are far from being erotic. Actually, some of them helped in showing the emotional turmoil Brandon is going through.Brandon, played by Michael Fassbender, is a sex addict who shuns away his suicidal and emotionally clingy sister (Carey Mulligan) because of a certain childhood traumatic experience they both suffered from, and that was never mentioned in the story line. I saw Fassbender in many movies before, but his role in Shame is by far his best. I guess I've said the same about his role in Hunger. Apparently, McQueen knows how to bring out the best in Fassbender. The fact that his performance in Shame was snubbed by the Academy and didn't even get an Oscar nomination remains a wonder to me! Carey Mulligan also was at her best, there was always something fragile and delicate about her character and she managed to show that perfectly.Typically McQueen, Shame is a love-it-or-hate-it movie. You will either fall in love with it or ruthlessly slash it. In both cases, it's worth it. Hats off to McQueen.",Shame
154,DJRMewzique,Softcore porn...with as many answers...,4,23 December 2011,"Michael Fassbender, the critically acclaimed actor from films like ""X-Men: First Class"" and ""Inglorious Basterds,"" has garnered himself a Golden Globe nomination for his leading role in the film ""Shame."" With much talk of sex and controversy, my curiosity (and obsession with film acting nominees) got me into the cinema to see it.With completely mixed results.Oh, ""Shame"" is filled with sex...so much so, it's verging on the edge of softcore porn (hence the controversy?). But if you were to ask me what it was about? I seriously have no idea.None whatsoever.Fassbender, in a role that does hold sufficient weight, but not certain it is awards-worthy, plays Brandon Sullivan, a man with a good job and a nice apartment and...well...an obvious addiction to sex. When his sister shows up unexpectedly after numerous unanswered phone calls, she seems to disrupt his life on a monumental level. And I have no idea why. Judging by the title of the film, is he ashamed by his sexual appetite? Being a surprisingly hard-bodied, attractive man, I am not sure why this would cause shame...or surprise...especially seeing he has...um...quite a fair amount to offer a woman...and yes, ladies and gents...we see a fair amount of what he has to offer. Is it because he is worried his sister will uncover his ""secret?"" I never really saw the shame in his appetite. So, the next logical question is....did he and his sister share more than ice cream growing up? A question that never gets a clear answer, nor does the whole plot point of his fascination with a random married woman he ever-so-briefly encounters on the New York subway.In a surprising role, Casey Mulligan, the seemingly clean-cut Oscar nominee of last year's ""An Education,"" proves that her nomination was not a fluke. However, even yet another strong performance by this potential star make the film's script any more clear than a bucket of mud.""Shame"" is a film filled with sex of every persuasion and absolutely no answers. Fassbender strips himself in ways most actors would never even think of (I mean, when was the last time you saw a man pee on film in the cinema?) and maybe for his nakedness, both physical and emotional, he caught the attention of some awards committees. But as a film that brings up numerous questions and then fades to the credits without even addressing the ""shame"" in question, this film left me wondering not only what it was trying to say, but if Fassbender's performance is truly deserving of accolades based on the impressive size of his penis.",Shame
155,jimcheva,What's really shocking about this film....,4,3 December 2011,"...is how boring it is. OK. I took with a grain of salt claims of how in-your-face the sex scenes in this film would be, but I was prepared for an intense emotional experience beyond that. Nope. A lot of long, slow, stylish shots of the character letting you know how unhappy he is. A David Lynchish version of ""New York, New York"". Carey Mulligan naked (nope, nothing). Her character being predictably if not terribly intensely unhappy. Some ever so mild tension between brother and sister. A few - and I really do mean a few - actual plot turns (you can't call them twists), the biggest pretty predictable. Some suitably brooding photography. And, oh yeah, sex. Enthusiastic if not terribly compelling sex. Disturbing sex? Maybe if you don't get out much. (And I mean out to movie theaters.) To the degree that there is something engaging here it's the relationship between a wounded brother and sister. But if you really want to see that subject done right, find John Cassavetes' ""Love Streams""; less sex, far more life. Otherwise, if you really want shocking, find Cronenburg's ""Crash"" (watch for Deborah Unger's monologue, done while James Spader is, uh, spooning her).",Shame
156,howardeisman,Excruciating descent into hell,3,6 February 2012,"I would think that this movie might have been aimed at a religious audience as a cautionary tale about sex and sexual addiction. No. Too much nudity and sex. The sex is about as erotic as a documentary about the internal combustion engine. Sure, this is supposed to make a point, however, an endless scene of bad sex is not high on my list of entertainments.Long, long scenes of silence mixed in with pedestrian conversation. In a restaurant scene, considerable time is given to a waiter reciting the menu, the whole menu!. The actor either did a great job of impersonating a bad waiter, or he did a terrible job of impersonating a good waiter. In any case, who cares? This had nothing to do with the story. A lady in front of me was trying to read the time on her wrist watch.Carey Mulligan sings a stylized, long, slow ""New York, New York"" with an endless very tight closeup. It is a good thing for her that she is as attractive as she is, as anyone less attractive would find that such treatment would kill their career. Nothing in this excruciating exercise is witty, nothing is educational, everything is meant to be a sensation that socks you in the face or brings a pang of sympathetic recognition. Some may like that. I don't! Audiences can only take so much of this. In the theater in which I saw this apotheosis of melancholia, the audience began to laugh at scenes meant to convey great distress. It was not that the performances were bad, in fact they were quite good, but since nobody had any empathy for the main character, or even had an iota of interest as to what would become of him, too much realistic angst brings out embarrassed laughter.",Shame
157,theoledoux,Addiction and all the shame,8,31 July 2021,"I'm frankly disappointed in people who didn't find this movie interesting, but I get it. This film is not for everyone. It could be if everyone had an open-mind and knew what they were in for. You're in for a depressing tale of what sex addiction does to Man. But you're also in for a sort of case study on modern day relationships, of the rawest form. So much so that you can immediately relate to a least one aspect of Fassbender's character or his sister. That's the strongest suit of this well directed and amazingly acted tale. It doesn't really have a weak point. I can't say there isn't enough to chew on because that's not the case. I really think this is a must watch for anyone who thinks they're alone in their addiction. Everyone has their vices, it doesn't have to be sex addiction. Alcohol, drugs, exercice, gambling, video games, shopping, EATING; anything can be an addiction. You will identify with this movie, but keep an open-mind and don't expect action. After watching it, digest it.",Shame
158,DubhDoo,McQueen and Fassbender have reunited to deliver a powerful and extraordinary tour de force,9,4 January 2013,"Steve McQueen and Michael Fassbender both started making considerable waves with the release of 'Hunger' in 2008, a film about the 1981 Irish hunger strike, directed by the former and starring the latter. It was a mesmerising and disturbing debut brimming with raw emotion anchored by McQueen's highly impressive direction and a magnetic central performance from Fassbender. After delivering a first feature like that, it would be interesting to see where the two would go next. McQueen decided that for his sophomore film, Fassbender was the only choice for the lead role, and my, what a film have they made.Fassbender plays Brandon; he's a successful and attractive thirty- something employed at an advertising company and living in a beautiful apartment nearby. Unbeknownst to anyone, he has carefully organised his social life to indulge himself in his sexual addiction, however, this is unexpectedly interrupted when his sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan), arrives in his apartment, planning to stay indefinitely.When Michael Fassbender was disgracefully snubbed by the Academy, Steve McQueen wasn't exactly pleased, declaring him to be ""a once-in-a- generation actor."" A big statement, yes, but one I'd agree with wholeheartedly. His performance as Brandon is utterly extraordinary, by turns sharp and volatile, by others subtle and reserved. It is the work of true acting great. In an early scene, we see him seated on a subway train, when a young woman sitting opposite him catches his attention, causing him to flirt with her, using only his eyes; she responds in a similar way, but he continues to gaze at her, making her uncomfortable and forcing her to exit the train. What is brilliant about this is that he summarizes the full depth of his character without saying a word, relying only on his eyes. Carey Mulligan also delivers a great performance as Sissy. She plays against type here, having played more introverted characters in films such as Mark Romanek's excellent 'Never Let Me Go' and portrays Brandon's sister as borderline brash, yet like Fassbender supplies her character with a sense of depth and real human emotion. She gets a number of standout moments, most notably a heated exchange with Brandon and her utterly compelling and powerful delivery of 'New York, New York' in one of the film's finest scenes.It is shot expertly by Sean Bobbitt, giving the film's look a textured and subtle beauty. In numerous scenes, he wonderfully captures the beauty of New York at night and a scene where Brandon goes on a late- night jog with the lens remaining fixed on him, was a great choice, boosting the emotional resonance of the moment. The use of cues from Hans Zimmer's 'Journey to the Line' (which was originally composed for Terrence Malick's marvellous wartime drama 'The Thin Red Line') also helped to increase the film's power, most notably the stunning opening scene. While this is a film about a man with a sex addiction, it is not an erotic work by any means; it depicts its subject matter in an unflinching, unarousing, but most importantly, mature light, that never feels gratuitous or forced. Brandon is not simply portrayed as a despicable man but as a human being grappling with addiction, complete with all the complexities and depth which comes with that. McQueen makes many courageous decisions throughout, going to places most directors wouldn't consider, which pays off dividends and shows that he is a filmmaker not afraid to take risks in the name of his film. Leaving an impactful mark upon me, this is a truly uncompromising, powerful and unforgettable piece of work, anchored by Steve McQueen's audacious and masterful direction and carried by two captivating central performances.",Shame

Every thing is pretty average. The maximum I would rate this movie would be 6/10, 5.5 would be better. and I am disappointed. but you might like it better.

The most emotional moments in the whole film were conveyed through no dialogue, just cinematography and impeccable acting. The problem I have with this film is that to me, it felt a bit messy. I'm sure Steve Mcqueen meant this to a certain extent, as it did show the emotional trauma Brandon went through, but at certain times it felt as though some scenes were cut short, and some lasted longer than they needed to. I did, however, love the long takes throughout all of this. They felt REAL. Like a normal life - running, going on a date, waking up etc. Overall this film will have too little dialogue for some and will bore some people, but if you enjoy a deep psychological teardown of a seemingly perfect life, this is for you.",Shame

The movie then deconstructs this carefully curated persona. The cinematography is masterful. I was confused at first because there is a scene where the sister sings and it's painfully long.

162,avenuesf,"Great film, with some trepidation",8,1 January 2012,"Like most of the other user reviews listed here, I felt that ""Shame"" was one of the best movies I've seen this year. Fassbender gives an incredible performance (and he was just as good in ""Hungry,"" which I feel didn't get enough attention in the U.S.). My one complaint about the film is that I felt the script copped out a little bit... both the main character and his sister had some major issues with intimacy, and alluded to a pretty difficult upbringing several times in the film; but it was only hinted at in a very vague manner. I wanted to know why this man was so seriously alienated from everyone around him, as well as what had caused his sister's emotional problems. As a result, I was left feeling that the characters were drawn kind of one-dimensionally, rather than fleshed out. Living in San Francisco, as in most big cities, I can tell you that I've met many people who think and act similarly to Fassbender's character and have never been able to understand why commitment is so terrifying to them; it would have been great if ""Shame"" had put a few pieces of that puzzle together, rather than giving me the opportunity to just observe it all over again and wonder why.",Shame
163,intern-88,What a Shame: taking sex addiction at face value,6,6 June 2012,"With celebrities ranging from Russell Brand to Tiger Woods claiming to be slaves to their carnal desires, sex addiction has made its way into the public consciousness. However, the validity of the condition is still very much disputed. Indeed, the labelling of promiscuity as a disorder seems like little more than a convenient means for celebrities to distance themselves from their depraved antics. It betrays a highly puritanical impulse to realign us with conservative notions of sexuality.Hunger, Steve McQueen's acclaimed debut about Bobby Sands and the 1981 IRA hunger strikes, approached a very contentious historical event with sober, apolitical portraiture. Yet in the opening scenes of his latest film, Shame, McQueen provides us with a very one-sided view of the sex addiction debate. We are introduced to Brandon (Michael Fassbender), a New York yuppie leading a double life. By day, he is just one of the guys (save the occasional unseemly visit to the men's room), but by night he becomes an uncontrollable fiend, looking for sex wherever he can find it.Brandon's busy schedule of brothel visits, one-night stands and violent sessions of masturbation, is upset by the arrival of his sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan), who, having landed a singing gig in New York City, needs somewhere to stay. She seems to serve as an uncomfortable reminder of their troubled childhood, which is hinted at but never explained. As a result, Brandon rejects her attempts to reconnect with him and casts her out. In this, McQueen attempts to explore the causes of Brandon's errant behaviour, suggesting that a history of family turmoil has left him with little faith in emotional intimacy and forged the basis for his addiction.However, despite McQueen's penchant for naturalism, Brandon's story is far from convincing. Not only does he seem to have an almost supernatural ability to attract beautiful women, but the scenes of violent masturbation and rampant sexual conquest are terribly cartoonish. For instance, during Brandon's final spree, he partakes in a series of stereotypically debauched antics, beginning with lewdly chatting up women in bars, before heading to a gay sex club and rounding off the evening with a threesome in a brothel.If anything, this less-than-sophisticated presentation of the supposed 'realities' of sex addiction leads one to think it isn't about sex at all. All of his encounters seem pleasurable and consensual, if occasionally contractual, and if McQueen intends to underline their innate depravity he certainly doesn't succeed. Brandon's tendencies are admittedly a little self-destructive, but his true struggle seems to lie in his isolation and emotional separation from his family, rather than his sexual appetites.Towards the end of the film, Brandon begins to see a colleague, Marianne (Nicole Beharie), and their first date is perhaps Shame's most important scene, largely because it undermines all that has come before it. As they begin to talk about past relationships, Brandon is led to admit that he doesn't believe in monogamy, or feel comfortable with long-term commitment. Marianne challenges him on it and they debate for the rest of the evening. Breaking from the narrative's overarching agenda, this seems to be the sort of discussion the film should have staged in the first place; one that examines our culture's sexual values without feeling the need to wag fingers.While Shame aspires to paint a vivid picture of a person living through the supposed affliction of sex addiction, the result is a rather unconvincing caricature. Nevertheless, in its failure to depict sex addiction as anything other than a matter of appetite and sensibility, it may well have something important to say.",Shame
164,engelst,Bleak and simplistic,5,30 September 2012,"Online sex and sex addiction can well serve as a background for an urbane relationship movie. But to treat this as revolutionary subject matter borders the ridiculous. Internet porn and addiction are all over the place and have been almost as long as the internet exists. Find me a male city dweller with a computer that hasn't watched porn on his PC. Come on, where HAVE you been hiding for the past ten-fifteen years?!!Now for the qualities of the movie itself. The actors are all top quality. Michael Fassbender delivers a tantalizing performance. But the actor's talents are wasted because the characters are sketchily drawn and lack development.What at first looks like a portrait of a man and his addiction gradually develops into a moral parable. The main reason being that as the story takes momentum, the incongruities heap up. Trigger events seem to leave no trace on the people affected by them. The crudely drawn pictures of people caught in a shallow, cold life full of people monotonously chasing the next kick end up being meaningless.

165,mistarkus,raw but missing something,6,19 December 2011,"An interesting, gloomy, raw mood resonates from an intimate portrayal of an obsessed, addicted personality yet something was missing more so than there being no beginning, middle or end or a lack of story.Well adjusted on the surface, a bit soft-spoken, and rather nice the character is not what may be first conjured up when thinking of one who emits sexual depravity. Within this character's ""normal"" exterior lurks an inner personal darkness manifesting into an uncontrollable intense obsession. The raw, intense illustration of severe angst, confusion and pleasurable agony was interesting to view and nicely portrayed by the makers and especially the actor. The makers wisely focused on the disturbing contortions of the face, especially during sexual encounters, which mesmorizingly transformed handsome calmness and confidence into monstrous mental and moral depravity and destruction. The actor altered his facial expressions so much that we saw him become the monster he truly was. Despite these intense feelings we witness, it was not the most interesting character ever created. The filmmakers' focus on this character's addiction with out regard to other aspects of a personality (except for him being a nice guy on the surface), which resulted in more of a characterature than a completely encompassing personality. The character was therefore not 100% believable due to lacking layers. There was another important aspect that was not believable and should have been more developed for this type of film. The sexual encounters seemed a little forced (contrived) and should have been more thought out and better developed which would have resulted in a more interesting movie.Despite the gloomy, dark mood and intimate portrait it still felt as though something was missing.",Shame
166,Jona1988,Amazing performances on an interesting subject!,8,25 January 2012,"There are many films about addicts but this one however is of a different kind. And it really succeeds in delivering a both shocking and interesting experience unlike any I have seen previously. A film like this wouldn't succeed without a great actor. One might know how terrible an addiction can be but if it weren't for the person representing it the real shock and message wouldn't have reached the point. Michael Fassbender once again shows that he is a star on the rise. There are many great things about this movie but it is really he who carries this to such greatness. He is absolutely brilliant in creating this seemingly secure, handsome, successful guy that somehow appears kind of uncomfortable cause deep underneath he has major problems. One really feels for him in the scenes were he often without much word but with emotions expresses his pain. In my opinion he deserves more that the praise he has already received, he should have got an academy award nomination. Carey Mulligan is also very good as the fragile, care seeking sister. Director Steve McQueen has done a brilliant job in crafting this amazingly gripping experience. I have not yet seen his previous movie but I sure will now. At first when I saw the running time I felt like that seems pretty lazy but it's not. It is perfectly considered because even gripping stories can get overdrawn. The scenes were more graphical than I had expected but unlike some I don't think it's too much but rather necessary to really make you get what this is about. The sometimes long scenes focusing on maybe just one thing for some time and choice of music create the exactly right feel for this. Someone might feel that the movie doesn't go into the character development a lot which is true because this is not what this is about. Shame focuses on a problem, portraying the life of a sex addict. It doesn't tell a plot in the common way but gives an experience that it's somewhat left to the viewer to interpret. And it works, not often do I want to see a movie of this kind again. Movies like this you usually see one time, a gripping movie but not twice.Shame is a brilliant movie. Shocking and touching, disturbing and interesting. Delivered by great directing and a standout performance by Michael Fassbender.",Shame
167,TheMovieSnob247,An excellent film. Probably the best about addiction since Requiem for a Dream.,9,17 June 2012,"Shame is a film about addiction. This is uncompromising in that it doesn't pull any changes, it shows the raw sadness, helplessness and shame of addiction. I loved the first 15 minutes of the film, as right away the director sets the tone for what's to come with a really solid opening. It was powerful and had an excellent score throughout (as does the rest of the film). It seems almost impossible for New York to feel lonely, but Steve McQueen portrays this brilliantly. As Brandon leads this empty, lonely life, the city seems to mirror him in every way, great directing. Brandon is sex a addict of the worst kind. It consumes his life in every respect. Intimacy doesn't appeal to him on any level. He spends his every waking moment thinking of sex. So much so in an early scene you see him simply undress a woman on the subway (even after seeing that she is married). He knows that he's sick, but he just can't help himself, the addiction is just really hard for him to overcome and he leads an empty life. When his troubled sister (Mulligan) visits and seeks some sort of emotional support from him, he's incapable of showing her any. On a night when she is really suffering and is literally begging him to help, he ignores her and goes out in the night looking for sex just about any way he can. His cold and uncaring approach to his sister leads her to make a horrible decision. The sheer shame of this forces Brandon to realize with how far he's fallen in a scene that is one of the best I saw last year, hands down.Later you see Brandon on the same subway, caught in a gaze with the same woman he stared at so intently before. Except now you can see the struggle in his face, how hard he's trying to fight the urge to pursue her. It really is a heart breaking scene from Fassbender. You don't really know what happens, but maybe McQueen just wants you to remember the character's struggle and it's a fitting scene to underscore the film.This isn't for everyone. There are explicit scenes and it's fairly disturbing, but I don't know how you make a good movie about sex addiction without that; so it's not to the film's detriment. Excellent performances from both Fassbender and Mulligan. Fassbender's Brandon is desperate, repulsive and eventually sympathetic; he has some very compelling scenes and the nominations he was getting for the role were warranted. However I was disappointed this film was more or less ignored during awards season. I think this is an important film to see and is highly recommended.www.themoviesnob.ca@the_movie_snob",Shame
168,CinePendejo,Melancholy but expertly made,9,2 April 2016,"One thing that makes Steve McQueen a rarity in the drama genre is quite simply how much he ""gets it."" Considering his movie that, despite depicting unrestrained, brutal occurrences within our lives, McQueen is talented enough to have it executed in a way that relates to us without plummeting down to exploitation territory. Movies like 12 YEARS A SLAVE, HUNGER, and this film SHAME shows that he stylizes in providing breathing room for callously tormented characters, so then we feel even more paralyzed once the aforementioned explicit scenes comes into play. This film, SHAME, is pretty much the best example of this; a drama depicting two mentally unstable yet relatable siblings coping with the absent of their fixations and showing just how severe it can get. I wish I would lie and say it doesn't astonish me in the slightest, but the movie is simply too great to take for granted. The movie centers Michael Fassbender as a man who possesses a huge sexual fixation only quenched by banging hot chicks, watching dubious amount of porn in his computer, you get the idea. Basically Quagmire. However his life gets intruded by his sister (Carey Mulligan) who needs a place to stay after having an emotional breakdown with her relatives. Without spoiling much, drama escalates rather flowingly until one day they both call it quits in a fit of rage and figuratively ramming themselves into a dead end. Outside of some various impressive directing skills and a slew of great performances, the best thing about this film is how tangible it all seems. We all can relate to these people in a certain way, from Fassbender's sex drive constantly being imposed by someone who needs his help, to Mulligans desperate torment being exacerbated by his deranged brother who just needs space. None of these are broadly bad people, just distressed to their inevitable breaking point. Fassbender in particular might seem to be the most despicable one, but in a way that is also the point; his whole arc of driving his own sister out of his way for pleasure only to have a huge set of reality literally beat him to the ground is not only a proof of tangibility, but also a catalyst of life's biggest moral. Sometimes what we're desperate to get can only serves little in the long term, and sometimes our pursuit can hamper or even destroy the ones we care about. The cast, what little they are, is phenomenal. I have never seen Mulligan engulf in such a tough role since ever, and Fassbender seems too perfect to play the suave but subtly unstable womanizer. Credit is due for Steve McQueen to allow their acting chops to flourish as well as his impeccable directing styles, the palpable brother-sister chemistry between the two leads, and unmerciful jabs at subject matter that apparently, after 12 YEARS OF SLAVE, was never at his peak. However if there is a weak element, it is how the aforementioned explicit scenes were drawn out. Not that they don't serve a purpose or that it was executed poorly, just that it felt a few seconds too long. Overall this film is sick, melancholy, and heartbreaking, but it is also expertly made, smartly woven, and extremely exceptional. Definitely worth a watch. RATING: 9/10",Shame
169,dixxjamm,"It bored people because it is reality, Why let the truth get in the way of a good lie, huh?",10,4 February 2013,"From the first 5 minutes I knew that the movie would be uncomfortable, disturbing and fantastic. And that's because I'm a 39 year-old man that had a fairly common life. Which is exactly why me and a lot of blokes like me would be lying if we didn't admit that this Brandon character is actually US. Yes, that over-the-top man is more typical that we would maybe like to admit. The reason why most of us avoid the extent of the character's ultimate downfall is because we get lucky, we find other things to worry/and be obsessed about or that we simply grow up. But to say that this is not an incredibly well spotted and presented universal character that ANY man would find himself in more or less would be a lie. I have rarely been so touched and intrigued by a movie character, by the honesty and complexity of the depiction. Must see.",Shame

This thing is nothing but mediocre soft core.I'm not certain there should even be a distinction any more. This is pornographic. I--love--good porn. There is nothing wrong with it. But it comes without pretense. Shame is just garbage that wants us to think it's ""important."" It's not. According to the actors the director was going to invite them all to his home for a nude party before filming began to loosen everyone up. Doesn't anyone have any self-respect any more or will they do anything for cash? Fassbender and the rest agreed to have soft core sex while being filmed for M-O-N-E-Y. We used to call this any number of things including being a prostitute. This nastiness covers it all: We are treated to various shots of his penis. Urination. We do miss any ""money shot"" but I wouldn't be surprised if there was one that ended on the floor. (It is clear that in the sex scenes he was not wearing a sock, so the women apparently agreed to playing with his gonads as part of the deal. I hope they got extra pay) He's a sex nut. He has sex with his sister. He looks for it everywhere. He watches it. He masturbates. He has difficulty having an erection and so who gives a fat rat's behind? This character could fall out that window after the sodomy scene and it would be fine.I am sick, sick, sick of actors and directors being rewarded for cranking this garbage out. And then people talking about how daring it all is and how fearless they all were and how terribly important it all is. It's mediocre porn. You can get the really good professional deal at thousands of web sites for free.In another era these actors performing this dirty stuff would be black balled. Now we reward them for gratuitous filth and invite them to meet Ellen. Then when interviewed they all talk about how professional they all were as they got banged. Aren't they always?

171,thegodfathersaga,a desert of Brandon's own making,7,20 April 2012,"Shame demonstrates a few days in the life of Brandon, a company executive living in a desert of his own making, an aridity carefully maintained and meticulously planned. living alone in his apartment, Brandon's secret is deliberate scarcity of human relationships and a life that revolves around sex, no matter the facet he chooses, he is gravitated towards it. which helps him reward himself a few moments of self-forgetfulness instead of soaking in self-disgust and shame.probably more aware of his power as a director, McQueen has continued to enrich his work with a very important detail: describing characters in all their dimensions; and in doing so, McQueen strips his main character completely naked and let the audience in on his most personal times and secret habits, but never into his thoughts. McQueen wants the viewer very involved, he breaks the narrative in order to let us control the viewing experience, he alludes to a society in which human relationships are mere artifices of normality.unfortunately, as the film gets close to the end, it increasingly exhausts its main character through the relentless hunt and discomfort to a point where it's extremely difficult for Michael Fassbender to act anymore. i suppose McQueen could've made a better effort in helping Fassbender break down his character and then rebuild it in the final part of the film",Shame
172,Johnboy1221,Incredible Film,8,23 June 2012,"After watching Hunger and Shame, I am more and more convinced that Michael Fassbender and Steve McQueen two of the most talented men is show business.Both men seem to get overlooked at awards time here in the U.S., and that's a shame.Shame does not disclose enough information about the brother and sister relationship to get a complete idea of what has gone on in their lives before they are reunited, but instead lets the viewer fill in the pieces. What happens when you do that is that you get a mix of ideas, and perhaps that's what McQueen was after.Of one thing there is no doubt....brother and sister are messed up mentally and emotionally....and the end result is tragic and sad. Watching a human train wreck is very difficult to do, and I felt somewhat relieved to find that I could manage to get through it.Shame is no feel-good movie, so be forewarned, but the performances of the two leads make this one well-worth the watch.If Shame does nothing else, it makes me wonder what theme Steve McQueen will hit us with next, and that's a positive statement on my part. In other words, I'm looking forward to his next film.Once again (after losing the bid for Hunger), Michael Fassbender will probably not get nominated for an Oscar, which is a big mistake. He's every bit as exceptional here as he was in Hunger, and I'm looking forward to his next film.",Shame
173,rajah524-3,Personal Experience may Determine Your Point of View,7,1 December 2011,"If I was looking at ""Shame"" from across a river that separated it from my own Alfie-gone-Carnal-Knowledge life experience, I expect I'd be a lot more tossed, wrenched, wound, or enthused. McQueen did his homework: He knows the cycle of abuse, and that's pretty much what we're watching here. He understands that the addict has to use again to manage his withdrawal symptoms. He understands that sex is no different from booze or coke or peanut butter pies in the eyes of a particular beholder. He even (appears to) understand that sex is really a matter of tolerance to several drugs (dopamine, testosterone, progesterone, adrenaline, oxytocin and more) for which no commerce is required. And there's probably some emperor-missing-his-toga stuff going on here, along with an urge to warn the world about his own discoveries and anxieties thereabout. ""If =I= have them, what about the rest of you?"" And he's surely right; how many guys do you know who'd give up an arm or a leg (some time in the future) to knock 'em over like Brandon here? But I'm not looking at this from across the river; I'm looking at it from 40 years of previously untreated experience. And =no= one I know would have figured me for a Michael Cain or a Jack Nicholson, save for a few of the more enlightened victims and the wise men and women mentioned further down. Watching Fassbinder was like looking at a security video of a hipper, 75th and 2nd Ave. rendition of my life until a few years ago. And I'm pretty sure I'm far from being the only guy on this side of the stream. But because I am where I am about it now, I can look at ""Shame"" as what it is: A little too heavy-handed, duplicitously moralistic, wordlessly preachy, shot from inside the paradigm, and probably plenty useful for those who are still living inside, as well. It looked to me like McQueen was about to get it here and there were it not for the common cult-ure's dichotomous, schizophrenogenic, crazy-making values about sex and romance, that Brandon (and all the rest of us) would have been unlikely to be so obsessed about the stuff. But there was so much money to be made from =both= of the polarities, wasn't there? A little Vegas here; a little Nashville there. Flip back and forth from the mid-300s to the 500s on DirecTV any evening. There's no crazy-making behavioral conditioning going on there. No. None at all. I'd have been stuck in the muck of mystery for another 40 years if I hadn't run into Anne Wilson Schaef, Pia Mellody, Ed Khantsian, Phil Shaffer, Pat Carnes, Dennis Donovan and Alan Marlat. But meeting Jules Henry, Ron Laing, Greg Bateson, Don Jackson, et al well after they'd expired was the clincher. And here's the deal on ""Shame"" for the Cognoscenti reading Clinical Psychiatry News: It looks to me like McQueen knows the first group, but probably not the second. Sex addiction is like all other addictions. It's a game, and it's a business. There are game pieces and game players. It produces immense profits for those who know the rules. (Start with ""variable schedule of reinforcement,"" ""polarizing reality,"" and the combined role of the nucleus accumbens and the ventral tegmentum.) Get past all the purposely confusing, socializing, normalizing =ideas= about sex and romance (including the many in this film), and one can De-Shame sufficiently to get re-balanced and neither be fearful of, nor obsessed with, sex. (The problem is almost always in the words we take for reality. Hey! They're only words.) Most people, however, will only see this film from one side of the moral river or the other. The cult-ure is set up like that, but =real= -- rather than =reel= -- life is actually not.",Shame
174,Zulfmanauthor,Why 'Shame' is so significant!,8,23 August 2015,"'Shame' is a highly provocative and controversial film, which focuses on a man's addiction of sex and pornography. It is difficult to watch, at times I thought about turning it off due to explicit scenes of sex and nudity. However the film goes much deeper than what is on the surface,it is based on a troubled man who is no longer able to control his addiction which has totally consumed him. Michael Fassbender is excellent in the lead role, perhaps his best performance to date. Carey Mulligan also deserves much of the credit, playing the character's sister who arrives unexpectedly causing further turmoil in his world. This film is explicit and it's vulgarity is not included for the sake of cheap thrills or to cause controversy but is intended to take the viewer into the filthy mind of Fassbender. The main theme of the film needs to be understood as it remains hidden behind many of the scenes, it focuses on many of the underlying issues men have and their overall perception of women in society. 'Shame' is not based on the turmoil of one man, it is based on how women have become an object of sex especially in the West where adultery is open and porn has become a way of life. @zulfmanauthor",Shame
175,maatmouse-1,Edgy and yet tantalising,7,25 September 2015,"From the moment where you see Michael Fassbender's wealthy thirty something bachelor lying in bed with his genitals barely covered, you realise what this film is about and where its liable to lead. Steve McQueen's film Shame is an exploration of one man's inability to deal with both his sexual addiction and his feelings about his sister, who turns up in his life like a turbulent whirlwind with her neediness and her own emotional problems. Brandon's life is about work and play mostly in the form of meaningless sexual congress, be it with one prostitute, online with various chatrooms and with two prostitutes. The sex in this film is, at times, quite graphic and borders almost on the pornographic; Fassbender doesn't seem to mind showing off his body whereas many actors couldn't cope with the nudity required of the role. At one point in the film, he is seen using the toilet and that scene is done for real. Carey Mulligan, in this film, shows a glimpse of what could possibly be. She acquits herself very well, playing Brandon's troubled sibling, Cissy, and the relationship between the two of them seems to hover around inappropriate behaviour. At one point, she climbs into bed with him, although nothing sexual occurs between them and another point, the first glimpse we see of Cissy is her nudity in Brandon's bathroom taking a shower. If you're watching this film purely for the nudity and sexual content, then fair enough. There's plenty of that, if it interests you. This is not a film for prudes or people uncomfortable with frequent full frontal nudity or the sight of a man's genitals. Yet the film's strengths are not in its graphic nudity but in its character build up. McQueen is an economical film-maker who allows his characters to tell their story rather than dress the film up with messy circulating camera shots and shaky camera work. Bravo to him! I wish other film makers would follow his lead. His film is also well lit and not too dark or light which makes it easier to watch. He allows his viewers to follow the story. The film is ultimately, a good one. A good film. As a study of one man's slide into a well known addiction, it delivers but it isn't an easy watch, especially right at the end.",Shame
176,markdroulston,"Masterful, yet difficult",9,21 February 2012,"2011 was a hell of a year for Michael Fassbender, a year in which he effortlessly hopped genres and worked with some of the best directors around, building one of the most impressive filmographies of any young actor at this time. Yet the one performance that will be remembered over all others comes from the most low-key film, Steve McQueen's SHAME. As grim and uncomfortable as the film gets, it is simply impossible to turn away from Fassbender's devastating performance as sex addict Brandon, and his omission from the Academy Award nominations, although perhaps not surprising given Hollywood's trepidation regarding anything overly sexual, is far and away the greatest crime this awards season.Following up on his previous film HUNGER (also starring Fassbender), writer/director McQueen delivers an even more harrowing and haunting film with his sophomore effort. SHAME is a portrait of the vicious routine of addiction, and Fassbender strips himself completely bare, both literally and emotionally, following the arrival of Brandon's sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan). Although only briefly alluded to, clearly Brandon and Sissy come from a nightmarish background of abuse, and each sibling has developed crippling emotional problems as a result. Where Brandon is totally emotionally isolated, unable to connect on anything other than a purely physical level, Sissy craves closeness and love from her brother which he cannot give. Their relationship is unsurprisingly strained; with only the briefest moments of tenderness amongst their uneasy and oddly child-like interactions, and the tragedy of their shared experience has left them each dealing with their demons in completely different ways, leading to heart-breaking conflict. Sissy's appearance shatters Brandon's routine, forcing him to see the train- wreck that his life has become, and Fassbender gives everything in service of the role.As excellent as Fassbender and Mulligan are, they are more than complemented by McQueen's beautiful directing style. Coming from a visual arts background, naturally his compositions are flawless, and much like HUNGER, SHAME's minimalist dialogue often comes in the form of long takes, adding a sense of unsettling realism which is occasionally difficult to endure. In very Kubrick-ian style, the director's attention to detail in his locations also adds so much to the tone of the story. Brandon's sparsely furnished and decorated apartment works as a perfect counterpart to his character, revealing nothing on the surface yet filled with hidden clues about his addiction, and as such becomes an extension of his personality, making Sissy's presence all the more unwelcome. McQueen's choices of where to focus his camera are fascinating and, coupled with the suggestive imagery and euphemistic dialogue, subtly convey so much of what he wants to say, resulting in one of the most remarkable films of the year. Those expecting a concrete resolution will perhaps walk away disappointed, but for audiences with a high threshold for unpleasantness, SHAME is an absolute must-see.tinribs27.wordpress.com",Shame
177,raimund-berger,Empty vessel.,4,15 September 2012,"Spoilers ahead.We're following Brandon, an Irishman living and working in NYC, who's suffering from an obsession with casual sex while living an otherwise isolated and dull life. Of course, crisis is lingering below the horizon and materializes when his sister moves in. She catches him masturbating (no joke), which prompts him to make a halfhearted attempt at changing his life. Why? We'll never know, but are presumably expected to guess that he felt some ""shame"" at that point. He's still throwing her out though, to which his sister, who's having a couple of never explained issues of her own, responds with a suicide attempt. Brandon luckily saves her, but does this incident change anything in their lives? Again, no answer - open ending, case closed.Point is, this is a typical ""all style and little substance"" film. Mixing fairly explicit and extensive sex scenes with long subway ride montages and tracking shots through nightly NY streets, accompanied by either an overly dramatic music score or Bach piano music, depending on which it is. Do we learn anything about how Brandon arrived where he is though? No. Does he ever talk about what's going on with him? No. In fact, the minimalistic dialog we're presented with barely supports those few moments of rather formulaic human interaction the film has to offer.At the same time is NYC reduced to a gloomy and depressing place where everybody's just being concerned with themselves. And those few characters we meet - mostly colleagues - aren't really any better than Brandon. To the point actually of the entire film not showing us a single healthy relationship. Why this one sided view, one might wonder. Possible answers: the film wants to portrait Brandon as just another facet of a similarly messed up environment. Or it wants to portray Brandon against a kaput background so that we can still sympathize with him. Your pick.In the end there's really just a string of shots accompanied by music. Impressions, if you will, loosely glued together by a storyline thin enough to fall apart once you're looking at it. Why this movie was made? No clue. Maybe a showcase for the 50 funny faces Fassbender can make?Still 4 points though. For all that it's lacking the movie's style admittedly is effective. If it just led somewhere.",Shame
178,dillylamar,Shame,7,27 April 2020,"Steve McQueen's delivers a realistic and vivid film about sex addiction, anger, self loathing, fear, loneliness, and the meaning or lack of meaning of relationships. Shame's premise is not depicted in film very often, which makes it a very unique effort as well. Micheal Fassbender's performance as sex addict is brillant, as he gives the audience his character's fear, self hatred, anger, and loneliness in full perspective. Carey Mulligan also gives a stellar performance as a needy, dependent, and affectionate musician. Steve McQueen directs this film in a laid back yet ruthless way, as Shame pits into darkness and trauma with somewhat of an elegance, while still maintaing a manic aesthetic. Narratively, Shame can get breifly lost at points, but Overall, McQueen's film is a honest and realistic depiction, with one great performance, and a good one as well.

That said, I can't say I enjoyed the film. This is a character study, so the plot takes a back seat. While there is nothing really wrong with that, it means that a particularly interesting character needs to fill the vacuum to keep things interesting. Brandon, while interesting, is not really unique enough to do that. He's reserved, angry, not particulary likeable, and we don't truly get to see what started him down the path he is currently on. So while there are poignant moments, this exploration of a man's shame didn't feel very relevatory.

181,jackharding89-1,Requiem for a pervert...,8,9 April 2012,"A film about a sex addict in NYC sounds like a banal Rom-com starring some A-list heartthrob like Ashton Kutcher or Gerard Butler. Well, Steve Mcqueen's Shame couldn't be further from that stomach-churning premise. The Brit director's sombre morality-play about a sex pest in the city is a bleak and intriguing affair; an unflinching character study about a detached introvert that'll bore many, immerse few. Make no mistake about it, this is one for the independent and art-house purists who appreciate fine film-making and damn good acting. Shame tells of Brandon, (Michael Fassbender) a self-consumed sex addict whose perverse private life reaches a crossroads when his idle sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) shows up on his doorstep and begins to meddle and annoy.In spite of his success, charm and rugged good looks, Brandon is a hard (no pun intended) and isolated man incapable of forging a meaningful relationship with somebody, anybody. The fact Shame is set in Manhattan is far from coincidental; it underscores Brandon's anonymity and loneliness as a person. This is sex and sex addiction like you've never seen on screen before; complex, sobering, shameful and destructive. Sexual healing can go fudge itself.Once again, the intense and immense Michael Fassbender is highly-convincing inside a very.....difficult role that requires a great deal of patience and restraint and balls for that matter; strolling around on screen with them out, taking a slash and performing an array of explicit sexual scenes can't be easy but where there's method, there's Fassbender. The ever- impressing thesp' does his director proud; going the distance for Mcqueen once more and bagging himself an Oscar nod in the process.Carey Mulligan is also superb as the suicidal Sissy. Outgoing, dramatic, needy, she's the complete opposite of her big brother but his saviour nonetheless. Her erratic and, at times, spellbinding performance is by far the best of her career thus far.Then there's Mcqueen; the gifted and fearless director of Hunger whose approach to film making is as bold and as beautiful and as it is challenging and technical. The man loves his prolonged stationary shots and employs them to lingering effect throughout, allowing Fassbender and Mulligan to ad-lib and feel their way through scenes in pursuit of total realism. Mcqueen also opts for what can only be described as a majestic tracking shot in one scene where Brandon flees Sissy's company in the way of a metaphorical run. In only his second feature, Mcqueen achieves a balance between the two main adjectives all directors and authors care about; ""unique"" and ""brilliant"". Here, he has a freehold on both of them; the sheer thought and attention to detail behind each and every shot is remarkable. From the potent close-ups of Brandon pressed against a grimy train window to moody, single takes of him doing his business.Shame is by no means the first film to look at sex addiction in modern cinema. Chuck Palahniuk's novel Choke was adapted into a droll and enjoyable indie satire some 4 years back but it's hard to compare the two. They differ in both genre and approach; Shame being the unprotected half of the two in its honest depiction of two siblings bound by pain and torment. Its climax is a telling and unforgettable one; abrupt, daring and open- hopeless in the eyes of some, uplifting in the eyes of many. Mcqueen and Fassbender's last tango in Manhattan may not be as powerful as their first collaboration, but it certainly doesn't fail to stir or impress. In a word; shameless.",Shame
182,supernma,Superb in every way,9,17 January 2012,"""Shame"" is a film not about what the characters say, but what they do. Steve McQueen deftly directs Michael Fassbender in the best performance of 2011, creating a tapestry of heartless sex and violent emotional power - a film to be analyzed and talked about.The sex scenes are raw and cold, aiming to disturb rather than arouse. What is perhaps most interesting about how McQueen handles the material is that a total lack of eroticism is replaced by sadness and pain; one particular scene featuring a three-way orgy between Fassbender's character, Brandon, almost brought me to tears. If I were to describe the sexually driven scenes in one word, it would be ""pathetic."" Of course, these moments wouldn't be anywhere as impactful without Michael Fassbender's intense and real performance.His performance ranges from the most subtle, under-the-surface acting to all out explosive and gut-wrenching emotional displays. The sheer bravery of this actor astonishes me. The film features unabashed full frontal nudity (even close ups) in both sexual and non-sexual contexts, and one can imagine the dedication and trust a performer such as Fassbender must have to put his or herself in front the camera in such a vulnerable and unflinching manor.While the film is about sexual addiction and the toll it takes on those who suffer from it, it is also about the broken, and often juvenile relationship between a brother and sister. Carey Mulligan delivers an equally complex and striking performance as Brandon's sister, Sissy, who desperately seeks to connect with her troubled kin. While Fassbender often withholds and swallows his emotions (with the occasional angry outburst), Mulligan plays a free-spirited and energetic personality, punctuated by inner suffering and need for attention; essentially, the two are exact opposites, and the scenes they share together are impossible to look away from.McQueen, as with ""Hunger"", exercises one of my favorite filmmaking techniques: the extended take. Many scenes in the film are done with less than three cuts, forcing the viewer to watch the story unfold in seemingly real time. The music is also a highlight, adding an emotional crescendo to the film and performances, and in fact carrying the first ten minutes of the film. The cinematography is also gorgeous, balancing cold whites with warm golden atmosphere.It's easy for me to call ""Shame"" one of the best films of the year, but it is certainly the most complicated and layered film of 2011, one I will probably watch many times. It's unfortunate that it has been stigmatized by its NC-17 rating, and therefore greatly limited to only a handful of theaters across the nation. Let me make this clear: there is nothing in this film grotesque or in bad taste or done for shock value - it is simply the truth of its subject matter brought to vivid life.",Shame
183,roger-pettit1,An excellent film with stunningly good performances from its leading actors,10,10 July 2012,"I knew next to nothing about ""Shame"" before I watched it earlier today. I am rather glad that that was the case. Had I read any reviews of it or seen any details about it beforehand, I fear I might not have been keen to view it (given its subject matter). And what a pity that would have been - because ""Shame"" is a brilliant film, and just about the best recent release that I have seen for a very long time. Despite its nihilistic bleakness, it is an engrossing, thoughtful and intelligent movie.Brandon (Michael Fassbender) is a young single man in his 30s. He seems, on the surface, to have an enviable life. He lives in a smart Manhattan apartment. He works in an office (exactly what job he does is not spelt out) and earns enough to go in the evenings to expensive singles bars, high quality restaurants and what seem to be 5-star hotels. He does not have to think twice about taking taxis from A to B. And he can afford the services of a high-class prostitute. However, Brandon's life is not, in fact, as comfortable or secure as those outward trappings might suggest. He lives alone. He is addicted to passionless sex and to pornography. He finds it necessary to make eye contact with attractive women when commuting on the New York subway. And he has few, if any, real friends. Basically, Brandon is a deeply unhappy man. Out of the blue, his sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) turns up and asks if she can stay with him for a few days. Brandon agrees. And, as a result, his life goes from bad to worse. Sissy, who is a cabaret singer, is the exact opposite of Brandon: she is an uninhibited extrovert. She embarrasses her brother in two ways. First, she has an affair with his boss David (James Badge Dale, an actor whom I have not come across before), who is married with children. Also, her presence in Brandon's apartment cramps his style somewhat. It makes it much more difficult for him to view pornography on his computer (which he does habitually), to have one-night stands there (again, something he does frequently) and to arrange for the services of a prostitute (another habit of his). Brandon, whose longest relationship to date lasted only four months, is essentially a sex addict. His life is empty. He never smiles. He is cold and unfeeling. And, although he perhaps does not realise it, he hates himself. ""Shame"" icily depicts the vacuum in Brandon's life and, in doing so, throws a spotlight on the shallowness of modern urban existence in much of the affluent western world. The acting, direction and screenplay are quite simply excellent. Both Fassbender and Mulligan are superb. Indeed, Fassbender's performance is surely worthy of an Oscar. The soundtrack, which is varied, is also a plus point. It makes excellent use of Glenn Gould's recordings of keyboard music by Bach, for instance. Yes, there are a lot of sex scenes, many of them graphic. But all are germane to the plot and to the depiction of Brandon's flawed personality. ""Shame"" is film-making at its very best. 10/10.",Shame
184,cartman_1337,Poignant but boring,3,22 October 2013,"This movie has received a lot of praise for its depiction of the secret life of a sex addict. And yes, the movie does raise some good points about the way the world is moving, and many will probably also recognize its theme of leading a secret life of porn addiction and ""shame"". Many will recognize its theme of the feeling of having your life invaded when a family situation forces you to set your own life aside to help out, and the frustration entailed. Many will recognize its theme of a feeling of meaninglessness and hopelessness, considering suicide as a way out. The themes of the movie are poignant, timely and meaningful. Unfortunately, the execution leaves a LOT to be desired.The opening scene sets the standard. A full minute (I think) of Brandon (Fassbender) lying in bed with the same expression on his face the whole time. Sure, you understand he's not happy; you could see that after 5 seconds, the next 55 didn't really say any more or less about it. And that's a recurring problem in the movie; a lot of the scenes are drawn out far beyond the point of having expressed its message. Set to the most boring piano-only classical music imaginable it just becomes frustratingly dull, to a point where the boredom of the music and overlong scenes becomes what you reluctantly focus on in the movie, rather than the story. It doesn't help the movie that it has overlong, almost pointless scenes like Carey Mulligan's performance of ""New York, New York"", which - bar none - is the worst ever public performance of that song (I can't speak for personal shower performances and such, with the performer as the only witness), not to mention the longest. Sure, as far as story goes the scene is important in showing Brandon's emotions and Sissy's secret ""talent"", but it could have been done a lot better.Then there's the so called ""shock"" aspect of the movie; its explicit sex and nudity scenes. I seriously don't get the fuzz. Maybe it's because I'm Norwegian. Seriously; every Norwegian movie released these days, even movies meant for young teenagers, show just as explicit nudity and sex as this movie. OK, I'm exaggerating, but less than you might think. And for a movie about a sex addict, there were really disappointingly few of these scenes as well, and the few there were, were short and disappointing.At the end of the day, the only one that should feel ashamed about this movie is the director. The story is good. The performances are good. The execution is terrible.

185,woinaroschy_1979,Fantastic acting from Michael Fassbender in a painfully realistic movie,7,28 November 2012,"After seeing this movie I had to write a review about it just to recognize in some way the phenomenal performance of Michael Fassbender. He plays the role of the sex addict with a complete and utter dedication, and it really takes a lot of courage and self-esteem to play such a part. The last 30 minutes of the movie made the most impression on me, the intensity of feeling on his face, the haunted, desperate look of a sex junkie grinding away for his drug, and the pain of realizing how deep he has sunk. Personally I would have liked a little bit more of a plot, some explanations about his past and his sisters past, or a glimpse of the future, but I can understand also that this is not what the movie is about. The movie is a moment in time of someone's life...which makes it unbearably realistic and I think that is why I, as many of the audience, feel this need of having more data, of knowing why and how, of hoping that everything will turn out fine in the end. Conclusion: Good, unbearably realistic movie with fantastic acting from Michael Fasbender.",Shame
186,Waerdnotte,"Dark, Uncomfortable, and Emotionally Empty.",6,2 February 2012,"McQueen goes to places other creators of film rarely go, and it's difficult to compare him to any other director past or present. Maybe his closest comparison is Tom Ford, the fashion designer, whose film A Single Man reflects a similar nihilistic sexuality of its protagonist. both have an artist's eye for the possibilities of film, but whereas Ford focuses on beauty, McQueen takes us into the grimy uncomfortable world of isolation and self-loathing.Shame relies on what you see on screen, and the dialogue is sparse and remote. The character of Brandon is dull and inarticulate, his sister Sissy is a train wreck, his boss Fischer is an egotist. Their neurosis, and troubled relationships are played out on the screen but as we discover, Brandon does not connect. He has sex. McQueen offers a thin narrative in which the slight story unfolds and it is through his cinematic compositions, Sean Bobbit's clean digital cinematography and Harry Escott' excellent score that we follow Brandon from successful clean cut executive to self-destructive sociopath.Unfortunately, Mcqueen's focus on the achingly dull lifestyle of Brandon, his lack of social skills, and faltering relationships does not make a great film. It might look good, but it doesn't feel good, and maybe Mcqueen needs to inject some humour and irony into his work. Give it some kind of subtext. As cinema moves into the 21st century, it is still the story that matters, and as beautiful as Mcqueen's work looks he still doesn't have the cinematic language of David Lynch or Martin Scorcese.However, the possibility of McQueen and Fassbender being the 21st century equivalent of Scorcese and De Niro might offer the prospect of greater work to come.",Shame
187,dario_malic,Shame,10,1 October 2012,"""Shame"", a new film by British director and screenwriter Steve McQueen tells the story of a troubled young man struggling with himself in a big city. Brandon is in his mid-thirties. He has a boring but probably pretty safe job in some office, the nature of his work not being relevant. He's a lonely guy. The only two persons in his life are his sister, who comes from out of town with no place to stay and is as troubled as he is, and his wife-cheating boss, who gets drunk and sleeps with his sister. Brandon is a sex addict. He spends every available moment masturbating or having sex with whomever he can. The problem is he doesn't enjoy it. It's a pain and torture to him, almost as if he's punishing himself for something.As you can see it's a very simple plot and the movie avoids any kind of exaggeration in depicting it. It's deemed controversial because of its many sex scenes and some probably consider it vulgar and excessive because of that, but the sex is necessary to tell the story and the movie is one of the most realistic that I've ever seen. What director concentrates on are the thoughts and emotions of the characters (mostly Brandon and his sister Sissy) and that's what carries the movie and keeps you involved. McQueen has done a great job both directing and writing this movie. He has provided the actors with an opportunity to display all their skill and they've done it masterfully. Both Michael Fassbender as Brandon and Carey Mulligan as Sissy gave fantastic performances, with their faces as the main tool for expressing all the sadness, fear, anger and loneliness of their characters. That can especially be seen when Sissy sings a melancholy version of ""New York, New York"" or when Brandon has sex with two women near the end of the movie (this scene even gives a feeling of horror). The other few actors that are appearing in the movie do a good job, but the emphasis is on Mulligan's and especially Fassbender's performance.Beside the work done by McQueen, Fassbender and Mulligan, there are two more important elements which make the film as good as it is. Sean Bobbitt's cinematography makes a fantastic job showing us loneliness and despair of the main characters through every frame, and Harry Escott's music evokes the sadness and melancholy which make us feel their pain and empathize with them. I should also point out the scenes of sex which are greatly filmed and yet lack the ability to arouse. Instead, they just deepen the prevailing feeling of hopelessness.Whoever talks about this movie points out Brandon as a sex addict. I'm not sure what would be a definition of a sex addict but I think there's something else we should focus out attention to here. At one point Brandon goes on a date with his colleague Marianne. A proper first date with walking, dinner, talk about relationships and a promise of a second one. It's the only time we see Brandon genuinely having fun. I think he's even happy and looking forward to the second date. But when it comes, all is ruined. Brandon can't have sex with Marianne. He can't get his penis hard which causes him to break and he lets her go. Here is revealed his inability to establish a normal relationship. Is it a consequence of his sex addiction or maybe a cause of it we don't know, but it's the most tragic thing about him.The title ""Shame"" is ambiguous, showing us all the complexity of the movie within itself. There is disgrace in Brandon's way of life, embarrassment he feels about it, and pity we feel for him. But there is even more to it. Because it's not just about Brandon. It's about all of us, trying to escape from our troubles in all the wrong ways and losing ourselves in the process, which seems to happen more often as time goes by. And that really is a shame.More reviews at http://onlineimpressions.blogspot.com/",Shame

189,synevy,Mesmerizing,9,13 February 2012,"'Shame' happens to be one of the best films i've watched this year. I've seen 'Hunger' and I like Steve McQueen's perspective. I find it original, artistic, daring, different. I've also followed most of Michael Fassbender's filmography. He is a brilliant actor. In this case he's McQueen's muse (Abi Morgan's as well). 'Shame' seems to have been made just for him.Brandon is a character that fits pretty well on Fassbender's acting abilities. He's an accomplished business man, living in a modern apartment in New York, enjoying the respect and company of his colleagues but has a secret addiction. Sex. Whenever an action becomes an addiction, destruction is the next step. That's where Sissy, his sister, appears. Besides the disruption of his 'normal' life she brings up some more issues that make both of their lives even more uncomfortable. Carey Mulligan is absolutely great in this supporting role and has revealed an also beautiful voice talent, which you might have already realized from the official trailer.The story moves smooth, unveiling the character's traits and flaws and also makes some nice setback play towards the end, in a dramatical way. Paying you, really, off in the end! There was all this fuss about nudity and sexual intercourse that never in this film became disturbing. Not at all. It depicted the life of the protagonist but never stamped him. You get to see the edgy point of addiction and you can put it beside any other kind of addiction there is. The dialogs are small and every-day-life awkward, smart, witty, surprisingly brave and strong. Once again, Steve McQueen manages to show emotions and pass it to the audience. The nods, the looks, body language, you just know. No need to explain.Even though it's a UK funded movie, it was filmed in New York, after a wonderful scene/location selection. From the modern apartment, with the industrial view, to the streets and nightlife of the city. You get the chance to live there for a while. Besides Frank Sinatra's 'New York, New York' song, Harry Escott composed some beautiful pieces for this film, while various artists appear in the musical background like Blondie, Chet Baker and Howlin' Wolf.I'd suggest it to every adult mind.",Shame
190,denizov,A very badly made film on a serious contemporary subject,3,2 January 2014,"Sex addiction is a serious subject that can be made into a very powerful drama. But the people who created this film evidently did not have the talent, the intelligence and the sensitivity to be able to fulfill the task. What a pity! I almost lost the patience to watch it to the end . To summarize: it was not worth watching and I really have the feeling that I had wasted my time. The tempo is too slow, the characters are shallow and undeveloped, their acts and deeds are not motivated at all, there are almost no dialogs, so you are left guessing why something happens. The words that the characters pronounce ( when they bother to speak at all) are almost unintelligible and I wonder why. Only the word ' f**king"" was present more than enough, being repeated dozens of times. Instead, you have a profusion of nudity and sex, most of which is simply unnecessary. I was very disappointed by this film and I do not recommend it .",Shame

A patron of internet porn, I was startled to find that I was completely disinterested in the sexual content. Familiarity breeds contempt. This movie is about sibling love. About two damaged souls that really need each other to survive. It is really quite elemental. Like Lost In Translation is. Everybody is brilliant. The girl on the subway.... will forever torture me. The magnificence of this film is the twice told story of the girl on the subway. This was the best film I have seen in many years.Incredible. Some siblings are not rivalrous. Some share a common experience. I hope my kid sister knows how much I love her.",Shame
192,Jaymay,"If you don't get this movie, consider yourself lucky",9,13 October 2012,"On the radio show Loveline, the sex and addiction therapist Dr. Drew Pinsky once said that childhood trauma literally changes the brain chemistry of its victim forever: it creates a kind of psychic scar, and the victim, without intense therapy, will replay the trauma in his or her life again and again and again, to the destruction of everything that is good and healthy in their life.Brandon Sullivan is a sex addict. Addiction can be a tedious and joyless affair. And it's no surprise that many people who see this movie come away feeling angry and cheated, especially if they were expecting some kind of lurid, sexy roller-coaster.If you don't understand the simple tragic power of this story, count yourself lucky. You have never suffered from addiction, never had anyone close to you suffer that way. Sex addiction, like all addiction, has its roots in childhood trauma. Those who can't read between the lines of this movie, again, should I suppose count themselves fortunate. But I'm happy to explicate (spoilers ahead).Brandon's sister says ""We're not bad people. We come from a bad place."" Brandon also mentions that he lived in Ireland as a child, then grew up in New Jersey. If you don't think that the backdrop of this story is about two children who grew up suffering sexual abuse in the Catholic Church then you're simply not paying attention.If you don't realize that Brandon and his sister had a confused and incestuous past as a coping mechanism for the abuse they suffered, you're not paying attention.People accuse this movie of being a series of sex scenes, one the same as the next. That's ludicrous. Every single sex scene in this movie serves a unique purpose. For example, when Brandon interacts with a woman from work who is actually his intellectual and emotional equal - a woman with whom he could actually have an authentic relationship, he can't get it up. He can't exist in a sexual relationship where he could conceivably be vulnerable.His sister isn't a sex addict - but she is a love addict. And yes, those do exist. They are people who play out intense emotional relationships - they fall into one doomed love affair after another - because they crave the chemical serotonin rush of falling in love the way sex addicts crave orgasm. This is why Brandon is so angry to have his sister around - not only does she, in her addiction, crave an unhealthy emotional connection - she is also his sister, a person truly worthy of his authentic love. It angers Brandon that these two things are hopelessly intertwined. His sister's love for him is both authentically pure and deeply unhealthy.New York City is undeniably a character in its own right in this movie. The city that never sleeps - the city where someone like Brandon can always find an unhealthy outlet for his pain. The power of Shame is in what it doesn't say. And what is left unsaid goes far beyond Brandon's back story - it goes to the character of the city where he lives, and the country that calls New York its greatest city. On the surface, a beautiful, glamorous life. But that beautiful facade is built on a long history of unspoken atrocities that define it and foretell its destiny.",Shame
193,zken,"See this film now-if you want to support great cinema and the best performance of 2011,",9,28 January 2012,"OK, this film is difficult to watch. In a time where the grossest and most disturbing behaviors are celebrated, even worshiped by an audience addicted to voyeurism, it might be hard to believe that there is still the possibly of truly shocking an audience. The problem with sex in films, is, it just is not fun to watch, and, it isn't even erotic. To me, what is truly erotic in movies is the idea of sex, or more accurately love, that is so much a matter of luck, timing and other factors, we won't go into. For example, I will always remember the love scene in ""Woman in the Dunes"". Now in this case, there is a rather horrible man who has lots of sex and no love, warmth or friendship. And he is so self destructive and one dimensional, that you kind of wonder why he hasn't figured out that it would be best to change his ""hobby"". Well I won't reveal the truth of this, but suffice it to say, you won't find this very real and disturbing tale uplifting or even that interesting. But, when it gives Michael Fassbender the platform to deliver the acting performance of the year, it is all worth it. There just has not been anything like this powerful a performance in a very very long time. And it is tragic that so few people will see this, and feel such a break through moment, both for the man, and for an art form that is often just fearful of this kind of naked truth (no pun intended!). If you are really a film person, you live for this. Not since Taxi Driver has there been this kind of moment. I just hope Michael can keep it up and find the vehicles for this kind of incredible, intense, and completely satisfying work out. I am in awe. And you should be to.",Shame

195,TinyDanseur27,Shame is intense insight into an all-consuming issue; Michael Fassbender is phenomenal!,9,27 June 2013,"Shame is about a sex-addict and his sister, starring Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan. After having seen the new Jane Eyre, Inglourious Bastards, and A Dangerous Method, I was excited to see more of Michael Fassbender. He's an actor who a couple years ago I couldn't have named one movie I'd seen him in, but who has recently blown me away with his amazing courage and versatility. Shame proved to be another great example of just how marvelous Fassbender is.This movie peeks into the life of Brandon, a successful New York businessman who, while seemingly normal on the outside, is severely addicted to sex in private. His younger sister Sissy comes to stay with him which disrupts his life and causes friction between the two of them. Where this movie lacks in a narrative plot, it makes up for in the intense insight into this all-consuming issue and how it destroys not only Brandon, but his relationships with his sister, friends and potential partners.Both Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan gave superb performances. I really felt sucked into the downward spiral that was their lives. What really amazed me about the movie though was just how fearless they must have been to shoot a movie of this nature. Needless-to-say there was a lot of sex and nudity. Just the thought that behind each one of those scenes is a director, cameramen and hundreds of crew, really made an impression on me. I can't imagine getting up in front of a crowd and doing what those actors did. It was tastefully done in my opinion, but I'll just say that there wasn't much left up to the imagination.Regardless, I would recommend this movie to those of age (and who don't mind watching downers). It really was thought-provoking.",Shame
196,Forgotten_Conscience_Productions,Shame Review: Just how much Shame should you feel?,7,6 June 2013,"People have a lot of ideas about what's right and wrong. There are just some things you shouldn't do, or talk about, or acknowledge as part of people's lives. Even those things which people know everyone is doing anyway. Of course this tends to vary between people, depending on their upbringing and personal history. It also differs between men and women generally. What's right for some people isn't always right for other people. But you'd be hard pressed to find someone who didn't agree that they had something they didn't talk about. You might not be able to get them to admit what those things are, but the fact that they won't tells you something anyway.One of the most common things people have trouble talking about though, is sex. Recent years have changed a lot of the conventions about sex, but there are still a lot of hang-ups that people have. These ideas even exist in the porn industry. You may be able to see just about anything you could want on the internet these days, however if you take a good enough look you'll notice that certain people don't do certain things. In an industry based upon satisfying the urges and desires of a population no matter what it might be, there is a sense of respectability based on what you do and what you won't. Doing one of these ""wrong things"" is at the heart of the film ""Shame"".Starring Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan, they explore the concept of shame from the perspective of a man who doesn't appear to have any. Fassbender plays Brandon, a man with a good job, a decent social life, and no real problems with women. At least that's the way it appears on the surface. Upon deeper analysis, very much explored in the film, we see that his life might be financially and socially fulfilled, he clearly has a hole in his life that just isn't being filled. Despite everything that he has and his ability to pick up chicks, Brandon can't make a lasting emotional connection to his family, friends or any of the women he gets involved with, to the point that it's almost psychologically damaging to his ability to perform.Enter Sissy played by Carey Mulligan, his sister and a woman equally looking for connection that she can't seem to find. Where Brandon has taken to an emotionally distant approach to people, preferring to keep them at a distance, Sissy appears to have taken the opposite view of dealing with her problems. She throws herself completely into a relationship, emotionally and physically, leaving her devastated when it inevitably falls apart. A tragic reality that seems to leave no way out.There are people in this world who actually live this way, going from relationship to relationship searching for meaning in someone other than themselves. Or in some cases even avoiding relationships all together and looking for meaning beyond simple relationships. They even get portrayed on film from time to time, often though they end up becoming the quirky and cute character that eventually overcomes it or learns to find it all despite their way of life. Not true of a film like Shame. The director and actors take a more honest and realistic approach to people who live this way and it shows in the way the film plays out.Just how much Shame should you feel? It's unlikely that anyone watching this movie won't feel at least somewhat disturbed by it in some way, but sometimes people need to be reminded of the parts of life we don't tend to talk about that much. And this movie will definitely do that.For more of my reviews, check them out here:http://andrew-heard.blogspot.ca/",Shame

I like the way he is able to exhibit and transmit real behavior in this film because it's very hard to do it in the way he does it. He does it using long-takes to the absolute limit because there is one scene here when it looks like he just drops the camera in one place, and he doesn't move it throughout the whole scene, and the scene it's seven minutes long. But it's perfect because has it been shorter he wouldn't have got his point across and it would have been boring if it would have been longer.With what I completely fell in love within this film it's the score. The score utterly manages to convey the sad and melancholic emotional state of the main character. There is something enigmatic but completely alluring about the score that always gets me - it's one of my most favorite scores.I think that Michael Fassbender is one of the most underappreciated actors of the past decade. If he were a black person I am absolutely one-hundred percent sure that Spike Lee would have made a movie of how Fassbender was shamefully snubbed by the Oscars. His performance here is, not to exaggerate, breathtaking. He is naturally compelling. I think that his face has that look when you can tell that it has a lot going on underneath it, making him easily the perfect choice for this character.Shame has one of the best character examinations I've seen, and I think that it is a must-watch film for everyone.",Shame

200,robojames,Bleak Portrait Of Addiction And Trauma,9,27 March 2021,"Text: This film really is a stunning and brutal window into the life of a man who has become his own worst enemy, living a life and indulging an addiction to sex and pornography that drains all joy out his existence. He's unable to achieve real intimacy and closeness with women, including his own sister, and spirals into a robotic routine of compulsive self-indulence and risk.Shame is shot in a way that makes a voyeur of the viewer. There are long takes that feel like naturally captured chunks of reality, people wandering in front of the camera, scenes that show the protagonist through windows or silently reeling in his own internal torture.As it goes on you are asked to question how he ended up this way, what kind of abusive or dysfunctional childhood he experienced to wire his mind in such a destructive manner, and so forth. He can't connect with lovers, dates, or even with his own flesh and blood, his sister, perhaps because she reminds him of a time he'd rather forget or scares him with the thought of genuine closeness to another human being.This isn't for everyone, but it's well-made and inspires feelings of deep empathy for others in that you wouldn't want anyone to go through this kind of horrible life. A great film in that it makes you ask questions about what makes us the way we are and how trauma is inflicted and transmitted. Great performances all round, too, especially from Michael Fassbender, who gives his all. Highly recommended if you have a tolerance or taste for disturbing and challenging subject matter.",Shame
201,kos-27,Trapped in a circle,10,17 May 2012,"ShameNow and then I get overwhelmed by a movie although I don't relate to its subject. One example is the movie Billy Elliot , another is Shame. The movie Shame is a drama about a brother and sister who came from a broken home where something bad happened when they were children. We don't exactly know what - whether it was abuse or incest - but it had a destructive impact on their emotional and social development. As a result of their damaged personalities the brother became a sexual addict incapable of any emotional relationship (not even with his sister ) and the sister became dependent for love and self destructive (suicidal). The movie tells us the story slowly: We discover what is going on bit by bit. We are shown scenes from the brother's daily routine accompanied by a beautiful score rather than heavy dialog. The movie brilliantly mirrors the mood and the emotional state by powerful acting from both, Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan. The facial expressions, especially the eyes of Mr. Fassbender, say more than thousand words. He plays a difficult role (how do you know how to play a sexual addict?) and yet he is capable to give a fascinating performance without being sexually more explicit than necessary, even managing to seem tender, vulnerable and desperate.The director succeeded in choosing the right visual sequences significant for capturing the essence of a sexual addictive behavior: The giving in to the uncontrollable urge alternating with remorse and self punishment. There's a reminiscent deep despair overshadowing even the slightest pleasant moment. I's a masterfully delicate movie, a tightrope walk, never vulgar, never common or stereotype.The movies composition is a circle: It starts off and ends with an encounter on the subway.

203,Edd-N-Furter,"It's not about sex, it's about shame",9,28 March 2012,"Brandon's life is almost perfect: a steady job, a nice apartment, good friends and women adore him. But something prevents Brandon from having a relationship that lasts more than four months, this incapacity is due to the fact that Brandon is a sex addict: to casual encounters with strangers and prostitutes, to pornography (both during and after working hours), to masturbation. And to some extent he seems to have his addiction under control, until her sister Sissy arrives unexpectedly looking for a place to live for a while.British director Steve McQueen delivers a fascinating character study that explores how modern life (in which new technologies play a major role), increasingly isolates people and makes them unable to establish emotional bonds with others. In Brandon's case, a hunter in search of pleasure and not love, the arrival of his sister will turn him into a prey of his own emotions and will make him face his reality.One aspect that has caused controversy is the way so raw and explicit to show Brandon's sexual encounters, however this becomes a necessary element, since it is through them that you can see Brandon's need and desperation as Sissy is more involved in his life. Special mention deserves the dynamics established between them, since it is fully nuanced and can even be uncomfortable to witness but is devastatingly emotional (especially in the last minutes of the story).However, the most important element for the success of the film lies in the performances: in the hands of less committed actors Brandon and Sissy's conflicts would be unconvincing, but McQueen wisely chooses Michael Fassbender (both had previously worked together on Hunger), who literally bares body and soul to take Brandon's emotions to the limit and does it so impressively in a brave and courageous performance (and unfortunately the Academy possibly considered too intense for consideration in their nominations). Meanwhile Carey Mulligan proves to be one of the young actresses with the best prospects and acting range nowadays: her rendition of the classic song New York, New York is an utter delight as well is one of the best scenes in the film.Shame, in the end (as in most character studies) does not seek to create empathy for the characters, but rather wants us to reflect and ask ourselves how we would react in similar situations.",Shame

Finally if I was an evil spirit, I would say that Shame is only one of these movies furthermore aimed at these nice and clean nerds who know absolutely nothing of the life.",Shame
207,SteveJ_888,Very Weak Film ...,2,1 August 2012,"You might like this movie if you typically like tedious, painful to watch, humorless movies without a single likable character.The film main character is a conflicted porn addict who is miserable because he can't have real relationships. He tries and fails. He is cruel to his sister, who is also an emotional wreck. We never find out how they got this way. At least the filmmakers spared us from that.Nothing really happens. The guy starts out miserable and remains miserable. No transformation – no insights – nothing. There is occasionally a glimmer of something good, such as an intriguing shift of the time line, or a slow observational shot outside the films usual perspective which is somewhat interesting visually. These shots fail though because there is little action to begin with – so no need for contrast. It's an opportunity for the viewer to reflect, but there's nothing to reflect upon except a series of events that document the guy's misery.To make matters much worse the film just flat-out stinks – across the board. The music is terrible. The movie is one erratic, badly lit, washed-out shot after another. The viewer doesn't need to suffer through 90 min. of this mirroring of the guys inner life – an occasional effect would do. Well, maybe the good camera was broken. Most of the costumes look like they were bought at a yard sale. The editing and pace of the film are amateurish. It would work better if reduced to a 20 min. short.The filmmakers do manage to accomplish one impressive feat – an amazing deception. Deprived of a timepiece, you will swear that this film is twice it's actual length. The last 15 minutes seem like an hour.The movie was filmed with the support of the New York State Governor's Office for Motion Picture and Television Development. I'm adding that to my ""beware"" list, one level above ""Official Cannes Selection.""",Shame

No seriously, it was so over-the-top it was like watching a porno movie, with some really cool music.I will say, the film itself is really well done. Such as, the lighting, editing, camera angles, etc. However, the substance was quite grotesque and overtly disturbing.One's rebuttal could be, ""well that's the life he lives"" Yes, I agree, but why so graphic? It was like the director/writer, was trying to be too provocative and was trying way too hard. Get that guy a gatorade and towel, bc he was really trying his best to be ""edgy.""

210,joesiegel,Depression and sex,9,8 February 2020,"The story of a sex addict man seeking satisfaction on the streets of NY can be good material for a romantic comedy, however Steve McQueen wrote a dark, deep and depressing story about sexual addictions of a man whose sexual desire is stronger than to live, leaving aside comedy and romance.After all, nymphomania is a serious mental disorder, the character of Brandon takes it to another level, he no longer gets pleasure in sex, now it depends on him, how a cocaine addict depends on cocaine, the film represents his addiction like the addiction of a drug addict or an alcoholic, it is not good for him and is killing him little by little.We can completely rule out an incestuous story with her sister, since she is only the trigger for his crisis by breaking into his private life and is probably the only person who can understand him, he may also suffer the same illness as his brother, but linked with a terrible depression. One of the strengths of the film is the photograph of the film that represents the frivolous world that Brandon lives, and the way in which the film has an incredible shortage of dialogues, as I have said before, it seems to me that movies that tell a story without spelling them seem to me to be above conventional narrative movies.This film did not win a single Oscar, although Fassbender and Mulligan deserved it more than anyone that year, but this is not the type of movies that win Oscars, not because they are bad, quite the opposite, they are too much cinema to winning an Oscar, Steve McQueen returned a year later with 12 Years a Slave which is also a great movie (9/10 for 12 Years a Slave), but is at the opposite pole of Shame; It's a movie made to win Oscars. Hopefully Steve McQueen returns to make movies for lovers of a more intelligent and deep cinema and not for the academy.",Shame
211,adam_pittavino,Dangerous!,10,6 August 2019,"Michael Fassbender has proven himself to be one of hollywoods most versatile actors, starring on movies such as Prometheus, 12 Years a Slave and Inglourious Basterds. Fassbender, unlike many of todays stars , has given off the aura of an enigma, and his immersive performance as a sex addict is 2011's Shame is the role he will be defined by. Shame by my admission is no easy watch, Fassbender's brutal, confronting act is as raw as youll ever see him. He is completely drained of any human affection or sympathy, his persona at times resembling a droll infant unaware of his social surroundings. His frightening fall into a slave like compulsion is completey convincing, he will have sex with anyone, anywhere and under any circumstance. Where has it all gone wrong for Shame's leading man? Its difficuilt to answer that question. Brandon is young, handsome, charasmatic, in good shape and seemingly successful. All of his redeeming qualities are hindered not only by his addiction, but by the unexpected arrival of his younger sister played by Carey Mulligan. She drinks all his orange juice, catches him in lewd acts and annoys Brandon relentlessly. Just like her brother, she is emotionally damaged, delicate and unaware of her surroundings, but unlike her brother she at least makes an attempt to find the path to a better future. Shame is a vicious and harsh film shown through the eyes of one character, the grim, complex study of sex addiction and the self inflicted torture that follows. Director Steve McQueen has captured a moody yet sterile flavour that sticks long after the film has ended. Shame makes you feel dirty, helpless and puts the viewer in an erotic bubble that many find impossible to get out of.",Shame
212,abhisheksaha-619,Micheal Fassbender at his best in this urban tale about life,10,6 June 2012,"After watching the film only one word came to my mind - ""Masterpiece"". This movie left me spellbound with it's real & stark images. Now Steve McQueen is definitely on the list of my favorite directors. He gave life to this story which many other directors would've failed to do. In this film, Micheal Fassbender is at his best. His portrayal of Brandon Sullivan is very down to earth & you'll be able to relate yourself to his character. The moment he listens to his sister Sissy's (Mulligan) song at the hotel & tears came down from his eyes, that was the most touching moment.Now, the sexual scenes might appear quite vulgar to many people, but I think those scenes were needed to portray Brandon's sex addiction & deep down all of us want the same thing as Brandon did. Some of us show it but others hide it beneath our heart. Carey Mulligan is fabulous as Sissy. She desperately tried to help his brother who was going through an emotional crisis but Brandon never cooperated.I haven't seen a brilliant & realistic movie like this since ""Requiem for a dream"". The images shown in the film depicts our needs, it's related to our basic instincts, but most of the times we're incapable of accepting it just like Brandon.So I'm rating this film - 10/10",Shame
213,arsalankazemian,"We're not bad people, we just come from a bad place",8,25 April 2013,"""Shame"" tells the story of a young man, Brandon, whose active sex life is overturned when his troubled sister, Sissy, arrives at his home to stay for a while.It is interesting that Brandon (played by Michael Fassbender) starts to question his current way of life by an apparently simple incident -- a sad song sung by his sister (played by Carey Mulligan) at a night club. He also becomes aware of his own situation by his clear contrasts with his sister. While Sissy is the type who easily enters a relationship, Brandon finds it both absurd and unnecessary to enter a committed relationship. But after all, Brandon and Sissy are as much alike as they're different. Brandon reproaches Sissy for having a relationship with a married man, while Brandon himself would gladly have sex with a married woman only if he had not missed her in the crowded underground passageway.Brandon's doubts about his sex life take him to extremes on both sides. While he finds impossible to get intimate with the girl who likes him, his doubts take him to an odyssey in New York which involves visiting a gay club and indulging in a rough threesome.A positive point of the film is that it does not try to answer all the questions it asks at the end of the film. We definitely see a positive change in Brandon -- mostly in the love he ultimately finds for his sister and signals of change in his sex life -- but everyone can have their own prediction about what course Brandon will take from now on.",Shame

Yesterday night I had experienced the film out of curiosity. It teaches me thousand of lessons to keep me away from such terrible life practice.The film showed Brandon, a handsome thirty-something advertising executive living and working in New York. He has cultivated his private sex life and keep involved into practicing a secret sexual addiction. I am not disclosing the story here.

215,BrendanMichaels,"""We're not bad people. We just come from a bad place.""",10,11 September 2016,"I'm surprised that no one ever says that 2011 is one of the best years in film history. We got films like Drive, The Tree of Life, Beginners, We Need To Talk About Kevin, Bernie, and of course Steve McQueen's magnum opus, Shame. After being impressed with his Oscar Winning film, 12 Years A Slave, I was extremely excited to see his other films. More specifically this one. After this I am on board the Steve McQueen train for as long as it's in function.For years I've been convinced that Michael Fassbender is the next Marlon Brando and never has a film until Shame proved to me why I find that to be true. The way Fassbender lets himself be one with his character truly fascinates me. Not many actors would truly expose themselves like Fassbender does in this film. His character Brandon is a mess of a man. He lets sex drive him in every part of his life. But he can't escape it. He's in too deep. How is it even possible for Carey Mulligan to be in 2 masterpieces in one year?! While I love Carey in Drive I think Shame has her best performance not only of that year, but of all time. She's fragile, but strong. She's the glue to Brandon's messed up life and she won't go away because she knows as his sister that's her duty. Such a forceful and heart wrenching performance.McQueen as a director is truly a visionary. If I were to describe how great his directing is we'd be here for days. The camera is not a separate object in this world but a connection for us to feel these characters. We feel their movements, their sexual desires, their disconnection of the outside world, and their inner sadness. We let the movie control us like Brandon's desires control him.I know a 9/10 seems low for how much I am praising this film but that will probably change once I rewatch it. If you have yet to watch Shame do yourself a favor and get on it quick. A great contender for one of the best films of the decade.",Shame

217,sowvendra,"Steve McQueen's ""Shame"" is a devastating masterpiece",10,28 September 2016,"Steve McQueen's ""Shame"" is a depressing mix of loneliness and sex. Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan play, respectively, Brandon and Sissy, a pair of siblings. Both are successful in their own way. Brandon is a successful executive who lives in New York City in a luxurious apartment with glass walls, has a huge LG television placed right on the floor next to his bed, and listens to Bach. Yet, he does not have friends outside his work circle, brings home and visits prostitutes, has random casual sex with any woman who is interested, is addicted to internet porn, and, on one occasion, when he is unable to seduce a woman at a bar and is roughed up by her boyfriend, he, just in one night, first walks into a gay bar, shares a passionate kiss with a man and then makes that man fellate him, and then walks over to two prostitutes and has a threesome with them. However, his acts of sex aren't for enjoyment. He is such an insomniac - or so lonely - that he gets up even before his alarm goes off. He masturbates even after he has just had sex. And, while he is penetrating a woman or being fellated by a man, you can't see even an ounce of pleasure on his face. He is in pain, frustrated, and angry. And accompanying those sex scenes is a hauntingly morbid background score that underlines Brandon's loneliness. While he is engaged in an act that should be pleasurable, you feel sorry for him. On one occasion, when he dates a colleague and brings her home, the colleague is prepared to have sex but Brandon is unable to do it. Is he commitment-phobic? Does he deliberately wish to remain alone? ""Shame"" puts forward these questions in a very stylish and subtle manner. And those face close-ups of Brandon and the sad background score reminded me of two other stylish films on the theme of loneliness and relationships: Wong Kar-wai's ""In The Mood For Love"" and ""2046"". Sissy, on the other hand, is not like Brandon. She is a successful singer who has gigs at posh venues all over the US, but Sissy doesn't have a permanent place to stay. ""Shame"", through Sissy's loneliness - or her choice to remain unattached - also seems to ask questions about what is permanent? Sissy is supposed to be averse to having possessions of any kind except what she really needs. Despite being successful, she does not own a car, does not know how to drive one, and prefers to take a bus or a taxi. However, unlike Brandon, she wants to connect➖to anyone who would care for her. She is heard pleading to her boyfriend on the phone that she would leave everything if he just accepts her. The boyfriend doesn't relent. Before her show in New York City, Sissy calls up Brandon a number of times to inform him of her arrival, but Brandon lets all her calls go to the voice mail and ignores her completely. When she finally turns up, apparently unannounced, he calls her a burden, a hindrance in his apparently well-laid out life. Sissy just wants to be held, to find a root somewhere. The scene where both brother-sister are sitting on a couch, watching some black and white cartoon on the TV, and they have just had this argument - Brandon calling Sissy a burden, while Sissy reasoning that they are, after all, brother and sister and have no one else in their lives except one another and that they need to look after one another - Sissy tells Brandon she wants to be hugged, and Brandon, after some thought, holds her close to his body, comforting her. This entire scene has been shot from the back of both the actors. The cartoon on the TV can be seen, but not the expressions on the face of both the actors. All the drama, all the pain, all the garbled chemistry between this brother-sister duo is realised through the voices of the actors alone. And this is one brilliant scene! In another interesting scene, as dusk falls, Brandon watches a posh, well-lit, multi-storeyed, glass-fronted building where, on one floor, a man is taking a woman from the behind, the couple pressed against the huge glass window; on another floor, a lone suited man - perhaps as lonely as Brandon - is walking to and fro aimlessly; while, on another floor, a man - perhaps wary of the world outside and trying to feel secure in his glass house - is drawing the curtains➖scenes from a modern, urban life. Finally, after a tragedy, Brandon accepts Sissy as his only family. Michael Fassbender is awesome. He cries, he curses, he is broken down completely. Same with Carey Mulligan. Though I will always remember this cute British girl as Kitty Bennet from Joe Wright's film, ""Pride & Prejudice"", Mulligan, in ""Shame"", is more in the mould of her character of Lynn Barber in the film ""An Education"": cute, yet, intense. Also, Mulligan's chemistry with older actors is magical. Remember her chemistry with Peter Sarsgaard in ""An Education""! Steve McQueen is some kind of genius. Both ""12 Years A Slave"" and ""Shame"" are about bondage, but of different types. While ""12 Years A Slave"" was about a freed slave being pushed into slavery again and taking twelve years to get the authorities to free him again, ""Shame"" is about being tied up by our circumstances in the contemporary era when all of us are supposed to be free and independent. ""Shame"" is highly disturbing, but it is also highly touching. Hats off to everyone involved in the making of ""Shame""!",Shame
218,ursulahemard,no 'no-shame' but rather clinical depression,6,24 February 2012,"I went to see the notorious 'Shame' and... was not shocked at all, not as all the hyper media excitedly predicted. The title SHAME is a clever marketing trick to lure all the voyeurs in us into the cinema, for the protagonist has no 'no shame' but is clinically depressed, which is ultimately a medical illness. It's about a guy, who ought to see the doc, swallow a few pills to balance his hormones out and look for therapy.It is an interesting movie, very nicely filmed and engagingly acted, and to see Michael Fassbender walking around naked was rather titillating. He's a very good looking and appetizing 30 something lad, but I could do without watching him pee. Even though visually very explicit, there is no violence, rape, vulgarity, ephebophilia, pedophilia, SM, fetish, etc. It's just about a guy who is shagging, without any kinkiness, the ones who go for it without any emotional attachment and dispatches the Ladies in question right after. If he gets personally involved, he can't perform, so he goes back to mechanical, random, anonymous, sometimes even paid, sex again. A very lonely guy who either picks up women or watches porn in his spare-time (whilst being successful in his job!). Carey Mulligan's talent is completely wasted here with the exception of her singing performance...that was very touching and engaging...Nothing new nor outrageous in this movie and in the 21st century, we all know, that there are thousands and thousands of men like the protagonist out there....rather sad...now, they ought to film the female version of it...for that exists as well...",Shame

The despair of not be able to be consequent on life is depicted in a great manner. It's like at an alcoholic: you don't want it, but you have to.",Shame
220,AlanJ2,Well directed film which is finally joyless and inauthentic,3,12 December 2011,"Exquisitely directed as it is, 'Shame' finally seems contrived and unreal. Its joyless hero appears to be suffering from a lack of intimacy rather than sex addiction but then, judging by their public comments, the makers seem a bit confused as to what sex addiction really is. Here it seems to be just a form of depression and 'Shame' is indeed yet another aesthetically beautiful celebration of depression like Von Trier's 'Melancolia'. You could call these films Designer Depression, because they look and sound so exquisite but to such little effect. Yes the cast are all great but that's not enough when it adds nothing whatsoever to our understanding of the subject. Indeed it is as if the writer and director have no more clue about the predicament of its central character than he did, finally abandoning him in a limbo of their own creation. And at times the story is just plain preposterous as when our heterosexually obsessed hero (played beautifully by Fassbender) suddenly and ludicrously goes for a gay quickie in a Dante's inferno sequence so overblown as to be laughable. But then for all its wonderful surface in a way the whole film is laughable. Is this because McQueen is yet to graduate from visual artist to narrative film-maker? Perhaps but we could forgo some of the glitter any day for a better script and story.",Shame
221,nnenok,Wanted: resolution.,6,26 May 2012,"After hearing several positive reviews of this movie, I decided to see it myself and I ended up being extremely biased towards it. The movie is good for someone who never felt like Brendon or Sissy, because it offers a trip into their head and shows the pain they're struggling with. However, for someone who is going through something similar they are, this movie brings frustration. After seeing their problems exposed on the big screen, the viewer would want at least some consolidation, at least some suggestion on how to deal with them. But this movie doesn't resolve anything, doesn't offer any solutions. Maybe this wasn't even the point of the movie. But I was expecting the type of film like Shortbus for example - if it has to include such a huge amount of rawness and sexuality, it's usually used at least to make a point. But here it doesn't, which makes me think that Steve McQueen just wanted to make a movie with a lot of sex and erotica, that would still pass as indie and ""artsie"".But apart from the (lack of) story, the actors are brilliant and the camera is great. I especially liked the long, uncut scenes using only one shot because they really showed tension, anxiety, the parts of life that are always skipped in usual Hollywood movies.",Shame
222,Joe_Chadowski,One of those films that changes you after watching it,7,18 January 2012,"Movies that shatter taboos like this does divides film buffs as well as film critics, and I believe how you respond to these films reflect the nature of your film interest.The story is that of Brandon, a well off New York bachelor with a secret sex addiction. An addiction he doesn't mind indulging in every chance he can in the privacy of his lavish apartment. He's content with his life, and it all is shattered when his sister, Cissy, arrives unexpectedly for an indefinite stay. Animosity is immediately sensed, hinting at a dark past shared between the two. The shame of Brandon's addiction shines brighter with the arrival of his sister, increasing tension, until it inevitably climaxes.Some will dismiss Shame as a distasteful exercise in excess, the copious amount of sexuality being over the top, ultimately distracting, and shaking hands with pornography. A valid view I'll admit because the sexual content is explicit and gratuitous, but it's a view that only looks at the surface of an excellent film.I see a future classic in the making, a film tragically enigmatic with its time that will gain respect and notoriety in time. The cinematography is expedient, acting is stellar, and dialouge is given only when necessary. You are absorbed into this film, provided you are in the right frame of mind. It takes the intimacy of the interaction of watching a film and the intensity of the sensations you feel to another level.There are many throwbacks to Stanley Kubrick's methods of directing. One being extended takes of conversation, which is brilliantly complimentary if done correctly. Unfortunately these scenes in the movie are less than captivating and fail to hold your attention. But with a film this calculated, maybe the fault is with me.What will make this film withstand the test of time isn't the controversial material, but what remains when said material is stripped away. This film is actually a fascinating study into the human condition and how addiction can deteriorate a person and cripple they life and loved ones. It's a very thought-provoking metaphor, masked in the most extreme way possible that challenges the viewer to dig past the superficial shock value and find its substance. And if you can, you won't emerge the same person after watching this.",Shame

After his wayward younger sister moves into his apartment, Brandon's world spirals out of control And this is it. The whole storyline of the movie can be summarized in 2 short sentences, and trust me, you cannot add much to the description – and that is probably the biggest shame of the whole film.Michael Fassbender is definitely in demand. Prometheus, Haywire, Dangerous Method, X-men: First Class, Jane Eyre – he featured in so many movies in the past two years and yet he still looks new to the audience, the definite star on the rise. And Shame is probably the most challenging movie of them all; it required a lot of a talent from Fassbender to act as the sex-crazed man convincingly. I have to give a credit to him for that, he managed to do it very well. The scene on the train, where innocent-come-predatory smile of Fassbender unsettles the young woman sitting opposite to him, is very powerful and proves wrong all the critics who claim that Fassbender is massively overrated. He proves once again that he is fantastically capable, charismatic and skillful actor, and I definitely look forward to see him in Dangerous Method and Prometheus. Carey Mulligan made a perfect support for the Fassbender's performance, even though I still find it hard to admire her always on-the-brink-of-crying slightly hysterical face.But even though the cast performed to their best, there is insurmountable problem with the movie – its plot. Absolutely nothing happens in the world inhabited by Brandon Sullivan and his sister, absolutely nothing. It could very well be the way to explain to the viewers the severity of the situation encountered by Brandon, but I personally go to the cinema to see the story, not the lack of it. Some people may and will find the movie as very metaphorical, literally putting you in the Brandon's shoes – this is something in which the film succeeds. But in terms of story-telling, it is failing spectacularly, because it is difficult to tell the story when there is basically nothing to tell. The movie plunges you in the depths of boredom, the only thing you will be thinking about: «When will this finally come to the end?!"" Actually, as it gets closer to the finish, some story unwraps, but it is too late to save the film.So even though Fassbender and Mulligan delivered their finest performances, poor plot fails to keep the attention of the audience and to provoke thoughts other than seeking the nearest exit.VERDICT: Amazing performance by Fassbender, mind-boggling boring plot WATCH: if you want to see Fassbender's star on the rise, or if you generally prefer descriptive rather than story-based movies.m-picturegoer.blogspot.com",Shame

225,MadameGeorge,Addiction in Secret,7,4 August 2012,"If ever there was a missed opportunity for greatness, it is this film. Addiction is covered in so many different ways in so many different films that I have seen, but I cannot remember ever seeing a film about sex addiction, which is so crippling.The film begins with an expedition into the drab, white wall, plain furniture, corporate world of Brandon, played by the talented Fassbender. (Side note- Fassbender should have received an Oscar nod, he is the destructive heart and soul of this film and performs so well, he is simply amazing). Brandon appears to be a man that has it all, sex, money, work and a few buddies that he goes out with. Of course what makes 'Shame' such an interesting film is that McQueen does not want the audience to feel sympathy for Brandon, but feel nothing. The entire point of the film happens behind close doors, this is where the shame lies. Brandon appears completely control of everything around him, but it is in the dark corners, crummy bars and swanky hotels that that we find Brandon always drawn too because for some reason (a reason that is never fully explained only hinted at and therefore very frustrating for the audience) Brandon cannot make a human connection to save his life.The level of depravity showcased in this film is expected for someone who has an addiction to sex. I found that those scenes fully represented the need for sex just as other films represent the need for alcohol or drugs. Sex is nothing to Brandon, it is showcased as something he does and checks off his list. The interaction between his sister, Sissy, played with passion by Mulligan, is perhaps the sickest element of the film. Again, their lives growing up and what happened to them somehow fits into the film but never materializes which would have elevated the film to a different level. It is very difficult to feel empathy for someone's malfunction if you do not know the foundation. But, then again I think that was the point of the film- that sometimes there is no clear cut answer as to why people are the way they are, sometimes there is no excuse to hind behind.This film is not for everyone. I would not recommend it either because it is difficult to watch and even harder to get out of your head after-wards and quite depressing. Brandon is that emotionless, bottomless pit of darkness that only experiences slivers of light. The ending posses the ultimate question : when does what we do in secret destroy us?",Shame
226,nitz_angel,Much ado about nothing,4,23 March 2013,"I never understand why these kinds of movies get praised. The only praise I can give is to Michael for letting his inner bad self go out in a role that you can only describe as porn for the masses. Everything about this movie is random. His job. His sex life. The music in the background. Why he cries when his sister sings. Why he is the way he is. Why it's clear that they are not blood related due to their constant nudity next to each other, and if they are blood related then it's even worse. The scenes go by and nothing is said or done other than flashes of skin, sex, faces, and places. It all inside a big blur of nothingness. I dislike pointless movies that drop us in the middle of the story and never give us any background or context to what we actually see. So at the end of it all its movie about nothing and throw in some full frontal nudity and random sex scene.",Shame

228,socceralex16,"There are reasons to watch this movie, and reasons not to...",5,18 December 2012,"I found myself curious about this movie. Its topic, its lead actors who sport strong resumes, and the direction i knew it took before watching it. But now after seeing it i just don't get it. How is watching a man pee important to the story. How is watching him jog for a few minutes important? Why must Carey Mulligans character sing the entire song New York New York so slowly? For dramatic effect? This isn't art. Its boring scene fillers. What happened here is a plot without enough substance. Even after the interactions, the many but necessary sex scenes there still wasn't enough scenes and they needed to be filled or others scenes extended. It creates unnecessary and painfully dull sequences throughout this movie. And i don't think this movie has an ending. The so called climax was extremely predictable but no real resolution. The problem of the sister disrupting the sex addicts life is not resolved. I don't understand how even the biggest supporters of this movie enjoyed the lack of an ending. They praise the acting, but there has to be more to make a good movie. You can have excellent acting, with things like facial expressions be entire scenes. But in this film these scenes are just dragged out way too much. Many of these reviews may have liked this movie. And the ratings suggest the majority enjoyed it thoroughly. But this is not a movie mass audiences would like. Thats why it wasn't marketed that way, thats why most people never heard of it, and thats why i don't recommend this movie to anyone besides drama critics and artsy movie lovers. Everyone else wont like it at all.",Shame
229,Cinematic_Bullshit,A Perfect Encapsulation of a Sex-addicted Mind,10,27 September 2018,"Shame begins with one of the most beautiful and brilliant scenes I've seen in a film. After watching these few minutes, you learn a lot about our main character, Brandon. You quickly learn he is a man who easily attracts women. As he's riding a train he stares at a woman; she instantly appears interested. She wants him so bad and for a moment it seems he's got her right where he wants her, but suddenly her arousal turns to shame - an emotion Brandon isn't familiar with. He's little more than a lust-filled animal. As this young wife gets herself together, Brandon gets behind her, seemingly ready to pounce on her. When she runs off, he can't understand why. He's an animal who's only path to satisfaction is reaching climax.Later, Brandon becomes annoyed when his sister comes to visit because it conflicts with his sex addicted lifestyle. When he sees his sister hes forced to look at all the women hes had sex with. When he hears her having sex with his boss, a married man, he hears the echoes of the women he's had sex with. This conflict with his sister could be explained by the fact that he can't communicate with a girl outside of sex. Since he can't have sex with his sister, he also lacks the ability communicate with her. He is cold towards his sister. Never showing her affection and at times rejecting her own affection.Brandon's only passion is to get laid. Since such a desperate need to feel euphoric is indicative of something missing in life, we're left to wonder what is missing from his life. In terms of finances, he is very successful. He has no trouble getting women. But as we learn later on, sex becomes difficult task when he forms a connection with a woman - he fails to perform with a coworker, yet easily gets off with a woman immediately after.His sister alludes to a dark past they share, saying ""We're not bad people, we just come from a bad place"". What that bad place is we're left to wonder. But there's obviously some trauma that has made it hard for him to be aroused when he forms a connection.At the end, after his sisters suicide attempt which might be the result of being betrayed by man after man, as well as feeling abandoned by her brother, Brandon may now realize how his addiction can affect others. The next time he sees the woman on the train, who has since dolled herself up, will he chase her or stay seated?",Shame

I have been that excited to see this film since first reading about it, and I was not disappointed. Michael Fassbender was perfection, not nominating him for Best Actor is as big a travesty as not nominating Ryan Gosling for Drive. This film really isn't about much, it's about a brother and sister that are both addicts. He a sex addict, she a cutter. But the plot of the story is never to find their motivations, which I assumed would've been the goal of the director. But their motivations and their pasts aren't important, because addiction doesn't need a definition, it doesn't need a precursor. The movie follows a sex addict, but a sex addict beyond any realm of understanding normal people could comprehend. To do this, I needed to feel his urge. I had to see he wasn't looking to just have sex, the emotion controlled him, and not the other way around. Fassbender shows zero emotion in the movie, but his desire creates so much emotion that I found myself close to tears at some parts. You could see the pain in his eyes after every sexual encounter. He needed it so badly, but ultimately understands he will never be satisfied. Almost like after finishing with one immediately thinking about the next. I cannot describe enough how brilliant, painful, draining, and wonderful this film is. There are a ton of amazing sex scenes, full male frontal is usually so taboo, but if anyone could've pulled it off, it was Fassbender.",Shame

The acting was totally convincing and the theme important and challenging. The repeated reminders of the hypocrisy of our society regarding sex and violence were clever and uncomfortable. I was very disappointed, but not surprised, that this film received no recognition at the awards ceremony. Normally, ""sex, sells"" is written on the heart of all promoters. But not in this case, as it is not at all titillating. A genuinely adult film (not the usual meaning). Fine performances from Michael Fassbinder and Carry Mulligan.",Shame

Is it coincidental that Michael Fassbender's character is name Brandon, so close to the role played my Marlon Brando in ""Tango."" Both characters were living their lives below the waist, and weren't they miserable lives. Shame portrays an attractive man who could be described as a sex addict but that we are given hints about a past that drives him to seek the false pleasure of the orgasm, which has been called 'the little death.' In a marvelous job of acting, Mr. Fassbender displays the emotions and sometimes lack of them that are pitiful to behold. When coming upon a connection with a young woman that could have meaning, he is unable to perform sexually, only able to achieve orgasm when there is no human connection. When his younger sister enters his life after living in LA, he rejects her need for help. She is a train wreck and will be in the way of his need to die with each orgasm. She represents the shame of his past, and Carey Mulligan gives an excellent performance to match Mr. Fassbender's. A thought provoking morality play which is a work of art.",Shame
236,jamfitz001,Bore,4,4 August 2012,"This is one of the most painfully dull and boring movies I've ever seen. There is no plot, it is filled with stereotyped situations and characters that are stock, and the pacing is painful.The film itself uses darkness as a motif that represents the nature of the main character's soul. The constant half-lighting and dim lighting adds to the sensory boredom that you are immersed in.Two particularly drawn-out episodes of stunning dullness stand out among the boring one hour and forty minutes of boredom. First, the scene in which our anti-hero goes to watch his boring sister sing. The Sinatra anthem New York, New York is turned into a slow-paced piano ballad performed by his boring sister. And you are forced to watch it, second by painful second, as the camera boringly cuts back between his boredom and her banal rendition. You have to sit there and watch the whole song, tick by tick. Then, Sis brings Brandon's boss home for a drunken snog, and bored Brandon hearing the moaning coming from his bedroom, overcomes the night of champagne drinking and decides to go jogging. Overlooking the improbability of a drunk person going jogging in the middle of the night, we are then treated to Brandon jogging for six blocks to dull piano music. Six blocks, no cuts, just a dark-lit scene of a guy jogging because his boss is humping his sister in his bed. This means he is alienated. Sigh.There's some gratuitous sex now and then. There is the stock nice-girl from the office who the alienated guy can't relate to. There is the troubled sister who cuts herself and has no direction. There is the pussy-hungry boss.There is the stranger on the train scene, at the beginning and at the end. Signifying a trip to nowhere.This movie is not worth watching.",Shame
237,rehams,Shame - a story of human despair and flight,9,12 January 2013,"Shame is a movie about sex addiction or so it would seem. I feel like the people giving this film poor reviews are not able to look past the main character's actions - or rather - they're not able to emphasize with Michael Fassbenders role, the lonely, sad man on a constant quest to numb his mind and forget his past.Much has been said at the explicit sex scenes. They're not really worse or better than many European films, but may shock the American audience more used to seeing graphic and indulgent violence than nudity. The sex scenes are needed to tell the story like the graphic depictions of drug abuse in Trainspotting.Addiction is too often dealt with on the basis of its subject whether drugs or in this case sex. But behind the addiction is almost always emotional trauma, from which the addicted person finds escape with his or hers drug of choice.In Shame, the drug of choice is sex. Michael Fassbender plays a typical New York yuppie who'se life consists of keeping up appearances until he can get his sexual release through internet porn, cam models, bathroom masturbation, prostitutes or women he picks up in bars, on the street or in his work.A main point of criticism seems to be a lack of plot. That misses the point completely. This is not a feel good fairy tale Hollywood flick, but a snapshot in time of the life of the main character, the films crescendo being his estranged sister showing up unannounced, which hints at the possibility of redemption for both he and his sister, but alas, this remains untold at the end.The relationship with his sister is the clue to understanding the title of film in my opinion. While the shame referred to in the title seems to be generally accepted as the feeling of shame that the main character feels with his addiction, it's also more than alluded that there's a history, a dark secret between the brother and the sister. When his sister crawls into bed with him, when she barges in on him being nude, presses her naked body against his, it's impossible to ignore the hint at incest or abuse in their common past. It's best described when she tells him over the telephone 'We're not bad people, we just come from a bad place'.Both are deeply troubled individuals, both seem to try and cope with hurt and trauma, both clearly damaged people. He through addiction to sex, she with repeated suicide attempts. What exactly in the past that makes them feel shame is never told.In the end, Shame is an excellent and touching film, devoid of external displays of emotion, absent any warmth, but steaming with emotion just under the surface like a pressure cooker waiting to explode.To not like this film, is to not be willing to put yourself in the shoes of another human being. Watch this film with an open mind and be one experience richer.",Shame
238,Nahid_15,Michael Fassbender is insanely brilliant.,8,28 August 2020,"""We're not bad people. We just come from a bad place.""The film is profoundly sad. It brilliantly depicts what is the true effect of addiction. How it sucks the life out of someone until they are forced to give in to their desire, thus becoming just a hollow shell of a person. The whole thing has an unsettling vibe to it, and the color tone and cinematography do help the story to move forward.
Steve McQueen as a director really shines here. He tells the story with subtlety, like there some scenes where the characters don't say much, and he relies on visuals to do the work.As for the acting, Michael Fassbender is insanely brilliant as he is in all of his other films. This role requires a lot from him like he has to be charismatic, also has to bring a sense of vulnerability to the character which he does amazingly. Carey Mulligan's character is sort of this broken person who clearly has a past with her brother, at least that's what I got from some of their awkward encounters.It's kind of a tough film to sit through, so it's not recommended for everyone.",Shame

In a way I suppose it worked because by the film had ended I was thoroughly disgusted with Brandon and only wanted something bad to happen to him.If this film was supposed to tell us how difficult life is for people with sexual addictions, then it missed out some large chunks. Did Brandon know his problem? If yes, why didn't Brandon go and seek help. if no, then how stupid can you be? The issues with Brandon's sister (Sissy) were glossed over. Only near the end do we find out how suicidal the girl is, but no reason explored.All in all, my wife and I were pleased when the film finally ended.",Shame

You need to at least want to understand why he acts the way he does, but truthfully he is not at all likable, there is nothing that makes you want to help or understand him.The film it just a stream of dislikable characters, embarrassing sex scenes and it's all so harsh and pointless.Really disliked this film a great deal and I would recommend a wide berth.

Every single sex scene helped you understand what the character was going through. I have to admit I first thought all this movie would be about was tacky sex scenes trying to highlight a problem that some people will say isn't a problem.This film really gave me an insight into the painful world of a sex addict and I kid you not, it is full of sadness. I think everyone should watch this film and it has certainly raised my awareness of the problem.The scene at the end made me think, is the director Steve Mcqueen trying to say women also suffer from this or simply just a continuation of a habit hard to kill?

242,thegreatnolanfan,very depressing yet bold movie,9,6 May 2012,"i saw this movie and was very depressed that day. Brandon was funny, smart, handsome, loner, etc. But he dint have friends, family and he doesn't believe in relationships. He stays alone in his apartment spending most of the time in sexual activities. At times audience feel disgusted by this guy, at times they feel sympathetic towards him. Steve McQueen is a genius of a director. His first movie Hunger was brilliant. His style of directing is very unique. He is greatly talented and has lot of potential. His subjects are totally out of the box and his love for film making reflects in his movies. Shame is a rare movie, brilliantly made. Acting is superb by Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan. The background music adds up to the drama so much that you are involved in the movie and feel like you know this guy Brandon for real.But there is no good message and hope shown here. Maybe because they wanted to make the film more realistic. Also at some places the long shots are very long and slow the pacing of the movie. I have this compliant even in Hunger where in certain parts the scenes were very lengthy. Some movies you cannot forget long after watching them because they mess up your brain. Shame is one such movie. This movie is not for faint hearted.",Shame
243,tcbently,Film4 in New York,8,15 January 2012,"This film is set in New York and is about two Americans. It's a bit of a mystery therefore why it stars Michael Fassbender (who sounds German) and Carey Mulligan (who sounds English). This fact constantly grated on me no matter how wonderful other aspects of the film were.That rant over, there was a fairly big upside to Shame, namely the cinematography and the top-notch acting. Steve McQueen almost makes New York the star of the film. There are loving, lingering shots of the waterside, subway carriages and dark alleyways - the city really comes alive in his hands.Fassbender and Mulligan act their socks off, he as an executive with a porn and prostitute addiction and she as his wayward sister. However, it was a long single-shot of Fassbender on a dinner date with his co-worker Nicole Beharie which wowed me. It really captured the man's charm and longing to live a more normal life.Shame is a strange Anglo-American hybrid. A few tweaks to the script (why couldn't Brandon be a British ex-pat?) would have ironed out its awkward moments and made it truly wonderful.",Shame

Yes,it's about a sex addict,but did we need as much graphic sex in such large quantities that it swamped the point of the plot.Any sympathy or hope we had for ANY of the characters was washed away.As soon as we got into the story another ""sex video"" reared it's head.It wasn't the actual sex that worried me,I am 64 and have seen most things;what annoyed me was the fact that the movie became exactly what is was preaching against,someone or something obsessed by sex.BTW,if that is Carey Mulligans real singing voice she is great.",Shame

Well, i was not offended at any level by none of the extreme nudity scenes i saw, nor the topic itself; i understood the story right away. And yet i find this movie far too slow paced (and i usually like ""slow"" movies) and boring at times with the long unnecessary scenes where i am forced to watch him run and run and run and run or stand in the elevator with a blank face with hours, or whatever; scenes from which a better structured movie could actually benefit. I couldn't get a clear grip of what the main character has in his head, and that annoyed me all the time. He is this shell of a human being, he is totally afraid of contact with any woman as a person, and that's it. All the internal struggle he presumably has is down to one scene where he cries on the rain after seeing his sister in the hospital.

I was expecting something explosive and original and unfortunately left feeling disappointed.Sure, the acting is good and Fassbender is believable in the role, but I didn't find the story interesting or particularly thought-provoking. Sex addiction seems to be the latest celebrity or sports-star fad and to take it seriously as a real problem or illness is impossible for me to imagine. Obviously there are hints at a rough childhood for Brandon and his sister but, if anything, Sissy's life and character could have been explored a lot more as she seems so much more interesting.To sum up the acting was fine and the movie looks good, but the weakness of the story was a major weakness.

It is a film that is very gripping and draws you in from the very start. Director Steve McQueen has become well-known for his very harsh and deep directing style, where he brings out the best and worst of his characters. When people think of sexual predators they automatically dismiss them as disgusting perverts, but with the truly mesmerising performance by Michael Fassbender, he makes you feel pity and sadness, that makes you just want to reach out and help him but you know there is nothing you can do. It is a very thought-provoking film that is very graphic, so you can only manage to watch it once or twice, but it is a film you will never forget.

If the director and writer were aiming to leave us emotionally detached, they achieved that goal.

I disagree that he is a psychopath,-he's a product of upbringing and the environment he(we)live in. Anyways, I expect so much more from a movie with good actors; and honestly, I think the same results could have been achieved with less sleaziness. I actually thought that the gay scene was expected,and all the rest, when he was on the rampage to punish himself (that's how it seemed to me),otherwise why the breaking down and crying? But I didn't feel any pity or involvement.I just wanted to get some answers, since I already started watching it and the movie was about to end. You get some sort of answer, (his reaction to a woman in the subway, as at the beginning of the movie)- it still left me emotionally detached and like "" was it worth my time?"" On the positive and lighter aspect: Michael is nice to look at -with cloth and without-as much as he is a very good actor; and Carry has a very nice voice.I gave it a 5/10 because of the actors (including the ""boss"" character) and because it kept me sitting to the end.",Shame

253,FantasyCreatureFilmsLLC,A film that will haunt you,9,28 December 2011,"It's interesting reading many of these reviews expressing trouble with the lack of information presented.It seems the intent was to do a character study of the life of a sex addict, not the analysis. If this wasn't the intent, McQueen would have added a scene when Fassbender's character attempts to ""kick the habit"" showing him joining a 12 step program or going to a shrink as expository revelation.He doesn't and this is purposeful.McQueen chooses to put aside the pat formulaic approach to do something new. The audience experiences the obsessive spiral of this character by becoming the voyeur. McQueen never sways from this goal, he never allows the intent to be off its mark by slipping in an analysis of his character's past, instead he simply focuses on his pattern of behavior and creates the turmoil in the mind of a viewer forced to simply focus on this behavior and guess at what motivates him. I believe McQueen achieves this goal in a well made film that succeeds with the fresh voice of an original auteur.Everyone is going to have an opinion on this, as it's never actually stated in the story, as to what may be the motivating factor behind the Fassbender character: I do believe at heart this is a tragic love story between a man and his obsession for a sister he's not allowed to have sexually...of course this is just my theory but I think the clues are there. We'll never know watching this if there had been incest in the past, if in fact it was he who'd touched his sister and made her the suicidal mess she is today which is possible, or if it had been another family member. We're only given clues to a deeper, darker, shame than the sexual addiction; our first introduction to Mulligan's character where she steps out of a shower naked in front of her brother is telling. There's endless availability of her to her brother that seems sexually provocative and purposeful to get a rise out of him. It's his response, his tears, his agonies, the exacerbation of his issues to her actions that are the giveaway; ultimately, we see when he can't perform with a co-worker we come closest to the reality of his issues regarding a deep rooted fear of intimacy with those he cares for. There's the re-occurring issue of his obsession with a woman in the subway wearing a wedding ring. His co-worker mentions she's separated. Is he unable to perform because, like his sister, she's taboo, or because she's been married? He seeks a rise from a man who he purposely provokes by claiming he wants to do certain acts with his girlfriend (was the relationship with his mother twisted, did he seek to provoke his father?). For commentary that the story is unbelievable, that straight man with a sex addiction become so out of control they may wander into a gay sex club and allows an act like you see, this is not outside the realm of possibility and probability for a man with a severe sex addiction. For commentary that this is about a man with depression and inability to be intimate, all these are part of the illness of sex addiction.We're also hit over the head we're watching a cyclical relationship between he and his sister, that leads to the same pattern in his behavior over and over like a broken record. We all want to know while we watch this movie what the background of this character is, but we're denied this. Instead, we're forced to experience the raw shame and degradation of sex addiction.

255,anjru,A snapshot of a painfully empty life,9,23 December 2011,"In Shame, Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan play brother and sister who share a disturbing past that they only hint at, leaving film-goers to guess what happened to them as children and teenagers as their emotionally-crippled adult years unfold.Fassbender's Brandon Sullivan is a thirty-something businessman who is relationally disabled. He seems incapable of connecting with anyone except through random, fleeting and sometimes dangerous sexual encounters. Mulligan's Sissy Sullivan, a lounge singer, craves a connection with her brother, a caring relationship. However, he is incapable of connecting with her except for fleeting moments of affection.One of my favorite scenes in the film is when Brandon and his smarmy married boss, played by James Badge Dale, go to the club where Sissy is performing. Her rendition of Frank Sinatra's New York, New York is spellbinding, as is her brother's unfolding reaction to it.Shame is rated NC17. There are a number of graphic scenes of full frontal nudity, threesomes, prostitutes, explicit language and more. None of it is gratuitous or particularly titillating because, what always comes through above all else is the emptiness and desperation in Brandon. He seems to wish to find a way out, but always to no avail.As someone else wrote, this is not a good ""first-date movie."" Shame is not for everyone. It is compelling, disturbing and well-acted and directed. If you have a stomach for a disturbing film and a slice of the times we live in, check it out.",Shame

But we stick with him and we see where it will lead even if it leads to no good. What I love about the film is it's space, never you feel forced by the story to go one way or another, it all comes naturally and subtle. You almost feel like a voyeur watching this man's life struggling with human relations and too much sex, which feels like the man has a problem but you don't know why, lot of sex but not in a nice erotic or romantic way mind you. It's about addictions, could have been any addiction but in this case sex. It's a sad story but a moving one brilliantly told and as I said, the room in the story, not forcing any aspect of it is for me the biggest plus and achievement of this directorial effort. The director really knows how to pace it and give you bits and pieces along a quite slow but interesting pace. Fassbender and Mulligan are very natural in a nasty place that makes your skin crawl at times but in a realistic way you almost feel you were there to watch it happen. I would certainly recommend it to people who love realistic films about real people, as much as that's possible in cinema.",Shame
258,MaccyXpert,"Powerful and confrontational messages, perhaps too subtle for some",8,14 September 2018,"This is one of the more explicit films I have watched in recent memory - the sex scenes and resulting nudity. Some will certainly argue that this is all gratuitous, but the protagonist's (Brandon Sullivan, played by Michael Fassbender) sex addiction ultimately serves as his hamartia (this is implied by the trailer and plot summary, so it's not a spoiler). The film depicts the harmful nature of being consumed by one's sexual desires (even if viewing this flawed behaviour may make some viewers uncomfortable) and offers some less significant - but still noticeable - commentary on hypermasculinity. The two leads are Fassbender and Carey Mulligan (who plays Sissy, Brandon's sister; this name may be a reference to a derogatory term used by hypermasculine men to describe men whom they view as effeminate/weak/soft because - among other things - they are not sexually aggressive with women). Their performances drive the film confidently, with Fassbender often acting cold and heartless (he may be suffering from typecasting at this point) and Mulligan lashing out and depicting a deep sense of insecurity (she always ends up playing characters with accents that make her sound younger than she is, which I find odd e.g. Mudbound and Drive). I think that the features/points worth analysing in this film are more subtle than in most films; I can tell what director Steve McQueen wants to convey and comment on (in most cases; other people may have trouble with picking up on minimal details that express restrained thoughts or emotions). Several scenes in the film involve focusing on Brandon's facial expression, particularly his eyes and lips, so it requires concentration that would suck to be shattered by noisy eaters in the cinema. McQueen maintains a sense of intimacy throughout the film; most of the scenes involving conversations or private moments involve close-ups or EXTREME close-ups. Due to this arthouse-style subtlety of filmmaking, some plot points or character arcs may seem unexpected. Some may also think that McQueen focuses on mundane moments for far too long e.g. Brandon waiting motionlessly for the train to stop for a few seconds. The sex scenes and nudity are obviously the talking point of the film; McQueen presents them in a realist manner (most people would not have an issue revealing their private parts in a private situation, so it is done casually). In his intention to display the destructive nature of sex addiction, McQueen presents the audience with a brutally honest depiction of Brandon's psychology (even though, in some cases, this depiction may lack depth) and wants the audience to feel confronted, in a sense (quality films can do this and sometimes alienate viewers i.e. the more conservative ones).",Shame

There's no path here, just a really big, unkempt park with people screwing in the bushes.Case in point: Powerful scenes can be formed with extremely long scenes, going beyond what would normally be used. You watch, you watch, then suddenly see something that changes the way you feel about a character, or an event.Or you can just let the camera run on and on as you film people running or -- oh, please just kill me now! -- listening to a woman who can't sing with a grating piano behind her as she sings the ENTIRE ""New York, New York"" song at roughly half the speed Marilyn Monroe sang ""Happy Birthday"" to JFK.The actors were fine, I suppose.

Having been in a relationship with someone who was addicted to internetporn, sexphonelines and (sleazy) dating sites, but unable to be intimate with me affectionately and sexually, this film was a very painful confrontation. Just like Brandon my partner was very becoming in his ways in company, somewhat bashful and humble, very handsome, successful in his line of work, but in private he could be very humiliating towards me, pushing me away when I wanted a cuddle or snuggle up, worked me almost literally out the door when he needed to go online again ('Alright, closing time!'). I had never been with someone who was unable to have sex with me, so I didn't understand it and I couldn't recognize the disorder. And I was in love. So I stayed. Took a lover to not totally waste away, but I was miserable and unhappy – but in denial about the seriousness of the situation. Although I tried to get him to get help together from a therapist. But he said he didn't need any help; He didn't have a problem. He said he was just not that sexual. (Not much later I found out, he was addicted to porn, phonesex and dating sites). Worse: He turned things around and called me ""needy"" and ""clingy"". He snapped just like Brandon to Sissy: 'Stop being a victim! You're dragging me down!' If I could have recognized and interpreted the signs, if I had seen this movie back then, then maybe I would have stepped out of the relationship after already three months, instead of staying for years and waste my prime time on a relationship that was going nowhere and which slowly wore me out physically and mentally. This movie is very important! Very important for everybody who is not in touch with their emotions and is addicted to all sorts of loveless sex and porn, but terrified to connect with other people and to be intimate in a relationship. And it is important for everybody who is in a relationship with such a person. It is a real wake-up call. It will get you in touch with your true feelings. And only the truth can set you free, as painful as it is! So therefor I gave it 10 stars, because it is a very important and brilliantly made film.",Shame
262,SammerAsker,It's A Shame,6,16 March 2012,"**Few non-detailed Spoiler**It's a ""Shame"" really...that's in short how i feel about the movie ""Shame"". so many aspects of that movie makes you want to like it, and I'm certainly not suggesting that i hate it, but... to go into details, Acting was Brilliant & Heartfelt, Camera & photography were very good, Directing in most aspects is nice, the thing is the movie is... lost in its own dilemma which is the director's responsibility. I'm always careful when i talk about the ""creative"" aspects of any film, because simply it's the maker's vision & he has all the right to shape it the way he likes it even if we didn't like it, i put very few exception to that rule and ""shame"" falls under that exception. Let me summarize my Criticism in 2 points: 1- It lacks the sense of Direction, you don't know where the movie is going even when it ends, you may understand what was intended but with how it was executed it leaves you disappointed especially as i said with everyone (actors and Crew) done their jobs to the best they could i find no one to blame for this but the director. The movie had a main Storyline which at points choose to divert from, which is understandable given the Movie's subject and how they choose to handle it, yet those different storyline were never expanded, explained, persuaded, the movie just opens a door and went past it. Movies sometimes discuss a subject or trying to find an answer, or philosophy blunder around such subject, or even in abstract manner reflect on a huge array of subjects all at the same time, the problem here is you don't really get what the director is set out to accomplish!!! 2- No Character depth what so ever, with such complex psychological drama, one need some kind of back story, even a hint of a characters history, but none were presented leaving a lot of questions ""Why?"" unanswered. Even the relationships between characters were filled with unexplained gaps, not filled even by simple commonsense So at the end of the movie you'll find yourself asking, hmm i got this after 10-20 minutes, why the extra hour?!!!Again I seem to hate the movie, which isn't true, i hate how it was executed, and i blame the director for it, i think the director had a huge issue editing this movie which caused what we saw, I still recommend seeing it but keep in mind it's far from perfect, all the actors were great, the story told is capturing, and the point made is intelligent and you will enjoy the overall experience, but i do suspect most people will not like the execution as i did. Mr. Fassbender has a 2nd movie which in away walks the same subject path of ""Shame"" but certainly executed in a much better manner (A Dangerous Method) it's a must see.Note \ people are rating movies far so high these days, this is hardly a 6.",Shame
263,euphoria2150,"A bit slow, too much nudity, good acting, a good psychological attempt!",5,15 May 2012,"After viewing this movie, I was left feeling as though there wasn't enough closure in the film. Michael Fassbender is playing a character with a sex addiction problem. He finds it vile and disgusting and feels guilt but it's also his outlet for perhaps his level of self-confidence. He seems bored, lonely, lost, like an empty drifter, and he turns toward sex and porn in an attempt to fill the empty void within. He's yearning to feel something and all he seems to feel in the end is guilt and shame, but alas, he's feeling so he continues his habit. I assume something traumatic happened along the way to both him and his sister because she too is dealing with her emotional damage throughout the film. Her intrusion upon him seems to raise a deep pain that he represses and buries beneath his soul-less facade. There seems to be a hint of an incestuous past between them and perhaps that's connected to the deep pain they both do not want to address. Overall, this movie was well acted, but I think I would have liked to see less nudity on Michael Fassbender's part, and more of him addressing the deeper problem beneath the porn and sex addiction. The pacing was a bit slow. Along with the soundtrack, its pacing emulated a painter slowly creating a work of art that somehow goes unfinished.",Shame

The direction is fine and most of the scenes fit together well.However, I found the story lacking because the background of Brandon and his sister is not really explained so I had very little emotional connection with them.Why can't Brandon have a relationship with any of the women he has sex with? Why does Sissy cut her wrists? If there was one - just one - flashback scene (possibly) explaining their ""bad"" past, this would have been a much better, more complete, film.The director could have cut the scene where Sissy sings ""New York, New York"" VERY slowly. I get that they moved from Jersey but so what? I played that scene on double speed on my DVD and it was still too long. I suspect cinema viewers used that as a toilet break.Finally, can we stop talking about sex ""addiction""? Brandon has an obsession not a dependency. Two different things. Some guys just can't keep it in their pants - this is just biology. Addiction is overused in describing personal issues. Injecting smack? Yes - you have an addiction. Jerking off in the shower?

I expected the usual art-house, depressing, emotionless ""look"" at sex addiction. Yes, there were many scenes of emotionless sexual encounters, but the film was more than that. This film stayed in my mind for days. It was a very moving, very human film about two people who are deeply unhappy but still struggling to make their lives meaningful.The real highlight of the film is Michael Fassbender's performance as Brandon. Brandon is a sex addict: he is successful in many areas of his life and is even admired by his boss, a serial adulterer. But his life is a painful search for connection, which he gets in sex but can't bring himself to get in relationships. His very painful first date with a nice girl emphasizes his fear of really opening up to people. In a remarkably restrained performance, Fassbender shows us that Brandon is deeply unhappy, ashamed, but still human and deserving of pity and sympathy. This intensifies when Carey Mulligan's Sissy comes to town. Where he deals with relationships by keeping them superficial and cold, she begs for love. In the end, both are completely dysfunctional yet try to show love for each other.I loved the film's restrained yet warm performances. I liked the script's elegant storytelling (no Lifetime movie explanations about why Brandon and Sissy are like this). The film is beautifully shot, with a lovely color scheme.

He makes the tiniest details the most interesting thing to watch. Case in point; social meeting between Brandon and Marianne is easily my favorite scene. The uncomfortable silences and delicious pauses in the conversations during dinner. Every intricate moment at the table exactly captures the mood of awkwardness - even with the ever-present waiter lol (how often does THAT happen?). I completely enjoyed watching two people flirting and conversing about anything and everything and much of nothing at all, steadily moving towards a knowing destination.

272,team-26,"Very dull, very bad film",1,16 January 2012,"Some spoilers. I really wanted this to be good - but it wasn't. It was gratuitous: I have no problem with nudity or sex on screen - as long there's a point to it. Here there wasn't. For example, at the very beginning of the film we are treated to the sight of the main character (Brandon) walking around his apartment naked - with the camera at crotch height. Then we are treated to the sight of him peeing - with the camera at crotch height. Does this add to our understanding of the character? No. Does it advance the plot? No. Ergo gratuitous unless . . . well, I don't know Steve McQueen, but this seemed a tad homoerotic for my taste. Later the main character's boss walks up to him and pinches him on the bottom. We aren't told why an aggressively heterosexual man does an act of homosexual harassment. So is this also gratuitous? Still later - I'd walked out by then - I gather there's a full-on (and less than credible) homosexual encounter. That doesn't surprise me, but I am surprised that the depths of Brandon's addiction to sex (his 'Shame') was marked by a sexual encounter with another man. In these enlightened times it seems odd to mark a sexual nadir by a spot of consensual buggery - and not complimentary to gay men who (quite rightly) aren't in the least bit ashamed of what they do. If you want a bit of degradation, why not show Brandon in a clinch with a sheep - if, that is, you want a little 'shame'?There will be reviews cladding this movie with a lot of pretentious statements, but at bottom this is a film made for men who like to take a sideways and surreptitious peek at the urinal. It's a film made for men who will claim it's a deep and meaningful look at sexual addiction - to patch over the fact that they are titillated by other men's body parts. It's a film made for men who can pretend it's intellectual while denying it's masturbatory. In short, 'Shame' is a film for men who haven't got the guts to rent 'Young Studs of Oslo'.Actually, let me take one thing back: 'Shame' is not masturbatory. It's not that good. Pornography has to engage, but this film was boring. It was dull. It was tedious. And that's what's unforgivable.One to avoid.",Shame
273,Copyright1994,A Masterpiece!,10,29 September 2011,"""Shame"" centers on Brandon (Michael Fassbender), a lonely, self-  alienated man in his thirties who tries his best to appear as your  average New Yorker with an office job whenever he finds himself out in  public. The trouble with this young man-- or his tragic flaw-- is that  whenever he finds a minute of privacy in his day, he hastily delves  into his own fabricated reality: a world of excessive sex, pornography,  and masturbation. The day Brandon's distressed, disruptive sister Sissy  (Carey Mulligan) barges into his condo looking for a place to stay  until things wind down and her sorrows disappear, his life begins to  spiral out of control. He grows increasingly frustrated with her as he  feels her invasive presence will bring about the exposure of his  deepest and darkest secrets. However, we see that this is just a  manifestation of his feelings of intense shame and regret for leading  the sad, artificial life he believes is the only one fit for him.  Steve McQueen has the sheer audacity to go where very few filmmakers  have dared to go before by making a film about sexual addiction and its  effects on the human mind. In this ambitious boldness, he doesn't want  to hold back on anything and he isn't afraid to show everything, so the  result is a film with enough full nudity and explicit sexual content to  receive an R-rating in Canada, which would probably translate to an NC-  17 rating in the US, unfortunately. There are several scenes in the  film where you literally see every inch of skin on the bodies of the  actors (Fassbender is probably the most physically exposed). Having  said that, this is never something that comes across as frivolous and  it only enhances the film's shock factor as a whole.  Michael Fassbender delivers the performance of a lifetime in ""Shame"",  and I currently can't see anyone else winning the Oscar for Best Actor  at the upcoming Academy Awards. He seems to understand his sad, lonely  character just as well as the screenwriters who gave birth to him (Abi  Morgan and Steve McQueen). Brandon is his own worst enemy, for he longs  to find solace in someone and discover genuine human affection, but the  other side of him remains too caught up in a shameful world detached  from real feelings and emotions. There are some scenes in the film  where we, the audience, are left alone with nothing but his  introspective, subdued presence as he reflects upon his actions in  regret. These scenes say more than most movies can say within their  entirety. It's thanks to Michael Fassbender's pitch-perfect performance  that we can step into his character's shoes and get to feel what he's  feeling. They say actions speak more than words; with ""Shame"", acting  speaks more than the inclusion of any sort of narration ever would.   Don't worry; I didn't forget about Carey Mulligan! I thought I would  highlight her performance separately, too. If I had to say only one  thing about it, I would emphasize how amazed I was at seeing her in  such an unusual, singular role. She has a tendency to play soft-spoken,  prim and proper characters-- but that's not the case with ""Shame"". She  really submerges herself into this disastrous, uncontrollable mess of a  young woman who never conceals her deepest feelings to the world-- be  it joy or sorrow. There's this one very memorable scene in the film  where she sings her own rendition of the jazz standard ""New York, New  York"" in a lounge (she's a singer who does gigs here and there), and  for the duration of the song, the camera stays focused on her face.  There are no cuts nor camera movements for a good five minutes (of  course, this won't come as a big shock to you if you have seen Steve  McQueen's ""Hunger""), yet somehow, this scene is absolutely  mesmerizing-- almost hypnotizing. Just the way she naturally glances  about apprehensively as this beautiful voice is unleashed (although it  probably isn't hers) is enough to send shivers down your spine.  What can I say about all the other aspects of the film? Well, since  Steve McQueen was the man behind the direction and shot composition,  it's no big surprise that ""Shame"" is expertly crafted in every little  detail. McQueen used the same cinematographer (Sean Bobbitt) and editor  (Joe Walker) of his first feature to achieve the same impressive  aesthetic look. Some parts of the film must have required so much time  and effort from the editor, it's hard to believe what was accomplished!  As for the cinematography, I'm sure you'll be floored by it within the  first five minutes of the film. In this opening scene, Brandon finds  himself staring at a woman sitting across from him as he is riding the  subway. He misunderstands her frightened glances and nervous attempts  to display her wedding ring as romantic advances, so when she gets off  in a panic at the next stop, he immediately follows her. In one of the  most beautiful, gliding shots I've ever witnessed-- with an emotionally  shattering musical composition by Harry Escott playing all throughout--  we see Brandon running up the station stairs and looking around for the  woman, only to realize that she had run away from him. His failure to  comprehend human interactions in this scene already gives us a distinct  perception on this poor character's serious vulnerability.  In sum, Steve McQueen's ""Shame"" is a masterful character study with  top- grade performances from Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan and  a raw power unmatched by any other film I've seen. This is surely not a  film for everyone, as it deals with dark, gritty topics often labeled  as far too controversial for the big screen. But if you're open to true  cinema, here's a devastating powerhouse of a film that will chill you  to the bone and forever stay with you.",Shame
274,slothhead54,Some of the best acting I've seen all year,9,10 November 2011,"I can see how potentially audience viewers might be distracted by the nudity and graphic of this film. I can also see how audience viewers could focus on the pace of the film being that it is sometimes slow with the long stills and doesn't have a dialog that adds pulse to the film. What makes 'Shame' such a success though is the raw acting talent showcased by Carey Mulligan & Michael Fassbender. The film, for lack of better explanation, almost entirely unfolds through their facial expressions. In the film Brandon, Fassbender's character, says ""Actions matter not words"" and that couldn't be more true for this film. What this film does have in dialog it certainly makes up for in superb acting performances.As an audience viewer you are left watching two very distinct characters heavily embedded in their struggles, very different from one another. As you come understand their inability to break free from the vices that bind them, McQueen is able to add a cathartic tone to this film through the development of his characters.Brandon (Fassbender) is such a prisoner of his addiction that he is prevented from being able to be anything else but an addict. He can't be someone's boyfriend and he can't even be the brother that his sister desperately needs. Anything requiring Brandon to step away from his carnal desire proves to be too much for him. Watching Fassbender as he emotes this on screen, constantly searching to quench his thirst, like any good addict does, is remarkable. He maintains our attention all the while appearing void and omnipresent in himself. In the end of the film when Brandon is confronted with a life & death situation you want to believe that this been the ""kick"" he has needed to come to grips with reality, causing him to reform his ways.

Shame examines the daily routine of a sex addict having to live in constant desire. Through his morning rituals till late in the night sex is always on the mind of Brandon. When his sister finally arrives on his doorstep after hearing countless messages left by her on his machine, the audience discovers how skewed their relationship is. Her presence sends Bandon over the edge, he is unable to maintain his addiction with her presence. She interrupts not only his home life but his work life.Sissy herself is as well a tragic character desiring love by anyone who will give it to her; and depending on others to maintain her well being. The dynamic between these two characters exposes the similarities between addiction of any kind showing the lengths an individual will go to seek release. Shame is able to communicate the inability for a sex addict is to build on or continue any relationship and the loneliness associated with addiction in general. This is conveyed in many scenes between Sissy and Brandon as well as the tracking shots through NYC. The director also chooses some fantastic songs that work well to represent sex addiction, a seemingly normal and jovial exterior containing a both dark and tragic interior. The acting in this film is clearly the best part although the script is solid, a yearning for background information leaves the viewer at times unsatisfied. The direction features many great scenes but the silences can sometimes be too drawn out (ex: singing scene). Overall this is a great film that delivers on it's premise: revealing the truth of a misconceived addiction. 8.5/10",Shame
276,prisni,Beautiful!,8,18 August 2012,"It's hard to notice but the use of almost minimal background music, for a change you decide your interpretation of the scene, the mood is self- defined. All you hear is the city as it rumbles and breathes and as life is being lived. Long shots of the actor in his moments where you see a subtle display of his insatiable urge and a gradual progression towards 'shame' are so beautifully etched out on screen. Like many well-crafted 'mood' films this one is addictive and leaves you in a melancholy pensive state.The actors, both Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan are brilliant in their performances, as they come together and fall apart, sharing both light moments as well those of intense distaste for each other. I personally love that much is conveyed without the help of dialogue and intense and overwhelming cinematography.",Shame

279,peterbillionaire,Anonymous sex is never fun in the movies,1,5 February 2012,"SPOILERS Brandon (Michael Fassbender) has a lot of really hot sex and he's unhappy. That's the movie in a nutshell. When this movie ended, I thought, ""Is that all there is?"" The unhappiness theme is established at the start. It is reiterated throughout the film. OK, he's unhappy, I get it.There's way too much sex. You know at the start of the film that Brandon has a lot of sex. The additional sex scenes add nothing to our understanding of the character. Although the sex looks hot (two hookers at once!), Brandon always looks grim. Anonymous sex is never fun in the movies. Lighten up, dude!It's not clear if the sex is causing Brandon's unhappiness, or if it is a symptom. The character is not articulate, so you will have to infer.It is fun to see Michael Fassbender walking around naked. Dude's got a big one, and a nice butt. I could do without actually seeing him pee. There are some teasing moments when the director sets you up to expect something sexy or pervy, and then doesn't deliver. When Sissy and Brandon's boss are having loud sex in Brandon's apartment, Brandon takes his clothes off. Is he going to join them in the bedroom? No, he's just going running.In the opening scene, Brandon is shown naked in bed with his hand over his crotch. Sorry, no payoff, he just rolls over and gets out of bed.Incest between Brandon and Sissy is implied. She stands provocatively naked in front of him when he bursts into the bathroom. She does not cover herself as they talk. In another scene, he jumps on her on the sofa when he is wearing only a towel, which then slips off. She gets in bed with him. The issue is not directly addressed or resolved, so it seems to be a red herring.The film seems padded. There are long shots of Brandon walking through Manhattan, or riding the subway. OK, we know he's always on the make. There is a very long single shot of Brandon jogging. If you know Manhattan geography, you can pass the time by trying to identify his route. Or you can check your messages. In the restaurant where Brandon meets Marianne, you have to listen to the waiter give his spiel about that night's specials and the wine list. Worst of all, you have to listen to Sissy sing ""New York New York"" all the way through, at a very slow tempo.There is an incident when Brandon is on the subway. His train comes to a halt at the platform, but the doors do not open. There is some kind of scuffle on the platform. Perps are seen running. The conductor orders all of the passengers to exit through the rear car. There are cops and yellow caution tape to guide the passengers. This sequence is interesting. Being stuck on a train underground is a kind of primal fear. How was the caution tape put up so fast? The sequence looks like it was really shot in the subway. If there is some connection with the rest of the story, I missed it. Brandon exits up to the street, and the incident is forgotten.Why does Sissy have to stay at Brandon's apartment? She has money. Why doesn't she have her own apartment? Or stay at a hotel? How can she get high-paying gigs as a singer when her life is chaotic? When does she rehearse? The sequence where Brandon goes gay is uncredible. Is this sequence intended to show how low he will go? --- or that he's latent? These things do happen, but we already know that Brandon can get all of the hookers he wants. He meets chic women in bars and they're having sex under a bridge 20 minutes later. This hetero superman all of sudden goes to a gay sex club? Not so plausible. Sissy's character is more interesting than Brandon. She talks more, so you know her better. Too bad about the suicide attempt. Like, now it's time for a big dramatic moment. Maybe if the movie were about Sissy, I would care more.There isn't a lot of ideas here. Most of the film seems to be treading water. Brandon is unhappy at the end of the movie. Like he was at the start.",Shame
280,Jayden933,Fassbender's Performance Carries this Emotional and Powerful Drama,8,31 August 2012,"Shame is a raw and provocative story of a man (Michael Fassbender) who is battling an aggressive sex addiction when his sister (Carey Mulligan) moves in. The most proper way I can think to describe the film is disturbingly beautiful. Michael Fassbender carries this movie with his superb performance, dedicating himself to the character. His inner turmoil is accentuated with the beautiful dramatic score. The film itself is exquisitely and artistically shot and contains some extremely long takes, showcasing the skill of the director and the actors. Overall, this movie has some of the greatest acting and cinematography in motion pictures and tells a dramatic, compelling, and emotional story. 7.6/10",Shame
281,lewismillican,As Brilliant As It Is Necessary In The 21st Century,9,11 October 2017,"Shame rather bravely tackles arguably the least talked about addiction in our 24 hour media world; sex addiction. This serious affliction is often glossed over in movies in place of seemingly more 'glamorous' addictions in drugs and alcohol. Perhaps this is due to the difficulty of writing a script and creating a focal character that is done tastefully. Opposed to making a movie that is basically an upmarket porno with a script that can't convey any severity or meaning. Shame brings some class to the table, facing up to the challenge through bringing a sense of realism and grit.General ThoughtsI'll start with the script it is brilliant, it is natural, it is genuine and the conversations in each and every scene seem fluid and real. For any screen writers out there this is how you write a script, and believe it or not it is just how people talk in real life as well! It was of course truly brought to life by not only lead character Brandon (Michael Fassbender) but the support cast. The on screen chemistry the manifested between him and his Sister (Carey Mulligan) was intense and that relationship actually proved to be such a perfect microcosm of Brandon's state of mind.Coupled with that, the direction by Steve McQueen is fabulous, not only the gloomy cinematography but the individual scene setups are brilliant. They are deeply atmospheric, Brandon's apartment is a very interesting use of space, and for me you feel 'cornered' along with him in his many arguments with his Sister. It is clinical, regimented and has very little soul which you can not help think will only curve his ability to develop and live in comfort.We are nearly on a home run when it comes to a checklist of what makes a brilliant movie but next is the score. It is dark, it is atmospheric and the diegetic score coming from brandon's personal music choices perfectly epitomises the mood of each and every scene. The dire and desperate music Brandon seems to choose is no coincidence, and only seems to add to the pain he is going though.We are indeed on a home run now surely? costumes; the clothing Brandon chooses perfectly reflects the state of his life and his addiction. Dark, dull, bland and lifeless, the costume designers have done a great job here. Clothing is well known to be an expression of someones personality. It is very easy to see if someone feels at ease and is comfortable in their own body, by what they wear. Therefore this is a element of the movie I simply had to bring up.Stand out performancesBrandon (Michael Fassbender)Brandon is the focal point of this movie and he is an incredibly complex human. In that amounts other things it is evident he is not able to have a meaning relationship, he doesn't allow himself to open up and be himself. There are flashes throughout the movie in which he allows himself to be his true self, most noticeable on his date with Marianne (Nicole Beharie) and with his boss, David (James Dale). He is constantly trapped and is unable to live freely due to this affliction he seems to have caught himself up in. It is as if, like a smoker, he is a slave to his addiction he completely changes as a person when he is having what you could call 'withdrawal symptoms'. He will do anything to get what he desires and when I say anything watch the movie and you'll find out.Sissy (Carey Mulligan)Not without her own problems Brandon's sister provides a fabulous sub plot to this. You can genuinely feel the pain she is going through in her performance and truly brings the script alive. I don't think Steve could have asked for much more from his leading lady in order to bring the best out of the protagonist and emphasise the ordeal he is going through.Final ThoughtsShame is as brilliant as it is necessary in this day in age. A greater understanding and compassion for the affliction is very much required from the general public, and this movie is a great step in that direction. With a protagonist that you can truly warm to. A small but vital support cast in which there are no missing links and every role has meaning, this makes for a truly refreshing movie. Although glum at times, that is very much necessary in bringing realism to a dire affliction. With a plot that is not multifaceted and over complex it never staggers but only builds in momentum. Like a snowball down a hill, never is there a point where you are not fully invested in this movie. For that very reason it is undoubtedly my favourite Fassbender role to date. 9/10",Shame

283,kayvan_new,A man fighting his inner devils ... really moving?!,7,26 September 2012,"I don't like to bother you with mentioning the details. As far I watched this movie and think over it there was a real gap in the plot. A sister coming out of nowhere, not even a simplest idea where she was or what was she really doing or looking for. You only have to follow a man just thinking about sex every moment during the day even at work like a real pervert and nothing more. Of course there were some temporary moments where he felt regret, but it was totally unbelievable and every time he did the same like nothing. In some scene it was just like a pornography with some dialogue. I am sure there are some movies out there from now or past which dealt with this inner struggle on one's obsessions and dark sided personality but I can say for sure it is not one success at all.",Shame
284,phantlers,A Quiet Classic,9,21 June 2012,"I enjoyed the extended commentary in the form of printed word placement on screen from advertisements, street signs, graffiti or newspaper headlines, wherein lies some humour and irony. Similarly, the epiphany towards the end when Brandon realises the truth of what Sissy has said about the value of their relationship and its importance for each of them. For me, this is the shame of the title, his realisation of how he may have betrayed the essential values (and people, including himself) in his life for the superficial or the artifice, as represented by placing sex before love. There's a nagging thought that the title may also echo a reference to an imagined incestuous act that never occurs but which may well have been anticipated by an audience teased by the trailer and synopsis, perhaps another joke by the director.There is much allegory here, in what is a deeply layered tale - something about the superficiality of thrill-seeking and the worthlessness of placing the immediate satisfaction brought by feeding an insatiable craving over nurturing a relationship that may become more lasting and worthwhile. I'm not convinced Brandon has a 'sex addiction' per se, as is widely supposed, so much as a compulsion to seek out the immediate thrill of an orgasm, something closer to an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder than an 'addiction'. Sure, I may have over-thought this a little and perhaps this belongs in a discussion rather than a review but that's how the film - and its superbly atmospheric soundtrack - moved me.",Shame

He thinks his sister is a complete loser which actually is the projection of his own guilt.Movie has this dark tone and empty feel to it which goes amazingly well with the scenes. There are some wonderful long takes where Fassbenders's expressions say it all.All the characters gave fine performances and I hope to see excellent work from the director again.My rating 9/10",Shame
286,rbap,Memorable,8,11 April 2012,"Not many films these days dare peek into the fabric of our personal morality and our humanity all at the same time, but Shame does just that.If you're reading this, you probably know what this film is about. If you want to know whether it's pornographic, overly shocking, or sensationalist I'd say not at all. It's honest.I never thought much about sex addiction. In fact, until I saw this movie it was an addiction I scoffed at. But like all addictions it's a matter of self-control. Clearly it can happen with sex, too. The problem with it is that on the exterior, it's much easier to hide than drug or alcohol abuse. A sex addict can be a successful, charming, and likable everyday guy to his friends and co-workers. But in his mind, he's a monster, never satisfied, always seeking to devour sex. Whether it's pornography, masturbation, or it involves another person it really doesn't matter. He becomes an automaton unable to form real human relationships. The sad part is that the sex, whenever it does happen, is just as fake and devoid of any humanity.I picked this all up by watching the film, it's that powerful. It depicts something few of us really think about with any seriousness. McQueen deserves any plaudits coming his way for this visionary piece of filmmaking. I now have Hunger on my 'must watch' list. Fassbender and Mulligan are incredible in their acting; utterly authentic. The musical score, too, is perfect. It is such a well put together film it deserves to be seen on this basis alone.It's not a happy movie, but it's not necessarily a sad movie either. It just is. You feel it, and you'll remember it.",Shame

But after seeing Fassbender's other projects, like Frank and Prometheus, I felt like I had to revisit this movie again. And, oh boy, did I find another layer of this movie. Look at it from the perspective of a struggle from an addict, and you'd appreciate this movie a lot. Can you see his frustration? His struggle? The conflicts inside him? It's amazing how an actor (a goofy one, actually) can bring all of these through an acting. And it's amazing that he cared enough to create a movie about sex addiction to make people aware of this.",Shame
288,J_kotowicz,Powerful and Artsy,7,11 November 2012,"Cleverly shot and well paralleled to the film's score, Shame is a deep, multilayer movie. Certainly not for the prudish or judgmental, this film showcases how even the most gentle bump in an addict's routine can cause an unstoppable downward spiral.'Functioning addict' is a slippery slope. Craving to find love, attention and escape, Shame talks about how an addict overcompensates to stressors in his life. Filling the void with sex, violence, and self destructive tendencies, you watch as Brandon (the main character) slips into an oblivion.Thought the world in Shame moves at a million miles an hour, there is very little character development. They start at a low, stay at a low, and continue to be low. There is no victory amongst the characters, not for an instant.Recommended to watch with a glass of wine and one or two close friends. Definitely not for the family or grandma.",Shame

There are some good sex scenes, but if I wanted to see sex, I'd just go watch porn.Why is he a sex addict? How did he become one? What is his relationship with his sister? Why does she make him so angry? And many other unanswered questions. The ending is awful, and the movie is a waste of time. Not sure why people call this a masterpiece, I'd never ever watch it again, it has no replay value or anything memorable.There are far better movies to watch, please don't waste your time with this one. The only reason I gave it two stars, is I like the concept, it could have been something great, but in ended up a movie that will be forgotten.

It keeps your interest until the end because you would like to know what happens next, or what's the point, what's the message - only to arrive at the end and discover that in fact nothing of interest or significance happens, there is no point, and there is no message - apart maybe from the boring whining about how the search for pleasure without love end up in misery and death - but do we really need to sit for nearly two hours to ""learn"" this? Drama about how life is so terrible and boring and empty of signification are so easy to make. You just need to run the camera, drag your ass around, film someone peeing or release himself in the office toilet, looking haggardly into emptiness and ending up shouting and crying. I can do that! And I am not Tom Cruise.The next thing of interest is when a bunch of critics then try to find meaning in all this, and try to read in it high existential truths. Very interesting.

The trauma in their childhood must have been great for these two to suffer what the viewer is witnessing. Any addiction is difficult to watch. I was exhausted after watching this film. Like a hunter Brandon's thirst could never be quenched. He is existing not living. There are so many facets to this fim that are interesting: the boss David's ability to have a family and indulge in sex on the side, people's willingness to go to a bar and have sex with a stranger and then go on with their lives, unaffected. Yet Brandon, with no ties to anyone, is smoldering and suffocating in the weight of his obsession. A good study in human behavior. I don't like sex in film for sensationalism but the sex in this film was like another character, the antagonist.",Shame
292,nexusfpl,"I watched if because of Fassbender, and liked it a lot",8,6 February 2015,"First, I want to say that Michael Fassbender is such a talented actor that everything he does is worth seeing, if only to see his wonderful acting abilities.Now about this movie, Shame. It's the only movie from Steve McQueen I've seen so far. Judging from this one, I'll watch other things from this guy as soon as I can. For I liked the pace of this film, and the way the story develops without much abruption. Everything is told in a slow way, as if the message the director wants to convey needed to be absorbed slowly. You do not see what's coming next, because the main characters do not reveal their true intentions but vaguely. Maybe this is just my impression, but McQueen does not seem to shock his audience, but to make people reflect upon what they're seeing. That's why even some explicit sex scenes in this flick may not be so shocking- they are perfectly necessary in the context.I can pretty much identify myself with the Fassbender character on this one. Well, maybe I am not really on the same situation, but I'm a young man in his thirties who lives alone and has a strange relation with sex and with the world around him. I am not a sex-addict (luckily), but I can really understand why it is easier, in this world of ours, to become addicted to porn and to easy sex than to have a serious relationship with someone. In the end, what do we modern men want? What are we looking for? In Shame, the main character is depicted as a modern man who's quite successful- he has a good job and a nice apartment- but he fails at one of the most important aspects of life- he can't really relate to other people on an emotional level. He can't ""love"". So, the longest relationship he had in his life lasted only four months. It's easier for him to watch porn on the web and/or to pay a whore. However, his addiction becomes compromising in the sense that it permeates even his professional life: he fills even his office computer with pornography. That is, he probably watches porn even on work hours.The film has a slow pace, as I said before, and this adds to a promising climax that, unfortunately, does not come. That's why I give this movie an 8 instead of a 10. In the end, all that happens is that Brandon comes to the full realization that something is wrong. He becomes utterly despaired. You don't see how this would end, or what is the solution he finds, I mean, if he will seek the help he obviously needs. In this sense, the film is lacking, but also not judgemental. There are little clichés here, it's a crude reality which is depicted. I only got somewhat lost in the end, like this was a movie which is yet to be completed. I see that this director has made another movie similar to this one, maybe I'll have to check that out too, who knows, maybe this movie is part of a bigger picture I couldn't entirely grasp?All in all, I'm reviewing this title right now, and so I must consider it as a movie in its own merits. As I said, there is no judgement underlying the story here. Brandon is a sex addict, he lives a completely senseless life, and not only because he is not religious, but because it is clear his life does not satisfy him. See the difference: McQueen does not ""preach"" that Brandon's life is sinful: he SHOWS that it is senseless. Brandon can't fail to realize that sex can't be good enough to fulfill life. He wants to find something more, he tries, and the presence of his sister obviously makes him ponder a lot of things- there is a person of his own blood there beside him, someone he really cares about, because even tho he could, he does not abandon her to her own luck when she needs him, and this presence is as strong as the need he has of satisfying his never ending lust. Fassbender actually manages to demonstrate how such perceptions work on Brandon's character. In the beginning of the movie we see Brandon as plainly satisfied with his life. In the middle of the story, we see him even trying to date a girl (a coworker of his) and to understand his sister. By the end of the film, Brandon is a display of despair. I don't know what message we should extract from this movie. I only know that, if we don't ""get"" it, it's not because of Fassbender's lack of effort to get it across. Personally, I don't think a woman can relate to this movie the way a man can. There are some sex scenes which can be really disturbing to a woman, but which a man is generally used to see. There is no romance in this movie, no emotion, no sentimentality. It's crude as hell. Women tend to like movies where they can sympathize with the characters. Here there's little to sympathize with: the women depicted are shallow as hell, Brandon's sister included, and the ""hero"" (so to speak) is everything but likable. Now, lots of men in modern times can identify with Brandon, and not only because he is a loner. Sex addiction is not a rarity nowadays and there are countless of us who prefer the comfort of watching (all kinds of) porn at home, and even paying prostitutes to the risks of a serious relationship. That is: this movie is more likely to please men than women because it reflects a side of the masculine world, the male psyche, and even though it may seem quite obvious, women generally don't grasp such universe entirely.I truly recommend this movie, if only to see Fassbender's amazing performance as Brandon.",Shame

He has an equally damaged sister, played by Carey Mulligan. And that is the extent of what you learn about the principals in ""Shame."" And while anti-heroes can make intriguing leads, there needs to be some character development to make you want to watch these people for two hours. What's shocking about the climax of ""Shame"" isn't the characters actions, but the fact that as audience members we've long since given up caring about them.Director McQueen uses virtually no dialogue, instead relying on visuals and sound. So despite the subject matter, abundant nudity, occasional violence, it's all very clinical and detached. Viewers are to make their own minds up about the characters and if, in the end, Fassbender is starting to make a recovery. However, the film is shot is such a dystopian fashion, it's pretty clear how the filmmakers feel about him. Perhaps if the film was a documentary this lack of empathy and detachment would be powerful.

297,mickjo,"If you like talentless art, you'll love this",2,2 November 2014,"Well now. There's a class of ""art"" that some people who probably see themselves as sophisticated idolise. My favourite example was the famous (at least here in the UK) ""My bed"" by Tracey Emin. Said bed was her own: dirty and unmade, complete with used condoms and bloodied underwear. I watched on telly as it was extolled by the usual faux intellectuals, and could only roll my eyes and sigh.I've seen films about sad, hurt people obsessed by sex; and one or two of them are actually very good, such as ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"". But you see, films like that don't dispense with essentials like a decent script and some faint glimmer of the possibility of redemption; not to mention at least something to empathise with in the characters, even if they are badly flawed.However, we are granted no such saving graces with this film. We have no idea of the back story; have no idea why the central character is like he is, what's the deal with his sister, and frankly, don't care much anyway. Are we supposed to be titillated by the nudity, with the sight of Fassbender licking the rear end of a whore (one of a pair he's having a 3-way with)? Or screwing from behind, against the window of a hotel room in broad daylight, another naked whore? Or are we supposed to be disgusted by such scenes? Who the hell knows? And frankly, my dear, I didn't give a damn.The lowest score I can give is 1; I've given it 2 because the cinematography isn't that bad, and I suppose Fassbender did the best anyone could with the part.

And then after seeing it, I usually find myself shaking my head saying, ""that's it""? And completely DE-tracted. Not with this film. I wasn't so into the film because I found the character of Brandon so cold that there was no sympathy I had for him. Not even at the end in where he seems to have an epiphany with how perverse his life (or existence) has become. Brandon (played flawlessly to a T by Michael Fassbinder) is a sex-addict: so much sex surrounding him it becomes sick and perverted though he seems to be the only one who knows it for sure. But that doesn't stop him from getting on with his day. His day consists of smut around him that it seems quite commonplace to him. He has it on his virus-infested computer at work; on his lap-top at home; magazines; videos; there's no end to it. Only to have a chink in his proverbial armor, his day-to-day is affected by Carey Mulligan- who introduces herself unflinchingly nude for a shot that lasts over a minute in the bathroom (in the shower actually) as the uninvited, pesky, pixie-like and precocious little sister who comes to dinner. There is a cliché sibling rivalry between them with her being the free-spirited nomadic soul and him as the steely older brother. We see some character development evolve as his married boss fancies her after a chance meeting at a bar. I will not divulge any more of the story but despite Brandon's shortcomings, he is successful in how he conceals his addiction to friends and colleagues. Even has a tryst with a female co-worker in where we see the depths of his character exude a ""warmer"" side to him. And just as he seems to become emotionally intimate with her, he breaks away and goes right back into his comfort-zone of joyless sex. The ending established a resolution in where a theme recurs, yet he's not so much the predator he was in the beginning. But will he change and go back to his old self? We never know, and that is where the slightly ambiguous ending works in a film like this. This is not a kid's movie. Even though it's NC-17 and technically a seventeen-year-old can legally see it, it's geared more for a mature audience. The long, continuous shots were quite the tedium after once or twice (and have become cliché since Tarantino) and the story takes too much time to get going. The shots where Brandon looks into the camera vacuously could be trimmed down (since there's so many). And the scene in where Mulligan and Fassbinder meet and greet in the bathroom is on so many levels, but mostly it's weird and creepy. Both brother and sister seem to be comfortable naked in front of each other. But maybe THAT is a part they never explored (or if they did, it's a deleted scene on the upcoming DVD). But a story like this can be like a bottle of an exotic bottle of Cabernet: a bite to it, but then the more of it you drink, the more the bite numbs and disappears. And then you never drink it again.",Shame
299,Timtacular,"The #1 Review Nailed It, Here's Why",9,18 April 2012,"This film DOES take some thinking to enjoy. I found myself mulling what I'd seen in the previous scene well into the next scene, and multiple times throughout the movie. While this is not ""HE IS NOW (EMOTION)"" spray-painted on the wall for the audience, I can't think of a single scene in this film that would leave anyone with unanswered questions by its end, if anything, I thought McQueen tipped his cards a little farther than he maybe wanted to, simply for the sake of a broader enjoyment by audiences.This was one of the most technically well-made films I can remember seeing and appreciating all at one time (I just finished watching this). So, to repeat, if you like any subtlety at all in films, this one is worth watching just for its grace and grace done with lots of power. While I didn't find the premise particularly intriguing, I am so glad I decided to see this, I'm flabbergasted that anyone would drop this film in the shallow/underdeveloped category, these characters are neither question marks nor paragons of humanity, just people living like people would if cameras WEREN'T filming them (i.e. neither character needs to say what happened previously, cus you know, logically, they both were there and kiiiiinda remember it. /sarcasm towards IMDb trolls) Oh, and also, don't see this movie with your mother.",Shame
300,box_99,Most Overrated and Crap Story,3,10 October 2015,"The entire movie is about sex, in the plot they don't tell anything about that. Probably the most over-rated and senseless movie i have seen. The story basically revolves around a few people, all looking for sex. The acting however is fine because the main character, Michael is a pretty fine actor. There's a lot that could have been done with the story. For the rating i am very very disappointed. Perhaps the only good thing about this senseless, worthless movie is that it tells us about how disconnected we are even to our siblings. The main character is a villain of sorts because he couldn't be the guardian of her 1 and only sister. The movie should be rated as a blue film, because of the filthy scenes.",Shame
301,scottmontreal,"When the Irish do sex or politics, it's not about fun",9,15 January 2012,"I didn't like what Steve McQueen had to say about sex addiction in Shame, but I loved how he said it. I loved his previous film Hunger, on both accounts. British director McQueen is like a great musician - he gets in the groove and just stays there until the end. His groove is intensity and commitment to his mood and characters.Shame and Hunger are very brave, unflinching, and yes, extremely compelling - even as they are upsetting. What impressed me are the political themes of his two films are almost opposites.Hunger about the famous Irish Republican Army prisoner hunger strikes chilled me because it brought back intense memories from that time when we were campaigning and marching for the prisoners. Before our eyes, they sacrificed their lives. The IRA struggle was all about deep personal connection and solidarity to their community, their IRA, and their nation. The individual prisoners, including famous leader Bobby Sands, never wavered in their goal to have themselves recognized as political prisoners struggling for a Northern Ireland free of British colonialism. The most powerful moment of the film was when Bobby Sands argues with a visiting movement priest why they can't and wont call off the deadly hunger strikes.Shame is deliciously styled like an Italian opera that contrasts with a gritty story about Brandon, an unhappy Irish-American sex-addict, isolated inside New York City in every way, even from his sister. Brandon's multiple sex partners only reinforce his loneliness. Sex with a co-worker becomes traumatic when she succeeds in breaking through his emotional shield.McQueen impressively used classical music during the sex, and long takes during the dialogues, to knock down the cheesy stereotypes of most adult films. The acting and the editing are superb. Yet, for me, the script's lack of ideas failed the subject matter. It doesn't offer us much in the way of political or personal background as to why Brandon is sex-addicted and unable to have a deep interpersonal relationship, or why his intrusive sister is a love addict.The script even keeps Brandon isolated from the prevalence of sex addiction self-help groups and counselling in our society. So the psycho-addiction theme never transitioned - and in the end, we are only teased with the idea that Brandon maybe able to help himself.",Shame
302,thejamaicancritic,"Shame is a Masterpiece, but not for the sex",8,30 July 2014,"Shame is a masterpiece in its own right,but not for its daring debauchery in showing staggering amounts full frontal male nudity or even its depiction of sexual addiction(which was terrific by the way),but it is a masterpiece for so much more.While it is said that Shame is known for its depiction of sexual addiction,its Steven Mcqueen's gritty depiction of the lonely and isolated world of the thirty-something male,who lives alone, never settled down and battling inner-demons from his past, which is breath- taking and to put it simply ,sensational.Brandon(Fassbender) is a yuppie,who looks stable to the outside world.He has a job,an apartment,lives in a big city,know how to talk to women and is quite...well.. handsome.However,inside his apartment,he lives a carefully cultivated private life,which involves and pivots on a world of sex, masturbation and pornography. Initially,this all seems like just an indulgence in sexual lust and his own licentiousness,but it when his Sister Sissy(played endearingly by Mulligan) arrives unexpectedly,that the audience for the first time truly gets a look at who Brandon really is and finds out that there is probably more to his practices than simply pleasure-seeking.Sissy interrupts the world Brandon has carefully created and this is not good for Brandon.Not having the privacy to openly indulge in acts of sexual gratification,Brandon is forced out of his comfort Zone and is forced to tackle many of demons.In truth,it is sissy's arrival which makes the film happen.It is so,that we learn of Brandon's fear of intimacy,which is illustrated in his brief and complicated relationship with Marianne played by Nicole Beharie. At the same time,the audience is left to wonder the cause behind the strained relationship between him and Sissy.It is through the dialogue between the two,that we are given an insight into Brandon's mind. We learn of him not wanting to feel ""trapped"" by Sissy as well as of him ""having no nobody"".We also learn of Sissy's fear that if she leaves she will ""never see him again."" What is brilliant about this film is that Mcqueen reveals none of the sources behind Brandon's issues are what they truly are for that matter.The audience is left only to wonder and it is this which makes this film something special.We see snapshots of drug abuse and for the first time see Brandon in an out right state of psychological breakdown after being beaten outside a bar.It is here that we see an unstable individual ,a conflicted individual, as he walks staggeringly, wounded and seemingly deranged through the streets of New York.However,nothing can compare to when he physical breaks into tears and weeps heart wrenchingly.For the first time we realize the role of sex in his life and more importantly the role of addiction.It is what keeps him together. And it is Mcqueen's depiction of this, which makes Shame a masterpiece.",Shame
303,punisheroverlode,A work of astounding beauty on one of the most ugly and taboo topics in society.,9,11 November 2012,"Brandon Sullivan (Michael Fassbender) is a successful young urban professional in his thirties. On the surface he has it all – a well-paying job, a nice apartment – but beneath this veneer of normalcy he is struggling with sex addiction. When his estranged sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan), unexpectedly moves in with him, Brandon is forced to confront just how much of a toll this addiction has taken on him.Shame (a word that is literally derived from an older word meaning ""to cover up"") emphasizes nakedness and layers, physical and social. Brandon's appetite for sex is a secret to everyone except his sister and the numerous women he beds. He is so consumed by his desire that he becomes an alien to others and himself. There are definitely people around him who are similarly promiscuous but none are as dominated by lust as Brandon is. Sex is only a part of their lives but for him it is his life.It's not that Brandon is oblivious to the fact that he's addicted to sex. Like so many addicts, he is painfully aware of the damage his craving is doing to his professional and social life but he is just unable to resist them. He throws away his voluminous stash of pornography and his laptop but the next day he takes an attractive co-worker to a hotel to have sex with her. He stops in the middle of intercourse with her, realizing that he's crossed a line, only to bring a prostitute into that same bed minutes later. This is a man so in thrall of his lust that he has become his own personal voyeur, a captive passenger to his desires and the turbulent rides they lead him on.Shame wisely avoids making any sweeping moral statements about sex addiction and lets the cinematography, sound and acting speak for themselves. Indeed, the film gets more of its expressive power from what is implied instead of what is explicitly revealed.The cinematography in Shame beautifully captures this sense of alienation and emotional distance by rarely having the camera zoom in on the characters. It almost always stays at a voyeuristic distance from some odd, uncomfortable angle. Dialogue and sound are also cleverly manipulated. Brandon is a quiet, almost socially awkward man. Even when he does speak, there is so much more being expressed in his body language than his words. Around Sissy though, he becomes less reserved if only because he is lashing out at her. Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan give utterly heartbreaking and nuanced performances. They convey an incredible depth of emotion not just in dialogue but also in their body language – a sideways glance, a forced smile, a deep stare. When there is no dialogue, it is often music that fills the emptiness. And in these sounds, we get a better look into the deep melancholy and yearning in these characters that just can't be expressed in words.Shame is one of those few films that manage to communicate deep emotion with such artful minimalism and effortlessness. It's a beautiful experience made even more profound by the darkness and complexity of its subject matter. Shame is truly a rare cinematic gem.",Shame

There are not much words necessary to convey who Brandon wants to be and who he really is. I also love the advertisements in the subway train and station behind Brandon. They add subtle hints on what could be, on the world around him, the options and just the whole confusion in his mind. I just want to add one thing. What makes this story amazing is the actor. Fassbender adds a lot of sex appeal to the picture, the viewer could say, hey if I would look like that, if i had your life, I would be happy. His conflict would seem a daily occurrence for a chubby, unsuccessful guy who consumes porn and cant get a girl to love him so he uses prostitutes. A fit, interesting, cultured person like Brandon portrayed by Fassbender makes this struggle so much more tragic because it is obvious he could lead a very different life if he could overcome whatever happened to make him this distanced. I am sure many ladies would gladly put up with his sex addiction, him looking like that...",Shame
306,GrungeFan1996,"Interesting, well acted, beautifully shot, but overall feels empty.",7,17 March 2017,"Shame is one of two Steve McQueen films I've seen, the other being Hunger. I thoroughly enjoyed Hunger, so I decided to check out Shame. Shame is about a 30- something year old man named Brandon (Michael Fassbender) who is a sex addict, he calls up prostitutes, and watches porn all the time, even on his work computer. His sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) comes to live with him for a while for she has no other place to live. Brandon and Sissy have a very contentious relationship, they don't get along too well and end up arguing all the time. There's not much in terms of a story, but that is the point of the film, this film is supposed to show the life of a sex addict and it does a pretty good job at it. The acting is very good, everyone delivers a strong performance, and the cinematography is excellent, the film itself looks absolutely gorgeous. Although the acting, dialogue, and cinematography are excellent, the movie just feels empty, when it ended, I was left wanting more, it felt like there was just something missing. I'm recommending Shame because it has great acting, great dialogue, and great cinematography, but the film overall feels empty and left me wanting more. 7/10.",Shame

308,natebouchard,A Trite Look at Sex Addiction,2,19 June 2013,"I won't presume to know what it is like to be a sex addict. I've battled addiction but never had it truly take over my life. It's a compelling subject, especially because addiction is a very natural extension of a lot of the qualities (some not even regarded as negative) which every human being possesses. So this movie intrigued me, especially given its name. ""Shame"" seems to hit the nail on the head when it comes to putting a single word to addiction. Arguably more significant than the physical, emotional or psychological needs that always get the spotlight in addiction stories is the shame. That dissonance between what we ought to do and what we choose to do is universal.Sadly this movie is not about that. It's not really about much to be honest. To make a movie about an addict requires fleshing that addiction out and fleshing the character out. Things need to escalate, to get out of control. We don't really get that. We get a few scenes that shocked some Guardian readers into saying it's a masterpiece. And while there are explicit scenes, they never convey that Brandon is going down a truly dangerous path. If this movie was about overeating, the progression of addiction would go from Brandon eating pizza every night to having cake a couple times as well. Then he'd blow off a friend and hit the Burger King for the big finale. It's just not much of an escalation and despite Fassbender's best attempt to look distraught or anxious (which happens a lot), we don't really get to know what the guy is thinking or feeling.We get long lingering shots,scenes that go on forever and a lot of quiet moments but nothing fills that silence. It's just empty. And when we get actual reactions from Brandon to his circumstances, they're abrupt and somewhat absurd. I think he did his best with a poor/vague script but Shame is clearly written and directed by a guy who doesn't understand the subject matter.The end result is shallow, deeply lacking emotion and altogether a terrible disservice to what could have been a truly fantastic concept. I can't wait until a script writer sees this and, so compelled by how good this could of been and yet how bad it is, decides to write what Shame should have been.",Shame
309,alexandros-15,Wonderful!,9,28 January 2012,"What a wonderful movie! First, Shame reminds us that cinema is about acting. Michael Fassbender gave one of the best acting performances in movies for a long time.Second, the movie was captivating. Steve McQueen from the very first moment of the movie plunged us into a virtual world of intense solitude with the sound and the music acting as a membrane separating Fassbender from the society and the rest of us.Third, this was a fascinating story of social self-isolation, fear of engagement and human solitude at its extreme. His sister, the also wonderful Carey Mulligan, was the last bastion of resistance who also took it to extremes at the end in a desperate effort to fracture his bubble.Finally, while the story is about sex obsession the movie is really about the role of any addiction/obsession (I guess gambling, electronic games, even being a workaholic) in leading humans to self-isolation and societies to perilous fragmentation and deconstruction.Carey Mulligan's performance of New York New York was mesmerising. It also reminded us in our times of fast gratification that long scenes are wonderful.Bravo!",Shame

311,teknozen,the ultimate 100 minute cinematic buzz-kill,5,25 May 2012,"Shame is THE definitive sexual addiction movie. The media gush around Michael Fassbinder's incarnation of a sex addict is, for once, accurate and his performance one of the more brilliant we've seen lately. While Carey Mulligan struggles extravagantly to hold her own as his pathologically messed up wannabe singer sister, the picture remains Michael Fassbinder's from first frame to last. Sexual addiction is an inability to find satisfaction, those few moments of post-orgasmic repose that allow—however briefly—a fleeting balm of peace within ourselves and a truce with the world to settle around us and—just for right now—for everything to be o.k. Therein lies the problem. Shame perfectly captures the relentless, desperate yearning for a mere breath or two of minuscule relief, the micro-timeout, that never, ever arrives. Godot has already come and long since blown this scene.Perhaps in your life, you've not yet had to ponder the hell realm of sexual—or of any flavor, for that matter—addiction. If so, this could be fascinating unknown territory to explore. But if you've ever tasted utter despair, there's really no need to submerge yourself in a 100 minute cinematic buzz-kill that goes absolutely nowhere, never mind how cunningly rendered by British film and video artist Steve McQueen. There is likewise a surfeit of neo-noir New York streets punctuated with the gritty angst of lost subway lust. The textures are as authentic as they come. Right. All that nudity. Should the titillation of semi-soft-core full frontal attract, this is not the place for gratification. Sure, there's plenty of skin, and the bodies are all nice enough, but it's 180° opposite from a turn-on. Unless, say, you are the sort who gets off on a cinéma veritié shot of a buck naked Fassbinder's backside as he pisses into his own toilet without bothering to raise the seat (Yes, his sister is staying in his apartment at the time. Passive-aggressive? You think?), then jiggles the post-penal drip from his dangling dick. A telling moment, definitely, but nothing I personally care to contemplate, given my mental state after macerating my mind in those 100 minutes of Shame.",Shame
312,blythyboy,A film of sexual obsession. Is it taken seriously?,9,22 July 2012,"When I first read the synopsis for Shame I was a little unsure. It's a very unique idea to follow and could definitely have gone well or gone extremely bad. However when I found out Michael Fassbender was involved I started to be won over by it. Fassbender seems to turn all of his films to gold with his excellent ability in front of the camera and has a piercing look about him that can really make you uneasy.I must admit that I heard of Steve McQueen (the director) because my Dad recommended I watch Hunger but I never got round to it. So this is my first experience with McQueen and I heard about how much of an artist he is when it comes to striking imagery and alternative camera-work. So Shame follows a successful businessman, has a great job and a lifestyle that embodies the heart of everything that is New York. However deep down he hides a very serious obsession with sex and the film shows how serious his state of mind is when it comes to watching pornography, obsessively staring at women in the street or at work and masturbating. It all sounds like a good time for the viewer as you think you are going to sit down to 100 minutes of naked women and gratuitous sex, you couldn't be more wrong.Shame portrays the terrible burden his obsession has become, it strongly follows a man whose life is starting to unravel because of it. It's actually a very difficult role to fill as it does involve a lot of sex but not in a way that would be erotic in any sense. Michael Fassbender has done a wonderful job of this, he has been able to overcome the on screen humiliation his character must go through by portraying these sexual acts but also show how shameful he feels after it's all said and done. Reason why the title works well. Fassbender couldn't have completed the film on his own, however. Cary Mulligan plays his younger sister, a character that seems to be the polar opposite of Fassbender's from the outside. I saw her in Drive where she played a humble character who could be liked by everyone. This role is certainly different from that as she has to play someone who is very outgoing and bursting with energy but hides a damaged past with family and ex-boyfriends. Mulligan shows off her amazing talents by singing a slowed down version of Frank Sinatra's New York New York. The camera followed Mulligan, Fassbender and James Badge Dale who plays his boss in real time to capture genuine reactions to her singing ability. The scene is by far the most wonderful part of the film and had me completely drawn in, an affect that I rarely come across.  As she continues to live with her brother, his way of life seems intruded upon which results in his condition getting worse. This is all made more disturbing by McQueen's art direction, using strong blue and red lighting and the added element of a haunting soundtrack. It's nice to know that the subject matter has been taken very seriously and in no way does it glorify or sexualise his condition.I was pleasantly surprised by how well the additional character played out, New York. The city seemed to be such an important artistic feature of the film and for someone who has never visited New York, it seemed to reveal its wonderful glamour and dreamful lifestyle but also show its darker regions. By shooting most of the film at night, it did well to bring out the harsh lighting and 'city that never sleeps' attitude that we have all come to know and love.I loved Shame. I thought the plot was structured very well and was able to show the rest of the world that these unfortunate obsessions exist and it did it without any risk of being offensive to the real life victims of sexual obsessiveness. The performances by the two lead actors were outstanding and should be congratulated on creating such a genuine chemistry that you pray for their happiness when the credits roll. Steve McQueen has directed a wonderful film and I look forward to his future projects.",Shame

At least made him into an American Gigilo - not just a man wanting to screw his sister. I cant imagine them spending a lot to film this - and the annoying piano music through was grating.

In the end, it seems that he has figured out what he needs after almost lost his sister, everything backs to normal, then there was an open ending that the director wants to leave to us to judge what he would do in front of the temptation after experiencing such struggles earlier.In my understanding, what the film wants to discuss is the life of businessmen living in the metropolis.

Yep we get to see the magnificent Fassbender's bits, all of them, nicely toned & shaped. Here is a Yuppie who knows how to look after himself. Mulligan on the other hand display's her 'bits' (sans bas) and as nice as they are and confirms my belief that Mulligan is as attractive without her clothes as she is with. However as a night club singer and not a Yuppie, presumably this accounts for the non-worked out female body? Next lets deal with the incest. OK at the start we see that the two main lead characters are happy with the nudity that each displays to the other. Moreover, the one of two redeeming point of the film is the later section were Sissy (Mulligans role) slips into bed with Brandon (Fassbender) complaining 'she's cold' is dealt with with some acumen, as it gets the message over yes they have been lovers but not for this film, thank you. After that...? nothing, sans, zilch, nada. This is a film about addiction, it doesn't show as is claimed frequently a sex junky trying to rid his demons nor is he phased by his ever widening need for different sex. Brandon is as happy at home with his needs as mom is making the apple pie for Sunday lunch. He doesn't need a way out as it doesn't affect him. He has a great job, his boss loves him (and get to bed his sister within 20mins of meeting her) he is well paid, he dates as and when he wants to he's got a great flat with a luxury address and he enjoys the internet and all its perversions as and when he wants to. Nothing about this person says anything about its time to seek the slippers settle down and breed his 2.5 of the world population. Without Sissy however the film would have crashed and burnt long before its 2 and a bit hour length. Herein lies the second redeeming feature, I liked Mulligan's Sissy. She plays a washed out nightclub girl looking for something to settle down with, somebody who will protect her as a father figure, maybe. In fact her father's figure in Junior (Brandon), having clearly sorted out in her mind that Brandon's butt between her sheets 7 nights a week was just what she was looking for and if that meant substituting sibling bonding for playing Mums and Dads, well that wasn't going to matter one little bit. After all its all family fun at the end of the day. Made all the more realistic as she took on the role of Alex Forrest, MkII. I did think as I left the film, that if Brandon had climbed onto Sissy's hospital bed with the intention of 'nursing her needs', that might have given the whole thing some credence All in all, not something that will have me rushing to the video store when its out for rental, and left me kinda wishing that I'd of stayed at home and caught up on my backlog of TV programs on the TIVO box",Shame

Sure, Fassbender's nut-sack was an inspiring spectacle as it contracted during a morning pisss, as was the amount of excessive fat above Mulligan's tree line, or rain forest, if you will.

Given the various comments from critiques, including words like ""brilliant"" and ""stunning"", we thought we were in for a treat.We were sorely disappointed. The script for this movie cannot more than 20 pages long. There are long segments the film without any dialog at all. You don't learn anything deep or meaningful about the characters, and never get to the point of caring about them in any way. Possibly this lack of intimacy we feel for the characters is Steve McQueen's way of reminding us how forgettable anonymous sex is. If this was his goal, he was successful. In one years time I will have completely forgotten about this movie. I'm astonished at the rave reviews and can only imagine its a case of the Emperor with no Clothes.Steve McQueen missed an opportunity to teach something about sexual addition. This film does nothing of the kind.What a shame.",Shame
322,socklessmenace,Fassbender & McQueen rise above,7,19 July 2013,"I saw this film for two reasons: Michael Fassbender, and Steve McQueen. So I'll start my review with them.Michael Fassbender- A towering performance, completely expected. Fassbender is a master of depth and range and is one of the best actors working today. Every role he submerges himself in is vastly different from the last, from his role in Tarantino's ""Inglourious Basterds"" to his portrayal of Magneto in ""X-Men: First Class"", few could fill the shoes (or should I say helmet) of the great Ian McKellen. The case is no different here. For an hour and forty minutes we completely believe Fassbender as a sex addict riddled with shame and regret. I can see why McQueen has decided to use Fassbender in his films so frequently, few actors can generate such gravity. Fassbender goes to dark and humiliating places and tugs us every inch of the way. One of his best performances and one of the best performances of the year (he was robbed of a best actor nomination).Steve McQueen- A fantastic introduction to this master director, however, I have unfair mixed feelings. Starting with the good, McQueen is a true art film director; every shot could've been a painting. He brought beauty onto tragic subject matter. As dark as the film got, McQueen's visuals stayed consistently entrancing. That being said, I went into this film having heard numerous reviews of McQueen jarring the audience with shocking visuals, going further and deeper than other directors would dare to go. Frankly, not once did I find McQueen making me feel uncomfortable, shocked, or bothered in any way. Like I said I found quite the opposite, I found he brought beauty. Rather than creating a sense of anxiety I felt he brought simple understanding. Don't get me wrong, he dealt with every scene with truth and honesty, and he was certainly compelling, but not uncomfortably compelling in the way I was expecting from hearing other reviews. He was no Scorsese, or Fincher, or Darren Aronofsky. Clearly people who found this film hard to watch never saw ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Requiem for a Dream"". However, this doesn't discredit McQueen at all. What he has in common with these filmmakers was his ability to tackle dark subject matter and find the truth in it and bring it out in an honest way, stylistically is where they differ. Where my mixed feelings come in is that, unfairly to McQueen, I went into the film with expectations of him to deal with the subject matter in a stylistic way more similar to Scorsese, Fincher, or Aronofsky. I was ready to be taken on a roller coaster, and what I got was a ferris wheel: excellent visuals, but not as much thrill. That being said, I was highly impressed with McQueen as a director and having seen this film makes me want to see ""Hunger"" and heightens my anticipation for ""12 years a Slave"". He is a true visionary and a talent to watch in the coming years.Carey Mulligan- Everyone seems to love this actress. When I think of Mulligan two other actresses come to mind, Michelle Williams and Hermione...I mean Emma Watson (don't know why). Unfortunately for Mulligan she is my least favourite of these three; where she differs from them is her range. Unlike Fassbender I find Mulligan has little range, or at least hasn't gotten the chance to show it. I loved her in ""Drive"" as the troubled girl, living a troubled life, surrounded by troubled people...then I saw her play that role again in 'The Great Gatsby"" and now again here. I'm not saying these characters are all exactly the same, I'm saying I found she played them all too similar for my liking. I'd say the only performance I've seen her do which isn't completely similar to these is her performance in ""An Education""...but I didn't particularly enjoy her performance in that... and it still had that troubled reminisce she mirrors in these other roles. So although I wouldn't call her a bad actress, I will say that she didn't wow me in this, and I just found I was watching Carey Mulligan instead of her character, because I've seen her play this role two times too many. Where Fassbender brought me in, she brought me out.The Script- Written by Abi Morgan and Steve McQueen I thought the dialogue was fantastically natural and the dynamics of the characters were well developed. The story, however, failed to impress me and I would even say almost reached disappointment. I just couldn't help but feel I've seen this story before, it was far too predictable. I found myself waiting for things to happen...and then they did. I had far higher hopes and I really wanted something fresh and new, but this film didn't give me that. The story didn't stick with me once the end credits hit. I just felt like I saw another tragic character study that I've seen ten times before. This is where the film lost its stars most for me.What did stick with me and what saved this film was exactly what I went into it for, Fassbender and McQueen. Fassbender took a traditional flawed character and made him compelling, at times overwhelmingly. McQueen took a cookie-cutter story and added style and mesmerizing visuals. They make this film worth watching. To read the script I probably would've struggled to keep my eyes open and read on; To watch the film I would've had to struggle to look away.",Shame
323,pannuage9,A Biography of Tiger Woods,1,25 April 2012,"After watching this movie, I suddenly realised that this movie was made and tailored after only one person, Tiger Woods. Simply put, it's all that this movie seems to be about, someone's porno-sexual-prostitute addiction. Nothing more. It follows a sex-crazed person around through out the film shadowing his obsession against the stark background of NYC.I guess now, a full monty on male characters is becoming the norm, as this film doles out at least 2 scenes for the viewer (Yaaaawwwn!). It's been done before in Cronenberg's Eastern Promises & others. No need to beat a dead dog more than one needs to, especially when they looped the scene twice.One scene puzzled me...the main character hurries into a workplace lavatory to masturbate during working hours. Okay we get the point, he'll hump a fire hydrant or any inanimate object; but my question is why does he wipe down the toilet seat prior to him spracking all over the place? Complete lunacy!This movie would be a good promotional platform for Viagra or Exstenz. Any film student could have pulled off a stunt like this.",Shame
324,hoganshort,"Raw, Real, Really Great",9,28 November 2011,"Shame is a movie about a New York man, Brandon, (the amazing and underrated Michael Fassbender) trying to live a normal life while keeping his sex life in control. Things become more difficult when Brandon's sister (the great, busy, and beautiful Carey Mulligan) shows up and he is not sure how to fit her in and deal with her in his life during this problem. Shame talks about sex and addiction and how it affects us and the one's we love. Sex addiction is a new subject and a timely one. It is a disorder that is only now being recognized and talked about and this film will only fuel the conversation. Is it really an addiction or the way of man? Is it really a quest for sex or is it the need for need itself? Is sex an emotional weapon, anchor, saviour, or can it be used for all. Are multiple sexual partners completely void of all love or is it the search for it? All of these questions asked and all themes in Shame.Sex is always a tricky subject even in conversation because it is so subjective. What is something to one person may not be to another, or right and wrong. Shame knows exactly what it is hits the mark beautifully. Mcqueen and Fassbender again make a perfect team, one knowing what he wants to make and the other having the means to transfer that vision. The sex is full frontal, in your face, sometimes passionate and sometimes void of love but it is never gratuitous. It is real.I believe this movie is so great because of the team and cast putting it together. Any subject can be attempted and I am happy this particular movie and subject matter has the crew that it does. Shame is raw and beautifully artistic without being pretentious. Steve McQueen is the director of Shame and he has only ever had one other directing gig. That movie was Hunger from 2008. Michael Fassbender was also the star in this movie. It was an incredibly powerful movie and an incredible power performance. Steve Mcqueen was a first time director who instantly found his voice in Hunger. The movie shows the IRA in the famous Maze prison and the horrific mistreatment of its prisoners. The movie is elegant, beautiful, touching, sad, and draws you in completely while it is simultaneously gruesome, disgusting, filthy, and horrific. The movie shows the awful things done to them and the disgusting ways they protested until the final half of the film which results in a hunger strike. The movie is completely character driven, yet at the same time has such a artful and passionate voice it becomes more than the characters themselves. Michael Fassbender had one of the best performances of his career, the year, and all time. He had to lose unhealthy amounts of weight for the film. Fass had to show the pain and belief in what he was doing for long scenes without talking, and also had to know enormously lengthy scenes in a different accent. There is a scene with Fass and a priest where they talk as friends about the planned hunger strike. It is about twelve minutes long. A 12 minute long scene with no cut ( if they made a mistake you would have to restart the entire scene) and constant dialogue full of wit and difficult prose. It is the most impressive scenes I have ever seen in a movie. The Academy Awards left Hunger, Mcqueen, and Fassbender unfairly out of the Oscar race. There has been Oscar buzz humming around Shame and I am hoping the Academy doesn't drop the golden statue on this one.Directors who write and direct their movies have a certain style. You can always know their work because they write in their own way and direct whatever they imagine. Directors like Tarantino (Pulp Fiction), the Coen Brothers (Fargo), and Ritchie (RocknRolla) have a noticeable fashion to their movies. A person could identify one of their movies by watching it without seeing the credits or knowing beforehand. There are certain directors who are amazing and can find a style when they don't write the screenplay, something I myself find just as impressive as writing themselves. Spielberg (Munich), Fincher (The Social Network), Mann (Collateral, and Scorsese (Taxi Driver) are all directors in my mind that have their own recognizable style in all movies. They are able to find a voice regardless of who wrote it and when. Steve Mcqueen I believe is a director who does both. He has co written both Hunger and Shame with different writing partners. Mcqueen has scripts written and he helps to work on it with them to find the best way to get his voice across. Stevey wants a hand in the screenplay and the other writers trust him even with a lack of proved experience.For other reviews and thoughts visit rollginreviews.blogspot.com",Shame
325,Tyler-Raine,Brutalizing Film with Outstanding Performances,9,16 January 2012,"This is obviously very, very adult in theme. The tone throughout is brooding and cold, and the title of the film encapsulates the entire running time of the film. The score is haunting and really helped to craft the mood. Everything you've heard about Michael Fassbender is true (everything). He is a quiet powerhouse, but I also think Carey Mulligan deserves a lot of praise for her work here too. As Brandon's sister, she's like his ying and yang. Where he expresses nothing, she feels everything, and of course this was very deliberate. I really enjoyed their brother-sister dynamic. One of the most powerful scenes in the movie is a 3+ minute shot of her performing ""New York, New York""- which is telling, because I found New York City, and the complexities of living in a city like this, to be a running theme of the film itself.Steve McQueen takes the depressing issues of this film and brutalizes the viewer with it- very quickly, the sex scenes lose any appeal they might have had due to the excessive, depraved, and mechanical nature of it all. And I liked that by the end of the film, I really didn't feel like anyone was preaching to me. There's no how or why explaining his behavior. Brandon doesn't reach some grand revelation, he doesn't change or even really try all that hard, he just lets you into his sad world for a few weeks and then you move on. This film epitomizes loneliness. I don't think it was totally perfect- sometimes, despite succeeding in holding its grim tone without becoming a complete screeching, over the top melodrama- it occasionally fell into clichés (particularly concerning Mulligan's character, and one scene in the rain that I rolled my eyes at). But I do think it's one of the best movies of the year, even though, I probably don't ever need to see it again.8.5/10",Shame
326,kiosilveira,An empty space,9,21 June 2017,"In Shame (2011) the core of the plot is the life of Brandon (Fassbender), and his addiction to sex and pornography. It would be easy to explore this film with controversial and explicit scenes, but Steve focuses on showing the emotions, the loneliness and the details of this existential emptiness that is present in the protagonist's life, this emotional chaos extends with an indefinite time visit of his sister. Which also seems destined for self-destruction. With another magnificent performance from Fassbender, it's a powerful, intense and yet another beautiful work by Steve McQueen.",Shame
327,stuartbunce,emperor's new clothes,2,16 May 2012,"Meretricious is not a word I use very often but it is the perfect description for this film which like many other indie art-house movies based on similar themes of urban alienation/sexual obsession/existential crises etc are really mildly titillating soft porn dressed up (or not as the case may be) as intimate and hard hitting character driven,profound and 'provocative' film making - which this is definitely NOT. Just another film which exploits a sexually provocative subject matter and uses it as a reason to 'explore' the theme with lots of shagging scenes and justifies all this with a tenuously strung together plot which tries to insinuate profounder levels of meaning and emotional truth which are in fact non existent.The actors try their best to convey this deeper meaningfulness and the director fancies himself as Antonioni I imagine but he's not, and of all the Steve McQueens I know of i think he is the less talented one, and I know two - one the iconic movie star and the other one works in my local Cafe Nero and does spectacularly good smoothies.",Shame
328,k-howitt99,A piece of art,10,11 October 2014,"Steve McQueen gives us only his second feature film and what a masterpiece it is, this film is not necessarily meant to be enjoyed but it is more effective this way. Brandon (Michael Fassbender) lives in a nice New York apartment and has a stable and what seems like a well paid job but he is hiding his sexual life, which is picking his life apart. His life is turned upside down by his sister, sissy (Carey mulligan) who has problems of her own. their taught relationship comes crashing down during the course of the film. This film is beautifully made, McQueen directs this extremely well, he gets great performances from both Fassbender and Mulligan. Brandon who has clear issues with committing to a relationship, struggles with his relationship with a co-worker, his pain with his sexual life is subtely portrayed by Fassbender. On the opposite side sissy has no boundaries what so ever, mulligan shows us her vulnerability issues perfectly. The relationship is doomed from the start of the film. McQueen allows the two actors two work around the camera which gives them both freedom, Sean bobbit the cinematographer also does a great job by providing a real life feel through the camera. The sex scenes are shot with no eroticism but brutality.Overall this film is an great piece of filmaking, this is not the feel good film of the year but it shows you not only the medical side of a sexual addiction but also a believable human story. Much recommended, a great watch.",Shame
329,kmg-thats-me,One of Fassbender's best for sure!,10,2 January 2017,"This film is a work of art, don't listen to small minded people saying it is boring...it just goes to show you these people are obviously only interested in Hollywood blockbusters full of action and have little or no interest in small budget classics. The film is dark and gritty, and doesn't sugar coat anything. It's very honest with real convincing dialogue with performances to match. One of Fassbender's best for sure and the fact we get to see him naked is just a bonus. Anyone who has seen Hunger (the last Mcqueen/Fassbender collaboration) will have seen Michael's commitment and dedication to his roles and this is no different. If you liked Hunger you are sure to like this too. One of a kind for sure. Well done to Michael Fassbender he picks his roles wisely.",Shame

Yes I have seen Mr McQueen 's movies and a lot of his art from the UK before he was remotely famous. I thought 'Hunger' was a promising effort, although I was ashamed when at an NY screening with the director, he had no idea what UVF meant (it is a film about Irish paramilitaries...) He obviously did not care. Embarrassing. I have no idea why serious artists wish to make mid level (at best) movies. These are not pearls from Tarkovsky or Bresson or Ophuls, or even Altman. They are distinctly average. And this one is worse than that - it is simply BOGUS",Shame
334,eugeneusher,Beautiful and shoking.,9,14 May 2021,"Steve McQueen's drama Shame is a very unusual piece of art. It explores unspoken aspects of our society, which everyone knows about but pretends not to notice. It is like this elephant in the room. It is daring, shocking and raw.The world is full of traumatized people and everyone deals with his traumas in his own way and these ways range a lot. This film explores the topic of damaged people and their coping mechanisms. The main character Brandon, played by Michael Fassbender, is a generally unhappy man deeply hurt by something that happened in his past and forced to search for his own special sort of relief.But the movie being called Shame is not an accident. Shame has its sublte role, it drives and pushes the main character and underlies his whole identity.One of the most beautiful traits that Steve McQueen put into this movie is the subtleness and vagueness of its ideas. The story never explicitly tells or explains what has happened and what is happening. It conveys and expresses the narrative through the picture and emotions of the characters, their facial expressions and the soundtrack and leaves it open for the viewer's perception and interpretation. It is a genius manner of telling a story, because the image it creates is individual for every viewer and highly depends on their own personality and their view on the subject.The film has left me with a unique and controversial afterfeel and made me question the very basis of my existence. I recommend this elegant masterpiece to everyone who looks for uncommon and new feelings and unconventional cinematography.",Shame
335,bronweis,Interesting psychological study,9,17 November 2011,"My biggest concern prior to viewing the film was that the subject matter would be unfairly treated; i.e., that it could be a glorification of a serious mental illness/ addiction. After all, Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan are becoming sex symbols or should I say Dreamy McFassbender.I'm relieved to see the subject matter was, indeed, treated with extreme delicacy. Though it is, technically speaking, quite graphic however, it is merely the medium for the message; important not to let it cloud a psychological understudy of two severely damaged perhaps ""confused"" individuals.Given that Fassbender is such a rising star and such a (IMHO) serious thespian, one does worry if he will be overly remembered for this role in the public eye. I don't think this will bear out, however, because of the NC-17 rating.Rather, I am more concerned that the film won't get its due. That due is: serious consideration, required reading on all things psych, all things Fassbendy, and all things emotional turmoil -internal struggle. Well played. Relevant to modern dating and relationships: re-defined.The movie is in fact serious and thoughtful, well acted, and thank goodness and thank you. For a great film.",Shame
336,annjanbay,Not to be missed,9,30 January 2012,"Amazing acting, well not acting really as you would forget that your watching a movie, it does drag you into the character's mind. Portrayal of a human act towards an addiction that is fatal. Watching every move,look,action and reaction constantly is exhausting. You can feel the endless struggle that goes on within the human mind while trying to maintain a neutral appearance. Some of the reviews are not fair, as they show how many of us insist on living in denial, the perfect world. The characters were so realistic and honest. Not much dialogue is heard but a lot is felt. This can simply be a true story from our every day life, the way the character deal with his shame and goes out of control at times is a real human act towards any addiction that may be cure less in his own mind.Great acting, a unique master piece that portrays the reality of an addicted human without any restrictions.",Shame

Lets cut through the posing and the pretense. It does'nt have a message, but its an excuse to have a lot of nudity and simulated sex, so what? Does this show it in a more meaningful-or less meaningful way?

339,rosiebenn3,"A weird, strange, but somewhat a interesting film",4,25 June 2012,"Hmm it is hard to find where to start with this film. I first heard of this film through a Film magazine or something else and thought I might give it a go seeing as Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan was starring in it. I found the film very strange but interesting at the same time. How often do you guys see a film about a personal life of a sex addict?! I normally like films that are quite slow and how we, the audience, can see their emotions through close up shots. But I found some shots lingered on for too long in my opinion and I was just eager to see something big happen. It did in the end where SPOILER: Brandon found Sissy in the bathroom with blood everywhere. I thought this was a very clever scene as we saw him after his flashbacks in the train, realising what could happen to Sissy. We shared the same emotions as him and was eager to find out what happened. At first I thought the body in the trains was her but she was in the bathroom and somehow survived which I thought was a little silly. I liked the dramatic ending and normally, I don't like characters dying but I thought it would be a real edge, making him wake up from his sexual addiction and get over it. Besides, how can she live after all that blood on the floor?! On this note, I liked the colour contrast between the white walls and floor against the pure red blood. This made it look more dramatic and horrifying.As for the sexual scenes- I was okay watching them but that was because I was by myself but I strongly recommend you do not watch with a family member especially your parents! Even with a friend would be a bit awkward! As for the insect angle to the film, I kind of agree with both sides. Some say that they feel that the siblings were kind of too open about their bodies and they were quite close e.g. they see each other naked and don't react, the sister wears a questionable shirt with her nipples sticking out clearly in the morning, she tried to sleep right next to Brandon in bed, she didn't seem that bothered about catching her brother in the act touching himself but thought it was slightly funny. Maybe we were brought up in a society that taught us not to be so close to our siblings like that which made us feel awkward when we watched it. I truthfully felt a little uncomfortable and actually thought they were going to have sex later on knowing how out of control Brandon's sex life was getting. Thankfully they didn't. However, other people argue that they were just close as they didn't have anyone else so they were just comfortable with each other and their bodies. Some believe they were abused or sexually abused as children which made them this close now. But who knows? Overall, I thought the acting was brilliant from both stars and loved how serious and real they looked. But I felt really uncomfortable watching them being physically and maybe a bit sexually abusing each other. The whole film was rather strange but it is worth a watch.All the way through the film I thought, how awkward Michael Fassbender must be feeling when filming that particular scene?!",Shame

And that is all i'm gonna say about about the plot of the film because that's all I knew going in and that's all you should know going in.Because this film is one of the best films of all time, every shot has a purpose, every mannerism has a purpose and that's what I love about Steve McQueen, his movies aren't just a revenue stream for him their clearly his passion. McQueen had previously been an artist and it fundamentally shows in this movie, this film isn't just a piece of entertainment to pass the time on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but an experience, that's right this is an experience. This movie isn't for everyone though, if you don't like sexual themes or scenes in your films then this maybe one to steer clear from, let me just say it earns its 18+ rating.But for everyone else this is one to look out for. Do not let this one pass you by i'm telling you this is a piece of art en-captured in film.I could go on and on about this film but to sum it all up, best performance Michael Fassbender has ever delivered by far, (but since its NC-17 he got snubbed for best actor of course). Masterful directing by visionary Steve McQueen and excellent score by Harry Escott.Don't let the content of the film turn you off, this is every bit as artful as 2001 a space odyssey, they just express it differently.",Shame

It is a harsh, sad and sometimes emotional brutal movie and it will make you feel awkward while watching it. THAT'S what happens when you just let the canera run to watch how an addict goes about his daily business. .
The movie is not offering a solution leading to a happy end it is more watching a a functional addict with an office job how he at first copes seemingly well with his life. When his also damaged sister arrives, everything starts getting more and more cracks.It is a masterpiece of a movie about the rooot causes of addiction: surpression of feelings/trauma acted out brilliantly. The study of the main character and the chraracter of his sister Sissy is pure gold and 100% spot on. The dynamic of their relationship is perfectly captured, which makes it hard to watch.But let me clear one thing: I never felt that the movie is beeing hopeless for the sake of beeing hopeless. Development is happening between brother and sister. Just more realistically how change between two people from a dysfunctional family would happen. And not this ""booom we won the lottery all our problems are gone let's party all night on an caribbean island"" way.What the movie plays with brilliantly is the interconnections of the main ingredients of sex addiction: shame, rage, loneliness, Trauma and deep emotional pain, beeing the cool guy on the surface but having huge walls, avoiding intimacy, mechanical and dull repetitions combined with some form of discipline to create a function al mask.I think If you like intense psychological case studies right out of the clinic you will love the movie. Or if you come from a rough childhood, have a case in your family or have a professional or some other connection to the topic of childhood trauma/dysfunctional family it is for you too.Only thing i would change is the title, it is about shame but even more about a Mask and Pain.",Shame
346,anthonyhowells,In Three Words; Intense - Operatic - Ambitious,7,23 September 2014,"Brandon enjoys nothing more than being out looking for his next meaningless one night stand. Whether that is with a girl he picks up in a bar or a prostitute he doesn't care. He is addicted to internet porn and appears to have little interest in dealing with his problems. Perhaps he doesn't see his situation as a problem? However, Brandon is unable to bring his conquests to his apartment as he has an unexpected guest in the form of his sister Sissy. They clearly have a difficult relationship, not seeing one another for months or perhaps longer at a time. When Sissy appears unannounced it appears she is going through a break up and is finding rejection difficult. The dynamics between Brandon and Sissy are intense and they have clearly been through difficult times in the past however McQueen leaves us guessing at what may have occurred. We are not privy to the back story and this leaves many questions unanswered.Brandon's addiction spills over into his working life after his works PC picks up a virus and the companies IT department decide to take a closer look. He is later informed by his arrogant married boss David (James Badge Dale) that his hard driver is 'dirty'. However, this does not lead to a dismissal. David is more interested in when they will be going on their next night out to pick up women.Indeed it is on that next night out when David meets the overly flirty Sissy. In a beautiful scene in an upmarket bar Sissy sings a wonderfully slow version of New York, New York. McQueen is in no hurry to move the scene forward and a lesser director would never have let a scene develop like this. This is repeated throughout the film. After Sissy goes back to Brendon's apartment with David, Brandon is incensed to the point of exploding. He seems one step away from becoming Patrick Bateman. Instead of listening to the sexual exploits of his boss and sibling he goes for a late night jog. This is a wonderful scene where we see once again the ambition of McQueen. Rarely will you see such a long continuous shot through the streets of New York City.Brandon continues to struggle with his addiction throughout the film and despite attempting to go on a 'normal' date this does not give him the fix that he craves. However, we are presented with a bit of comic relief during the date in which an overly attentive waiter brings a smile to the audience. This is a well balanced scene which could have easily derailed the film. However, McQueen keeps a wonderful consistent tone throughout.Brandon is taken down avenues that perhaps he thought he would never explore. His relationship with Sissy continues to be fractured and although we have to surmise their backgrounds we do see that Sissy bears the scars of a difficult past.Steve McQueen has provided us with a visceral treat in Shame and has showed why he is fast becoming a big time director. His artistic background is put to good use and he has developed an almost operatic feel throughout the film. Shame deals with a tricky subject matter which is handled perfectly with McQueen not attempting to patronise his audience with a toned down look at addiction, he goes to the next level and for some maybe even too far. However, if Fassbender's character was addicted to drink or drugs then I think McQueen would still have pushed the subject as far as he could. This in turn gives us a thought provoking and unique insight into a taboo compulsion.",Shame
347,danajoy,It's A Shame,6,31 July 2016,"This is an extremely dark film that left a lot of questions unanswered, but maybe the point is not to answer questions, but just to show what is. What ""is"" is a man who is very unlikable and I never felt anything for him except disdain. I never cared what happened to him and when things didn't go well for him, I mostly felt, ""Too, bad. So, sad"". You brought this on yourself. This is the type of film that should be shown to young women who are sexually active as an example of the type of man to avoid. Shallow, uncaring, twisted. His soul feels empty and he never feels like a real person to me and there is nothing that inspires any sympathy for him and his dark demons. He doesn't really ever seem to suffer emotionally in the film, except for rage and an obvious sense of self pity at one point. I didn't enjoy watching this film. I think that should be the point if a person is going to spend the time. It felt a little draining and I never cared about him and I just wanted him gone. The same as if I had met this character in real life and they are out there. If you enjoy dark drama without any substance, then this is the film for you. It's not that I prefer everything neat and tidy and put in a box or sunshine and roses, but I don't prefer a movie that only shows shallow depravity. I just had the feeling, ""Who cares.

351,greenray1,Outstanding Portrayal of a very real and painful illness,10,22 January 2012,"AN HONEST and personal review from me here about this outstanding film. I saw the film on the first night it came out in London which included a live link up with the film director (Steve McQueen) and script writer (Abi Morgan) afterwards. I personally resonated and understood what Brandon was going through to a degree and it struck a chord within me. The film is so accurate down to every detail. What scared me was the level you could actually get to in all of this and just how ""lost"" you could find yourself and how out of hand it becomes. The need for Brandon's next ""fix"" and the desperation to get it any place anyhow - be it with a stranger, a hooker or by other means. I think anyone who feels they are close to problems in this area will benefit from seeing this film as well as others to grasp an understanding of a little talked about addiction. I too, as Brandon does in the film, find it easier to have relationships which do not involve intimacy and the complexities of ""normal"" relationships. This is both a SHAME as well as me feeling SHAME because of it. I saw the main character in the film as someone I do not want to become. There are many different takes on the possible previous (unhealthy) relationship between Brandon and his sister and the Director and writer would not give anything away here even after the film. It leaves us, as the viewer, to piece together what his past may have held with Sissy. We are reminded here with the film SHAME as in so many Ken Loach films for those of you that know him as a Director - just how awful and powerful addiction is, whatever form it takes. The battle is on for many of us to win and I hope that we can.",Shame
352,chrisgb_91,Heartbreakingly bleak tale of addiction and the human condition,7,25 March 2013,"Shame is a heartbreakingly bleak tale of addiction and the human condition.The film has us follow Brandon (last name unknown), played by the talented Michael Fassbender. During the opening exchanges, we are greeted with no dialogue; merely action. A technique that I personally find to be very effective. We need no words, Brandon's actions and surroundings are all we need to build an initial impression of this man and his way of life. He lives in a sparse apartment, absent of colour or warmth. His facial expression remains in a fixed state of ambiguity. Most tellingly, he doesn't come close to smiling at any point.Through the first act of the film, we learn of the severity of his addiction. From setting his sights on married women on the New York subway; to masturbating in the work place and hiring prostitutes for gratification. The act is fairly matter of fact; aside from the intriguing answer phone messages that he continuously ignores. Is she Brandon's girlfriend? ex-girlfriend? sister? It isn't too long until our intrigue is partly answered for with the introduction of Sissy (played by the equally as talented Carey Mulligan). For the first time in the film, we begin to see some real emotion from Brandon. Almost immediately, his seemingly cool (almost cold) demeanour begins to diminish. He becomes more irritable and impatient.From here, the film gathers considerable pace in terms of emotion and character dynamics. Instead of wondering why Sissy has this effect on Brandon; you soon realise that it doesn't matter. The film is a study on the human condition and psyche. The writer/director (Steve McQueen) gently hints at the reasons, but they aren't important. What is important is the characters and the emotion.The film seers with pain. It is an incredibly painful watch. And this is why it is such a good piece of cinema. The lead actors are mesmerising in their roles. Be sure to look out for a quite unbelievable scene in which Sissy serenades a small New York nightclub with her singing. The scene contains many of the factors that resonate within the film throughout; rawness, pain, sadness.Shame is an incredibly bleak picture; but a picture that hits you on a deep emotional level. A film that leaves you satisfied through being in the presence of pure cinema.",Shame

354,darthpaul64,McQueen and Fassbender are quite the pair.,10,1 February 2012,"Brandon (Michael Fassbender), a bachelor living in New York City, is a businessman by day and self-loathing sex addict by night. It's a mystery why he is the way he is because on the surface, he leads a somewhat successful career and has all the physical characteristics that a woman desires. His routine is thrown off course when an unexpected visitor shows up at his place. We soon find out it's his sister, Sissy (Carey Mulligan), and she needs to stay for more than just a night because she has no where to go.Michael Fassbender became a household name for movie fans in 2011 with roles in ""X-Men: First Class"", ""Jane Eyre"", ""A Dangerous Method"", and ""Shame"". He's popped up in smaller roles in previous years, but this was the year that really cemented him as a movie star. His portrayal of a sex addict in Shame is his strongest performance in my opinion. He sold the character very well. I found myself sympathizing with the character even though he made more wrong choices than right. Like any other addict, Brandon goes through great lengths to get his ""fix,"" and he hates himself for it, but he doesn't have a choice. Fassbender wasn't given a lot of dialogue to work with and ends up giving a louder performance with the moments of silence. At times, the look on his face is pure ""Shame."" Even though Sissy is not the main character, she gets the second most screen time and also has problems of her own. Sissy and Brandon's relationship is far from normal and at times it hints at an incestuous one. She is almost the complete opposite of Brandon; she needs attention and has struggled on her own for quite some time while Brandon just wants to be left alone. They both take out their frustrations on each other even though they share a similar past that is left completely removed from the film. Carey Mulligan plays the troubled younger sister perfectly. I felt for her as anyone would with their own sister; no matter how many times they make the wrong decision, you still find a way to care about them.""Sex addict"" is a term I have heard a few times, but I have never put much thought into the idea or if it even exists. I mean everyone likes the act of sex right? Well in Shame, Brandon showcases a pretty valid argument that the condition is not something to be washed over and there are people out there with this problem. His orgasms do not bring pleasure and it shows on his face in several scenes. The depths he goes to are pretty deep and he treats his sexual partners like objects rather than people. Brandon is not familiar with romance or intimacy and when he slightly has a feeling one of those, he begins to struggles.Shame is a beautifully shot film, but there is nothing pretty about it. Director Steve McQueen and Michael Fassbender collaborated for the first time back in 2008 with ""Hunger"", which is also a beauty in terms of film, but is also about not-so-pretty subject matter. Overall, I really enjoyed ""Shame"" even though it is not an easy watch and is probably the last choice when it comes to ""date night."" There is a scene at a restaurant where Brandon goes out on some sort of date with one of his co-workers that lingers far longer than any other shots in films these days and the conversation they have about the idea of relationships really made me think. If you think it's a ""Shame"" I just sided with what a sex addict had to say, just go see it for yourself.",Shame
355,For_the_love_of_cinema,Unforgettable.,9,13 April 2012,"""Shame"", directed by Steve McQueen, transcends boundaries by conveying to the audience the life of a man coping with sex addiction. Brandon Sullivan, played by Michael Fassbender, seems like a normal man to the people around him, with a cozy apartment and a corporate job. However, as the audience, you're pulled into his dark world right from the start and you realize that his life is far from normal. Brandon, being a sex addict, frequently engages in hook-ups with prostitutes and the like, until one day, his life is disrupt by the unexpected arrival of his sister Sissy, played by Carey Mulligan.The film is top-notch with excellent direction, flawless cinematography, outstanding editing and remarkable acting. Fassbender gives us the best performance of his career with his portrayal as a man struggling to find his way through the sexual urges and the guilt he has to live with everyday. It's beyond me how he didn't pick up an Oscar nod for his performance. And Carey Mulligan is flawless, as always. The woman has made a name for herself in the film industry in such a short span of time, giving us quite a number of memorable performances. The music is also worth special mention as it fits the theme of the film so well, that it leaves a mark on you and reminds you how music can add so much depth and intensity to a film. Kudos to everyone involved in the film.What bothers me is that the film was snubbed by the Academy. Is the Academy so old-school that it can't deal with a film about sex addiction in the 21st century? I suppose so. The NC-17 rating probably didn't help either. But that's the thing about true cinema – it forces you to look beyond the sex, nudity and vulgarity and makes you admire something that's both right in front of you and beneath the surface. That's exactly what Shame does. And it works.Bottomline: ""Shame"" is an intense, gripping, raw, emotional, disturbing and haunting masterpiece. The film may not be for everyone, but for those who appreciate the true meaning of cinema, it certainly won't disappoint.",Shame
356,tristanbunn,Beautifully Uncomfortable,10,28 October 2015,This movie just helps show that Michael Fassbender is one of the best actors working today. It's always a task for an actor to give a great performance with little dialogue and Fassbender does just that. Some of his best moments in this film come from his facial expressions. Steve McQueen also does an outstanding job directing this film using long takes and making us feel like we're involved in this uncomfortable reality he creates for us. The cinematography is also outstanding and every shot is composed so well and can make us feel so dirty. The thing that really sets this movie into greatness is the score. The score for this film is wonderful and it builds and builds until we are suffering with these characters.

Really really disappointed with the whole actually, it did not move me, it did not give an insight etc. Fortunately the actors are among the best this world has to offer, but even Fassbender fails in one of the last 'emotional' scenes in the rain (oh my god, in the pouring rain, how can the filmmaker come up with the idea?). Even though he is really a fine actor, his task was undo-able here. You can't believe him. You see the construction that poor Michael has to fill in. And he fails. You can't blame him though. It's the director. And what about the ending with the attempted suicide. The subway stops for a police control and oh yes, Fassbender remembers his sister was almost attempting suicide in the subway earlier and for some reason he senses he has to run home. And guess what: his premonition was right. He finds her covered with blood in a horribly out of the place almost aesthetic scene with the white clothes/tiles/hair and the red blood, tasteless, tasteless. But not just that, for what kind of bad story telling was this??? Any decent Hollywood movie would never let this happen. But this filmmaker gets away with all this crap in most of the 'good taste'-media. People who like this are untrue and completely phony. I thought the filmmaker was not, but he is. Sorry to say.

361,CogansTrader,https://twitter.com/#!/joesreviews91,8,23 January 2012,"Michael Fassbender's crash landing on the top of the A List in 2011 came as a surprise to casual film goers, but the man has long been on the road to becoming an overnight success. From getting the best line that wasn't roared in a Scottish accent in 300 to giving stunning performances in the likes of Hunger; the only surprise is that it took so long for him to go from that guy to leading man. Of course a probably welcome CV boost from Quentin Tarantino never hurt anyone and was proof to all that it is what you do with your lines, not how many you have that counts. He ended 2011 with movie star status assured; he starts 2012 with his reputation as one of the best actors currently working further enhanced. Shame, his re teaming with the aforementioned Hunger director Steve McQueen is not, it must be said, easy viewing. Fassbender plays Brandon; a successful New Yorker who struggles through the days craving his next sexual encounter. Addiction has long been a staple in cinematic drama; the craving for something which leads to a downfall and possible redemption has been covered over and over. However, the film world has always relied on the dirty world of drugs to demonstrate this. Shame isn't just a film about addiction; its a fascinating examination of how fragile the human mind is and how terrifying a prospect it is that our own human urges can turn against us.The plot is set in motion following the arrival of his estranged sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan, herself impressing). The relationship is underplayed, albeit deliberately, but the audience is still left wanting further explanation as to how these two came to be; although fans of Freud will have a field day speculating what it is that Brandon is really ashamed of. Others are sure to come up with there own suitably depressing the siblings childhoods.Despite this, McQueen brings his story to life with style. Its slow paced and torturous; just as Brandon lives his life. He isn't attracted to women; he doesn't have it in him to feel an emotional connection to someone; he is someone who struggles to do the most mundane activities without a relentless craving for his next physical encounter interfering. High enough plaudits there aren't for how Fassbender convinces as a man on a seemingly unstoppable self destruction.Despite the painful subject matter handled head on, Shame makes for a highly rewarding watch. This is daring film making that deserves to be seen and will stay with you for days afterwards. The actor/director duo (who already have another film lined up together) have created a frighteningly convincing and devastating character study.

365,tigerlily1221,the Distancing Effect as Technique; a film aptly titled,7,23 January 2012,"Many reviews here struggle with motive, a seemingly absent backstory on Brandon and Cissy, comparisons between the two main characters' use and misuse of intimacy. Further critical reviews either praise this film as 100% character study or they also write that it fails 100% at character study, owed largely to the lack of backstory. Critics 'vent their spleen' in anger that the film is too painterly, too pretense and posture, contributing no sense of empathy with Brandon or Cissy. Well folks, I put it to you that this is not narrative, not a character study, not a film about sex, not a film like any that we've been presented in a long time. In my opinion, this is the Verfremdungseffekt from Brecht (google or wiki this, translation often presents it as ""alienation"" or ""distancing"" effect) and I believe that this is the byproduct of this film, to a tee. Our director McQueen has created something of an experiment in which the viewer is an unwitting accomplice, similar to Hanneke, in which we are given views into our character in his natural environment. He is not completely likable, nor is his condition. We are watching Brandon at his most vulnerable moments, doing things that (from the visual signals written on his face) he does not enjoy as pleasure but performs continually in the quest for satisfaction. And we're watching him, in his bed, in his bathroom, in thrall to these physical drives, and we watch him again struggling, we're starting to think that it's a little uncomfortable to see this man, who is meant to be a success in our society, as he betrays our expectations of him over and over again. Does this sound like how you view an alcoholic or drug addict? Why are we watching, as in the theatre seat one thinks to oneself, 'yes, this is not a good movie for a first date.' I don't even know if I'd tell my mother I'd watched this. I'd be too ashamed: there. You were accomplice, you viewed passively and felt repulsion for your anti-hero. Wikipedia writes of the Verfremdungseffekt: ""being thus 'distanced' emotionally from the characters... the audience could be able to reach ... a level of understanding... while alienated emotionally from the action and the characters.. and empowered on an intellectual level both to analyze and perhaps even to try to change the world."" So perhaps McQueen has created Shame, to induce shame, to charge you with doing something about it. Not a character study, not at all.",Shame

But she regards it as being bored when asked, so she's probably not all that proud of it, possibly she regrets it. Having experience with this myself I can say that the scenes at the end were very moving, very well thought out. (yeah also spoilers just in case) because when Brandon sees the accident or whatever actually happened at the end (i was thinking that she had jumped in front of the train idk, but that wasn't the case) he remembered Sissy, tried to call her and if course it didn't go through. He's probably really panicking right now because he was having a go at TWO hookers at once and I know that if I were writing Brandon I would be writing something along the lines of guilt for putting his problems above his own, angry that she had done that, upset and overwhelmed because this long gone problem of hers has resurfaced after he was the one that put her down at the beginning. I could write an entire monologue about that and get extra credit for school. That was the best part of the movie to me, where it all sort of unravels with both characters, Fassbender's character is just bent on using sex to escape his problems while Mulligan's character is using previously repressed methods to deal with hers. People argue that there was no plot, no character development and I'm going to give you all a kick up the arse for it because through the eyes of a writer and director, this has very subtle, but very very well written development. At the start, Brandon is seemingly managing his private and work life, he manages somehow to do everything he does undercover. Then, his sister turns up, we don't have much to go on with their past, so I'll presume from the evidence given that they were fairly close (she never bothered to cover herself when he pulled own the bathroom door, he got on top of her while only wearing a towel, she gets around in almost nothing as does he) there is also a good chance that Brandom was either a negative or positive impact on teen life, though perhaps a negative that she mistook as a positive in a scramble to be loved. Whatever the reason I think it's safe to say that Brandom isn't liking her at all, even as children he probably found her need for affection annoying as he himself couldn't understand it with no emotion presentable toward the general population. He may be jealous of her for being able to do that. Whatever the reason is that he doesn't like her is obviously a very complex one. Toward the middle of the movie, after she sings New Yord New York, Brandon needs more women, he wants more sex and will do anything to get it. But having Sissy around is like having an anchor around your neck. No matter how far you get up (and get off) you'll always get pulled back down again just with the effort needed to deal with her. Toward the end he goes on a bit of a spree, a woman who he fingers and then gets into a fight with her boyfriend over it. Then a man. I think the man is to symbolize The fact that he will go to any lengths to get some, I don't think Brandon is gay at all, I think he was just craving it so much he didn't care where it came from. Then as Sissy is calling him, he's with two hookers at once for a very long, yes very we'll done sex scene. It then falls into Sissy's attempted suicide. The scene of them at the hospital is powerful because I think the same situation has happened before. Just after that he falls apart, not a lot of movies that I have seen have ever portrayed men and being vulnerable people, sure the Winchesters have their share of the angst, but this movie is one of those long, well written fanfiction with lots of porn and angst all at once. The porn happens here because of the angst and angst happened because of the porn. Simple. I think what ideas getting at here is there is extreme amounts of character development, most people just don't see it. The concept of silence in this movie is stunning, it put across to me that there was so much more to think about than just the acting and what's right there, though sometimes I felt it was a little too long. But it makes you think. Addressing the sex scenes now. As a teenage girl who generally is not allowed to see this stuff with the parents, I had to watch it in my room and keep a close eye on the door. Often sec scenes jumped on me really really fast, I didn't know they were coming. Like Fassy and the other girl banging in the window. Pretty much died of a heart attack there. But cinematography and choreography with most of the scenes was amazing. Though sometimes I had to question whether or not this was a really really good porno with high paying actors or a really heavy movie. I went with the latter. And yes, I love this movie. I'll be sure to watch it again in the future, it's really really good if you're looking for a movie to think about afterwards.",Shame
369,npacemo-90-212412,Why Shame?,10,15 May 2012,"I've read many reviews about this movie and most of them depict the movie as a picture of a sex addict spiraling out of control. I don't really see it that way. The main character, beautifully acted by Michael Fassbender, strikes me with the manifestation of such a wide range of conflicting personal features. Pedantism, order, cleanliness, civility and at the same time spontaneity, emotion, vulnerability, vulgarity. At one end of the spectrum we see a conformist successfully integrated within the norms of our society and the other end we see a truly modern man, a rebel, a two-face seeking for something more.I try to think as if I'm the main character. My thoughts are telling me that the word 'shame' doesn't depict 'my' real feelings. Maybe 'frustration'. But not shame... As you'll watch the movie, you might sense it too. Shame is related to something terrible in the past. You can sense it in the way a brother and sister relate to each other and in the way how he demands to keep his distance, away from Sissy,... away from a shameful past. I do try to imagine what might have happened in the past to both of them.At one point the main character seems to attempt to dive into a 'normal' relationship. At first you can't say if he's really honest to the girl or he just manipulates her in order to fulfill an erotic fantasy. But later on you can see it in the scene with his erectile dysfunction. A real emotional connection and over-excitement might cause something like that. That was a genius way to depict it.",Shame
370,narihlee,what every movie should be,9,12 April 2012,"I honestly don't remember the last time I felt so strongly about a movie. The last movie that really left a heavy weight on my shoulders was Blue Valentine, but Shame tops that by a ton. This masterpiece by Steve McQueen tells the tale of Brandon Sullivan and how his addiction to sex constantly meddles with his life. The thing about this movie is that it's such a real depiction of life, even if the idea of the movie may be difficult to connect with, you will still understand the emotions the characters feel. The performances by Fassbender and Mulligan were disturbing and haunting and absolutely perfect. They created such realism within the story that by the time it was over you could feel the pain each character felt. I felt depressed and sad once it was done, but the next morning I could barely get out of bed and I was crying for absolutely no reason at all. The movie had such an impact on me that I now understand why Carey Mulligan would come home crying after filming. Beware, because this is not a movie for everyone but if you can handle it and you want to watch a quality film, I highly recommend this. Shame is one of the best movies I've ever seen and I have seen quite a lot. It emits feelings that envelop the audience, just as any great movie should.",Shame
371,Godsownmanuel,A shameful tragedy!,6,20 December 2011,"I personally do not understand it when people see movies like this&refer to it as ""not pornography."" As far as i'm concerned, any literature or film that show sexual acts&images in a way that is intended to make people feel sexually excited is pornography and if you're offended by it then you should not see this film as the majour theme is sex addiction and about 60% of the movie contains graphic sexual acts from heterosexual sex, gay sex, orgies, masturbation, internet porn and full frontal nudity. Having made my point, i also state that the general success of this movie lies in the actors performances. It is so believable that you almost think, maybe they're going through these situations in real life or their participation in the movie is actually depressing, as that, ""depression"" is always almost visible in the main characters' (portrayed by mulligan&fassbender)appearances. Action truly speaks louder than words! But sometimes, words matter even if its just a sentence&i truly believe at least a bit more should have been said in this heart wrenching movie to make the viewer totally fall into the lives&fully understand these characters better. Scenery, camera usage, close up shots, wonderful! This movie opens up your mind to a million things, leaving you with questions you might not be able to answer yourself. I won't suggest this movie as a form of therapy for a ""wanting to escape"" sex addict because i don't think it will work, but for those who might be curious to see what sex addiction is like, the pains associated with it(and any other form of addiction)&the possible damages it can cause, depression, wrong family background/child upbringing, yes i would. Surprisingly/unfortunately, there was no talk of S.T.D's&S.T.I's",Shame
372,sanjin-svajger,"Empty and boring, almost porno",5,19 March 2012,"I'll simply divide this review in two columns:Cons: 1. the main character is neither emphatic or sympathetic: This is a very big problem in film such as this one where there is only character and no plot. If the viewer doesn't care about the character in a character centered story then it's mostly all for nothing. It could be used as a technique to deliver some sort of a message but the message in this film is either to hidden or non-existent.2. no plot: There is a very big lack of story. ""Nothing"" really happens in this film. If the spectator would fell something towards the protagonist (empathy or sympathy) this wouldn't be a problem. This makes the film boring and approximately 30 minutes to long.3. structure: The films structure is vague at best. I've heard/read somewhere that this film was created without a script... Well, it certainly looks and feels so.4. cinematography: There were not a lot of lights used on this film. It looks like natural lighting - which I don't appreciate to much. This is more a thing of taste maybe then actual objective critique. If the cinematography works then it works.5. not enough exposition on the characters: This contributes to the first point above. The spectator knows very little about the protagonist and his sister. To little. Their past ""should"" have been dramatized, just a little bit if not more. I've put should in quotas because this would have changed the basic structure and feel of the film BUT it would have added texture and meaning!Pros:1. simplistic scene breakdown: This is rather a thing of taste then anything else, but I think it works fairly well in this film. All the scenes that don't have sex in them have a really small amount of shots in them. This contributes to the scenes atmosphere. And as such is correctly implemented. The whole film has a rather small amount of shots.2. actors performance: I guess it was good. Kinda hard to tell with the all the bad scripting (or the lack of it) and direction. But the actors definitely saved the film. If the actors would have been replaced by no-name actors then this film would have been voted probably ""unnecessary explicit and vulgar"".Overall:The film is to long, cold and boring.If you want the spectator to feel the protagonists inner struggle and his emptiness you first have to make him feel for the protagonist. Then you have to create a void between the protagonist and the spectator which is achieved by making the protagonist do all the wrong things that he should be doing to improve his situation. This then creates the feeling of the protagonists inability to change him self - which is the primary subject of this film. I'm surprised that the industry professionals that made this film don't understand this?? It really is story telling 101 - story telling basics! Kar Wai Wong does this very nicely in his films ""2046"" and ""Chung King ekspres"". Maybe they should watch the two films and learn something from them. In my opinion this film is a failure as it fails in it's basic form. It wants you to feel the characters inability to change (this is the films fundamental thing) but it fails to do so.The film and it's subject is very explicitly shown. People will be shocked and surprised by this. But don't give it a good rating just because it's explicit! Because this is what happens most of the time: when people see something explicit and non ordinary they say ""it's a masterpiece"", ""it's a modern..."", ""it's a great portrayal of..."", and so on and so forth.I gave 5 stars to this film because it's actually quite bold in its explicity.",Shame

If you are going to walk into this film with the mind set ""It's just about a guy with a sex addiction"" Then you are going to be surely shaken.Yes the film is about sex addiction but its more about the characters themselves. You have the needy sister that needs to grow up and the brother that is so wrapped up with his addiction he has no time for anyone else. He would rather do whatever it is for his addiction by any means.The score to the film is perfect. Even without dialogue you still know what each and every character is going through. Carey's New York, New York does just that.The feeling of the film is so natural you get lost into it and don't even think that you are watching a film.

Explicit sex scenes are cleverly disguised by a soundtrack with classical music. Although the acting is really impressive, I think the commitment the actors have, especially the lead, is a little over the top. After seeing this movie, there isn't one part of his body you haven't seen (or one position you haven't seen him in, either). I believe this movie is rated so highly because apparently critics confuse lots of explicit nakedness with ""art"". Granted, the actors are good. They manage to pull of very long shots expressing believable emotions. And this certainly paints an interesting picture of New York as a cold, impersonal city where everyone seems to have lost sight of what a relationship should entail. But that does not distract from the fact that there is no story being told and that huge parts of the movie you're just staring at the screen waiting for the scene to end.

It made me miss New York and be happy I am no living there......all in the same movie. I know of someone who has some of Brandon's, the lead character, qualities. It perfectly captures the thrill of being successful in New York. And sometimes the emptiness and vacancy you may feel once you establish that success if you don't have a strong support system that you can be honest with. His apartment is very much the starkness of a bachelor in New York. When confronted with the possibility of a real connection with a co-worker, possibly subordinate, his self assured persona withers. He is unable to make that leap from anonymity to intimacy.Carey Mulligan's role is a little more tragic, but, painfully real. Once again, she reminds Brandon about the danger of isolation despite his protest of wanting to navigate through life, solo.It is definitely a movie I will be purchasing on Blu-Ray.Fassbender should have also been nominated for an Oscar. There was just no performance as memorable.",Shame
376,railvoyager,A disturbing view of life...,6,3 June 2012,"I've never watched a movie by Steve McQueen and never had the chance to see Michael Fassbender or Carrey Mulligan play in a film. I therefore was more than curious about this highly publicised work. People are sexual beings and it is a part of our nature. But we certainly live in a time that everyone can find sex everywhere to the point that we might become miserable and feel empty because of this extra offer of sexual images.Brandon (M. Fassbender)is a thirty something career man with his own apartment in New York. He's got the looks, the style, he talks nice but from the beginning of the movie we get the impression that his life is sad, empty and monotonous. And that's because of his sex addiction. If for most people sex is an element of joy in their lives, for Brandon it is a torture. Like any other addiction, sexual addiction rules completely his life.When Brandon's sister, Sissy (C. Mulligan) shows up uninvited at his apartment, his life becomes even more troubled and confused. Sissy is a troubled young woman with the obvious signs of borderline personality disorder. She's craving for love and human touch but if she is not gonna get it, she will act unpredictably. Brandon doesn't want to have an intimate relationship with her, maybe because he is unable to do so or because there is a dark secret connecting them both with their childhood.McQueen's film is a drama about emptiness, human touch, family relationships and the nature of addiction. But there's something to be missing here. There in not much talking in a film that is primarily centered to Fassbender, his facial expressions, his body language, his emotional bursting. Fassbender is not supported by the rest of the cast or the gloomy context of New York properly. He might be the character who is sexually addicted but his relationships with the others are very poorly explained and examined. Though ''Shame'' might generally be a good effort, for me it's more of a one man show performance that finally damages the film to some extent.Thank you very much for reading this.",Shame
377,allwynsdcosta2006,Shame,10,3 February 2013,"Brandon is an effortless charmer. He has it all-- sophistication,classy looks and too much fun to get married. But is it all fun? What if he has a dark dark secret that makes him one of the most anomalistic men you could ever meet. This film makes one realise that in this world where no one is quite who they seem there is no one who we can know completely.'Shame' is a film that dares to deal with a very bold and basic aspect of human instincts. Brandon is a sex addict and he has learnt to live with it. But all hell breaks loose when his sister who has problems greater than his own, moves in.Watching porn, meeting prostitutes and jacking off to porn magazines in his office men's room are few of the many unspeakable chores in his daily routine. He has mindless sex with strangers in risky public places. But none of this seems to be more aberrant for Brandon than dealing with his own sister. His sister is an artist and has fewer limitations to what she chooses to do with herself. Brandon is protective but he rarely comes across as a possessive brother. He seems indifferent and less bothering when she has a one- night-stand with his married boss. But Brandon's life spirals out of control when his troubled and complex relationship with his sister takes an emotionally charged up and a dangerous turn for the worst. This film moves something in everyone of us. Characters and the plot are unusual but refreshingly believable. 'Shame' is one of those films which is more about the characters in it than the script. It's a voyeuristic glimpse in to the life of a man who has secrets like all of us. The film does not make any moral judgement or tries to lead the viewers in to accepting, believing or rejecting anything about its characters. This film is an amazing and rare work of contemporary art- more like a life painted on a modern day canvas. Unfortunately, very few artists dare to explore the more vivid and unspoken eccentricities and complexities of human behaviour like this film does.",Shame
378,cmshents,i want my money back,1,5 June 2012,i will always remember not to watch anything by Steve McQueen. i just want my money back. this movie falls in the same category as Trespass or Sleepers. What a stupid movie. I would not watch it even if I'd be paid to. Is it trying to teach us about the dangers of porn? The follow up question is what 18 year old doesn't know the side effects of porn. My take is that Mr McQueen is duping us into believing that his movie is full of action by putting up 18sln - just a man showing dick and ass. Not even proper shagging. There was no storyline at all.

(A really good performance after HUNGER).The flaws of human being is wonderfully highlighted whether it was Fassbender or Carey Mulligan's character.The graphic nudity and portrayal of sex was a necessity keeping in mind the topic that was dealt in the movie.Steve McQueen has left no stones unturned in researching the character.Fassbender has managed to give a performance that few actors can give to justify the role.And the music was really good that matched the situation entirely. The tense scene and the scenes that showed desperate Fassbender character was aptly edited and with suitable background score.This managed to bring out the all the actors.I was sorry that this movie did not win many awards and get recognized.Steve McQueen sure deserves to be awarded for his work in future.Looking forward for more Michael Fassbender and Steve McQueen's collaborations.,Shame

In other aspects, mostly the frivolous, it falls short. The movie is gorgeously shot, as it is more of a chore to make the upscale spots of NYC look anything short of expensive. The score is great and you can definitely feel it providing you an emotion that the acting/plot doesn't necessarily carry itself. McQueen dives into the world of sexual addiction. At times the film seems a bit pretentious, overly edgy, and excessively graphic. However, the addiction itself is clearly the protagonist, Fassbender's character (Brandon) is just the carrier of the virus. The film's greatest successes come in depicting addiction. I've read a few reviews on here that basically read as ""so what, he bangs a few people a week, and watches a lot of porn."" While this is all true, the scope is larger than that. If it was just frivolous sex and excessive masturbation, we wouldn't have a movie. Brandon has sex with strangers from bars, co-workers, over the internet, while on runs, and sex with more strangers after having sex with strangers and being beaten up by strangers, in a gay bar depicted as the underworld. The point of all of this is to show how it affects his relationships. Brandon's addiction leaves him insular. He can not see outside of his own mind. He has not had a relationship with anyone lasting over 4 months, his work computer was deemed ""filthy"", he totally neglected the relationship with his sister, ignoring her cries for help. The relationship with his sister is especially weird. They are often naked in front of each other, and generally are much more affectionate than what I consider ""normal"". This made me think, was this behavior learned, or were they raised in a perverse environment?There are times where you see Brandon's character trying to fight the urges and demons in his head. Sitting in precarious positions, pulling his hair out, crying and screaming. There are times where it looks like he is making positive changes and at least attempting to oust his demons. However, they are short lived. Whether it be outside stimuli, or a self-created fantasy, Brandon fails to perform the maintenance needed to keep his mind healthy. The movie ends with Brandon observing a woman on a train he has intimately studied previously. The look on his face allows the viewer to understand that the cycle is repeating, and that addiction is serious. The last show focuses on the woman's wedding ring. This is probably why Brandon doesn't understand or consider marriage. The shot also provides a reflection on our current culture of sex, relationships, dating, and society as a whole.",Shame

But the scenes, the content, the lines - quite uninteresting. Yes, it is about sex addiction and a sister that is always in trouble and tries to commit suicide. It is a very difficult topic and the way it was approached was fairly distant. The choice of very cold colours throughout the movie helped in enhancing the feel that there is an emotional disinterest in the events happening. So yes, the story is tragic, but the storytelling not so much.However, what I absolutely loved about this movie was Michael Fassbender and not only because he is hot (although he is hot with every fibre of his body). He was very consistent with his character and very precise in his acting. He was cold, yet charming. He did not believe in committed monogamous relationships, yet he disarmed a woman that was all about that.

385,paulvisser86,One of the greatest movies of all time (seriously!),10,2 February 2016,"I honestly think that Shame is one of the greatest movies of all time. As a film fanatic I am of course also a huge fan of critically acclaimed classics like The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Vertigo etc., but in my opinion Shame definitely belongs to this list of classics. Many of you would disagree with me – I am sure about that – but please let me tell you in short why I have come to this conclusion.First of all, the camera-work and soundtrack of the movie are sensational. I you are not sure yet whether or not it is worth to watch this movie, just look up the metro scene on YouTube. I am convinced that all your doubts will be gone directly. Secondly, the acting in this movie is magnificent. Michael Fassbender is really robbed in the 2011 Oscar season. He should have won the Oscar for best actor and I was absolutely stunned that he actually didn't even receive a nomination. Sometimes I think the Academy only looks at a certain type of movies, instead of reviewing the broad range of different kind of movies that are released each year.Finally, I must say that Shame is one of the few movies that really haunted me for several weeks. Shame is such an intense movie - and the soundtrack is so emotional - that I and my girlfriend talked about it for hours after wards. I have seen the movie several times after it was released and it gets me every time. This is mainly a result of the great acting by Fassbender, as it is really easy to identify with him (despite his extreme sex addiction which I obviously don't suffer). What a great actor and film, be sure you don't miss it! Of course everyone has their own opinion about this movie, but I can assure you that it is definitely worth watching and an unforgettable film experience.",Shame

You are delivered to the mercy of the director. A must see for the real movie lovers. The colors, the lighting, the acting, it is just perfect. In the European version there are some nudity and sex scenes in it, but in my opinion, it suits the movie.

390,dairy_calloula,A film for the intelligent mind this is not,2,21 December 2011,"Director Steve McQueen has said this is a film he wants to stay with the viewer, and in that respect he's succeeded. Since seeing this buzzed-about film last evening, my mind has been swirling around the many elements I disliked along with genuine curiosity as to how it has fared so well in reviews.To begin with the positive aspects that earned my two stars, I found the film to be very true to its NYC location. I appreciated that although Brandon has a high income job which affords him a luxury apartment with incredible views, in a spatial space the apartment is actually quite small and confining. Not only is this true of Manhattan living in general, I felt it lent itself nicely to the tension between Brandon and Sissy. I also enjoyed that in scenes where Brandon is walking through his neighborhood or going for a run, we are seeing actual storefronts and landmarks that exist in that location. Such details along with a number of well executed subway scenes gave me the sense that Brandon is someone I could pass on the street or sit across from on the subway without a second thought or insight into the darkness of his character.These positives aside, I carried through the entire film the feeling that Brandon and Sissy were people I could not understand and more importantly were presented in such a way that I was not meant to understand them or even try. While I don't need to be able to relate in order to appreciate a character, I do think it's important to distinguish character development from portraiture. Brandon and Sissy are clearly two troubled individuals the motivations of whom are intended to shock and disturb, and while McQueen succeeds in that regard, without any greater sense as to how these characters developed into such deeply flawed and unconventional people I simply lost interest in them from the very start. When a tear rolls down Brandon's cheek as Sissy performs ""New York, New York"" (perhaps one of the most excruciating cinematic moments I've encountered in a long time), I did not know why he was touched, I did not care, and most importantly I did not believe.Brandon and Sissy's relationship in general was a point of frustration for me. I wanted more information from the very start yet I could sense it wasn't forthcoming. What was it about their past that made them so comfortable with each other in one respect yet so incredibly distant in every other? When we see Brandon ignore Sissy on his answering machine until she turns up in his shower saying he'd given her a key, I just didn't believe that Brandon would've given her a key based on what I'd seen of their relationship, particularly in light of the fact that Brandon's sexual deviance was something he tried to keep hidden. I ultimately felt that, given the many inconsistencies in their relationship without any insight as to the development of that relationship, even the moments between them which should have touched me did not. When Brandon is forced to deboard the subway car, has what appears to be an epiphany as to the condition of his sister and takes off running for his apartment where he discovers her post-suicide attempt, I again didn't buy this innate connection that attuned him to her state of being. From a converse perspective, if Brandon recognized all along the extent of Sissy's fragility (as the references to her many failed suicide attempts would lead one to believe), and the realization that he may have finally pushed her too far is the reason he runs to find her, why then would he have carelessly initiated so much of the abuse in their relationship only to weep over her near-lifeless body when she attempts suicide again? Again I felt my ability to grasp the character's motivations was hindered by lack of context.In terms of the performances by Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan, while I generally felt they embodied their roles well within the constraints of the material, I found myself distracted at times by their accents. Carey Mulligan is usually right on target, however in an early scene where she cries on the phone to a former lover, it's abundantly clear that this is not a woman who grew up in New Jersey as her character claims. Far more blatant was Michael Fassbender's Irish accent throughout the entirety of the film. When Brandon tells a date he was born in Ireland, I had to wonder whether this dialogue was added to the script solely to explain why his accent was not that of a local.Moving on to the graphic sexual nature of the film, I can't claim it was entirely gratuitous as Brandon's sexual compulsion was the pulse of the film, however it felt after a while like I was watching a bad porno flick that succeeded only in turning me off - for what seemed at the time like the rest of my life. My biggest problem here was a lack of balance. We are given a tremendous amount of insight into the deviant nature of Brandon's character, but the insight ends there. If every moment of Brandon's life is consumed by his sexual appetite, what are we to make of the fact that no one he interacts with on a daily basis seems to have any indication? And being multi-faceted people ourselves, how are we to see Brandon as anything but one-dimensional?""Shame"" is not the word I'd use to describe characters so eager to relinquish control to their worst instincts. Could the title ""Depression, Self-Loathing and Unwillingness to Initiate Change"" have been taken?",Shame

It may not be a movie for everybody, and disturbing for most but this beautifully, artfully, directed film has so much raw emotion and feeling to it. If you can't tell whats going on within the characters during the entire film, you just truly won't know everything underneath the surface. There are a lot of quiet moments during the film but the emotion is still strong during these moments, more so than when there is actual dialogue. This emotion is perfectly captured with the beautifully composed music by Harry Escott. There are so many layers to this film, but is displayed in such a simplistic setting in every scene. This movie is absolutely captivating and will go down as one of the best movies of all time for me. McQueen and Fassbender are an amazing duo, can't wait for them to work together for future films.",Shame
393,ryyan-buii,An emotional drama with great actors,8,12 June 2013,"Shame (2011)In New York City, Brandon's carefully cultivated private life — which allows him to indulge his sexual addiction — is disrupted when his sister Sissy arrives unannounced for an indefinite stay.Michael Fassbender is definitely a great actor; one of my favourites. Spectacular performance in X-Men: First Class and Prometheus which I saw before this film so I really had high expectations for his performance in this one. Also you can't forget about Carrey Mulligan who played an outstanding role in the emotional film, Drive.There may be a bit of spoilers, but I feel like this movie is more about being left for interpretation on the theme of the film. That's kind of what I want to talk about.The story starts off with Brandon (Fassbender) and you begin to see that he has some kind of sex addiction. But when his sister, Sissy (Mulligan) shows up and you start to feel some kind of tension between them and you start to try to understand their relationship between each other. Personally I don't have a sister but I'm pretty sure siblings don't act like this around each other.Throughout the movie I felt like there was some incestuous past between Brandon and his sister before the movie began. A phone call at the end of the movie basically confirmed it for me. This is what I believe he was ashamed of. He goes out of his way to avoid his sister and suppress his sexual feelings by finding other ways to deal with it.I found this movie very emotional, but there were times that I wanted to skip past parts just get to scenes with dialogue that would give me something to understand more about the characters. Overall, I thought without that kind of emotion and understanding of a character from such amazing actors like Fassbender and Mulligan, you just couldn't pull this movie off.8/10",Shame
394,risto-solman,Grim movie about sex addiction,10,3 November 2013,"It is one of those movies that will haunt you for a long time and in a positive sense where it will make you think about addictions in general. Acting was absolutely brilliant and Steve McQueen has done an excellent job at bringing so many different aspect of addicts daily problems on screen. Simply brilliant. The musical score by Harry Escott excels as well at bringing a grim and serious tone to the picture. The main character Brandon, who is portrayed by Michael Fassbender is in fact a likable and relatable character, perhaps that is one of the reasons that makes the film so compelling and hard to forget. Since there are so many people with different addictions, the movie is really relevant. The tone of the movie is serious and grim and you can feel the pain of the main protagonist as his days pass and he tries to fight his addiction. One of the best movies of past few years.",Shame
395,renaissancedodo,Perhaps the Bravest Film of the Year,9,25 January 2012,"""Shame"" is not going to sit well with a lot of people. Actually, there are very, very few people who are going to appreciate this. I say ""appreciate"", because this film isn't entertainment. It is an excruciatingly honest film, revealing the life of a man struggling with sexual addiction and all that entails. It is, among the films I have seen this year, the BRAVEST, because it is only revealing - it doesn't have an agenda. Sadly, many people will just not be able to get past the sex.It's scary, and painful, the way this film reveals the dark side of sex and addiction . . . because there is no filter. It's a provocative film because the subject is provocative, not the way the film presents it. The film, like Brandon, is very detached. It's not trying to manipulate, it's just ""revealing"" to anyone who wants to look into the life of Brandon and everyone he affects. I commend Steve McQueen, who I think might already be among his generation's finest filmmakers, for not making the easy choice. Those long, lingering shots will haunt my mind for a long time. McQueen's not afraid to let the camera just roll, which is SO wonderful, because it flies in the face of an increasingly hectic style of film editing that becomes more and more about ""look at this NOW"" and ""NOW I want YOU to FEEL"" this. McQueen isn't trying to please anyone, or make a ""movie with a message."" He just knows when to leave the blasted thing alone, and let the moments occur ... moments which tore me up from the inside on many occasions. Those long stares shared with complete strangers? People never talk about it, or want to admit it, because it's uncomfortable and ""impolite,"" but those moments do HAPPEN in real life, and McQueen reveals all of that without the vomit-inducing pathos manipulation so many current film directors are addicted to. He doesn't dumb it down, and thank goodness for that.Consequently, there's no hiding in a film like this. I commend Michael Fassbender for being almost unbearably vulnerable. There is a dark, soulful chasm in Fassbender's eyes throughout this film. Nothing ever quite fills this chasm, but his recognition of ""the problem"" is a beautiful, painful catharsis for me, as I watch this man crucify himself in search of just FEELING something. So, so sad. But not without hope. I really cannot say how much I applaud McQueen for playing all the cards JUST right. WELL DONE! Every time I saw a ""moment"" I was thinking ""oh no, please don't do that, don't make the mistake that 98% of other filmmaker's would make in that position "" and he never did. He always chose the path of true resistance. So, of course, the film was completely overlooked at the Oscar's. Even though I'm sure they both could care less, Michael and Steve should wear that snub as a badge of honor. Good work doesn't need validation, it speaks for itself. I hope to see these two collaborate on many more projects, because they are exceptional artists! So ... entertainment this film is not. Nor is it a message movie. It is honest and visceral and, ironically, completely unashamed of itself. If you feel brave enough to spend 100 minutes confronting Brandon's demons alongside him, I strongly recommend you give this film the opportunity to reveal.",Shame

Do not waste your time watching it. Since I have to write 10 lines of text - the above would suffice - here it goes: Please explain to me what is the relationship between Brandon and Sissy his sister? Does they practiced incest? Did they had a brute father? Were they abandoned by their mother? In other words, what is the real cause of Brandon's weird sexual behavior and deviations? Clearly the guy is abnormal, but why? Besides, it simply does not makes sense that he wishes to have sex with every woman that crosses his path, but he is also impotent, seemingly a gay who has not yet left the closet and a voyeur. And if the readers really wish to have a reason for not watching this film, the guy spends long times doing nothing. As for his sister, her story is a not-story since it never becomes clear what is bothering her. Once again, a bad script badly directed. BTW I am not a bigot neither a prude.",Shame
398,AnxietyAlex,Breathtaking,10,30 December 2012,"Brandon(Michael Fassbender) is a New Yorker living with an addiction, his carefully planned life begins to spiral out of control when his emotionally needy sister, Sissy(Carey Mulligan), turns up unexpectedly. This film is a showcase for the effects that addiction has on the life on an individual and those around them. Brandon's addiction is a sexual one. We are shown how he feeds his addiction throughout the movie, he takes part in orgies, hires prostitutes and we eventually become aware that the sex of the person he has sexual relations with does not matter, he just needs to get his fix. Shame is a very powerful film that shows how addictions, no matter what type of addiction, can destroy your life. The acting is top notch from both Fassbender and Mulligan, who have never been better. It is quite clear that both Brandon and Sissy had a troubled childhood, how it was troubled we never find out. Both have dealt with the troubles of their past in very different ways. Brandon has gone down a path of addiction to escape the horrors of his childhood, while Sissy has become an emotional wreck who constantly craves the attention and affection of her distant brother. It's obvious that Sissy's clingy nature has affected her relationships in a very powerful scene as she appears to be begging her boyfriend over the phone to stay with her. Sissy is the mentally weaker of the two as we discover that she has attempted suicide in the past. Although Brandon does eventually begin to unravel mentally too, he has a tough exterior that begins to breakdown once Sissy turns up. Fassbender has some fantastic scenes in the film, it is one of the best portrayals of an addict since Requiem for a Dream. All in all, Steve McQueen's Shame is probably the best movie of 2011. McQueen really shows himself to a great filmmaker with this work. I can't think of one negative aspect of the movie. While at times it may be difficult to watch due to the unflinching manner in which addiction is portrayed, it is a very rewarding film that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled. The acting is some of the best I have ever witnessed and how Mulligan and Fassbender were not Oscar nominated I will never understand. Shame is a truly great film and essential viewing.",Shame

This will however shatter throughout the movie as he is confronted by his sisters casualty about the addiction.Sissy play the inhibited role during all off this, doing Fassbender's boss while she's crashing at his place, and really making a real influence on mindset overall.The tension builds up all the way and keeps an eye on the dark side of the addiction during it, which is good.Hence the picture settings during the movie, the blue and documentary lightning overall, and all the below headline shooting makes it more grand.This all through spirals grand into half of the movie, where significant situations suddenly breaks into Fassbender's demise.All in all you get the feeling of an addiction through the movie.

Plus, I didn't like the subtle judgement of his gay experience, such as that was the highest point of his sad, pervert life. I didn't expect a complete analysis of the problem, but in this case the character has been shown as a person with lot of problems and loneliness, and it's not clear if and how sex dependence (?) was the cause.The pattern, the look and feel and many scenes of the movie I think were highly inspired by American Psycho.",Shame

I felt that I could connect with all of the characters, and was able to deeply feel their emotions that reach out and grabbed my heart. The images was beautifully captured. I was a bit skeptical, because of the NC-17 rating, I was sure that there would be excessive nudity and sex, but to my surprise it was tastefully done.

Not by the actors, even though I thought Carey Mulligan was better in other movies, Michael Fassebender is actually the only good thing I kept from the movie. Thhe story doesn't go anywhere in my opinion. McQueen only gives glimpses of few things that are abandoned right away like his relationship to his colleague, his family past, his sister (wasn't it the center point of the movie, to have a situation where she disturbs everything? she's not present enough for me). I would have preferred to have shorter or fewer sex scenes (all the sex showed does not serve the story that much after a while we've seen it all!) and more deeper views on Brandon's relationships. I don't mind to see a dark movie (actually I usually appreciate it), or a slow movie where it's more about contemplating, getting close to the characters to feel what it's about.

I give props to Abi Morgan and Steve Mc Queen for their raw, no fluffy Hollywood style film. A few years back I saw the film ""I am a sex addict"". This film was a dark comedy about a guy who while getting married reflects on his addiction with prostitutes. Shame has no laugh tracks whatsoever. Both Michael Fassbender's Brandon and Carey Mulligan's Cissy are dour, moody & troubled. I can relate to Brandon's frustrations. As a addict who lives a structured lifestyle, you do not want any distractions.However, Brandon's situation with Cissy is an interesting one. This movie makes you really think about breaking anything that is considered taboo. Brandonstruggles to have intimacy but his addiction overpowers him. He goes todark places, places that do cause shame. Michael Fassbender nails allof these traits.I loved Carey Mulligan! Personally, she is the better actor/actress. Her character Cissy is much more emotionally frail. There are a number of scenes in the film that make it seem like Cissy is the truer addict. I would of liked to have seen a more graphic film though. I was hoping for more insight and background between Brandon and Cissy. The NC-17 rating was not justified. The original ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" is more explicit in both violence and sex. That is not too say Shame is explicit-the dialog and tone is brutally explicit- just saying an R rating would work. I've seen many films that deal with male and female emotions, dealing with obsessions-drinking, sex, killing but so far nothing that society says hold it- that is taboo. Shame comes close though.Both Steve Mcqueen and Abi Morgan have made a film that will make you think,guess and leave the ending up to you to decide what is the shame.",Shame

Brandon indulges himself in many sexual activities but it is his way of running away from emotions or commitment. He made it clear when he told Marianna about his opinion of marriage and relationships. Also, throughout the movie we don't see him speaking or sharing his feelings which are also his way of not having any connection with any one. Even the writer followed his lead and did not offer flash backs into their childhood or family just leaves us with his facial expressions and anger with his sister. His sister was his connection to feelings or any past experience and he wants to shut it down. This movie is really beyond any other movie I have ever seen, the characters did not really have to talk which in a way conveys their suffering. People may find him cold hearted and selfish but he is not the finale scene in the hospital with his sister proves it. Brandon can change to a normal man just if he finds his strength to do so, in the movie he gave up all his filthy magazine so it was a sign that he can give up this kind of life for may be love, although he changes his mind again about it later.just one hell of a movie deeper than what u think .",Shame

Certainly sex addiction is the vehicle but there are deeper, more important themes here. Or so I thought. After reading a couple of interviews with Steve McQueen, the film's co-writer and director, I guess the critics are right: it's just a film about the validity, pain and emptiness of sex addiction. Hmmm. . . Now I wonder if Coleridge intended his albatross to be nothing more than a big. black. bird.Regardless, the film verges on brilliance. Both Michael Fassbender and Michelle Williams deliver beautiful, Oscar-worthy performances.

They are disturbed, yet a part of the normal world. They are living different lives - one adapted to the tune of the world and one dancing to their own freely flowing imbalanced universe.

One wonders why we need to watch Michael Fassbender urinate...or agonize over his many, easy sexual conquests (oh, that so many of us could have his excoriated anxieties and live in bourgeois Manhattan comfort and affluence!), and act like a general creep throughout what has been touted as one of the hot films of 2011 (?)The overall feeling is, without a projected sense of irony, one of shame. Shame that so much film stock and the raw talents of the actors and director were wasted on this nothing of a story. The fault probably lies in the writing - a very Spartan, minimalist script acts like an empty room with bare walls, where we needed the intellectual drive and sagacious attitude of, say, a Midnight Cowboy, or American Psycho, if we're talking about psycho-sexual thrillers set in NYC (or indeed many other psychological dramas set in a number of places).Bottom line? I can't believe IMDb gave this movie 8 out of 10 stars - or, that its users did. E.T. got less than that. Many, many great movies barely reach the 7s on this site. The marketing hype can't live up to the hapless dread and needless emotional suffering put to celluloid and packaged for consumption here.Don't waste your $10.

Early on we see Brandon walking around his flat naked whilst he listens to what sounds like an ex-lover telling him to pick up the phone in an answer phone message but later find out who it actually is. I remain unsure as to why we had to see him walking round naked and using the toilet whilst the message plays, seemed possibly gratuitous. Brandon in his trademark blue scarf From early on we see Brandon indulging in call-girls and masturbation in the shower to fulfil his sexual appetite and before meeting a co-worker for a date he sees a couple having sex against a window in their apartment. My theory is that his obsession made him imagine this happening and provoked a jealousy inside him which later in the film made him perform the same act with a call girl but that could just be me going too deep and Lynch about it all. His world is rocked by the appearance of his sister Sissy (played by Carey Mulligan). She is a singer who crashes at his flat whilst she performs at some bars and is obviously a drifter who is very dependent on people. From the outset it is very uncomfortable between them and some hostility mainly on Brandon's part. This seems to develop as the film progresses with Sissy crawling into his bed only for Brandon to complete flip out and throw her out. It shows a glimpse into a troubled past between the two that is never explored by McQueen and is left open to interpretation to the viewer. Sissy singing an excruciatingly slow rendition of ""New York, New York"" nearly brings him to tears but again no explanation as to why is given before he refuses to praise her performance when she sits with him. I felt this was the moment we were really going to find out more about the relationship between the two but alas I was left disappointed. The key to them having a troubled past for me came through in an answer phone message played near the end, before one of the climatic scenes, where Sissy says ''that we are not bad people''.﻿The film has some fantastic scenes which include Brandon making eye contact with her girl on the subway in a scene which has no dialogue. Throughout watching this scene I was constantly pondering what each movement by the two characters meant in terms of body language, the girl crossing her legs before she got off looked like her way of saying she wasn't interested before she gave him the slip heading out of the subway station. A scene which many will have seen in the trailer shows Brandon going out for a late night run as his sister and boss (in my eyes cringe worthy when chatting up women but played superbly by James Badge Dale) have sex in the living room. The tracking shots of him running and the soft piano music which is played as if through Brandon's Ipod are truly amazing (if anybody knows what the song was I'd love to know). Despite the heavy content there are a few darkly funny moments to be had but the sexual content is about as explicit as you are going to get in cinema. A ménage a trois near the end continues long after you get the idea of what is going on and is unnecessary but the real downside to this movie is that you never learn enough about the characters, especially Brandon, to care deeply as to what happens to them. After finally getting Marianne (weirdly awkward performance by Nicole Beharie) into bed he is unable to perform and is deeply shocked, possibly showing that he cared about her but feels he may get emotionally involved. But beyond this it's really hard to understand why both Brandon and Sissy are the way they are without knowing more about them. Sometimes leaving things open to interpretation improves a film and sometimes it doesn't.2.5/4 a film worth seeing for some unforgettable scenes but falls down in plot and character development From Rolling Picture blogspot",Shame
414,angelgab82,Great Movie!! Simply GREAT.,10,2 February 2012,"I'm not someone who knows how to make criticism... This movie is a wonderful it shows how sex addiction works without going into the boring details.As an addicted myself and in Therapy since a while the movie was just a mirror of what an addict pass in his life journey. What fascinated me about this movie was the simplicity... The most heavy moments that maybe many of us felt before is being in emotional moment!... and that was really interpreted when he met the a lady who wants a serious relationship and true connection.Many of us who are occupied by sex watched porn, visited a prostitute and watched cam girls !!... Are those things SHAMEFUL? maybe yes maybe not none can judge it but if your stuck in this life cycle try to seek HELP!While for me i went to a TV interview about shame movie and I'm in bigger shame now most probably today or tomorrow going to lose my job and my wife already thinking to divorce. Seems people pretend to be open minded in our society but in reality none is... I believe this movie can make many of us start realizing that in this Internet age the addiction is one click away!Best regards and thanks for this lovely movie.",Shame

Brandon starts of as a fairly likable well scrubbed up handsome office boy ,but as the film progresses its clear to see he has many problems ,and most of them probably stemming from a murky past with his sister,with whom he has an cruel abusive destructive and dysfunctional relationship with.After watching the film you will understand that these sort of addictions are just another ""high"" like heroine,alcohol etc, that mask underlying emotional problems .If the addict cant admit hes wrong, and seek help he is just another animal on the loose.Brandon being just one of a million predators out there I imagine,and he gains no sympathy from me.Interesting movie,just keep your finger close to the fast forward button if it gets a bit much......... As the film ends you see Brandon as an animal on the prowl preying for his next fix......medication is a good option for him,and what about his poor sister,she could never satisfy or justify his insatiable behavior.",Shame
416,sarahedouglas,What a waste of my evening,1,9 April 2012,"This is one of the worst films I have seen since Benjamin Button. I feel that an evening of my life has been taken from me that I will never get back. The only positive comment about this film is that it was not as long as Benjamin Button.This is a dull and pointless film. It seems to submit my review it has to be at least 10 lines long.This film is one of those self indulgent films that just panders to the ego of the director. How anyone who watched this back before releasing it felt it had any artistic merit must have been delusional or must have enjoyed watching the dull sex scenes. Some of the reviews said this film was shocking, I certainly did not think so. I do not understand how this film has managed to get a 7.8/10 review. Perhaps I was watching a different film.",Shame
417,flpapa,Shaken but not stirred,6,15 April 2012,"Those of us, and we are legion, with addictive personalities understand there are times in our lives when an emptiness within us hungers inexorably to be filled: with alcohol, tobacco, work, food, the Internet or sex - as in the case of Brandon (Michael Fassbender), Shame's protagonist, an otherwise fastidious office worker who lurches from one casual, meaningless liaison to the next. So we comprehend his desperation, which Fassbender conveys in his progressively more tortured demeanor. However, director Steve McQueen's technically competent attempt at chronicling Brandon's descent into his own private hell ends up as not much more than a semi-documentary case study that leaves the viewer nodding in appreciation of its authenticity yet detached from its hero/victim. More of a back story is needed to elicit sympathy for Brandon, who in his self-absorbed callousness isn't a particularly attractive character to begin with.""We're not bad people. We just come from a bad place,"" says Brandon's sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan), who suddenly shows up in his apartment in the last throes of a painful breakup with an unseen former lover. Sissy, played bravely and convincingly by Mulligan, is starved for affection and turns out to be as emotionally damaged, in her own way, as her brother. She hops into the sack with someone from Brandon's office 20 minutes after meeting him. Some clues about that ""bad place"" would have supplied a third dimension to the siblings to turn them into people we could care about. Or perhaps, in line with the moralistic direction the plot takes, we're supposed not to care too much about Brandon but instead share his disgust at himself. A tragedy is a tale in which a heroic protagonist is undone by a tragic flaw. But there is no tragedy when the protagonist is all flaw and no hero.Tighter editing would have preserved the impact of an early scene in which Sissy, singing in a bar, transforms ""New York, New York"" from a celebration of hope into a dirge, a lament for broken dreams. Tighter editing would have helped throughout the film, even though McQueen's conscious decision to have his camera follow Brandon in a seemingly real-time, linear arc adds to the impression that we are watching a train wreck in slow motion, the shameful encounters cascading one into another until in the end, with the protagonist literally trapped on a train, his life goes off the rails, and he is ultimately brought to his knees.The prevailing blues and grays bring home the bleak mood of the film - there is no hint of where and how redemption may be found - although the city is, on the whole, portrayed as being more soulless than sinister. In two climactic scenes, though, McQueen floods the screen with a montage of red and yellow that evoke the infernal flames. In the first of them, featuring an actress felicitously named Calamity Chang, the joyless, jackhammer action punctuated with closeups of Fassbender's gargoyle-like grimaces is enough to put the viewer off sex for a while. The second scene McQueen shoots as one from a silent movie. That may be the only viable artistic choice, yet it leaves the suspicion of a cop-out. Does Fassbender have the chops to express his anguish in full stereo sound?We know sex addiction exists. We know it is damaging to the addict and, indirectly, to those he loves or should love. So why make a movie about it that doesn't provide us with much, if any, insight into the person who must struggle with it? The talents of the director and his two leads would have been better spent on a more meaningful project. 'Tis a shame.",Shame

It's not TERRIBLE, but I honestly found it to be very boring. I felt like it went too fast, and it wasn't confusing or anything just....I don't know boring period. The acting is good yes, but the story line just didn't feel real enough. Usually movies that deal with real issues in life can draw me in, but this one just made me yawn. I overall just didn't care for the direction the movie took. The music however, is beautiful. In the end, I found the film to be decent. I felt like most of it was sex, rather than acting though. I'm not against sex scenes in movies, but if the whole movie is based on acting in sex scenes then definitely not interesting.",Shame
419,harsh-356-444302,An Empty Movie about nothing,3,13 May 2012,"For an hour and a half almost nothing happens. The film has almost no plot. The protagonist does not seem like a sex addict, he looks more like a normal single man who likes to sleep with different women without commitments and watching porn. The film ends and we still don't know what is the damn problem with his sister, the only thing we know is that she decides to commit suicide. People who say they see a complex and dark story in this script must have a very boring life. There are a lot of scenes that add nothing to the story. As the interminable scene where Sissy sings ""New York, New York"" or the subway trips where nothing happens. I do not question the work of the actors, but the script is very poor and this movie is full of disposable parts.

Same with Cary Mulligan's song ""New York, New York,"" with verses that seemed never to end. She can sing, and everyone got that during the first few minutes - but making it a production, transformed it to boring. Perhaps if the entire film was shot in Russia or Poland, the slow stationery style would have worked better, but this was New York City, where time and people move. Pace picked up for the night jogging and the climactic attempted suicide scene, but the latter was telegraphed in excess before.",Shame

These range from Fassbender's brilliant performance, the raw nature of the scenes in this movie, the cinematography, and of course, the soundtrack. The movie honestly tests its viewers to show the hardship that Brandon (Fassbender) had to endure due to something out of his control which even he realises is disgusting and seems as though it was born from a traumatic experience Brandon shared with his sister (played by Mulligan). Brandon's sister manages to cause turbulence in his life as she starts living out of his apartment also which manages to destroy the walls of Brandon's secret life which creates more problems for Brandon who finds no advantage to letting himself be part of a meaningful relationship with anyone, including one of his co-workers who he manages to connect with but becomes unable to perform sexually as he doesn't want to allow himself to feel the connection.

The characters are perfectly brought to life by Fassbender and Mulligan, who were brave to take these roles. It features one of the best depictions of mental illness and addiction in cinema that could only have been executed by Fassbender and McQueen working together. I can easily recommend this film to anyone and be confident in the fact that they will love it. Ever since I seen the film in 2012 it has held a solid spot as my number favourite film.",Shame
423,jack-orozco,"Shame was definitely good, but could've had more substance.",7,21 November 2012,"I personally found Shame to be a very interesting piece of drama to watch. I found the camera-perspectives and visual sequences of the film to be very well done, for example the scene in which Brandon goes out for a jog after hearing Sissy having sex. Some would argue that scenes like the jogging scene were unnecessarily long (I will mention the subject of unnecessarily long scenes again later), but I think that they portrayed the point they were trying to convey well, like in the jogging scene, I felt that Brandon was attempting to ignore his sister's sexual life completely, or detach himself from it, and I got that. I think almost of the the scenes in this film conveyed a certain dramatic power and got across the point they intended to. The camera-perspective and visual sequence elements of the film made it both visually interesting and made it seem to effectively keep my attention without having to resort to being too jumpy or fast-paced, which I enjoyed. I liked the way that the filmmakers didn't seem to be afraid of pulling off some of the things that others may have chosen not to do. Obviously, one of these things is the non-fear of full nudity, which I found actually very refreshing, far too many filmmakers are afraid of losing a portion of their potential audience due to the audience not finding the content appropriate. I'm glad that Steve McQueen chose to make the best piece of drama that he could, as opposed to the one which would make the most money. I also think that the lack of dialogue or even noise altogether was very effective in creating a sobering atmosphere. I think that Steve McQueen did a good job with the directing and he and Abi Morgan did a decent job with the script writing. The script didn't seem phenomenal, but it flowed naturally and worked well. I always look forward to watching both Michael Fassbender and Carey Mulligan, and they did not fail to deliver. I loved Fassbender's portrayal of Brandon, he really brought out a rich and fully developed character. The seamless and natural-feeling transitions between timidness, confidence, despair and fury were spot-on and really made the character feel very volatile. Carey Mulligan was also very good, she performed extremely naturally and her singing was also impressive, but unfortunately, whilst being very good, her performance didn't make her stand out. At least, not next to the tension that Fassbender's character managed to create. I felt like Mulligan was trapped in Fassbender's shadow, not in the sense of their acting skill but in the characters that were created. Despite the fact that, as a whole, I thought that it had some scenes which were beautifully done, one of my only big complains would be the sex scene in which Brandon has a threesome. Whilst ending very poignantly with Brandon being visibly destroyed by his sex addiction, I felt like the scene went on for far longer than was necessary. It felt like I was just watching high-quality, bad visibility porn. During the rest of the film, I thought that the balance of conservatism and liberalism of the sexual explicitness was about right and I was glad they had done it right, but the threesome scene felt like they were abusing the subject of the film and I was disappointed when the scene went on for too long. However, I found the rest of it to be conceptually intriguing and it's dramatic methods to be brilliantly effective. I personally thought that whilst the film was good, I required more from it. I wanted more substance, I wanted to know how Brandon had developed his sex addiction, I felt like the end of the film was more like the ending of the first half of a film; it had shown his issue, it had shown what effect it had on him and it had just shown how that was affecting those who cared for him when the film ended, and I felt myself needing to know whether his sister's attempted suicide had any affect on him and his addiction. One part of me enjoyed this, it liked the fact that the creators of Shame didn't feel pressured to have the same type of ending as many other dramas in this style, but overall I felt like there was so much more potential to the idea that Steve McQueen and Abi Morgan could've explored. To conclude, I thoroughly enjoyed watching Shame, I wanted more from it in the realms of story development, but the film as a whole contained some lovely elements and it is among my mental category of good films.",Shame
424,mrgsdim,"A true ""Shame"" for all cinema fans",1,4 December 2012,"I honestly cannot understand how such an awful movie might receive even one positive comment. There is no plot, the performances are flat, it is unbelievably slow and the ending scene is meaningless. There is no message, even the presumed inner-drama of the protagonist is not described is such a way in order to attract the attention or even the sympathy of the audience. Apparently Brandon's problem is that he cannot get sexual satisfaction unless he pays for it. The writer does not make the slightest effort to exploit Brandon's ""fetish"" which could make the film a bit more intriguing. Even worse, the relationship between Brandon and his sister-which could have been used in order to describe Brandon's personality or explain how it was formulated- is not analyzed in depth and does not add anything to the story. This movie has nothing to offer. Just a waste of time. The title is right on the spot. A true ""Shame"".",Shame
425,hsocolovsky,"Extraordinary, but there is a SERIOUS musical rip-off here",8,7 December 2012,"I will not delve into the story, directing, acting, cinematography, since many reviews already convey much praise towards this film's excellence in all those areas, and I share that praise of course. Steve McQueen is a sincere and extraordinary visionary (I also praise Hunger as a groundbreaking film in every respect), Michael Fassbender is such a powerful actor with immense character and personality. Mulligan is amazing as well, and the pacing and building of sequences here are masterful.The issue I want to comment is that ""Journey to the Line"", the hauntingly beautiful and powerful piece written by Hans Zimmer in 1998 for Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line, has been ripped off by this film's composer, Harry Escott, and that rip-off is used TWICE in this film: At the opening, in the beautifully acted and shot sequence of Fassbender's character, Brandon, in the subway, making eye contact and later stalking a beautiful female passenger, and later on, in the sequence where he hires two prostitutes and has sex with both at the same time, which alternates with the sequence of him provoking a guy's girlfriend in a bar and then going into the gay bar across the street.Why do I think it is important to mention this? Because I honestly thought, while watching the film, that it was an honest arrangement of Zimmer's piece and that such would be acknowledged in the credits, but no. No acknowledgment. I know the piece well, it is a truly beautiful work and I've spotted some other semi-rip-offs of it in other films, including P.T. Anderson's Magnolia, but in the case of McQueen's Shame the rip-off is SO obvious, it even extends to the slower strings coda and uses the very same fast and thin percussive pulse in the background (constant 1/16s in the 4/4 measures). There are changes made in this version, of course, but are just ways to justify it and make it ""seem different"", like the typical inversion of chords in the melody.The film also uses diverse pieces by J.S. Bach, including one of the Goldberg Variations that has become so popular in cinema (The English Patient, Hannibal, Silence of the Lambs, etc), a slow and well done arrangement of ""New York New York"" sung by Mulligan, and lots of great jazz pieces. In all these cases the credit is given at the end, to each and every composer and performer, but not so with ""Journey to the Line"". It may seem Im taking this too seriously, but as a composer and film lover I think this points should be mentioned. I am not biased even though Terrence Malick is my favorite living filmmaker and the piece used in his 1998 opus is ripped off. No, this is a matter of respect and acknowledgment to great artistic works and the sad problem of creative lack of originality, especially in a film as extraordinary and deep as this one. Uncredited music piece ripped off and used twice, so two points off the score.

I'm thinking we must not have.Shame dives into the life of a man living with an addiction to sex. The first 10 minutes of this movie effectively introduces him, his addiction, his relationship with humanity (sister included), and barely uses any words to do so. You shouldn't need a lot of dialogue when emotions are conveyed with facial expressions, effective cinematography, and great editing. This film is loaded with all of that.Obviously films are subjective, but I feel those who say they didn't get to ""know' the characters at all must always need everything spoon fed to them. I am not a sex addict, but still connected with both Fassbender and Mulligan. I found the development both subtle and extremely realistic. Does everything need to always have that Hollywood ending? Should everything get wrapped up nicely and leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling when you walk out of the theater? I definitely don't think so.

437,koleleko,A masterpiece of the 21. Century,9,18 March 2017,"We follow the life of Brandon, a man to such an extent dependent on sex and pornography that it is destroying his emotional life. The situation is quite alarming, because our protagonist is unable to bind with people, in bed he's just an animal driven by his whimsy, sex filled with emotions kills his pleasure, and a relation with his sisters is almost non- existent (each scene in which the two of them have dialogue is filled with anxiety, restlessness and timed anger). The first 20 minutes beautifully illustrates what will be the rest of the film: there is not much conversation among the characters, the narrative is a rare, much of the information the viewer receives via visuals (though not one scene stand out, it can be remarked that the film is professionally framed, essentially balm for eyes) or over the score (which is excellent). In addition to the score, the soudtrack is not bad eater, it fits well. Although explicit scenes are short, the film is well deserving of its NC-17 rating, so I recommend that you watch this alone for the sake of avoiding the inconvenience and additional explanation. Fassbender in this role ( and with that in hunger) proved to be one of the best actors working today, on par with DDL and Pheonix, and a lot of girls and some boys will be delighted by the information that he appears in the film ""whole"".

Shame is not displayed, researched and uncovered, and we do not see how it develops, influences the main character and the story, and resolution is missing, nor questions left open.In my view this movie is about loneliness, our coldness when it gets to relations and letting other people in.It's much an existential movie, embodied into a story with very modern and down to earth categories.I was pretty much left with an impression that the main character has wasted a lot of time and money for sex, and impression that I probably wasted time to watch this movie too.

442,fsantoni13,McQueen and Fassbender's sexually driven descent into despair,9,27 July 2013,"The opening shot of ""Shame"" could be a painting; the camera stares down at a man lying naked on his bed, the wrinkled blue silk sheets of his bed drape over his pelvis as he stares back. His body is pale, his ribcage is visible, and his eyes are cold and motionless. An inner confusion and anguish is palpable. This opening image is a spotlight on Brandon (Michael Fassbender), a sex addict, and his psyche, as he is lost in the despair of his mind and his body's physical urges. ""Shame"" is set in Manhattan, where Brandon is a handsome and affluent thirty-something executive who lives in a lofty apartment by himself. He is a shut-in, who spends his time eating take-out, hiring prostitutes, and watching an excess of pornography. His private and shameful life is disturbed when his sister, Sissy (the wonderful Carey Mulligan), arrives and asks to stay for an indefinite amount of time. Both Sissy and Brandon are troubled by a childhood that is never revealed. ""We're not bad people, we just come from a bad place,"" she says. ""Shame,"" the second effort of director Steve McQueen is just as uncompromising as his first, the 2008 drama ""Hunger"" about the 1981 Irish hunger strike. Both star Michael Fassbender, both tackle controversial and touchy subjects, and both feature McQueen's methodical, urbane direction. With ""Shame,"" McQueen is nothing but visceral in his depiction of an addict and the consequential demise and destruction of his mind and life. Sissy's arrival marks the beginning of Brandon's Dante-esque journey into self-destruction. Through small and intimate moments shown as a collage (marvelously married with Harry Escott's score) Brandon's life and slow descent is shown; his fixed gaze on a married woman on the subway, a beating he receives after a ribald statement to a woman and her boyfriend, and a desperate encounter at a club when he's at his mental nadir. Appropriately portraying Brandon's overdose on sex is an especially difficult task that McQueen handles with a graceful eye and camera. Rated NC-17, the film does not overflow with nudity and sex, but instead, the film is a crescendo of self-afflicted misery, arrested development, and addiction as a coping method for trauma. Long stretches of the film are wordless, as McQueen' strength is in his images. ""Actions count, not words,"" Brandon says when he's reprimanding Sissy, a statement that McQueen takes to heart, such as with his opening shot, Brandon solemnly jogging through a gloomy Manhattan, the golden tint in film as Brandon indulges in a threesome, or simply, a woman's bare shoulder with the rest of the shot out of focus. It all adds up to Brandon's life, his thoughts, needs, shame, and regret. Cinematographer Sean Bobbitt portrays New York as a city of glass and white-walled penthouses, filled with sexually driven and beautiful people looking for the next hook-up. It is ruled by its nightlife, and Brandon is one of the walking undead, single-minded in his thoughts and actions. Similar to ""Eyes Wide Shut"" in its sexuality and audacity, McQueen makes you feel his film with its eventual tragedy and makes you question the characters and yourself with its ambiguous ending. However, the real star here is Fassbender, giving himself up totally to his character, stripping himself naked, literally, for his role and evoking all of Brandon's emotional and physical quirks. He has disappeared into this character. With Fassbender, McQueen has found the DeNiro to his Scorsese, a partnership that will continue, as McQueen's next film ""Twelve Years a Slave"" will once again feature the pair.",Shame
443,nmubarak-84904,Fassbender the Great!,8,28 June 2019,"If you ever, even remotely, doubt Fassbender's talent, then you can't by any means miss this movie. He gave such a brilliant performance. He took us the audience to another dimension where you don't care about the truth, or about what's going on anymore. He drags you along with him in his anguish and misery, you have nothing to do but to completely sink deep in with him. He is just magnificent beyond words!",Shame
444,kirkwhi,Great Film ... for Adults,9,14 January 2012,"I don't know what to say about this film. I saw it a few hours ago and it's still on my mind. It's one of the most graphic legitimate films I've ever seen in my life. It's uncomfortable at times. It's a fantastic commentary on addiction. Michael Fassbender is phenomenal. If this film were more accessible to the public, he might be up for an Oscar. I don't mind the extremely graphic scenes in the film, and I understand why they are there, but I think you could edit this film into an R rated version that at least older adults could watch. It might move a little more smoothly as well. All and all, I enjoyed it a lot. See it but leave your kids with your parents for the night.",Shame
