0,bkoganbing,Street Justice Dispensed,9,19 April 2008,"Ethan Hawke, bright eyed and innocent, reports to his training officer for his first day on the job in narcotics in the LAPD. He never could have fathomed just how much he would learn on that very first Training Day.His training officer is Denzel Washington, a thirteen year veteran on the police who's put in a few years in plainclothes in Narcotics. He certainly has the experience, but just what kind of experience and what he imparts to Hawke is the subject of Training Day.A film like Training Day will rise and fall with the performances of these two characters since one or the other and mostly both is on screen from the beginning. Fortunately both Washington and Hawke complement each other's performances like jigsaw puzzle fit.It is no accident that Denzel Washington won his second Oscar, his first as Best Actor. This performance is working on so many levels it's astonishing. Washington is at all times, charming, capable, corrupt, violent, street smart, and arrogant. What I liked most about it is how the various facets of this character are revealed bit by bit to the audience and to Hawke though not at the same time.As for Ethan Hawke it takes him to realize just exactly what he's dealing with in a training officer. Hawke was nominated himself as Best Supporting Actor, but lost to Jim Broadbent for Iris. Still it remains his career role so far.Corruption in the Los Angeles Police Department isn't exactly a new story. In fact one of the supporting players, Scott Glenn who plays a drug peddler and well, did another film about LAPD corruption in Extreme Justice. LA Confidential also dealt with this issue recently, another fine film.Denzel Washington is a great example in this film of the arrogance of power. He's a guy who dispenses more street justice than going through the traditional system. So with what happens to him here, he gets one of the best comeuppances ever seen on the big screen.And I won't say what it is, but you've got to see Training Day to find out.",Training Day
1,SnoopyStyle,The power of Denzel,8,18 August 2015,LAPD narcotics detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) takes rookie detective Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) on his training day. Alonzo is a harsh spoken street-wise cop pushing the envelop in South Central L.A. Mostly he goes right over the edge.This is all Denzel all the time. It's his relentless power. There's no logic or plot worthy of following. That's not the point of this movie. The audience is Ethan Hawke as he tries at first to submit to the Denzel hurricane. Then we're trying gather our feet in the storm. Finally we have to make a decision about his character. This is a tour-de-force performance from Denzel and nothing less.,Training Day
2,classicsoncall,"""Let's suit up ladies, time to punch in.""",8,29 April 2006,"I can usually fill a full page of notes regarding my thoughts on a film as I'm watching it, but this time I came away with only about a half dozen character quotes that sounded cool at the time. Looking them over now however, makes them seem cliché ridden, offered in an attempt to manipulate the viewer. That 'smiles and cries' explanation offered by Ethan Hawkes character was an eyebrow raiser, and how about it 'taking a wolf to catch a wolf'. The topper though was Denzel Washington's tattoo - ""Death is Certain, Life is Not"". That one prefaced the ending, since Washington's Alonzo wasn't a bad cop in a 'Die Hard' yipee-ki-yay sort of way, he was just a bad rogue cop.Let's face it, if ""Training Day"" represents a rookie's first day in narcotics, then the bad guys have won. Alternating hits of PCP, beer, and who knows what else, it's pretty amazing Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) even made it through that day. That's not including guns to the head, rifle blasts through the 'office' car, introduction to a Latino bathtub and falls from high rise apartment buildings after being beaten to a pulp. Even with steely resolve and a strong constitution, there's got to be a better way to make a living.Story semantics and odds defying coincidences aside, Washington and Hawke turn in strong performances as cops on opposite sides of the moral fence. It's not enough though to tone down the way over the top situations and confrontations the pair find themselves in and out of, all without a moment's rest. Try this while watching - take a deep breath.",Training Day
3,gavin6942,A Look Inside the Los Angeles Police Department?,7,11 May 2010,"""Training Day"", to me, seemed a bit far-fetched, at least at the beginning. I couldn't see an officer behaving the way Alonzo (Denzel Washington) does. But he's sort of undercover, so I get it. And luckily, the film takes steps to correct his extreme behavior as it goes on, explaining things more clearly.Denzel Washington is widely considered to be at his peak here, and won an Oscar for his performance. Sadly, I think Ethan Hawke gets overlooked. He put in a great performance himself, and is generally not given the credit he deserves. Maybe he's not as high-profile as Denzel, but the man has been in the business as long time and this film really showcased his skills.",Training Day
4,lee_eisenberg,The post-September 11 world.,7,18 January 2006,"Some people say that the country became more violent after Kennedy got assassinated; following that argument, one might say that we got even more violent still after September 11. Certainly, Kennedy's assassination destroyed the image of a squeaky-clean, wholesome America, and September 11 changed the way that we felt that we could do everything.Whether or not we became more violent after 9/11, ""Training Day"" offers some insight into that. Released right after September 11 (it's release even got delayed because of the latter), the movie stars Denzel Washington as corrupt cop Alonzo Harris, teaming up with rookie Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). As this is a movie about the gritty world of crime, I shouldn't have to identify that it's pretty violent. By the time that the movie had gotten released, movies had been showing violence for over thirty years. But if in fact we did become more violent, then the movie might have been a look at the future. Movies about corrupt cops are nothing new, but they did an OK job with this one.As for other aspects, Denzel Washington won an Oscar for his role, making him the first African-American to win Best Actor (Sidney Poitier is actually Bahamian). Some may ask whether or not it he would have won had 9/11 not happened, but not me. I say that he deserved the Oscar.",Training Day
5,jboothmillard,Training Day,7,13 June 2007,"I think the main reason I wanted to see this film was because of a great star winning the Oscar, and then I heard that the villain he plays is a cop. Basically Jake Hoyt (Oscar nominated Ethan Hawke) wants to become a professional LAPD narcotics cop, i.e. stop drug trafficking, and he is teamed up with veteran, swaggering and streetwise narcotics cop Alonzo Harris (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Denzel Washington) for 24 hours to learn and prove his mettle. But as they are searching and investigating the big drug case, along the way they clear the streets of other (possibly drug related) crimes, and Jake is finding it very difficult to cope with Alonzo's questionable and very rough techniques, particularly when the guilty should go to prison. As the film continues, you see what a genuine scum Alonzo really is, and why he does not deserve to be a cop, and he and Jake do eventually turn on each other in the concluding scenes. Alonzo does meet an unexpected death, being killed by thugs (most likely the ones he insulted). It is a dark, pretty engaging and very stylised look at American law enforcement. Also starring Scott Glenn as Roger, Tom Berenger as Stan Gursky, Harris Yulin as Doug Rosselli, Raymond J. Barry as Lou Jacobs, Cliff Curtis as Smiley, and hip hop stars Dr. Dre as Paul, Snoop Dogg as Blue and Macy Gray as Sandman's Wife. Denzel Washington was number 28 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 40 on The World's Greatest Actor, and Alonzo Harris was number 50 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains. Very good!",Training Day
6,ccthemovieman-1,Denzel's Definitely Different,6,1 September 2006,"A departure from being the normal good guy made this Denzel Washington movie a bit different.....and unpopular with a lot of his fans. I found it a very intense story of two Los Angeles cops: one being a veteran corrupt one ""Alonzo"" (Washington) and the other a rookie, honest one ""Jake"" (Ethan Hawke). This is a bit sordid at times, with over 100 f-words, but was almost mesmerizing at times and hard to put down once the film started. At least that was the case on the first viewing. On the second, I didn't find the whole thing that appealing.I don't know if this is a realistic look at the crime areas of Los Angeles, but if it is, wow: pretty frightening. Washington's viewpoints, however twisted with this particular character, made some sense in parts, sad to say. Overall, not a pleasant film but certainly an interesting one.",Training Day
7,dbdumonteil,"Death is certain ,life is not.",7,14 July 2004,"Pervasive language indeed!One of the only sentences which does not include a swearword is the one tattooed on Washington's arm which I use for my title .A motto which sums up a movie which somewhat renews the ""two-cop team"" routine.When the movie begins,I was thinking ""another film where two very different cops -the veteran and the rookie- team up for the best and the worst"".I was wrong.It's not ""48 hours"" all over again either.Actually everything happens in the short space of one day ,it actually ends in the middle of the night,so the title is thoroughly appropriate .Hawkes portrays an idealist whose ideas will be put to the test in a very violent way.""I was like you are now"" says Washington.You can forgive some implausibilities (the cousinand the wallet is the biggest) and enjoy the excellent haunting soundtrack (the final cast and credits avoid the obligatory ""rock"" or ""rap "" track and opts for an ominous (almost dirge -like ) music.Tom Berenger is the third name in the final credits,but ,oddly his part does not exceed three minutes and he's got only one or two lines.",Training Day
8,blanche-2,A corrupt man in a corrupt world,7,30 July 2009,"Ethan Hawke has a ""Training Day"" - from hell - and learns that his trainer (Denzel Washington) is way out there in this 2001 film directed by Antoine Fuqua. Featured in the film are Scott Glenn, Tom Berenger, Harris Yulin, Eva Mendes, and Snoop Dogg.Hawke is a young family man, Jake, who is teamed up with a decorated narcotics detective, Alonzo, to see if Jake has what it takes to work the street and go undercover. Alonzo is a very unsettling guy - joking one minute, mean the next - and Jake doesn't know quite how to take him. He just knows the job means a lot to him.Gradually it dawns on him that a) Alonzo is more corrupt than any of the perpetrators he says he's after; and b) he's setting Jake up so that he's part of some dirty work and therefore won't be able to talk.Really top-notch, edgy performance from Denzel Washington, who is always full of surprises, here playing an unpredictable character. This was his Oscar winning role, and it was deserved, though there's no question that he deserved it in the past too. The film is full of action, violence, and really raw characters - one certainly gets a sense of the mean streets from watching this film. Ethan Hawke acts just as a man who doesn't know what's going on would - unsure, embarrassed, nervous, scared, but very determined and quick-thinking, as he realizes what he's gotten himself into.Shocking, violent, bloody, and fast - that about sums it up. Some excellent performances along the way, too, from everyone involved.",Training Day
9,Quinoa1984,Hard Boiled and extremely well acted cop drama,9,5 October 2001,"Antoine Fuqua's Training Day is a film that gets a big boost in the acting department from Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke, but it's script is also acute and sharp as a knife when it comes to showing corrupt cops in Los Angeles.Hawke plays Jake Loit, a rookie cop with 19 months training who's gonna get some real training (narc training) on a day in L.A. from a unconventional detective (Washington).  You know a cop movie will be quite different when in the first 30 minutes a cop is smoking dope (laced with PCP), though it isn't quite simple how it got to that anyway.  As is much of the movie, which never takes the easy way out of scenes (outside of a unreal ending) and stays in it's region quite well.  Sometimes it seems like we've seen this before, but Washington is so convincing as a villain type, which he usually avoids, that the film is overall quite entertaining and worthwhile. Hawke is also noteworthy as the rookie whose life and perspective of what he once thought of (the LAPD) will change.  Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Macy Gray co-star.  A-",Training Day

This pressure cooker is about to blow. Almost as different as night and day. Denzel Washington is a renegade undercover cop that blurs the line separating good from bad when he teaches a young officer(Ethan Hawke)how to survive the streets on his first day of training as a narcotics cop. Excessive violence seems to be order of the day. Compelling and solid story. Also in the cast are: Dr. Dre, Scott Glenn, Snoop Dogg and Eva Mendes. Two hours well spent.",Training Day
11,Theo Robertson,"Very Good In Places , Rather Poor In Other Places",7,22 July 2003,"Jake Hoyt teams up with Alonzo Harris . Hoyt is a newbie plains clothes undercover cop while Harris has been in the job for years and both men are chalk and cheese where personality is concerned . We`ve seen this sort of scenario umpteen times in other buddy movies , only thing is this usually only happens in comedy dramas and if you`re tuning into TRAINING DAY for some light hearted laughs you`re going to be very disappointed
!!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!! TRAINING DAY is a grim gritty hard hitting drama , the sort of movie Hollywood rarely makes these days with the first half being a very compelling intelligent movie that really holds your attention . Unfortunately about half way through there`s a slightly ridiculous plot twist that threatens to sink the whole movie and had me begging the question "" Why on earth would Harris and his corrupt buddies invite Hoyt along to do a job with them "" ? I mean Harris has only known his partner for a few hours at the most while the other cops don`t know him at all so why would they trust Hoyt to keep his mouth shut ? I guess that`s to show how evil Harris is and how morally upstanding Hoyt is at the climax , another bit I found faintly ridiculous . I mean if you`re a home boy would you side with a corrupt black cop who`d let you walk away from a crime if the price was right or would you side with an untouchable white cop who will see justice done at any price ? Yeah that`s what I thought too . I don`t want anyone picking me up wrong thinking I hate this film because I don`t , it`s very well acted by all the cast and even after the plot twist halfway through it still held my attention , especially when Hoyt is in the latinos` house . It`s just that it seemed the studio decided to treat the audience as fools at the last moment which is a common fault with Hollywood movies for the last few years . I was going to give TRAINING DAY 9 out of ten up untill the halfway point , so overall the movie gets 7 out of 10
Seeing as everyone else has brought up the subject of who deserved the oscar I will say some days I think Washington deserved it while some days I think Crowe deserved it , but 2001 wasn`t a vintage year for performances and if the Oscar voters had put Jim Broadbent in the best actor category he would have deserved to have won it for IRIS",Training Day
12,zardoz-13,An abrasive but standard-issue buddy police picture with a great Denzel performance,8,7 February 2008,"Denzel Washington delivers a dynamic performance easily worth an Oscar as a rogue cop in director Antoine Fuqua's gritty urban crime thriller ""Training Day,"" co-starring Ethan Hawke, Scott Glenn, Snoop Doggie Dog, Macy Gray, and Tom Berenger. This unsavory but exciting R-rated law & order melodrama paints a considerably less than flattering portrait of police corruption in Los Angeles. Essentially, scenarist David (""U-571"") Ayers has exploited the recent Ramparts police scandal in the L.A.P.D. as the basis for his controversial but contrived screenplay. While he infuses the film with his charismatic personality, Washington goes against-the-grain for a change as a dyed-in-the-wool villain who won't hesitate to double-cross friends. Not only does bad-ass Denzel tote a chrome-plated automatic pistol under each armpit, but also he cruises his asphalt domain in a customized obsidian-black 1978 Monte Carlo. Gear heads will drool over Denzel's ride which doubles as his office. As an extension of Alonzo's amoral character, the Monte Carlo compliments his roguish personality. Sadly, as psychological actioneers rate, ""Training Day"" lacks the tenacity that Washington imparts to his warlord-like antagonist. Fuqua and Ayer employ sentimental stratagems to align our sympathies with Ethan Hawke's half-hearted hero who turns wimp in the end. Surprisingly, unpardonable logistics sabotage Fuqua's mise-en-scene, especially in a rooftop foot chase! Further, the filmmakers bank on sheer coincidence to bail out the hero. A ""Scarface"" inspired scene as Latino gangsters prepare to ice our hero in a bathtub illustrates the worst of the coincidences. Ultimately, if ""Training Day"" constitutes the best Hollywood can offer as a cautionary tale about police corruption, we're all in trouble. Basically, the Darwinian message of ""Training Day"" is big-fish eat little-fish, or survival of the fittest, so what does it matter if how criminals buy it in the end if justice is served? As cynical as ""Training Day"" tries to portray itself, it winds up as a formulaic but flawed thriller about legal courtroom justice versus street justice.Basically, this abrasive but standard-issue buddy police picture does nothing countless other thrillers like Sidney Lumet's ""Serpico"" (1973) haven't done better. Specifically, ""Training Day"" resembles a white-washed version of director Abel Ferrara's uncompromising 1994 dirty cop saga ""Bad Lieutenant,"" starring Harvey Keitel as a heroin-shooting, trigger-happy, N.Y.P.D. detective in deep trouble with loan sharks. Like the Keitel character, Washington's renegade cop shoulders his share of problems. He has teed-off the Russians (presumably their mafia) during a wild and woolly weekend in Las Vegas, and they want payback. Even Alonzo's police superiors refuse to believe he is anything more than a walking dead man. Alonzo aims to prove them wrong and his narcissism makes him perversely appealing. Some of the problems with ""Training Day"" is what we learn about Alonzo's off-screen activities seems more interesting than what we see him do. Take the encounter with the Russians in Vegas. Apparently, Alonzo snapped, killed a guy, and the Russians have dispatched hit men to get him the same way the Colombians nailed Al Pacino in Brian De Palma's ""Scarface."" Nevertheless, Alonzo never loses his cool in ""Training Day,"" because he believes he is in control, particularly with regard to a rookie auditioning for the sixth man slot on his elite team.""Training Day"" chronicles a 24-hour span in the life of young, idealistic, rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke of ""Dead Poets Society"" & ""Hamlet"") who wants only to 'protect and serve' the public. Since joining the Los Angeles Police Department 19 months ago, Hoyt has been angling for a big break. Thirteen-year veteran L.A.P.D. Det. Sgt. Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington of ""Remember the Titans""), who heads up an elite narcotics squad, provides that break. Harris gives Hoyt the chance of a life-time to prove he can perform undercover without getting himself smoked by a paranoid drug dealer. If Hoyt can make a favorable impression on Alonzo, he assures his young beautiful wife breast feeding their 10-month age, infant daughter they will be bound for a better life.As a typical, formulaic American movie, ""Training Day"" relies on rewards and punishment to shape its morality. Hoyt interprets this assignment as his ticket to the big time. Not only is Hoyt in for a rude awakening, but also so is the audience. By the time those fateful 24 hours elapse; Hoyt will emerge as an entirely different person. His saintly ideals will be tarnished as well as his own sense of innocence. Anyway, Ethan Hawke gives an evocative performance, but the actions of his character ultimately undercut the brilliance of his acting. He plays a stereotypical hero who balks at doing what a hero's got to do. Hoyt's last confrontation with Alonzo underlines the weakness inherent in Hawke's character. As the young, hungry cop, Hoyt represents hope, so his refusal to rub out Alonzo smacks more of political correctness than dramatic closure. Similarly, ""Training Day"" compares these two characters and reminds us in no uncertain terms who epitomizes good and evil.Director Antoine Fuqua, whose credits include ""The Replacement Killers"" and the slick Jamie Fox caper ""Bait,"" gives ""Training Day"" a sleek, sharp, and snazzy look. Unfortunately, while the movie amounts to a visual feast for the eyes, David Ayer's script degenerates during the second half of the action. The hero stands for law and order, but he refuses to get himself dirty do his job. Clearly, ""Training Day"" contends that what you sow, so shall you reap. Anton Fuqua and David Ayer have made a passable film that provides reassurances if the cops cannot take care of corruption, then criminals will.",Training Day
13,Boba_Fett1138,What a delightful surprise!,9,6 January 2004,"Denzel Washington's Oscar winning performance made me want to see this movie, or otherwise I would have never ever watched this movie because normally I don't watch ""ghetto, gangster, set in present day, with rappers in it, movies"" like this. But the movie turned out to be way better than expected and it's arguably one of the best movie of 2001.The movie has an amazing pace that covers one of the days in the life of rookie narcotic officer Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) and rouge LAPD veteran Harris (Denzel Washington) on their first (and only?) day together on the job. The movie gets nowhere boring or slow and has tons of surprising plot twist that make the story very interesting and even tense multiple times throughout the movie.The power of the movie is in Denzel Washington's Oscar worthy performance and the chemistry between the two main characters. Denzel Washington is perfect as ""bad guy"" and delivers his lines in a most amazing way. His lines sometimes seem to come straight out of a Quentin Tarantino movie. Also notable is Scott Glenn in his role as a rotten old drugs lord.The atmosphere and style of the movie feels very realistic mainly thanks to the cinematography, nice fast editing, script and the performance's by the cast.Way better than you would expect it to be, give it a chance!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Training Day

Denzel steals the show, but Ethan still really makes a mark. This is immensely gritty, with many honest looks at what happens in the bad neighborhoods of LA, as told by a screenwriter and director who actually lived there. The authenticity is a huge part of why this is so compelling. With a few exceptions, you really feel like this could happen(there are things that are not very credible. Others have already detailed them, I don't really have anything to add), and it really provokes a discussion of police brutality. Despite an episodic nature, every scene has a distinct purpose in the overall narrative, although for a number of them, you won't realise what it is until later.This contains a lot of strong language, some brutal violence, and a little nudity.

20,anaconda-40658,Washington Training in Corruption.,6,14 September 2015,"Training Day (2001): Dir: Antoine Faqua / Cast: Denzel Washington, Ethan Hawke, Scott Glenn, Tom Bergenger, Harris Yulin: Action thriller about the faults in the justice system. Ethan Hawke prepares for his first day of training on the narcotics team with a meeting with Denzel Washington who plays by his own rules. He begins by forcing Hawke to smoke pot then Washington proceeds to dish out his own brand of justice on the guilty. Hawke can sense trouble as corrupt law caves in leading to an extremely violent climax. Director Antoine Faqua previously made Bait, which contained similar themes. It observes corrupt justice and plays out many scenes with uncertainty. Flawless performance by Washington who is of the law at first appearance before true nature emerges. This is a very different performance from him and that is what render this film viewable above the violence. What is interesting is his downfall right after he yells, ""I am the police. King Kong ain't got nothing on me!"" Hawke is superb as a cop wanting to do right but forced to comply with wrong. He will be placed in a difficult position in the third act.

Denzel Washington plays veteran Alonzo Harris whose methods seem questionable, to say the least. Harris argues that one has to become a wolf to take down a wolf. Will Hoyt make it through the day alive, let alone uncorrupted?""Training Day"" had a lukewarm reception at the box office the first weekend of its release in 2001, but the profits steadily increased for the next six weeks as word-of-mouth spread. The greatness of ""Training Day"" is not simply due to the intriguing story and excellent writing, but also the superb casting. Hawke is perfect as the naive, but ambitious rookie and Washington is nothing short of stunning as Alonzo Harris, ranking with the best performances in cinematic history, like Jon Voight's Manny in ""Runaway Train"" or Robert Duvall's Col. Kilgore in ""Apocalypse Now.""As the training day continues Alonzo's methodology becomes increasingly dubious and you can just imagine Hoyt responding, ""I... don't... see... any... method... at... all... Sir."" How can anyone withstand the temptations he faces and not give in (and I don't mean the drugs)? Needless to say, the film scores high marks on the moral conundrum front.There's one obviously contrived element but that's par for the course with movies and it could've been worse. Of course, the action and thrills are amped-up, but the tone is thankfully realistic.BOTTOM LINE: ""Training Day"" is an excellent urban thriller with a captivating performance by Washington. It's fittingly ugly, raw and brutal, so stay away if you don't think you can stomach it.The film runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot in L.A.

23,Mr-Fusion,"An Oscar-winning performance, but a mediocre flick.",5,16 November 2013,"""Training Day"" is Denzel Washington's master class in dominating a movie. He's compelling, explosive, magnetic, all of it. In the hands of someone less daring, Alonzo Harris could've been just a cardboard bad guy. But Washington handily makes the role his. He owns this movie. And up until the pivotal scene with Scott Glenn, this movie is a kickass crime thriller. It's here (sadly) that things start falling apart. Til now, Ethan Hawke's internal struggle gives the movie its dramatic weight when Denzel's not on screen. But at this point, the movie's about a thug with a badge buying search warrants with stolen money, and the rookie being asked to shoot someone dead with no provocation. There's nothing left to the character of Alonzo Harris, seeing as he's just a criminal trying to buy his way out of a screwup with the Russian mob. All the b.s. he'd been spewing to Hawke is nothing. And everything from then on (Hawke's miraculous salvation from execution, ridiculous fistfight on rooftops, etc.) is just absurd. The brilliant first half crime movie gives way to the typical contrivances of a David Ayer script. It's all still worth the watch just for Denzel Washington's riveting performance. It's just a shame the rest of the package doesn't live up to that incredible talent.5/10",Training Day
24,=G=,Hardcore entertainment and blatant stupidity...that's Hollywood.,6,19 March 2002,"In ""Training Day"", a bloated Hollywood action/drama,  Hawke rides along with street narc Washington on his first day of on the job training as an undercover narcotics officer. The film tries to represent the tug of war between right and wrong in law enforcement on the mean streets of L.A. In spite of solid production value, the flick fails miserably to deliver a compelling story as it wears on and finally wears out with numbing excesses. An obvious fabrication full of characters who are marching to the beat of a director's crop, ""Training Day"" has nothing to do with law enforcement and everything to do with Hollywood's exploitation of you and me. Nominal entertainment for those into crime flix.",Training Day
25,MovieAddict2016,"Good, not great",6,21 March 2005,"Denzel Washington won his Best Actor Oscar for this film and I am one of (seemingly) many who feel he did not deserve it - for this particular movie. Washington is one of my favorite actors but it seems he deserved it more for other projects - the Academy was in it for the politics that year, as far as I'm concerned. Denzel actually gave a better performance in 2004's ""Man on Fire,"" but of course that's just my opinion.""Training Day"" follows the path of ""Bad Lieutenant"" studying police corruption, but it is really using this as an analogy for the corruption of humanity itself - Jake (Ethan Hawke) is a good straight, honest cop who is slowly but surely twisted by his bad influence (Washington), the sadistic corrupt cop.This is not a great movie but it is a good one, with solid performances. That all said, I don't think it was Oscar-worthy and I do believe Washington has given far better performances.",Training Day
26,KineticSeoul,Arrogance of power and corruption,10,12 January 2017,"This has got to be one of my favorite street/hood movies I have seen. Although this is more from the point of views from a good cop and a crooked cops perspective of things. The narrative is easy to follow but there is street smart and street depth to it. Despite few parts not being all that believable, especially when it comes to some of the decisions and actions of some people in this. So yeah, the story connects really well together even the parts that just look like subplots. And when you throw in Denzel Washington putting on his most explosive, menacing, charismatic and powerful performance. You got yourself one heck of a awesome street/hood/crime movie that pushes towards what street justices is like. Ethan Hawke is even believable playing a naive rookie officer with a good heart. This is a entertaining and yet enthralling experience to sit through, especially because of Washington's performance in this. Overall, this is a movie I can highly recommend.10/10",Training Day
27,sddavis63,Denzel Washington At His Finest,8,16 June 2002,"The story is a bit far-fetched (seems to me that an awful lot happens in just one day - police life really is exciting!) but this movie is worth watching even if it's only to see Denzel Washington put on an unforgettable performance. Washington is, in my opinion, one of the finest actors in Hollywood today. This may not be his best performance (""Glory"" and ""Philadelphia"" come to mind) but it's unforgettable because it shows his versatility. Washington generally plays ""good guy"" roles; here he's the corrupt LAPD narcotics officer Alonzo Harris, who recruits Officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) to his squad only to set him up in a scheme he has to pay back Russian mobsters to whom he owes money.Washington's Harris comes across as believably ruthless (""the devil incarnate"" my wife called him at one point.) Harris and Hawke made a great team. They seemed to have a chemistry and I hope they work together again. The movie is chock full of action and you definitely will not be bored. It contains a lot of language, but surprisingly little nudity or sexual content, focusing instead on the story itself.Watch this. You will definitely enjoy it. 8/10.",Training Day
28,thesar-2,He Don't Need No Training,6,14 November 2010,"Much like Nicole Kidman in To Die For, this Training Day was a Denzel Washington vehicle. Both movies were ho-hum, but held the character of a lifetime and is highly recommended just on their command performance.This is not to underplay Hawke's almost (90%) equally acting – he was very good, himself, but Washington was so good, that when I first saw this back in 2001, long before the Oscar Nominations were announced, I said: ""He better both be nominated and win."" On a side note, unfortunately for Washington Fans – he has tried to recapture this high since and that's made me very sad to say I once was a devote Washington follower. Meaning: almost every role since 2001's Training Day, he has screamed ""OSCAR!"" without acting much.But, I digress, this is about Training Day, a good (again, not great) film, but one you should see concerning the troubling day both Rookie Hoyt (Hawke) and Harris (Washington) are having.Eager to please and diligent to keep his job for his growing family, Hoyt is joining the narcotics hard-core L.A. team, but he needs to deal with drama-filled Harris, who may (or may not) be on the take with the crooks he's paid to take down. (Watch FX's excellent series The Shield for further adventures on the same plane.) You see, Harris might be in over his head with a deal/incident gone wrong in Las Vegas, pissing off the wrong people, despite his demeanor. And he must trust the Clark Kent'ish Hoyt if he's to get away with it.That's pretty much it. I don't want to spoil much more than that, and the fact I brought up The Shield, which covers pretty much the same ground. That's pretty much itfor the plot. Watch this fantastic performance from Denzel who, up to this point of his excellent career, hadn't played a true baddie. And he does it in spades. It's worth the Orientation Day for him alone.",Training Day

30,ElMaruecan82,"Fantastic premise, but too much 'bad-Denzel' for the film's own good ...",7,24 July 2015,"Boy, was Denzel Washington good at being bad ! You almost have the feeling that he had fun portraying Detective Alonzo Harris, the corrupt cop and mentor, during the titular ""Training Day"" of Jake Hoyt, the rookie played no less convincingly by Ethan Hawke. Both actors would be nominated for the Oscar, but only Washington took it home. This is how persuasively villainous he was. The recognition also came from the American Film Institute that put him #50 of the Top American villains, the last spot but to his defense, he was the most recent entry. Anyway, « Training Day » has been remembered ever since as the « Bad Guy Denzel Movie ».Washington had fun and it sure shows, he gives a figure that is not that unfamiliar for cop-movies buffs a larger-than-life vibe, he's on the screen for less than twenty seconds that you know you're onto a great creation, a narc cop dressed like a Black Panther or Black Muslim militant, a gangsta goatee and a black beanie, a smile that would make any small-time thug freeze from fear. How come an actor with such a friendly face can get so intimidating, sure part of the merit comes from Washington's performance, but it also owes to Ethan Hawke who, as Jake Hoyt, is the perfect counterpart to Washington's alpha male confidence. And their first exchanges in the restaurant shows with a few words that these men are separated by experience, equaling in such a dirty racket, to an eternity.Hoyt lives in a modest apartment with his wife and a 9-month daughter, his dream is to climb the social ladder, which in the Police, means he must pass the 'danger' square. The training day is Hoyt's opportunity to make his bones, his career depends on it. That perfectly sets up his character, he's a man determined to succeed and be a good police officer. Part of his learning will consist on discovering that both goals can cancel out one another, yet the film would've been too cynical had it been the culmination of the 'coming-of-age' learning. It's not a movie about the disciple outranking the mentor, but the disciple learning a few ropes from the mentor and still be able to stick to his values. And that's what, in my humble opinion, emerges from the first exchanges, Harris is a static character, Hoyt evolves, and part of the interest relies on Jake's evolution. And that works most of the time.The problem with « Training Day » is that it gets so wrapped up on that premise of Washington being the villain that it is almost used like a gimmick, and Hoyt's evolution is only limited by the scope of that training day, we never get to know what changed exactly in his view and how that will affect his future. The film takes a conventional turn to a personal face-off between the good and the bad guy, which in the final act, is a bit of a let down compared to the whole 'close to reality' card it played right at the beginning. ""Training Day"" tries to be many things at the same time, for its own good. Let's get it straight, it never ceases to be entertaining, and this is a good movie, but it could have been so much grander had it chosen not to focus much on Alonzo Harris. In my opinion, he should've been the supporting role, which, technically, he was, as he literally 'supported' the most interesting character's arc.God, that whole first hour of « Training Day » is a terrific slice of post-September-11 era, these times I couldn't imagine I'd be nostalgic of. Even the casting of Snoop Dogg as one of the informers gives the film a little edge by encapsulating the post-Millennium day where urban violence, rap and money contributed heavily to Pop Culture imagery, where the sight of death wasn't a taboo anymore. In a way, Alonzo Harris is an efficient villain because he's emblematic of his time, being a Cop with a 'C' like in cynical, corrupt and charismatic. Yet, it's with Hoyt that I related, as a Millennium kid who wanted to believe there's a part of goodness to take from society, wishing he wouldn't fall in that trap Harris kept luring him into. I also identified with the relationship between the rookie and his new boss, something I've had enough experience to appreciate the realistic way it was conveyed in the film.You know these first days at work, where you're being taken by your coach or top manager everywhere and you feel so useless between all these people who know each other. Indeed, that's why the first day is always the worst : each impression you give is the first, and in Hoyt's business, a bad impression is something he can't afford. You're also the most recent newcomer, the one who knows the least people, this is how marginal you are. The wisest thing is to shut up, to listen, to learn. Hoyt has no other choices than listening to Harris, and Harris is no stupid, he takes advantage from it and cunningly toys with Hoyt's eagerness to prove his value, and isn't that the biggest trap you can fall in. And as the day progresses, you can feel the distance widening between Hoyt and Harris, and I hoped the movie could focus on Hoyt because Harris didn't need more screen time to make an impact, it worked from the start.""Training Day"" tried so many things it got convoluted in complicated plot devices and other contrivances, some of them unfortunately, were too blatant to be even taken seriously. While it started as one hell of a character study mixed with police procedural à la ""French Connection"", it ended like ""Scarface"". I don't mind a good over-the-top performance but the film could've been remembered for more than being that movie with a bad guy Denzel.",Training Day
31,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Washington and Hawke's powerhouse performances fuel this fantastic thriller that's masterfully realistic and breathlessly entertaining.,8,4 November 2017,"'Training Day (2001)' is a piece built around two powerhouse performances, the first being Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning turn as an unpredictably volatile veteran detective confidently walking on the wrong side of crooked and the second being Ethan Hawke's slightly overlooked (probably because it isn't as 'loud' as his co-star's) yet still deservedly Oscar-nominated rendition of a naively honest rookie whose determination to do things 'by the book' gets directly in the way of his desire to make detective. It's the ever-changing relationship between these two equally interesting characters that drives the piece forward with a constant momentum that often amounts to edge-of-your-seat suspense. It's really thanks to the amazingly grounded and realistic script that the film is so effective, as every single line of dialogue feels incredibly natural and each word that is said adds to the overall narrative in some way. The effortlessly entertaining picture becomes incredibly engaging by its pulse-pounding third act, to the point that its few issues can be easily ignored.

32,ThomasDrufke,Haunting tale,8,28 March 2014,"Impression- This is a very well written film about a man who is taken under the wings of a sketchy and untrustworthy cop. I really enjoyed the dynamic between Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington, and I'm glad they both got nominations for their work here. After seeing Hawke in the 'Before' trilogy I know he can do dramatic roles and it goes without saying that Washington can act. The only thing I was worried about was that this movie may have that over the top action like some movies similar to this do. I was not disappointed.Praise- Its a high octane thrill ride from the beginning till end. I cant say I didn't predict Washington setting Hawke up, but its still for the most part un-expecting and very interesting. It was one of the first times Washington played a complete bad-ass on screen, and he played it well. I totally bought into Hawke's character being frightened by Washington and him daring to do all the crazy stuff that he is ""supposedly required to do"". There were also some great cameos by great actors playing small roles. Tom Berenger and Eva Mendes are barely present, but their presence is felt. This movie also has a high re-watch-ability factor. Particularly for the banter that goes on between the lead characters.Complaints- To be honest I felt that some things were unrealistic. Such as the bullets in Alonzo's car. You mean to tell me that nobody at the crime scene happened to notice the bullets in the rear view windshield? I also find it hard to believe that for over 10 years this man got away with going outside the law to put away criminals. But it is a movie, so anyway....Good movie overall with a memorable dynamic between the leads. Very pleased with the outcome.8.3/10",Training Day
33,Cineanalyst,Denzel Washington Saves the Day,5,21 February 2021,"A rather unremarkable cop-crime thriller in most respects, ""Training Day"" does benefit from a plot set within one day and from Denzel Washington playing against type. I might've been surprised, however, that he won an Oscar for it except that the field was relatively weak that year, and maybe Spike Lee and others have a point of it being a makeup award for his losing nominations for more usual Oscar-bait productions, whether for ""The Hurricane"" or, further back, ""Malcolm X"" (1992), the latter where Washington watched Al Pacino receive a more-obviously-makeup award, and, later, for ""Fences"" (2016). The Academy has been handing out competitive Oscars like they're Lifetime Achievement Awards since at least 1930 when they gave one to Mary Pickford for her embarrassing performance in ""Coquette"" (1929). Washington's ""Training Day"" performance does also fit the Academy criteria for over-the-top, capital-A Acting, and he's charismatic and dressed stylishly. To paraphrase, King Kong ain't got **** on him. Regardless, he's the main attraction here.Ethan Hawke riding those coattails to a Supporting Actor nod for his less interesting role and performance for the first day on the job as Washington's partner--and despite being the protagonist and being on screen 13 more minutes than him--is more unaccountable. It's a fantasized, if not melodramatic, simplification of corruption by the police and justice system and the supposed depiction of a block of a hood, Terry Crews included, otherwise. The rest of director Antoine Fuqua and writer David Ayer's resumes are stuffed with such mediocrity and worse. Recording artists the likes of Snoop Dogg and Macy Gray make cameos, and Eva Mendes is merely there. The plot is brisk, although the narrative coincidences are a drag in the final act.

37,ironhorse_iv,"Training Day is worth watching, any day! It's a masterpiece.",8,21 December 2017,"'King Kong ain't got sh*t on me!' That's sure, right! 'Training Day' was an amazing movie! Directed by Antoine Fuqua, and written by David Ayer, this neo-noir crime thriller, tells the story of a young naive LAPD officer, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) undergoing a nightmarish single day evaluation by corrupt, yet renowned and respected narcotics officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) who has big sinister plans for him. Without spoiling this movie, too much; while this good/bad cop film has amazing performances from both main & supporting actors like Ethan Hawke, Cliff Curtiss, Scott Glenn & others, much of the success of this movie has to go with how surprising good, Washington was as the villain. It's sad to think, that Denzel had to depart from his usual squeaky clean image, to win, an Oscar for best actor, but the performer really does shines in this type of roles. You can truly tell that, with his use of body language and tone. The way, Washington show, primeval street grit, with long, hard stern looks, loud boisterous charisma yelling, and disregard for the public safety, such as bumping into people as he walks, show how much of an utterly detestable character, Alonzo can be. No wonder, why most of the audience were so eagerly for his comeuppance, even if Denzel, personal, is so beloved. Yet, there was another part of the character, Washington was able to display, without the writer spending too much time on his character backstory, visually; which was showing empathy for Hoyt. You see this, whenever Jake does anything, valor and honest & Denzel having to react from that. Its shows the struggle of guilt, within Alonzo. It tells the tragic story of a mild-mannered, family man, slowly morphing into a ruthless criminal in a matter of a few words & stares. It's nearly perfect. Yet, there was a few flaws, with the character as a whole. Much of that, comes from the misuse of the source material, which 'Training Day' is loosely based on. While, Alonzo is somewhat based on real-life, corrupt Los Angeles, police officers, David Mack, Rafael Pérez & Kevin Gaines. Some of the actions, the character commits as a Narc Cop with Hoyt, throughout the film, just doesn't seem very plausible or realistic. They come across as too flashy, gimmicky and cartoonish, rather than smart street cops. One such example is the smoking, a confiscate drug scene. First off, it's a little hard to believe, that an officer like Hoyt that use to do patrols, would be that gullible and foolish, what it takes to become a narc. In most cases, police officers received an average of 41 hours up to 540 hours of instruction training before going into that field. There would be, no way, Hoyt would be that adequate. Secondary, it really doesn't make much sense that he would take the drug, knowing full well, that he was going to drug test in a few days & he wasn't dealing with any perps at that time. Third, it's highly bizarre, that Alonzo would plan out, for a whole week of stuff, on a specific one day plan that relies so much on the highly off-chance that Hoyt would take the drug, in order to blackmail him. Much of this movie could had be resolve in the first couple of minutes, with Hoyt, saying 'no'. Fourth, how in the hell was Alonzo's many crimes, overlook for so long!? I get that, he get stuff done in the department, but even if most of the department share the same corruption as the officer on the field; cops still have to write reports, submit a financial disclosure statement, undergo random drug testing, and pass recurring background investigations, yearly. There is no way, they can hide everything from the public & other government agencies. The corrupt cops would eventually get caught. Probably quicker than later, like what happen in real-life, with the Rampart scandal; which this movie is loosely based on. Also, none of the criminal sequences, throughout the day, felt anywhere near realistic. The idea that they easily find illegal drugs, as soon, as they pull a corner is far from truth. In real-life, Narc spend hours on end, on one, suspicious activity, with little to no pay-off, that a crime is being committed. Also, much of the crimes, portray in the film, felt more like step-up sequences, rather than isolate scenarios, which occurs more, likely. Regardless of that, I do have to fight against the claims from critics that this movie is nothing, but the continuous negative stereotype of minorities in film, by saying the movie does show that corruption happens in every level, regardless of class and race, such as the case in the restaurant scene & with Roger (Scott Glenn). As for the critics that says, Hoyt was nothing, but a ''white savior' cinematic trope whom job is it to rescue people of color from their downward plight. I also have to disagree with them, as the film shown in the end, Black & Hispanic communities, are willing to stand up against crime. Hoyt didn't make them, change. They did it on their own. Nevertheless, the film approach to women, could had been a little better. Most of the women in the film does nothing, but look and act like sleazy floozies. Sadly, actress, Eva Mendes is just there, for eye-candy and pointless nude scene. Still, that's a lot better than the jarring use of black musicians artists, like Macy Gray, Snoop Dog, and Dr. Dre, as criminals. That was awkward. Still, great use of their music in the soundtrack. Nevertheless, this strong Rated R movie, was an intense & compelling watch. While, this crime drama is not for everybody, due to rough language, graphic violence, drug use, and sexual references. It's still worth checking out, unlike the 2017's TV Series of the same name. Forget that show. Watch the movie, instead.",Training Day

Washington, playing against type as the epitome of a bad cop, is so over the top that it is not surprising that he won an Oscar for this role. He is supposed to be charismatic but the character is not the least bit likable. The script starts off as meandering, with hardly any sustained narrative during the first half; it then crams in too much plot and ends up as unbelievably stupid, including a key scene that hinges on a silly coincidence. The action scenes are utterly ridiculous, with Fuqua not making any attempt to infuse credibility into them.",Training Day
39,The-Sarkologist,A Question of Innocence,8,10 March 2019,"It looks like this is another one of those films that I missed during a period of time when I didn't go and see films anywhere near as much as I did in the past, or I do so now (which is probably between 2000 and 2006). So, during that time I really wasn't paying all that much attention to what was coming out, or even going and seeing films that did come out at the time. However, this is also one of those films that seem to keep on popping up every so often, and a part of me felt that maybe it is worth actually going back and watching, particularly since Washington did win an oscar for his role in the film.I have to admit that it is pretty gripping, and things seem to get deeper and deeper as the film progresses, though we should note that the entire film occurs over the span of a single day. Basically the film opens up with a beat cop Jake being offered a position as a narcotics detective, as long as he successfully completes a single day on the job, which is basically an evaluation. Obviously Jake is pretty egar to impress.The thing is that there are a lot of things going on behind the scene which is slowly being revealed to us, but not necessarily to Jake, namely because Jake is not quite in earshot, or simply assumes that everything is above board. Sure, he sort of has some suspicions that things are not quite right, but sure enough, he is an innocent beat cop who is eager to please, so he isn't really all that keen on asking too many questions.That is the other thing about the film, and that it is basically told entirely from his perspective. Unfortunately, unlike literature, we aren't really able to get into his mind, and understand what he is thinking, but then again the film doesn't actually provide us with a narrative. Should it? I'm not entirely sure, because it still sort of works out, at least most of the way through the film.Well, sort of, because once we get to the end, the coincidences do start to pile up, such as the girl whom he saved turning out to be the cousin of the guy that has been paid to kill him, which means that he spares his life and lets him go. Yet, if we work on the principle of Chekov's gun, that incident earlier in the film really does need to have a reason for occurring, particularly since he picks up her wallet after she leaves - even though Hollywood movies don't necessarily follow that rule, having such a thing occur without having a reason for it later on in the film would effectively be sloppy film making, and it certainly isn't one of those films that throws red herrings at you.It is an interesting look at corruption in the world of the detectives. Look, corrupt cops are nothing new, there have been countless numbers of films and TV shows made about them, and of course they never seem to actually get away with being corrupt. Though this story is much more interesting, particularly since our detective lives in the heart of gang territory, and doesn't seem to have a problem with living in the heart of gang territory. Sure, he is corrupt, but I think the film goes a little further than that.For instance, Jake, at the beginning of the film, refuses to smoke any marijuana because, well, cops don't do drugs - remember, he is pretty innocent - yet is suddenly told that one needs to be a little flexible if one is going to be effective. By sticking to a moral code means that you are going to be outing yourself pretty quickly. Yet by bending your moral code raises the question as to how far you are going to bend, and the further you bend the more corrupt you eventually become.I guess Alonzo, our detective, in a way is a very tragic character. He is a highly decorated officer, yet in becoming effective has resulted in him becoming corrupt, and the more effective he becomes, the more corrupt he becomes. Yet it isn't just him that has fallen down, because it seems that the rot has spread far and wide throughout the system - it is just that Alonzo, as we soon find out, has stepped just that little bit too far over the line to discover that he has found himself in what is effectively a no win situation, that eventually tips him over the edge.In this case, sometimes innocence, and the desire to maintain one's honour, can save one from falling too far, yet it also results in an awful lot of sacrifice, since it is clear that Jake probably will not being going down the path of the narcotics detective, though this is never really made clear at the end of the film.",Training Day
40,zkonedog,The Perfect Vehicle To Match Denzel's Intensity,7,23 February 2021,"Since it's 2001 release, ""Training Day"" has come to be known as one of the most intense films ever made. Director Antoine Fuqua and writer David Ayer craft a tale that pulls absolutely no punches in its portrayal of life on LA's ""mean streets"". There are few lead actors that would be up to the task of matching such intensity, but fortunately this film employs one of them.For a very basic overview, ""Training Day"" sees young cop Jake (Ethan Hawke) looking to start a career path in the narcotics division. On his first day, he is paired with veteran detective Alonzo (Denzel Washington), who gives him a physical--and psychological--tour of LA's drug trade and the queasy or downright dirty methods often undertaken--even as wearers of the badge--to get the job done.In terms of overall plot, the whole ""gritty cop ethics"" theme is one that will vary from person to person. If such moralizing is ""your thing"", ""Training Day"" will probably be one of your all-time favorites. It truly is fearless in its portrayal of the seedier side of police work, often to the point of outright discomfort.But even if hard-boiled ""cop stuff"" isn't your cup of tea, Washington's performance gives the film such a high floor. This seems like a role that Denzel was born to play, allowing him to glower, crack wise, and monologue (usually emphatically!) in equal parts. There is not a moment he's on screen when your eyes won't be drawn to his presence. You'll get no complaints from me on his Oscar take-home.Perhaps overlooked in the wake of Denzel's masterpiece is Hawke's own solid acting job here. Denzel's schtick only works if another character can be made an audience proxy, and Hawke does that admirably. Viewers may marvel at Alonzo's swagger, but they'll identify with Jake's sense of conscience and morality.Overall, I consider ""Training Day"" to be a solid film featuring an extraordinary acting performance. The hard cop stuff isn't my personal favorite genre, but even then I'd never go lower than 7/10 simply for the atmosphere of tension that Fuqua, Washington, and Hawke create from beginning to end.",Training Day

Written by David Ayer and directed by Anthony Fuqua, Training Day grabs you. While the ending suffers from an overload of coincidences and contrivances, the movie still packs a wallop as it asks the question: Can honorable men deal with the worst of humanity on a daily basis without being corrupted?Co-starring Ethan Hawke plays Jake Hoyt, a Los Angeles cop out to become detective. To that end, he tries to join an elite squad led by Alonzo Harris (Washington), an undercover officer legendary for his effectiveness.

In fact, they loathe the man and put up with him solely because of his badge and gun.Taking place over the course of a single day, Training Day builds momentum and never backs off. The film creates and maintains a sense of genuine danger. As the proceedings grow ever more dark, you begin to wonder if the key players can possibly survive the day. Until the last 15 minutes, that is, when the story wraps up too quickly and in far too pat a fashion.",Training Day
42,johnnyboyz,"Watch it for Washington's performance; some well made, unpredictable scenes and let it just draw you in.",7,4 August 2007,"What we have with Training Day is a big mixture of: gangster, crime, cop/buddy and something close to resembling a ghetto drama all in one. Needless to say that all these aspects of the film work together in a reasonably effective way which, in the end, leaves you feeling satisfied. There are individual strokes of greatness but these are limited to things like Denzil Washington's performance who reminded me of a Wesley Snipes character out of something like 'New Jack City' (1991). There is also the element of unpredictability for the best part as relative rookie Jake (Hawke) gets put through some pretty harsh paces for the first forty minutes or so.I came away from Training Day liking it overall but there were some distinct things that had me thinking to myself 'Yeah, I see exactly what they're trying to do here.' And this is relatable to the 'buddy/cop' sequence. Jake and Alonzo (Washington) are the absolute binary opposites of one another: you couldn't get two more different characters. One is a 'desk' cop who books illegally parked cars and probably takes the odd trip to the doughnut shop one too many times (although his build doesn't suggest this) whereas Alonzo is one of those cops you see in films and if you were ever going to become a law enforcer, you'd want to live their lifestyle: guns, girls and plenty of softly earned drug money. Although this is nothing new, it was refreshing to see it done in an unpredictable manner and of course, Washington's performance sees it out.Secondly, the way in which each character acts  Jake seems sharper and wants to do everything by the book whereas Alonzo's methods include something more reminiscent of: instead of arresting two rapists, just threaten in an extreme manner to shoot their genitalia off if they catch them doing it again and let them go. Jake even talks and dresses differently and of course, Ethan Hawke is a white Caucasian American  Washington is coloured so these two characters make for great entertainment in an easily explosive situation when you've got two people so different in looks and lifestyles.Thanks to some good film-making, certain situations of tension and spontaneity happen and are carried out well. These situations are also very awkward and since we're supposed to map onto the character of Jake more so than Alonzo, we do sort of feel what he's feeling  again, this is thanks to Washington's amazing performance; especially when he either forces Jake to take a smoke of some drugs or when someone is unexpectedly shot and Jake is panting heavily or even when they drive though a bad neighbourhood and Alonzo states: 'Don't you ever come here without me' as black ghetto gangsters eye up the vehicle. Although this manipulates our opinions on Jake as a bit of a wimp and further makes us think Alonzo is sort of invincible, the payoff for thinking these things is great  the filmmakers make us think of one thing so much that all the odds seemed stacked against us later on.What was also clever is the way in which the film can change so dramatically  although not entirely realistic all the time, one situation or setting can very quickly change in an instant. This could include when Jake is in big trouble with some Mexican gangsters but gets out of jail thanks to a previous deed that he did. Although this was a bit of a fluke, it would still be possible in the tightly knitted world of crime that particular city possesses. Although these changes are unpredictable and entertaining, lines must be drawn somewhere especially in which the finale is played out: where several characters seem to switch sides to team up with a guy who they've known of for about twelve hours, which was a little unbelievable.In the long run, Training Day is a very entertaining film that doesn't cover too much ground in terms of innovation or anything deeper than that but it is a clever example of how to suck an audience in and play with them later on.",Training Day
43,TheMovieDiorama,Training Day is a prime example of how just one scene can elevate a film to greatness.,8,27 February 2018,"You all know the scene I'm talking about. Alonzo's monologue against the street that he thought would cooperate with him. That scene. Urgh, genius. A rookie narcotics officer is paired with a more experienced, albeit corrupt, detective for a day of training in the urban streets of Los Angeles. What looks like a semi-professional day on the job turns out to be a nightmare for the rookie. There are a ridiculous amount of positives, but unfortunately there are various negatives that prevents the police drama from being classed as a classic. At its core, this is a character study. A twisted, demented and self-assured detective who may have started out with the right intentions, but gradually becomes corrupted by the streets. The screenplay consistently reaffirms the idea that it is the environment that changes a person. Being adaptable under given scenarios. The depiction of the streets of Los Angeles and the black and white segregation is rather prominent throughout the film's runtime. Yet it feels extremely real. It is the gritty and dark undertone embedded within the narrative that intrigues you and makes you invested in the characters. Speaking of our protagonist(s), Ethan Hawke was sublime as the naive rookie who just wants to help the world, one crime at a time. However, Denzel Washington just owns every scene in what I can only describe as his best performance. His acting was ferocious. Conveying confidence and fear simultaneously. David Ayer's best script (although that's not saying much...) and Antoine Fuqua's best directorial effort. It's just a shame the ending was unsatisfying with too many plot conveniences throughout. What were the chances that the girl they saved at the beginning was the cousin of a Sureño who was going to kill Jake!? Absurdly convenient. Then later we get the craziest overkill of the decade. Bullets galore. Alas, I do find this to be a gripping police drama and Washington's best performance. That's enough for me to highly recommend this.",Training Day
44,insomniac_rod,Excellent display of corruption.,8,30 December 2008,"Training Day is a the perfect example of corruption, violence, and drug dealing issues inside police.Alonso Harris is a character that will be always remembered for it's realism; people like him sadly exist. Is it for low incomes? Is it for the desire of power? ""Training Day"" perfectly explains Alonso's behavior through many violent scenes that not necessarily deal with phyiscal violence, but also with drug abuse, corruption, sexual matters, and also display situations that start with home.The movie is very intelligent because through Ethan Hawke's character we learn that not every single cop member is the same; in fact, the good cops follow a long hard road before becoming corrupt and more. Through his character, we learn that not only good intentions are needed to fight against crime...So ""Training Day"" is in my opinion one of the best cop movies ever made because it doesn't follow the typical ""cop features"" and goes further and insert sub-plots that satisfy the new millennium tendencies.Please watch Denzel Washington's extraordinary performance. Also, there are many interesting cameos like from Snoop Dogg.",Training Day

46,Anonymous_Maxine,"Amazing performances, great action, good film, but it should have been better.",7,31 January 2003,"There are a few actors in Hollywood that create a huge stir of interest and gossip anytime they come out with a new film. Tom Hanks is probably the biggest of these actors, but this group also includes tremendously talented actors like Jack Nicholson, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Cruise, Harrison Ford, and of course, Denzel Washington. All of this almost automatic hype is not, however, entirely accurate at all times, and Training Day is a prime example of this. Now before you click on my name above so you can send me some hate mail, I should just point out that I am not pretending that Training Day is a bad movie, I am just saying that there are a lot of things in it that should have been done differently or not at all. Denzel Washington plays the part of the scary Detective Alonzo Harris, and Ethan Hawke plays Officer Jake Hoyt, a new white officer on the force who is to learn the ways of being a tough cop from Harris. The most powerful part of the film is, of course, Denzel's performance as the hardened narcotics officer in Los Angeles, and the interaction that he has with the inexperienced Hoyt, who really only wants to get a nice promotion so he can provide a better life for his wife and kid. Harris has a way of doing his job that really makes it interesting, he's not just a guy running around arresting guys who sell drugs or are doing drugs, he plays his job almost like a chess game.One of the more surprising examples of this is the way that he forces Hoyt to smoke PCP laced marijuana as one of his first lessons, explaining to the incredulous Hoyt that if he were to turn down a similar gift out on the streets, he's be dead. No further explanation is given, and none is needed. Harris knows that he has to be intimidating on the streets or he'll get killed, and he knows that he has to be as familiar as humanly possible with the very thing that he's trying to stop. These people are his people, but he's on the other side of the law.There is an interesting way that the movie explores the possibility that many of that civil laws that police officers must follow only hinder the true delivery of justice and their efforts to stop crime, because Harris is an officer that pursues the bad guys in any way necessary, whether legally or not, and he looks much deeper into the situations than just getting the guys in cuffs in the back of his car. The scene where they see the two guys trying to rape a woman on the streets comes to mind. Hoyt is ready to throw these guys in the car, take them downtown, and throw them in jail, case closed. They witnessed the crime, it was that easy. Instead, Harris beats them both stupid and lets them go right in front of the astonished eyes of Hoyt, inspiring the famous line, `Let the animals weed themselves out.' God willing.The real problem that I have with this movie is that, for one thing, it is entirely too violent in places where it doesn't need to be. One of the things that I hate to hear the most in a review of an action movie is that it's too violent, just because it sounds so much like something my grandmother would say, but take, for example, the scene where Harris and Hoyt are fighting each other hand to hand. This scene is excruciatingly violent, but the only problem that I have with it is that it should have been maybe a third of the length that it was. MAYBE. I am a serious fan of good bloody, violent movies, I even enjoy Steven Seagal films and Van Damme films, but even in the most hardcore action films and for the most die hard action fan, there comes a point where you think, `Okay, I GET it.' Training Day either does not believe that this point exists, or doesn't know where it is. Besides that, I know that this is an aberrant role for Denzel Washington, who does not very often play villains, but even as the character that he played in Training Day, there are certain things that you simply can't do to an actor like him, and gunning him down Godfather-style by a whole row of machine guns is one of them. No matter how bad the guy is that he's portraying, you just can't do things like that to him, the man's LOVED! I am not usually one to complaing about issues of violence like this, but there is a place in the movies for excessive violence, and it is in Van Damme films and Seagal films, not in movies like this. Training Day had entirely too many real world connections to be dumbed down be excesses like that, and if these things had been reduced to a more realistic level at least slightly, the quality of the film would have increased enormously. Just a little change could have done a lot of good.",Training Day

Washington, as is his custom fully buries himself into the role. He becomes Harris. The plot, in a nutshell, has Officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) reporting to Harris for a day od on the job training in his undercover narcotics unit. Harris shows Hoyt the seamier side of Los Angeles and attempts to show him the ways of the streets. Director Antoine Fuqua takes us into the ghetto neighborhoods and introduces us to a way of life few outside the ""hoods"" have experienced. Washington as mentioned is excellent, conveying ticking time bomb type of personality. Hawke, who was nominated for an Oscar for his role, is also outstanding as the ""play by the rules"" rookie. Rappers Snoop Doggy Dogg as a wheel chair bound drug dealer and Dr. Dre as a member of Harris' team give surprisingly effective performances in their roles. Scott Glenn does a nice turn as a drug dealing friend of Harris. And totally wasted as a member of ""The Three Wise Men"" is Tom Berenger, who has but one brief scene. ""Training Day"" has a fair amount of violence and street language, but you will just sit in awe of Washington and Hawke's performances.",Training Day
50,dfranzen70,Commanding Denzel,8,2 April 2002,"Denzel Washington won the Oscar for this role as a corrupt narcotics cop. That in itself is an unusual sentence - not the Oscar part, but the ""corrupt"" part, as Washington rarely plays bad guys. But his Alonzo is most certainly a bad guy, out on the streets not for the greater good but to further his own interests. Even so, while Alonzo's not the most moral of characters, Washington makes him so multilayered that you almost root for him to persevere. Ethan Hawke plays rookie cop Jake Hoyt. Ok, he's not a rookie cop, exactly; he's been on the force for something like 14 months. But he wants to do bigger and better things, so he's signed up for Alonzo's elite narc squad.
Alonzo puts Hoyt through the paces - visiting snitches, shaking down people, doing the drugs they confiscate (or at least making Hoyt do them). Through it all, Alonzo seems mean and cynical, but also worldly and supremely intelligent. He's not just some megalomaniacal renegade cop who's king of his own world, or even some Johnny Law with a 'tude. The viewer wonders what's up Alonzo's sleeve: Does he have plans for young Mr. Hoyt? Is he just playing with him? Or is he just completely nuts? You just plain never can tell with Washington's portrayal, and that's why he deserved the Oscar. Always keeping the audience guessing, Washington makes sure you don't pigeonhole his character as purely evil. The events that take place during the day (as the title suggests, all of the action is confined to one day's work) imply that they're all leading up to something - the audience just doesn't know what. If Alonzo is bad and is looking out for himself, what kind of denouement can be expected? If he isn't completely bad, is he going to say the day's just been one long lesson for his newcomer? The crisp script by David Ayer never lets up, relentlessly pounding the viewer with these and other questions. Moral ambiguity is a delicious plot device, but only if the script is well written. There's hardly any lag in Training Day, so that if there were any plotholes the viewer would gloss over them quickly enough. The movie's hard hitting, full of life and excitement, complete with plenty of twists. You can never get completely used to anything in the movie, because few things are as they seem.The one exception to this is Hoyt himself. Maybe he's supposed to be an Everyman; more likely he's just a wide-eyed innocent being corrupted by the Big Bad Veteran. Hawke has the wide-eyed look down pretty good, which is a bit of a comedown from a guy who played a supercool dude in 1994's Reality Bites. It's the meatiest role Hawke's had, and he seriously flubs it. But since he's playing opposite Washington, and since this is Washington's movie, Hawke's inadequacies are easily overlooked, as well they should be. Having said that, there's no way Hawke should have been nominated for an Oscar, as he was. What were people thinking? That Washington was as good as he was because he had Hawke to play off? Hardly. It's an ineffectual performance; Edward Norton would have been a far better choice - and he could have walked home with that Oscar, too.",Training Day

This movie offers a frank and graphic portrayal of a corrupt police officer. The police officer in question, played magnificently by Denzel Washington, is both a terrifying and pathetic character because he is a man who projects a facade of strength which is a caricature of the social misfits who abound in his universe. For the Denzel Washington character, rules of ethical conduct are utterly meaningless and are to be ridiculed and ignored. The problem with this movie is that it glorifies the corrupt cop who is portrayed as being tough and all-knowing when in fact his thinking and perceptions are completely distorted. Accordingly, his behavior becomes maladaptive and can lead only to disaster. As a result, he is ruined, both as a police officer and a man. Sad.",Training Day

Ethan is his young trainee, Jake Hoyt, who wants to become a narc so he can move himself and his wife into a better home.

At this point this is where the battle starts...Alonzo Harris is not evil in the usual sense of the word, but he is simply a person who has become corrupted by his own means of justice.  The story of ""Training Day"" is that he has developed a sort of God-like persona and uses this image to put fear into the hearts of those who are against him. Despite all of this, there are higher forces who oppose his power.  This inevitably leads to his downfall.  Alonzo is a tyrant plain and simple.  He has people who do his bidding for him, but not for long now that Hoyt is on the streets.  Hoyt will lead the battle to oust Alonzo out of power.10/10",Training Day

Here is how my `Training Day' went:3:30 p.m.- Since it was `Veterans Day' I knew I had some free time to see a matinee. Usually I see romantic-comedies during matinees, so I had not been trained in the action genre that is `Training Day' during this mid-time of the day.4: 13 p.m.- I decided on `Training Day' because of the buzz on Denzel Washington's virtuosos performance as a crooked L.A. cop. So I got up my gear (my movie watcher discount card, my popcorn money, and my glasses) and was ready to be trained. 4: 45 p.m.- My training began a little rough when I saw the long line outside the movie theatre waiting to get their tickets. I knew now I was not in this alone. 5: 13 p.m.- I now started my neck-stretching warm-up exercise regime as I notice that the only vacant seats left in the cinema room were the ones in the front row. 5:45 p.m.- My official training started in the `advertising department' when I saw the trailers of some upcoming yet-to-be-released films.6: 00 p.m.- 7:00 p.m.- During this time, my training moved into the `public relations department' when I was able to notice that the film was very intense and very well-crafted. It had substance that the viewing public, especially those that live in the inner city, could relate to.7:01 p.m.- 8: 15 p.m.- My training ended in the ` motion picture elite department'. Because after watching this immensely entertaining intelligent film, I knew that it belonged in the elite films of 2001. Academy voters should be put on probation if they do not nominate Denzel for a Best Actor Oscar. Ethan Hawke, who plays the rookie cop who gets manipulated by Denzel's character, was surprisingly good in this type of film for him. However, it was Antonio Fuqua's manipulative direction that was one of the most unpredictable aspects of the film.  8:30 p.m.- My `training day' had ended!

Ethan Hawkes is Jake Hoyt, newly ""recruited"" to it and even eager to join.Hoyt immediately sees that Harris is not your run of the mill detective, he appears to have a unique style of ""detecting"" - Which involves all kinds of bullying and fear tactics- And he does not limit this to suspects, he uses them on Hoyt as well.In reality Harris has a specific agenda. Hoyt goes along with it but each activity of their day raises the red flag level higher and higher.Harris actually rules over a small section of hell, a gang-ridden neighborhood called ""The Jungles"" where his son and girlfriend Sara (Eva Mendes) live. Harris expressly instructs Hoyt never to enter ""The Jungles"" by himself. Harris appears to be the ""benevolent protector"" of this neighborhood and we get that impression as well. Remember, this is all appearances- This whole film depends on our ""First Impressions"" and how they are wrong.We get to meet many of Harris' ""friends"" and acquaintances, who are either ""retired"" drug pushers who have served their time (Scott Glenn as ""Roger"") or Judges and DA's (Harris Yulin and Tom Berenger and Doug Rosselli and Stan Gursky respectively). In fact, the two categories of people are interconnected in some way through Harris. And Harris plays them like finely tuned instruments.And now Harris has chosen Jake Hoyt. The only question we can ask as the body count rises is ""Why""?Alonzo likes Hoyt because he has a good eye for what is happening around him, this is proved when Hoyt sees a rape happening in the corner of his eye, jumps out of the car and takes on the two gang-bangers who are piling on a hapless girl. In the process she loses her wallet and Jake picks it up: File for future use.This film puts a new slant on the words ""Patsy"" and ""Double/Triple/Quadruple Cross"".Washington plays this as if he's the guy, just like he does any other role, Hawkes follows suit with the ""Innocent Look"" that hides the fact that he's seen more than he lets on. Look for the likes of Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg, and veteran character actors Nick Chinlund and Raymond Cruz- Several real gang-bangers from the LA neighborhood called ""The Jungles"" were used as well.Antoine Fuqua mimics Tony Scott's style of directing with a great score by Mark Mancina peppered with some decent Rap tracks and other interesting music.",Training Day

62,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Superb crime drama. Incendiary work from Washington,10,22 July 2016,"""To protect the sheep, you gotta catch the wolf, and it takes a wolf to catch a wolf."" This questionable sentiment is how rogue LAPD detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) justifies a heavy laundry list of dirty deeds, scary volatility, sociopathic backstabbing and a complete disregard for the badge that he wears on a chain like dog tags. And indeed, inner city Los Angeles can seem like a war zone, but its like he's in fact more part of the problem than the dark angel of justice he sees in himself. Antoine Fuqua's combustible crime drama Training Day rightly won Washington an Oscar for his unsettling runaway train of a performance, and he owns it down to the last maniacal mannerism and manipulative tactic. The film takes place over one smoggy L.A. day (hence the title) that feels like an eternity for its two leads, as well as all the colorful and often terrifying people they meet along the yellow brick road that's paved with used needles and shell casings. Harris is tasked with showing rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) the ropes in his neighborhood, in the hopes that he'll pass the test and achieve Narc status. Jake is prepared for a run of the mill crash course, but as soon as he's treated to a verbal beatdown from Harris in the diner they meet at, he has a feeling it ain't gonna be anywhere close to a normal day. This is just another day for Harris though, as he drags Hoyt by the scruff through drug busts, gang warfare, the worst neighborhood in town and pulls him deeper into his very dangerous world. Fuqua has a knack for getting the atmosphere of his settings just pitch perfect, and the feverish nightmare of the inner city comes alive, seemingly possessing the characters themselves until the atrocities just seem like a way of life. The trouble really starts when they run across Harris's old drug lord buddy Roger (a wicked Scott Glenn in a role originally intended for Mickey Rourke), who proves a valuable asset later, though not in the way you might think. Harris introduces Jake to his equally crooked and scary team, including Peter Greene, Nick Chinlund and Dr. Dre who struggles in the acting department, especially in a room full of such heavy hitters. Jake is aghast at the horrors he sees and cannot believe the streets are like this. Harris devilishly assures him that this is the job, mutilating the symbol of his badge even more by justifying such behaviour as necessary. Tension reaches unbearable heights during a visit to a Latino gang household run by Cliff Curtis, Raymond Cruz and the eternally scary Noel Gugliemi. This is the heart of darkness fpr the film, a story beat from which there is seemingly no escape, until it becomes clear that Jake has somehow evolved a step up the food chain as far as LA goes, and is now ready to put down the dog who taught him, a dog who has long been rabid. People complain that the final act degenerates into a routine action sequence. Couldn't disagree more. With a setup so primed with explosive conflict, it can't end up anywhere else but an all out man to man scrap, which when followed by no flat out action sequences earlier in the film, hits hard. Their inevitable confrontation is a powerhouse, especially from Washington, who finally loses his composure and yowls like a trapped coyote, his actions caught up to him. In a role originally intended for Tom Sizemore (who would have rocked it in his own way) I'm glad Denzel got a crack at it, for he's absolute dynamite. Watch for Harris Yulin, Raymond J. Barry and Tom Berenger as the three senior LAPD dick heads, Eva Mendes as Alonzo's girlfriend, Macy Gray as a screeching banshee of a ghetto whore and Snoop Dogg as your friendly neighborhood wheelchair bound crack dealer. Fuqua keeps attention rooted on the dynamic between Washington and Hawke, who is excellent in as role that could have easily been swallowed up by Washington's monster of of a performance. Hawke holds his own, and the film is really about how two very different guys view a difficult area of town, how it changes them both, and ultimately how their moral compasses end up on a collision course. One of the best crime framas out there, and quickly becoming timeless.",Training Day

Ethan Hawke was perfect as his goofy wannabe NARC, which brought about an interesting dynamic between the two characters. For once, Denzel Washington got out of soul brotha' routine and played a character with some inner conflict and depth. I must also say, Antoine Fuqua had his best directing effort thus far, combining all the best elements from Bait and The Replacement Killers to make this sound and riveting street thriller.",Training Day
65,rbverhoef,Great performances,8,20 November 2003,"'Training Day' is one day in the life of officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke). It is his first day in training with detective Alonzo (Denzel Washington). Jake also wants to be a detective one day. Alonzo is not your normal detective. At first his intentions are not very clear but when Jake has to do very strange things you know Alonzo is not a good guy.Basically Alonzo and Jake are driving around in a car, sometimes meeting people. That is why the performances are so important. Fortunately they are great. Hawk as the rookie does a very nice job and Washington, not the likable character he often is, creates a great evil character. The movie itself is not that great and the plot has some very predictable points, but because of these two actors the movie is elevated to a higher level.",Training Day
66,valleyjohn,Denzel Washington at the very top of his game,10,30 March 2011,"Every great actor has a defining performance. A performance that they will always be remembered for. De Niero's was Raging Bull , Pacino's was Scarface and Tom Hank's was Forest Gump. I believe Denzel Washington will always be remembered for his role as Detective Alonzo Harris in Training Day. This was the first time we had really seen Washington play a bad guy and you have to say , he took to it like a duck to water.Training Day is one of my favourite movies of all time. Movies don't get much grittier than this one. Director Antoine Fuqua pulls no punches when telling the story of a rookie cop's first day as detective. Ordinarily we would be raving about the brilliant performance of Ethan Hawke as Jake Hoyt but such is the personality and expertise of Denzel Washington , Hawke is overshadowed. The scene in the kitchen when he is left alone with the card playing gang members is a memorable one.This movie is 10 years old now and rarely has there been a film since to compare. Maybe The Departed has come closest.If you have never seen Training Day , do yourself a favour and go out and rent or buy this now. You wont regret it.",Training Day

I truly thought he was just as good as Denzel. Also, screenplay was brilliant by William Monahan, who has gone on yo dutect srveral bery good films: my favorite is ""London Boulevard"" (2010). Ethan Hawke is so good in the last 1/3 it yhe film. From the moment he leaves ""Smileys"" (Cliff Curtis, who is excellent). Scott Glenn is miscast to me, however. No way he can play a real dealer. I know first hand. The only other part I didnt buy (but it looked cool) is when Ethan Hawke goes to his neighborhood & house. There is no way; truly, no way he could walk through that street without getting blasted in real life. Regardless, it is nice for people to think a white dude could do so; but no way my friends. Still, it is an excellent film.",Training Day
68,eric262003,Where One That Supplies Various After-Thoughts,9,28 September 2009,"At the end of the Oscar-winning movie ""Training Day"", one must ask, ""where's the fine-line between doing what's right and the tactics one must go through in accomplishing it?"" The hero in the story faces this enigmatic question from the moment he wakes up till he goes to sleep at night. Getting tired of the usual routine of parking tickets and arresting drunk drivers, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is young cop who has bigger aspirations into the police force. His ambition is crack down on bigger game like muggers, murderers, rapists and all other assorted weirdos plaguing the streets of Los Angeles. Thus he en-rolls in a training session with LAPD's finest narcotics detectives Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). During the process, young Jake learns more than he could chew when he discovers that detectives are not always prone to play-by-the-rules. Now he's in a position where he must decide if he wants to continue or if he wants to end it. The script is very well researched and very easy to grasp at. The dialogue is fast and furious and can be very witty at times. The pace is at its most convenient and though the action is wild it still offers room for plenty of mind-numbing twists. The only real flaw is that it gives a negative view of how unlawful the more advanced law enforcers can be. Those alleged people who protect us from crime are no more criminal than the people they arrest. In many true story films like ""American Gangster"" (another film Washington was in) proves my point. Denzel Washington deserved his Oscar here as he takes direct command in this movie. Even in the scenes where he's only mentioned by name, he still makes his presence felt. Denzel who can play good guy roles to near perfection does something that few actors and actresses can do: take a u-turn to type-casting and play a more tyrannical character. Ethan Hawke is equally impressive as a cop who must have long restless nights wondering how did he get himself into this mess and how to get out of it or if there is a way out of it. Sadly the supporting cast are mostly underdeveloped fillers with really no depth. For an action movie, the action is quite scarce. Most of the tense scenes are through the unsettling of Jake's inner conscious. The real story isn't about Jake's fight for what's right, but just the inner emotions that are screaming at Jake every moment he goes to work or training. You want thrill-seeking shooters rent ""Lethal Weapon"". The violent scenes are not for the squeamish and the gore is very believable. Sure it has plenty of action for the action-junkie, but it's also a very intelligent film to back up on as well. The theme is who should you trust, your soul or your mind? With stunning action scenes and a believable premise, this has got to be the best heart-warming thriller that will leave you stunned for a long time.",Training Day
69,philip_vanderveken,"Don't mind the critics, this movie is good stuff!",7,12 September 2004,"Before watching the movie I had read some good and some bad credits about this movie. Some said it was overrated, that it wasn't realistic at all... Others said that it was the best movie they had ever seen. I saw the movie for the first time three years after it appeared in the theaters. Perhaps that is why I wasn't as influenced by the hype which was created around the movie as some other people may have been. Overall I liked the movie, though I wasn't very impressed with the first 20 to 30 minutes.What is the story about? The young police officer, Jake Hoyt, who has a perfect family, wants to get a better job within the LAPD. He doesn't want to write parking tickets for the rest of his life, but wants to become a detective in the Narcotica Brigade. To get this job, he will get some help and advice from a detective which is already chasing the bad guys for many years, but who isn't afraid to cross the line from time to time. Hoyt will have to make some big decisions, will he stay the good cop or will he cross the line as well?This movie may be a little predictable from time to time, but overall there are enough twists and unexpected plots to keep you focused and interested. The action is well portrayed, without exaggerating and Denzel Washington is really fabulous. I guess many people were a little bit disappointed because he played another part than what they expected from him. I liked him and I would advice everyone to watch the movie. To me this is worth at least 7/10, perhaps even a little bit more.",Training Day
70,screenman,Adequate,7,10 May 2009,"With two very engaging actors taking lead roles, in the form of Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke, this movie seemed to promise a great deal. Yet somehow it never live up to its pretensions.The beginning was almost a cliché of the genre, in which Hawke as naive rookie gets treated with cynical contempt by his street-wise bad-ass mentor, Washington. The whole thing has a slightly de-ja-vu look about it, as other equally good movies resonate in one's memory. But just as it begins shuffling towards Boredom Street, the plot quickens and undergoes a dramatic and unexpected shift. A likable bad guy, played by reliable Scott Glenn is ruthlessly slain by the mentor (who has clearly crossed the line) in punctuation for stealing his $4million stash. The whole thing is rigged to look like a shake-down that went wrong. It certainly gets your attention. Needless to say; the rookie wants no part of it and declines his share in the pay-off. You know from that point on that a collision course is inevitable. Later this rookie is left in the hands of a bunch of homicidal Hispanics who have evidently been paid by his mentor to whack him. He survives this experience by a coincidence that borders upon the supernatural and is rather hard to take seriously. Still; he does, and now goes after his 'villain' mentor. After that we are back to formulaic again. The ending is as weak as the beginning. Our rookie survives, the mentor gets wasted (by Russian mafia types) there's a brief off-camera newscast voice-over explaining that he's a 'hero' cop who died in the line of duty, blah,blah, blah.A group of shady senior law officers referred to as the Three Wise Men and who are also evidently rotten as hell - of which Tom Berenger is wasted in a cameo role - are never seen or heard from again. It's a very incomplete and unsatisfactory denouement. I'm left thinking that the money or the celluloid just ran out before the story could be wound up.You can see hints of 'Serpico' - which is more believable, 'The Rookie' - which is more fun, 'Deep Cover' which is more gripping, and one or two others. This work is adequate. The script is decent; acting is mostly good; location, lighting and sound do the business. Editing seems a bit choppy at times. It lights up predictably, shines brightly for a while, but fades without much flair. Worth a watch if you get the chance, but not recommended for any particular quality.",Training Day

Probably he is sometimes even improvising, for example in one of the first scenes, at the diner.Ethan Hawke keep a lower profile, which is much more easy to believe in. The story is passable, considering the genre, although not believeable of course. The violence is idiotic, showing people beaten up in a way that certainly would kill them in real life. Here they are well and kicking immediately, jumping and punching. We have seen it before. It's been stupid all the time.But you are entertained through all the clichées about gangland and gang members (aren't they protesting against this kind of heavy racism?).

Antoine Fuqua directed a wild cop drama like you have never seen before. Dealing with systematic corruption in the police force, crime investigation, drug dealing, bribery, and ethics. Training Day is a visceral sprint into law enforcement. Training Day forces you right into the position of a rookie cop asking yourself what would you honestly do in the same situation. It is brilliant due to David Ayer's clever and complex script alongside Fuqua's innovative and gritty direction. Training Day is timeless thanks to its commentary on police corruption and our contemporary police brutality problem. I think everyone needs to see Training Day. Denzel Washington is the real star as he comes across as the most real and selfish cop ever put on screen. His violence, anger, and ingenuity are met with his display of likability, experience, and results. Washington portrays a man of deeply held convictions that poses as a good cop to fool all those around him. Washington earned that Oscar for real. You will absolutely despise his character by the end. Notably, Ethan Hawke is the everyman rookie cop that we are meant to empathize with from the very first scene. We are along for the ride right by Hawke's side and he plays it wonderfully. From the naive well wisher that does not understand the streets to the honest cop that does the right thing, Hawke pulls off a very relatable performance in Training Day. He plays off of Washington's outgoing psychopath very convincingly down to the last. I like Hawke in Training Day quite a bit. I must mention there are so many neat cameo and supporting roles scattered throughout Training Day. From Scott Glenn, Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, Eva Mendes, and Terry Crews. Training Day's cast is wild. Everyone is realistic and feels a part of this horrid world of crime and corruption. In all, Antoine Fuqua did a phenomenal job directing Training Day. It has aged well with the same intensity as when it first released in theaters. Training Day is still shocking and visceral down to the last moment. This is a brutal ride along for the books, but well worth the watch.",Training Day

But the rest of the film was more than excellent.""Training Day"" is the best of the bad cop dramas that I have seen, and I've seen a few. Both Denzel Washington as the psychopathic bad cop, Alonzo, and Ethan Hawke as the idealistic rookie, Jake, were full out. Denzel Washington won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance, and Ethan Hawke was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. The direction by Antoine Fuqua was superb. The LA street scenes and milieu were as real and vivid as my old buddy Taco Bender. (And trust me, Taco Bender was very real.) The extras in the crowd scenes should get some kind of prize for macho scary. I've been there, and I still have a few nightmares. There are some streets in LA you don't want to walk down unless you are a homey, or a brother, and some other streets you don't want to walk down, period.Unlike some cop dramas and shoot 'em up thrillers, this one was carefully planned, so that the scene in the barrio at the card table, the rook all alone set up for the kill, came across as real because what had happened before was just about the only thing in the world that could have saved him. The LA atmosphere was like a rush, as stunningly authentic in a different way as, say, that in Chinatown (1974) or LA Confidential (1997), but more contemporary.I wonder how many guys starting in say the sixties or maybe a little before have experienced the kind of initiation that Jake experiences in terms of being fed some dope never before tasted and then ""led"" on the ""trip"" by someone wanting to exploit them. Most of the time, for most guys it was an initiation into something other worldly, scary, but something that was only psychological and would be gone the next day. For Jake it was a matter of, first, his livelihood as an idealistic cop, and second a matter of groking to a paranoid view of the world in which the good guys are the bad guys and everything is hopelessly corrupt and there is no good, only evil—and you just found out. And third, a matter of life and death with either acid and grass running all around your brain or maybe PCP and speed, and some suddenly obviously evil person (as Washington so well depicted) giving you the kind of ""guidance"" you can't refuse. And then finally it is beyond life and death and only a matter of primeval justice and a revenge you must perform.Look for Snoop Dogg in a wheelchair and Dr. Dre as one of Alonzo's posse cops.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

I mean, Training Day was shot using real ese's and vato's from the Imperial Courts in LA!  No cameras have ever been allowed into that hood!  This is the best ONE DAY movie ever!  Ethan Hawke is great and should have won the award for best supporting actor.  However, his time shall come. The best parts about this movie were that everything Denzel said was true (the director points this out).  The tension with the ese's at the kitchen table is authentic.  I was surprised that the Vato Smiley, is the same dude as the WOLF from Collatoral Damage.  He is a New Zealander in real life. However, he plays a very good ese.

79,Screen_Blitz,"Gritty, thoughtful police drama with an outstanding performance by Denzel Washington",10,28 January 2016,"This unflinchingly realistic police drama takes viewers into the dangerous world of drug dealing that runs rampant in the streets of South Central Los Angeles and where is a subject on nearly every street of the area. Along the side, this film also gives viewers an inside look at the corruption of law enforcement and police brutality that remains a major issue in the United States today. The film places Ethan Hawk in the role of Jake Hoyt, a rookie cop who ventures on a 24- hour 'ride along' with veteran narcotics detective Alonzo Harris (played by Denzel Washington). Cruising through the dirty, crime-ridden streets of Los Angeles, Harris pulls Hoyt in the grueling of crime and drug-busting. However, when Alonzo's lines between right and wrong become blurred and his bold decisions put Hoyt's life at risk, Hoyt soon find himself in a dangerous game of survival. This film is directed by Antoine Faqua and written by David Ayer who would later go on write and direct many other cop dramas. Not many films portray the harrowing reality of the law enforcement as realistically as this one does, and this film does not shy away from the dark side of police corruption as we watch the characters venture through the sordid streets of the South Los Angeles suburbs and experience the violence and gang activity that consumes these neighborhood. Thanks to Denzel Washington who breaks his usual good- guy typecasting to portray a narcotics cop who suffers significant ethical dilemmas and brings his first-time partner in jeopardy. The intensity of his character drives the plot in a long run, to the crescendo in the last half hour of the film At one point during the training, his character busts two teenagers for possession in marijuana with phencycldine, upon taking it he smokes it and then offers it to Ethan Hawke's character who in response smokes it. This scene immediately leaves you questioning on who his character is and leaves you with thoughts that this character could be up to no good. Denzel Washington gives an outstanding performance as Detective Alonzo Harris. Throughout the film, Washington is just drowned out in his role with such powerful effort. It is quite astonishing to see him play in a villainous role so well after watching him play in good-guy roles in his other works. Ethan Hawke does a magnificent job here too. He is shown to be very committed in what is arguably the best role of his career, and his talent shines bright here.Training Day is a highly entertaining movie and a textbook addition to the police drama genre. Complete with mesmerizing performances by Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke, powerful directing by Antoina Faqua, and a spectacular screenplay by David Ayer; Training Day definitely hits home.",Training Day
80,seymourblack-1,"Authentic, Intelligent & Utterly Engrossing",9,27 January 2012,"This movie's a top quality police drama that's not only violent, tense and exciting but also authentic, intelligent and utterly engrossing. It's set in the most dangerous neighbourhoods of L.A. where undercover cops regularly have contact with drug dealers and gangsters and also face high-risk situations on an almost daily basis. The men who undertake this work have to assume many of the characteristics of the criminals they pursue in order to be accepted and in so doing are expected to avoid being sucked into behaving in the same way as the people they're seeking to bring to justice. Needless to say, not every officer manages to do this.Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke)is an ambitious young rookie who wants to advance his career by becoming a member of an elite squad of undercover officers who work under the leadership of Detective Sergeant Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). When Alonzo agrees to take Jake on a one-day ride-along, Jake's thrilled, eager to learn and hopeful that he can show that he has the qualities needed to be a successful member of Alonzo's team.Jake is naive, idealistic and totally unprepared for the events that he'll experience during his training day. He's initially disconcerted by Alonzo's repartee and sense of humour and is later unsettled by some of his mentor's practices, which seem incredibly unorthodox. Alonzo has many years of experience in undercover work and so Jake is reluctant to challenge his methods too strongly.After observing the sale of some drugs in a park, Alonzo chooses not to make any arrests but simply acts in a very threatening manner towards the buyers and then confiscates their drugs. When Jake sees a young girl in an alley being sexually assaulted by two men, he overpowers them on his own and is then surprised when Alonzo decides not to report the incident after viciously beating up the two attackers. Alonzo knows that the girl's related to a gang member who will ensure that the two men are suitably punished but Jake is appalled by the use of this kind of street justice.Later, Jake accompanies Alonzo when he uses a fake search warrant to enter a drug dealer's house so that he can steal the dealer's money and on another occasion when Alonzo and the rest of his squad kill a drug dealer who used to be a cop so that they can steal his money. Jake refuses to take a share of the proceeds but then is forced to change his mind after Alonzo threatens to frame him for the murder.During his day with Alonzo, Jake is forced at gunpoint to smoke marijuana (laced with P.C.P.) and later pressured into drinking whisky and beer. He also learns that Alonzo owes a large amount of money to some Russian gangsters from Las Vegas and that the money stolen from the drug dealers is to be used to pay them off.Jake's recognition of how corrupt Alonzo had become had grown as the day progressed but things then become even more threatening when he realises during a visit to a Latino gangster's home that Alonzo has abandoned him and the gang are determined to kill him.""Training Day"" contains plenty of action and violence but it's all relevant to the story and is very effective in portraying the level of danger that Jake finds himself in. The way in which the story unfolds draws the audience into identifying with the hapless trainee and in so doing makes the whole drama extremely gripping. The initial meeting of Alonzo and Jake is fascinating and the way that their relationship develops turns out to be both interesting and unpredictable. The inclusion of sequences filmed on location in the neighbourhoods where the action is set, enhances the realistic feel of the whole project and the authentic sounding dialogue strengthens this further.Denzel Washington's Oscar winning performance captures perfectly Alonzo's unique combination of charm and menace and Ethan Hawke is extremely impressive as a young guy who experiences the most eventful and memorable day of his life.",Training Day

I did like Ethan Hawke's performance.  It was quite good.I guess Denzel was okay.  Not one of his best performances, bit above average though.The story was rather thin.  Sure it was complicated with alot of mush.  It did keep me pretty interested.  But at many times it was like yawn.  But I finish movies normally and this movie wasn't that bad. 
The ending was dumb.  I kinda liked the alternate ending shown on the dvd. But I'm not sure how well they could fix the russian link.  the russian link was probably the silliest part.Now it's really weird seeing this other actor (the one that tries to kill Ethan until he finds out Ethan's a good guy.  as in if it weren't for him, his cousin woulda been raped)  but I watched two movies last night.  This one and Three Kings.  Had I known the actor before I watched Whale Rider it mighta been interesting.  And I think he's best acting job is in Whale Rider.

I am feeling sorry for two main characters, because they first made us like them or get to know them, then when they are almost as our friend or family, they suffer. Similar to real life friend or family member loss. The only 3 bad things, hence the rating, I did not like is lack of real action, lack of positivity, and lack of solution.

85,mattymatt4ever,"Overlong and uneven, but very well-acted and often engaging",7,8 October 2001,"At times, ""Training Day"" seems like a photographed play.  Most of the scenes during the first and second acts take place within the confines of a patrol car, with Denzel and Hawke having their foul-mouthed interactions.  To be honest, I felt some of those scenes could've been trimmed or cut and didn't seem necessary.  The overuse of dialogue scenes dragged down the pace a little.  So you can say, the film could've used more time in the editing room.  The performances are stellar.  Denzel is one of my favorite actors, and it was nice to watch him play a character much different from the upperclassmen he usually plays.  This time around, he's an uninhibited, foul-mouthed, sadistic, no-nonsense narcotics cop.  Like always, I was impressed by Denzel, but I was even more impressed by his co-star Ethan Hawke. Technically, the film focuses on him, but since Denzel is a much bigger star--he has to get first billing.  Sorry, Ethan.  Hawke, though a fine actor, usually gets the role of the pretty-boy love interest.  This is a much, much different role for him.  He plays a quiet, well-intentioned married man who gets called in for training (as a narc) by Denzel.  The two guys couldn't be any more different, like all buddy cop movies.  But unlike most buddy cop movies, this is much darker.  There's humor here and there, but dark humor.  None of that Riggs-Murtaugh chemistry we got used to in the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies.  I have to admire Antoine Fuqua for not making the usual casting choices.  Another example of his original casting is Scott Glenn's role as a burned-out dealer, who Denzel befriends.  Of course, since Fuqua has a history directing music videos, we have supporting roles with such artists as Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg and Macy Gray.  Not the greatest actors, but they didn't have enough screen time to ruin the film. 
The climax is adverse to the film's harsh, realistic tone.  We're basically given the Hollywood treatment.  We have the usual dueling between the antagonist and protagonist, in which they beat each other to a bloody pulp. One of them gets away, the other returns--as a bloody mess--and they fight again.  I don't want to give away the ending, though there's no big surprises, but if an alleged tough guy is in the middle of a ghetto, gangbangers and dealers surrounding and outnumbering him, and starts telling them off--it don't matter if you're a policeman or not; those guys would blow you away in the drop of a hat.  That's when Denzel makes his ""King Kong ain't got s**t on me!"" speech, in which you're sitting in the theater trying to stop yourself from laughing.  And you know damn well those gangbangers and dealers would've laughed at him too--before he's brutally killed.  It's noticeable that the writer of this film tried to be realistic by injecting tons of street slang into the script, but some of the slang sounded more laughable (unintentionally) and preposterous than realistic.  Believe me, I live in an environment where I hear more street slang than I need to hear. I know the difference between real and fake slang.  ""Training Day"" is an overlong film that gets boring at times, but I found it mostly engaging.  The performances alone are worth watching.  By the way, that hot mamacita Eva Mendes plays Denzel's wife in the film.  And she has a brief nude scene.  Oh, man!  Is she hottt!My score:  7 (out of 10)",Training Day
86,hnt_dnl,Provocative allegory about good and evil,9,11 May 2008,"In re-visiting TRAINING DAY (2001) recently, I have absolutely no doubt that Denzel Washington deserved his Best Actor Oscar. He makes the absolute most of this role and is magnetic as corrupt narcotics cop Alonzo Harris. The main thing that I like about this performance is that Washington played it as a totally corrupt and unscrupulous man who once, a long time ago had wide-eyed principles of doing good and cleaning up the streets. But he lost his way to the point there is no redemption.In walks newly promoted young Detective Jake Hoyt (played superbly by Best Supporting nominee Ethan Hawke, who in reality has more screen time than Washington), Alonzo's new 'trainee'. Jake is who Alonzo used to be with a MAJOR difference...Jake is incorruptible! He refuses to give in to the seduction of the quick buck and giving up on humanity. And in the process, Jake is the one who proves to be the strongest of the pair. Even with his Oscar nom, I feel like Hawke's work goes unnoticed as he essentially is the true heart and anchor of the film. Jake could have easily come across as a fake, stereotypical, do-gooder character, but in the end, he makes the viewer believe in Jake's unflinching valor. We care BECAUSE OF Jake! Initially, a had a problem with the film taking place all in one day. While I still think that it's a bit unbelievable at times, I really appreciate how gritty and realistic many of the characters and situations translate to the screen. While there are hints of preachiness and convolution, the film still draws you into it's dangerous world in a very provocative way; it manages to stay a step ahead of the typical tale-of-the-streets, mainly due to many intense scenes and strong acting. I really didn't appreciate all of this when I first saw it, being totally awed by Washington's transfixing performance and ignoring how good a movie I was actually watching.Director Anton Fuqua did an amazing job not just with Washington and Hawke, but with the entire cast as well, with standouts being Scott Glenn (as the biggest street dealer in LA) and Cliff Curtis as a young Hispanic ganglord who actually shows signs of nobility. Addititonally, there are effective cameos by famous rapper-musicians Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre, and Macy Gray. But the obvious standout is Washington, whose powerful performance wholeheartedly deserved the Oscar...And he got it!",Training Day
87,sharky_55,"Strong safety, huh?",7,15 November 2016,"Ethan Hawke has made a career out of perfecting the nervous smile and candid shake of the head. Even as he gets older he has retained that youthful naivety about him. In Lord of War I noted he was woefully miscast as the FBI hotshot - Hawke is not the arrogant, in control type. In Training Day he is a different brand of law enforcement, where his character plays to his strengths. In the beginning Jake Hoyt feigns confidence and ambition, but soon after is immediately wringing his hands and vibrating with a nervous energy because of the things he is being asked to do (he put this aura to great use as the fresh faced teenager in Before Sunrise). Hawke is like a modern Jack Lemmon, but dropped into a urban, unforgiving environment and a tireless role. His body is withered and lean, with a scratchy, unkempt beard as a symptom of long nights. He represents a rat, a narcotics cops scurrying over to the dark side. Alonzo Harris is his opposite, who shares the same traits as Hoyt that might sooner mistake him for a dealer instead of a cop. Washington is relentless to the point of being overblown; with his skullcap, black 'matrix style' trenchcoat, silver crucifix necklace and penchant for double wielding pistols (with one aligned in the 'kill-shot' position), he treads the dangerous line between authenticity and the Hollywood vision of the edgy, corrupt cop. His dialogue is fast and furious, showcasing his 'street' knowledge and his wielding of racial capital to play both sides of the thin blue line closely, and often recklessly. In another world it would be easy to imagine him as a drug kingpin. It is this approach that leads to Hoyt's first challenge. Harris underlines the offer with a bit of wisdom that makes so much sense that almost makes up for his methods: to be a narc you must know and love the drug. The second part of his nefarious plan is to lace the joint with PCP and create a trial of evidence that will later come into play. The 'drug vision', shot from the perspective of the dazed Hoyt, is where the film shows some of its false colours. It's ridiculous, highlighted with a nightmarish green tint, canted dutch angle and erratic shaky-cam straight out of some Don't Do Drugs PSA for a high school crowd. The nauseous combo with extreme close-ups barrelling in on the young rookie's reactions are part of Fuqua's treatment of 'realism', albeit a shiny, sanitised version of working narcotics. Occasionally, he even is allowed to splurge, and the result of this is a dramatic rooftop meeting of similarly corrupt cops about to raid an informant, or as they call it, 'cashing in an account'. We understand that each of the four have gone through the same trial by fire that Hoyt is being pushed through. But what's wrong with a Starbucks?The ideal behind Hawke's Hoyt is a good one, if not simplistic. An early scene tacks a wife and child onto him like some sort of moral compass point, but not as part of a three dimensional character. He's an amalgamation of the characteristics that we and Hollywood like to see often in movies - white, middle class, young father, morally upright. Fuqua aligns the audience alongside him, and we nod and agree with his moral choices, before all that is upended and we discover that the streets operate on an entirely different level than the cinematic black and whites we are so used to. But the film also falls victim at the same crux. It posits that sometimes the bad guys win and that simple morality might not always be such an easy out, but then lets the angelic protagonist navigate the messy and heartless territory it has worked so hard to establish with relative ease and a few convenient narrative strokes. Training Day recalls other tangled crime dramas about figures trying to navigate the corrupt waters of the system, in particular the Hong Kong film Infernal Affairs and its more well known western counterpart, The Departed. While the former wears its pulp on its sleeve by using a flashy action aesthetic and showy, soap-opera-esque flashbacks to push the narrative along, the latter was well and truly americanised. As with many of Scorsese's films it verges on the point of being overdone, stretched an extra fifty minutes and made gritty, grey and quietly devastating. A distinct difference lies in the treatment of the undercover gang member who infiltrates the police system: the original had a way of swinging allegiances and evoking Buddhist sentiments of a perpetual guilt, whilst Scorsese all but batters Matt Damon into the ground, leaving no room for dispute. Interestingly, Training Day was released but a month after the 9/11 attacks, with the American public distraught, and fear and paranoia running rampant. In that climate a cop could do no wrong. Nowadays I look around and see a very different environment, one where the lessons of Training Day might not be so shocking. While the two former films are more or less straight thrillers, Training Day attempts to say a little more, but it's not entirely successful either.",Training Day
88,jhclues,Washington Makes It Worthwhile,6,4 April 2002,"A brutal and disturbing film that attempts to connect you with the underbelly of the streets of downtown Los Angeles, while examining that fragile, thin line between those who enforce the law and those who break it, `Training Day,' directed by Antoine Fuqua, is a cautionary morality tale that decidedly points out that what you do and who you are is a matter of free will and personal choice.  Beyond the action, it's a study of human nature that explores the necessity of having a moral code by which to live, especially when confronted with that age-old seductress Evil, who can lure even the best of the best across that line from which there is no return. The most disconcerting aspect of the film, however, is in it's portrayal of those in high places who with facility betray those they are sworn to serve and protect, with their flagrant abuse of their position and power, and moreover, seemingly always manage to hold the high ground of advantage over those against whom their misdeeds are perpetrated.  Indeed, the burden of proof must always fall to the good guy, and more often than not it is those endowed with a more positive, benevolent nature-- the ones who want to do the right thing-- that find justice elusive and become victims themselves, if only because of their refusal to compromise their own principles.  And that is really what is at the heart of Fuqua's film, which very probably will take many viewers to a place they would rather not be.  But, as Steve McQueen said in `Bullitt,' when asked by his girlfriend how he can stand doing a job that keeps him so close to the gutter, `That's where half of it is--'  And in today's world, unfortunately, it may well be that the percentage is even higher; which somewhat elevates the significance of this film.	Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), a nineteen month veteran of the L.A.P.D., is about to begin his first day on a new assignment, having landed a spot in the Narcotics Division, where he will be a member of a small squad under the direction of Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington)-- if he measures up to Alonzo's stringent expectations.  It's a job he wants, because he sees it as an opportunity to really do some good in the community; it's a place from which he can help rid the streets of drug dealers and other felons.  But he quickly discovers that-- as most worthwhile things are in life-- it's just not that easy.  As Alonzo is quick to point out, `If you want to protect the sheep from the wolf, you have to become a wolf.  It's the wolf that catches the wolf--'  Jake also learns that on this day he's going to have to make a lot of decisions, and make them quickly, without the luxury of time to consider all of the possible ramifications.  And one of them is put to him directly by Alonzo, who tells him he's going to have to decide what he wants to be, a sheep-- or a wolf.  It's something he's going to have to know by the end of the day; and Jake doesn't know it going in, but this day, his `Training Day,' is going to be a day that will change his life forever.	Fuqua's film is presented honestly and in such a way that it successfully puts the viewer on the streets of L.A., and Jake and Alonzo are credible characters; but the motivation behind Alonzo's ruthlessness is fairly anemic and under-developed.  The weakness of the film, in fact, lies in the screenplay (by David Ayer), which though it captures a certain sense of `street-wise' reality, is otherwise rather formulaic and doesn't really have the depth it needs to make it emotionally involving.  And one of the biggest flaws, especially in light of the fact that this story is presented in `realistic' terms, is that a key element of the plot hinges on a coincidence that Vegas odds-makers would love to put some big money on.  Fuqua visits much of the same territory as Dennis Hopper's 1988 film, `Colors,' though the final message is quite different, inasmuch as the focus of this film is on the `bad cop' angle.  As stated previously, there is some significance to this one, but it takes some work and imagination on the part of the viewer to discern.	As Alonzo, Denzel Washington gives an excellent performance-- and, quite frankly, this film would be less than average without him-- but whether or not it is deserving of an Oscar is open to speculation.  Washington is one of the finest actors in the business, without question, and he's taken on some challenging roles (in which he's been very successful) that make this part pale by comparison.  Alonzo Harris is more along the lines of Mel Gibson's Riggs in `Lethal Weapon,' or Eastwood's Harry in `Dirty Harry,' the difference being that Alonzo is the bad guy.  It's a credit to Washington's ability that he was able to make this such a strong character, however, and his Alonzo is certainly believable and real.  And, in retrospect, perhaps it is an Oscar-worthy performance; it had to be to overcome the weakness of the script and what he was given to work with.  And, again, without Denzel Washington, this film plays for two weeks in the theater and is quickly forgotten when it hits the video store shelf.	Hawke gives a strong performance, as well, but that he received an Oscar nomination for it is the stuff of which debates are born.  Like Washington, however, Hawke does do a good job of bringing his character to life, and it is one of the strengths of the film.	The supporting cast includes Tom Berenger (Stan), Harris Yulin (Doug) and Scott Glenn (Roger).  In the final analysis, `Training Day' is elevated by the performances of it's stars; without them, this one has no legs.  6/10.",Training Day
89,educallejero,A masterpiece action thriller (it's not real life bruh),10,7 August 2019,"So many people almost offended by the ""that's impossible"" scenes from this movie just can't enjoy things.At no point I ever thought ""oh this is like real life but onscreen and the director is denouncing police corruption"".It is very obvious, intended by the director/writer or not, that the movie USES real life problems (corruption at every level, starting for the street drug dealers and ending in the judicial system that benefits from it), and like many other great fun movies puts it all together to create and intoxicatingly fun ride of a movie.The fact that Washington, Scott Glenn and the supporting cast gives the characters that much charisma just makes it better, perfect.Some people are bothered by the ending not being realistic enough and too ""happy"" or something like that.

Thw acting is as good as acting can get. Denzil Washington is fantastic and quite rightly recieved an oscar nomination but Ethan Hawke deserves compliments too. this is by far his best acting roll and quite frankly things can't get any better.

Alonzo doesn't conform to the norm however to get results and Jake is pushed into doing things that he is very uncomfortable with. The more he does the harder it is to turn back and he becomes embroiled in Alonzo's schemes. A very good movie with fine performances from both the leads.

Clearly inspired by recent events within the LAPD, TRAINING DAY is told from Hawke's point of view, allowing the audience to share in his escalating sense of outrage, until he's finally tipped over the edge by a monstrous betrayal of trust. But, like any number of exploitation movies before it (even those as polished and presentable as this one), TRAINING DAY is conservative in thought and deed: Washington is sexy, dynamic and evil to the bone, and the movie wallows in his decadence before concluding with an audience-pleasing showdown between Good and Evil.

94,Pedro_H,"Pointless theme-ride through the LA gutter, despite good acting and production values.",5,2 May 2004,"Police and thieves are such a staple of TV that you have to be looking at making something special to make one stand out as a feature film.Here the producers try and make things bigger, bolder and more extreme but, sadly, this only makes the production more hysterical and far-fetched. No cop in the history of the force is quite as down-and-dirty as the one played here by Denzil Washington. Indeed he is probably as out-there as any cop in the history of cinema cops!Excess and success have often been mistaken for one another in the Oscar world and here Denzil took the main prize with this good, but hardly great, performance. The guy can grin and talk in double time (this guy knows about speech rhythm and stress - which is rare for an American actor), but this must have been a poor year. Nathan Hawke is actually just as good as the rookie that may - or may not - be corrupted.Here we are in ""blacktown after-dark"" (for those that have seen Kentucky Fried Movie!) and you can be sure that the minute they step out of the car there will be gunshots, a chase and a death. Yes it is quite lively and the street hoods do look the real deal, but so what, they probably are the real deal!I feel for Hawke, the cop he is playing is a moron so he can only react not act. Hope he gets his own star gig soon - he looks ready.There are plenty of other movies that leave a horrible aftertaste - Boyz in the Hood, Menace 2 Society, Taxi Driver, to name but three - but there films have some social comment to make. This doesn't. This says: It is all rotten, it is all without hope. Bad places have bad cops so they are part of the problem not part of the solution. There is no redeeming qualities here.

96,RonellSowes,Captivating Performance Veritable Ambience,8,25 May 2021,"Antoine Fuqua's later work isn't very note worthy, but that doesn't diminish the job he did here. He certainly knew the world he was depicting and filled in any gaps with the actual environment. But perhaps more real than any real gangster is Denzel Washington as Alonzo Harris.Alonzo Harris is more than a 'Dirty' Harry Callahan or Popeye Doyle sort of cop who toes the boundries with his rough, rule breaking approach as he tracks down the 'bad guys'. Harris is one of the bad guys only he has a badge to give him an edge over the street hoods. His justification for his conduct is that criminals work outside of the law and to get to them the police should too. But Alonzo is no different than any of the villains rookie officer Jake meets over the day, and as the film suggests he's possibly worse.The brutality and genuineness Denzel Washington brings to the role is exceptional and the quality of his performance raises the entire film a couple notches. As Hitchcock said ""The better the villain, the better the picture"" and Alonzo Harris is a great villain. Who packs so much authenticity you could almost think he's a real thug off of the street if you didn't know better.The veracity of this picture extends beyond Washington's performance which is what separates it from so many films. The Los Angeles crime world of this film stands above and away from almost any other peer. In it's own right it even surpasses the more stylish depiction of Michael Mann's films and portrays something far more raw and vicious. The movie puts you on some of the worst streets in the city in a way that transcends watching and is more of an experience nearly on par with way Apocalypse Now did for Vietnam.",Training Day

100,RJBurke1942,Not what the rookie expected...but it was ordered,8,9 October 2006,"Finally, a movie where Denzel Washington plays the bad guy! And, wins a well-deserved Oscar for Best Actor. Moreover, Ethan Hawke was nominated for Best Supporting Actor.So, this movie has two great performances to see, as the rogue cop, Alonzo Harris (Washington) takes on the new wannabe narc rookie, Jake (Hawke) on his very first day on the job. And, what a day it is...There are three threads to this complex plot: first, Alonzo has the Russian Mafia after him and must deal with the problem or die  there's a contract out on him, and those Russian types just don't mess around; Alonzo also has a group of dirty cops who are getting ready to take down another long-time dirty cop who's been supplying drugs for years  and Alonzo and his gang intend to cash in; and, finally, Alonzo has a do-gooder rookie who thinks he's on the job to actually do good for others, instead of just doing good for himself  money-wise that is.So, where're the real bad guys, you ask? Well, they're either wearing suits and pulling Alonzo's chain in the big end of town or, they're sitting on the sidelines of the really bad areas, waiting for Alonzo and his buddies to mess things up for themselves  so that they can then cash in...A big part of the plot is somewhat artificial because Jake's eventual success, shall I say, on his first day comes only as a result of a very fortuitous co-incidence when he saves a young schoolgirl from an attempted rape. It's a crucial event, and I suppose the screenwriter figured that only one unlikely co-incidence was okay. I guess so...Apart from that, it is a fast paced, beautifully edited and photographed, non-stop, rip-roaring, pulsating, wisecracking, boom and bust, kick-butt action movie that left me dazed after first viewing. A second viewing helped to clear up some of the more confusing details. You might want to watch it twice also, but if you like Denzel, then you'll watch this one at least once.",Training Day

102,FlickJunkie-2,"Intense, powerful, implausible",7,10 May 2002,"This film starts with an excellent premise and then sprints straight out into left field, makes a right turn at incredible and lands somewhere between absurd and ridiculous.  Actually, I enjoyed the film, but this day of mayhem and corruption is so far from believable that it diminishes the film's value.One of the most important factors in a good cop film is realism.  It requires not just realistic guns, explosions and car chases, but realistic and authentic characters and a plausible story.  In this film, almost all the characters are way over the top.  Rookie director Antoine Fuqua brings great intensity to each frame from his music video experience, and most scenes have an imposing power that grabs the viewer and chokes off his air supply.  However, Fuqua's failing in this film is that of excess.  There are no moments of calm to create contrast.  The film is all storm.  It is well done, but exhausting.Denzel Washington is a great actor.  I say this without hesitation. However, this is nowhere near his best performance.  He was far better in both `Hurricane' and `Malcom X'.  He was robbed in 1993 when the best actor award went to Al Pacino for `Scent of a Woman' instead of going to him for his performance in `Malcolm X'.  In `Training Day', Washington tries far too hard to be bad.  He overacts in spots and he is so intent on being forceful that he neglects character nuances, normally his greatest strength as an actor.  So, while I consider this to be a strong performance by any other standard, comparing Denzel to Denzel, this performance is just slightly above average.  This year, Russell Crowe got robbed.  However, Crowe won it last year despite the fact that both Ed Harris and Geoffrey Rush gave better performances.  What goes around comes around, I suppose.Ethan Hawke was also nominated for his supporting role as Jake, and it was a nomination that was well deserved.  This is the strongest performance I can remember from Hawke.  His is the most credible and nuanced performance in the film, despite being in Washington's shadow.  He is helped, of course, by the fact that the character is the only one that is anything like a real person in the entire film.This is a vigorous film that never lets up.  The action and the psychological tension are first rate.  It is just too overblown to be real. And to be great, cop stories need to be real.  I rated it 7/10.",Training Day

I won't go into depth about the story, 'cause I want you to see it as I did, but let me just say that there were a number of times in the film were I was ""on the edge of my seat"".The only complaint I have about the movie is that Snoop Doggy Dogg, Dr. Dre and Macy Gray were in the film.  Their acting was pretty good though (in their defense), but I just don't like seeing musicians in films (unless they are playing themselves/musicians, i.e. Slipknot in ""Rollerball (2002)"" or White Zombie in ""Airheads"")I don't want to get your hopes up or anything, but I thought this was an incredible movie, and I hope that you will agree with me.  This movie isn't for everyone, this is DEFINITELY a film for adults, there is a lot of swearing and intense scenes.  I'm not really sure what else to say about this other than ""See this movie!"".  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Training Day
108,OriginalMovieBuff21,A good solid crime movie,7,27 April 2004,"This was a good film with many great performances. Denzel Washington was explosive and did very well in acting for his part. Ethan Hawke was good too, but I haven't really seen him in much films. Usually he's in those kind of cop movies. There are some negatives also in this movie. Like for instance, it got kind of boring, you know like flipping back to back parts on some occasions with drugs and other stuff and training day is kind of old though too. I mean there's tons and tons of films before it that are just like this. Although, I did like this movie and Denzel did really good in his part like I said and I liked the action too.7/10",Training Day
109,Antagonisten,A B-movie,3,14 August 2006,"I can start off by saying that i consider the Academy Award to be a very dubious award. It seems more like a pat on the back for long and faithful service (and with a little added political correctness) than a true award for outstanding achievement. That being said i still think it's insane that this movie (or rather the actors in this movie) was nominated for two Academy Awards and received one.Now don't get me wrong, Denzel Washington is a terrific actor. I have seen and liked him in many parts but this just isn't one of them. In fact part of why this movie is such a failure is Denzel Washington. The whole streetwise cop-routine just doesn't work for him. He ends up looking like the kind of cop who wouldn't have survived one episode of ""The Shield"" (to name one similar reference). And still we are to believe that he is a man who has lived well off of bribe money for a long time.And the second issue of credibility is of course Ethan Hawke. I'm not an expert on the American police authorities but somehow i doubt that someone would like to put Ethan Hawke in plainclothes in an all-black/Hispanic neighborhood. Even that issue put aside Ethan Hawke still looks like he's fifteen years old and completely lacks any credibility as a policeman. And for this he gets one Academy Award nomination? And beside these monumental issues? Well it's more or less like one long and quite poorly written episode of ""The Shield"". The old jaded corrupt cop shows complete disregard for his own and his rookies safety when he plays the streets like an amateur throughout. The technical quality of the movie are OK, as is the scenery. The acting is not impressive though, although i would credit that to poor writing more than substandard actors.""Training Day"" is a B-movie in every respect except one; it has stars attached to it and one of those stars was long overdue for an Academy Award. This movie could just as easily have been in theaters for two weeks and then gone right to the video store if you replaced Denzel with, say, Cuba Gooding Jr. And an over-acting star in a poorly written role does not a good movie make. Personally i lament that Denzel couldn't get his award for a more memorable performance, also in that regard is this movie a waste.",Training Day
110,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: deep & fascinating action film,9,3 April 2002,"""Training Day"" is either a drama or an action story -- you can take the film for either, which is good because as an action film buff I normally don't get into dramas -- too arty, with melodrama bits that bore me, or overly subtle. Fortunately, Training Day avoids both extremes, being a fascinating police story with outstanding performances that won Ethan Hawke an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, and Denzel Washington the Oscar for Best Actor.The story is gritty and real-world, with an ""edge"" that avoids campy entirely. Although it's quite violent, they avoid serious gore. And although the premise of the story is not new (what premise is?), how it's played out, especially at the ending, is original and satisfying. The film has both more drama and more action than the recent spate of Robert DeNiro drama / thrillers, including ""Heat"", which is similar.Who should see this film:-- Action film buffs, even if you hate dramas, even if youare only happy when stuff is blowing up constantly-- Drama / arty types, unless you are turned off by what isperhaps one notch too much violence (less than ""The Professional"" aka ""Leon"" (1994)).-- non-action film types who might see one action film everyso often, and have maybe heard about ""training day"",with the same caveat about violence.I'll give ""Training Day"" an excellent 9 out of 10.",Training Day

112,christophe92300,Mixed feelings,5,21 October 2012,"I have mixed feelings about ""Training Day"".The cinematography is excellent, dynamic, basically spot on, as are the actors though one could be annoyed by Washington's performance but I guess this has to do with his character.To me, the real problem is the script. It is dynamic, unfolds pretty smoothly, no overlong passages, but everything is predictable, and there are two big plot holes that completely annihilate the premises of the movie (read the board and you will understand what I am talking about).Overall, Training Day feels pretty entertaining but you probably watched this type of movie a hundred times, nothing new here, and the plot holes mess up badly the credibility of this film.",Training Day
113,departed07,A different Denzel for the better.,9,20 March 2008,"Over the years Denzel Washington is known to playing either heroic leading characters or historic people (Malcolm X, Herman Boone), but now he gets to play the villain for the first time where I couldn't keep my eyes off of him when he first made his appearance as Alonzo Harris.""Training Day"" is really about Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke in a different turn from Indie films), a trainee for the Los Angeles Narcotic Division where he wants to put away the bad guys just like all good cops are suppose to do until he meets Alonzo, a bad-ass happy trigger cop who knows everything about the city of Los Angeles from the Vatos, the druggies, the pimps, the cripples, the gang members who alert Alonzo, and so forth where he also speaks languages.Hoyt thinks that all he's doing with Alonzo is part of a routine...he's wrong about one thing.From one event to another Hoyt is either being dragged or coaxed by Alonzo from taking drugs, being part of a set-up after a murder where now he doesn't really know if being a narcotic officer is the line of work for him.""Training Day"" is an insane ride where Denzel takes the screen like a madman tied to a bomb not knowing when he's going explode; he takes the term villain to a whole new level especially in cop corruption. Ethan Hawke is outstanding as the new rookie where other performances from Scott Glenn, Macy Gray, Dr. Dre, Tom Beranger, Peter Greene and Snoop Dogg shine out as well.",Training Day
114,beresfordjd,A revelation!!,9,12 March 2017,"While I always knew that Denzel is one of the very best screen actors of the modern age, it was a revelation to see what a great villain he could be. That said, he was still Denzel the charmer as Alonzo in Training Day. We even began to believe that he was redeemable after he shot the Scott Glenn character as he explaining that that sort of thing was a necessary evil. I was annoyed that Eva Mendes was nominated for an award for an appearance that lasted seconds over all. Also cameos from Snoop, Macy and Dr Dre were totally redundant and distracted this viewer. They really do not have the chops for parts like that. Ethan Hawke was terrific in this film too and was the perfect foil for Mr Washington. It has been a long time since I saw TD originally and it impressed me greatly then. The impact has not lessened over the years.",Training Day
115,Spanner-2,"Washington is excellent, ending is awful",7,21 October 2001,Denzell Washington and Ethan Hawke are terrific in this cop drama about a rookie cop who finds out his mentor is crooked. The film is excellent for the first two thirds beforing veering way off course in a rather preposterous conclusion that almost wrecks  the good that comes before. Still worth watcing just for the terrific performance by Washington. GRADE: B,Training Day
116,Darth_Osmosis,A truly brilliant movie!,10,28 May 2018,"Denzel Washington is incredible as a hardened cop who takes a rookie under his wing, Ethan Hawke is also great as said rookie. The plot is twisting and turning and makes this ""training day"" seem like a long hard career! Characters and dialogue are excellent throughout. it's a gritty action/thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Every moment in this matters somehow and forms a bigger picture. I absolutely love this movie!",Training Day
117,iohefy-2,WHAT A WASTE OF TALENT,5,1 October 2001,Denzel Washington is a great actor and to see him spewing four letter words throughout the length of this picture is not what I expected to see.  I don't mind the occasional four letter+ words once in a while but that was the major part of the words spoken. It is a shame that the studios have to inject this into movies to draw the young people.  What has happened to just entertainment????,Training Day
118,AKS-6,Entertaining,6,9 November 2001,"[Contains what some might consider SPOILERS!]Training Day is a pretty standard cop movie. Corrupt cops isn't exactly a new theme in modern cinema. It is, however, quite interesting to see Hawke's character struggle with what he sees Washington's character do.The fact that we only get to follow Jake and Alonzo for a day is both the movie's strength and its weakness. The strenght is that the pace is quick and the movie is never boring. The weakness is that it seems a bit over the top for all those things to happen in less than 24 hours.Since Denzel Washington is in the film the acting is of course brilliant. Ethan Hawke also does a great job.Overall, Training Day is entertaining and never boring. A good film: nothing more, nothing less. (6/10)",Training Day
119,Offworld_Colony,"A modern classic, ruefully playing with the established conventions of the grizzled good cop teaching the wet-eared newbie about the real policing of the streets.",9,10 February 2020,"Denzel absolutely glues the film together between Ayer's spectacular script (one I read recently and its a real pleasure just to read it in its torrid detail and attention) and Fuqua's creative but steady direction. It's got satisfying stings of action between its trope inversions and a sine wave of momentum, you'll grip the seat, convinced of something only to be soothed and breathe a sigh of relief before the next peak or trough just as Ethan Hawke's character is.

120,bsinc,Auuuuuuuuuuuuuuu,9,2 April 2002,"I can't stop thinking about this movie. Yesterday evening I rushed to the cinema because something told me I just had to see it. Whatever it was, I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL!!!!!! I was blown away in the first few minutes. Denzel Washington' performance left me speechless and a day later I still can't find the right words to use. It was as if he'd been preparing his whole life for this role, building and forming it inside his mind but in the mean time also delivering some of the better performances seen on the big screen like the one in ""Crimson Tide"" or ""Devil in a blue dress""... I think a Slovene critic said it best; The role of Alonzo Harris is Denzel's ""Scarface"", it's a role, a character, a movie that breaths in the beat of his heart and it's a role that represents a peak in his career.
A movie that never ceases to amaze took me for an unforgettable ride making sure that I will never look at Mr. Washington the same again. When his name is going to be mentioned this is the role I will think of first. Kudos to Ethan Hawke as well who represented another major surprise of the movie proving that he is a good actor and that he could easily follow the tempo of his ""partner in crime"". With the amazing performances by the two actors, a story that kept me begging for more and a bunch of memorable supporting roles (Scott Glen, the surprisingly great Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and Macy Gray)and a great sound track this is without a doubt the best 2001 had to offer.Denzel winning his well deserved Oscar (although Russel Crowe's performance was almost equally good) proved to be merely icing on a cake that was already amazing.     My ni**a!        10/10",Training Day
121,Cinemaniac1984,Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke both cast against type in this excellent cop movie,9,5 February 2015,"It's easy to look at Training Day as just another action/crime movie with the bad cop corrupting the rookie and dragging him into his world. With Denzel Washington turning in his best performance as the villain and Ethan Hawke as the idealistic, likable and heroic good guy, this is anything but a routine movie. Both actors are excellent in their roles, and Antoine Fuqua does an excellent job bringing a gritty no holds barred crime movie to the screen.LAPD Officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) is an idealistic, honest, good hearted rookie who has one day to prove himself that he has what it takes in the Narcotics Division. Jake Hoyt is very eager to make a good impression and earn his place as well as seeing this role as a stepping stone to making Detective. Detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington in his Academy Award winning role as Best Actor) is a 13 year highly decorated veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department and has a feared and respected reputation amongst all police officers, friends, criminals, and enemies alike. Alonzo is assigned to showing Jake the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles as well as taking Jake under his wing as a mentor. However, Alonzo Harris is a corrupt police officer to the point where the line is blurred between cop and criminal, right and wrong, good and bad, and what is legal and illegal. Alonzo Harris is not above physically intimidating and assaulting suspects, as well as stealing, robbing, assaulting, planting evidence, and setting up a murder to look like a justified shooting. Though Alonzo Harris justifies this as all in the good of taking bad guys off the street or in his words which he lives by on the streets of Los Angeles, ""To protect the sheep you gotta catch the wolf, and it takes a wolf to catch a wolf."" Alonzo Harris is also extremely arrogant and selfish who will do anything for money as well as caring very little for anyone else but himself.Once Jake Hoyt witnesses Alonzo Harris' unconventional methods of enforcing the law through his own brand of street justice in which he makes up his own rules, Jake finds that it may be too late to save himself and his career. Alonzo threatens Jake by making him smoke drugs at gunpoint otherwise face being thrown out of Narcotics Division. Jake also witness many immoral acts committed by Alonzo to the point where he questions his own conscience and whether Alonzo is a police officer wanting to enforce street justice or just a criminal wanting to commit acts beneficial to himself.Denzel Washington is well known for portraying a variety of good guys on the screen in movies such as Glory, Philadelphia and The Hurricane. Cast against type in Training Day, he does an excellent job portraying the villainous, down and dirty Alonzo Harris. There was a lot of controversy when Denzel Washington won the 2001 Best Actor Academy Award for his role when Russell Crowe was strongly tipped for his role in A Beautiful Mind. Regardless, Denzel Washington thoroughly deserved to win for his role. This is definitely Denzel Washington's best role in his entire career.Ethan Hawke was previously known for his roles in Dead Poets Society, Alive, Reality Bites, and The Newton Boys. Ethan Hawke, who also deserved to be nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award, comes of age in his role as the idealistic and honest rookie Jake Hoyt who is very eager to make a good impression but finds himself in over his head in an unfamiliar world. Although Jake Hoyt makes several mistakes which end up almost costing him his career as well as his life, he proves himself to be a capable police officer when he saves a teenage girl from being sexually assaulted by two homeless men, which later saves his life. To date, this is Ethan Hawke's best role.Other actors which appear in Training Day include Scott Glenn (The Silence of the Lambs) as a local drug dealer Roger, Tom Berenger (Platoon) as District Attorney Stan Gursky, Harris Yulin (Scarface) as Detective Doug Roselli, rapper Snoop Dogg as wheelchair bound drug dealer named Blue, New Zealand actor Cliff Curtis (Three Kings) as a thug named Smiley, pop star Macy Gray as the wife of a drug dealer, Eva Mendes in an early role as Alonzo's mistress Sara, and as part of Alonzo's corrupt crew of police officers rapper Dr. Dre as Paul (who comes across as a thug than a police officer), and Nick Chinlund (Con Air) as Tim.Training Day certainly left a long lasting impression of me when I first saw this movie back in 2002 which will never be forgotten. In what could have been a routine action movie, becomes an intense, gritty and compelling cop drama. Excellent job all round, Denzel Washington earns his well deserved critical acclaim as the bad guy Alonzo Harris, and Jake Hoyt also deserves acclaim for his role as Jake Hoyt. It's also great to see Antoine Fuqua go on to direct greater movies such as Tears of the Sun, Shooter and The Equalizer. Screenwriter David Ayer has also carved out his own career following this movie and has also made his mark as a director with Street Kings, End of Watch, and Fury.Training Day is an excellent movie which is definitely highly recommended.9/10.",Training Day
122,PyrolyticCarbon,"Excellent performances with a good, fast paced script.",7,10 February 2003,"Excellent performance from Denzel Washington and an equally believable one by Ethan Hawke. The well written and thought out plot keeps this high paced thriller moving along nicely. It keeps you unsure of what either of the main characters' motives are, or even if they have any at all. Initially the Washington character can seem quite grating, showing the well written part, and soon your sympathies are lying with whom they should be. Although the ending is quite weak, and can leave you feeling short changed, it still makes a good, well written film.",Training Day
123,supertom-3,Denzel makes this movie!,8,23 July 2004,"This is a cracking cop thriller. The premise is simple, with Ethan Hawkes rookie cop taken on a training day with experienced and hardened officer Denzel Washington. He soon discovers that Denzel has let the position of power go to his head and that he is quite prepared to abuse his power. Hawke is excellent in his role as the rookie caught up in a terrible world of police corruption and he is deserving of his Oscar nomination, perhaps deserved of the win. Denzel is superb though. His character is meaty, with this guy almost being a personification of evil while also having other personalities to him, a character who is almost trying to delude himself into thinking that he is an upholder of the law. Washington is amazing, this is one of the greatest bad guy performances ever. Denzel is like a firecracker, one minute he is exploding and showing off an alarming attitude towards policing and the next he is talking Hawkes character round, convincing him that what they do is right. He is so good he almost talks the audience round at the same time. Of course the film may seem very exaggerated in regards to the police corruption in LA (ten cops from each precinct can be charged with abusing their privileges and the law apparently!). Overall this is a classy thriller directed with style by Antoine Fuqua. ****",Training Day
124,dead47548,Original and engrossing.,9,9 January 2008,"Police corruption is a topic that is used numerous times in films to the point of annoyance, but this one makes it much more gritty and realistic than any example I can think of. I'm always a fan of the 'Good v. Evil' scenario and this one employs it perfectly. The polar opposites that the film creates in Alonzo and Hoyt (the former being completely corrupt, the latter being completely pure) are very interesting and the balance between them kept me engaged the entire film. As we watch Hoyt try to understand this new world that he's been thrown into, while still trying to keep his morality and good nature intact, we realize (just like he does) that there is no right or wrong. You have to create a balance, because the line 'It's not what you know, it's what you can prove.' couldn't be more true, so sometimes that's why you have to bend the rules in order to bring the bad guys down. The ending is one of my all time favorites, as Hoyt leaves Alonzo to be murdered by the numerous men out to get him because he can't arrest him and he can't kill him himself. Brilliant. Both of the lead performances are excellent, and Denzel's win was fully deserved. His charisma and the fact that his character was so against his normal 'good guy' type made for such an interesting and ethereal portrayal of one of my favorite characters. The only thing that I wasn't a fan of was the huge coincidence that the girl Hoyt randomly saved from being raped just happened to be the cousin of the man who was about to kill him. I found that insanely dumb, but it didn't affect my opinion on the film at all.",Training Day

The training day of a rookie cop (Ethan Hawke) yields a seasons' worth of confrontations, revelations, implications and ethical questions about law enforcement and the ""nature of the business"".

I've seen others of Fuqua's filmography and the likes of Southpaw were extremely entertaining and it seems he's had a long career of hits. Back to Training Day this is a masterpiece, straight from the get go you can relate to/empathise with Hawke's Jake Hoyt and he feels like a well defined and crystal clear character from the very first second, not a doubt in anyone's minds he's the hero of the film. A story of corruption is naturally interesting and I must say the performance by Washington deserves all the praise it gets as he falls into the group of villains which you truly despise, testament to his performance and the quality of the writing/directing. Baring some parallels finally to Se7en the grim depiction of the criminal underworld is full of life and looks realistic and dingy. As the titular 'Training Day' ensues and develops with Hoyt dragged into the shady dealings of Alonzo the tension ramps up and the stand off occurs, feeling organic and natural the division of our protagonists is understandable and feels genuine leading to the neighbourhood shootout and chase between the two leads, at times a little far fetched it's still gritty and heart pounding, concluding with Washington's iconic monologue and his exile from the neighbourhood. Boasting a cast of notable faces such as Cliff Curtis and Eva Mendez as well as a couple of celebrity cameos from Dr.Dre and Snoop Dogg who aren't actually bad actors this is a masterclass in conflict, tension and character, a true great of cinema",Training Day
128,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,5,3 June 2021,"Good Morrow, countrymen.Talk about a bad first day on the job. Denzel Washington is bad cop and Ethan Hawke is the rookie good cop...and a load of other ""stars"" fill out the cast. LA is once again cast as The Hood, it's a tired location...was tired in Colors (1988) and remained a boring cliché is 2001. Bad Lieutenant cast of characters vs. Serpico's vs. Drug Dealers vs. Gangs - the formula has endured.What saves this trite script is the performance of Washington, especially seeing him play a scum at the end of his rope - he's very effective. Of course, this is a l3ftist fantasy portraying cops as the bad guys - and having the actual bad guys deliver street justice in the end - yeah, right. Every character is cartoon dutifully reciting cornball tough guy street dialog.The bathtub scene: What are the odds? Who cares...this is the type of nonsense you get in a dumb movie.

Is LA really this big of a mess? This movie makes Capone's Chicago look like Bedford Falls. But don't believe it. Thanks to your friendly neighborhood Liberal Thought Police media correspondent, a big city cop can't so much as clean his gun without being brought up on misconduct or excessive force charges. So the idea of Los Angeles being a modern day Dodge City with the cops shooting and beating up the street scum is about as far from reality as a Bill Clinton testimony. This is one of those films that is at times so over the top brilliant, and at others so patheticaly stupid, that you wonder if it wasnt a splicing of efforts by 2 different directors. But its all one guys work, and sadly the stupidity leaves a stronger aftertaste than the quality. Whats good is the entire first hour and Denzel's and Hawke's work throughout. Whats bad is the typical, utterly unoriginal and predictable ending. How can one movie go from so fresh to so moldy stale within the short span of two movie hours?

Without saying anything more, I found the ending unsatisfactory.  Overall, I give this 6/10.  Pretty average.",Training Day
131,smakawhat,See it for Denzel,8,29 October 2001,"What can I say Denzel is the MAN.  He just steals the show.Training Day focuses on Ethan Hawke's character (Jake Hoyt), a young LAPD cop.  He is on his first day to start off in a new position to work in the narcotics division.  Jake is eager, he tells his wife how excited and nervous he is for this assignment comparing it to first day of high school football tryouts.  Jake plays by the book, is intelligent and strong, but his world is about to be turned upside down by a hardcore veteran named Alonzo Harris played by Denzel Washington.Alonzo takes Jake on a ride of insanity through the drug plagued worlds of Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in gritty Los Angeles.  Alonzo is hard, he is succesful and good at what he does, but he does things differently. Alonzo is essentialy a cop who makes his own rules, and this of course creates a conflict for Jake.  After a few minor routine assignments it's easy to see that Alonzo is dirty.  In short Alonzo's attitude to fighting crime is simple, to beat the street you have to be harder than the thugs and pushers who inhabit it.  But Alonzo has been doing this far too long and is in a lot of trouble.This movie COULD have been a bad exercise in good cop bad cop shlock.  But what evolves is a very well acted character study of 2 men with different views on how crime should be fought (in fact 2 polar extremes).  Denzel is masterful as Alonzo playing one of the most feared dirty cops I have ever seen on film, and Hawke as Jake does what he does well in most films, playing tormented characters caught in a bad situation and looking very shocked and perplexed.  There are great scenes of dialogue between the 2 such as when Alonzo asks why Jake wanted to join the squad.  Jake replies that he wants to get drugs off the streets and give something back to the community, and Alonzo only replies what is the real reason you joined narcotics?  Jake then says, ""Cause I want to make detective"".  It is this line that is the basis of Training Day.With that, director Antoine Fuqua's work of pictured gang plagued LA is masterful.  Black distraught neighborhoods, Hispanic tatooed thugs sitting around a card table,  Fuqua creates hell and shows it brilliantly.  There is some good cinematography and a good score (but used too infrequently) creating a nightmarish uneasyness.  It's also wonderful to see Denzel play a bad guy for a change and play it sooooo well.  When Alonzo is interogating suspects you can't help but squirm in your seat while you watch him on screen.The film tries to tie in a plot, so that it can create a conclusion in the end.  It isn't that distracting or even neccesary but it only shows the inevitable of Alonzo's work.  The film ends unresolved and this is good, because the film isn't about the good guy winning and the bad guy getting his just desserts, it's about how 2 men of different moral belief try to survive and do what is right.  There are no heroes in this film, just great characters.While the use of placing 2 well known rap starts in cameo rolls, 1 Snoop Doggy as a wheelchair pushing crack dealer [good acting], 2 Dr Dre. as a cop henchman for Alonzo [bad acting], was really unnecesary.  While Snoop holds his own in the spotlight Dre's acting is just so canned.  Minor points, but I'd EASILY recommend this for Denzel's performance alone.Rating 8 out of 10.",Training Day
132,bix171,Earnest And Misguided,5,28 April 2002,"Denzel Washington plays against type effectively--he's evil--but in the end this is just another in Warner Brothers' long-standing tradition of earnest socially conscious dramas; the problem is that rather than addressing social ills, it just ends up patronizing its target audience, namely urban minority moviegoers, by delivering the notion, through a series of absurd coincidences, that street justice is more effective than law enforcement. Washington is relaxed and entertaining as a corrupt undercover cop who shows his new partner (Ethan Hawke, way out of his league) the ropes in south central L.A. but he plays into the conceits set up by screenwriter David Ayer (he wrote the slick `The Fast And The Furious') and in the end Washington's in cahoots with the film's stodgy finger-wagging, becoming little more than a stick figure. The director is the talented Antoine Fuqua (`The Replacement Killers') but this time he's reined in his talent for flashy color-driven visuals for the usual cloudy, bleached-out images we've come to expect when the subject is down-and-dirty L.A. Special note should be made of the cameo of singer/songwriter Macy Gray: she makes the most of her brief appearance, using unsteady hand movements and a fair amount of sass to create a vivid portrayal of a woman who knows she's being used by the police and who has no compunction about letting her feelings show--she has the best moment in the film and you end up wanting more.",Training Day

It was nicely photographed and paced well.  The ending was somewhat of a sell out and not too plausible.  Guns, as in most Hollywood productions, were the center piece of the movie.  No wonder we live in violent times.  We worship them in movies such as this.  I rate the movie highly for its fast pace and good acting but discount that rating because of the gun worship and faulty ending.",Training Day

135,ExpendableMan,"Fantastic, Denzel Washington's finest hour",9,15 May 2006,"Before seeing this movie, my impression of Denzil Washington as an actor wasn't especially high. Not to say that he isn't talented, just that ever since Crimson Tide he appeared to be slotted neatly into every stern hero in every serious political thriller to be trotted off the studio assembly line for years. But then came Training Day and his role as Alonzo Harris and all that changed. Shrugging off the overly serious good guy image once and for all, Washington here is a revelation; a barking, ranting maelstrom of police brutality who believes that maintaining order on the crime ridden streets of LA means being even more ruthless than the drug dealers he faces on a day to day basis. His performance elevates the film from standard thriller fare into an exemplary story that has quite rightly become one of my favourite films of all time.Set over the course of twenty four hours, the film whisks Ethan Hawke's naive young police officer onto an introductory day of Narcotics work under Alonzo's tutelage. As the hours go by, Hawke is subjected to more and more violence as the heat and paranoia of suburban Los Angeles combined with his loose cannon superior officer play a heavy toll on his nerves. Consequently, the film is very much a two man story with Hawke and Washington playing off against each other expertly as polar opposites. One young, inexperienced and a firm believer in the rule book, the other older, more cynical and twisted by all his years on the streets into a bull-headed monster.The story itself is fraught with tension. Alonzo forcing his young protégé to smoke PCP at gunpoint is just the start and from there on the pulse pounding never stops. The execution scene where Hawke realises just how far gone his partner is for example is one of nail-biting pressure and shortly after, his encounter with a trio of Mexican gang members is jaw dropping, working as the exact moment you realise how much hot water he has found himself in.The end result is nothing less than a brilliant thriller. Hawke and Washington make for a phenomenal double act and the pace only occasionally lets up to allow the characters time to breathe and establish the depth that makes you care for them more. Highly, highly recommended so long as you're prepared to be absolutely terrified of Denzel Washington for years to come.",Training Day

137,Pookyiscute,I loved it because I hated it,7,7 February 2006,"Let me try and explain my feelings about this film. First of all, Denzel Washington was excellent in this. He deserved the award for best actor, and rightly so, for his work in this film. I hated him in this movie because I hated his character. Which should tell you how good a job he did in the movie. When you hate someone's character in a movie, so much, that generally means we're talking Academy Award. However, I don't think I was meant to hate the movie, too.A new rookie on his first day of Narcatics, meets with his unit leader at ten a.m. Already nervous, about making the team, he has no idea just how nervous he'll be by the end of the day. After only spending two hours with his leader, Hawke starts to become aware of what kind of cop he's dealing with, but only by the end of the film, do we really see what we the audience are given to deal with as well.Ethan Hawke was great in this too, and in some ways I think that he's a better actor than Washington. But, to be fair, Denzel is the star of this movie, and you can't take your eyes off of him, because of his performance in it.Again, it's hard for me to even understand how I felt about the film. I liked it and I thought it was well-written, but it just seemed like such a dark film, and I almost wanted to turn it off sometimes, because it was so frustrating. But, I liked it well enough to give it a seven. So, there we are. Definitely not a film for anyone under seventeen, and not only is there some substance abuse, nudity, language, adult subject matter, and violence, but there is also some scenes that are very heavy to handle.Good performance though, and again...I loved it because I hated it.",Training Day
138,SafReviews,Decent,7,1 June 2020,"It wasn't the most exciting movie, but it was good enough to keep me interested. I thought the plot was decent, it was a bit hard to follow at times as I didn't understand some of the lingo, but I understood what was going on. I thought the action scenes were great, I wish it had more of those as it would've made the movie a bit more thrilling. To me, the movie felt like more of a drama than an thriller. It's not the best movie, but it's definitely a movie that I would rewatch.",Training Day
139,cinephile-27690,Training Day is the BOMB!,10,21 February 2019,"I watched Training Day last night and it rocked! This is easily, hands down, my favorite Denzel Washington movie!The plot is quite simple: Ethan Hawke plays a cop on his first day, who gets lessons from Denzel Washington, a professional cop veteran. Together, they stop criminals, but it may turn out that the biggest criminal of the day may be with them the whole time.The acting in this movie is great. Denzel won Best Actor for his performance-and it's well earned! If someone else won in his place-that would have been a crime against humanity! Well, maybe not, but it would still be cruel!Ethan Hawke was great too, and I have not seen much of his work. I will be keeping an eye on his work now! In fact, everyone was great in this movie!If you read my reviews, you know I am against movies with a ton of language(see my review of The Wolf of Wall Street for an example.)While the IMDB trivia page says that the F word is said 211 times, and that can't be too far off, I found the movie to be more concentrated on it's awesome story than dropping in the next curse word in, unlike the other movie I mentioned! Still, if coarse language overused bothers you, wait for this to air on TV.I have read reviews saying that the end was kind of predictable, and it personally shocked me at first, then it didn't so much. If you don't overthink the entire movie, the ending is still impressive. Personally, I found the ending to have the best twist ending ever in a movie-and yes, I've seen The Sixth Sense!Some also argue that this movie couldn't have ended in one day. I would have to disagree. If this day starts somewhere from 7 am- 9 am, I could totally buy that this event ends before midnight! Plus, it's a movie for heaven's sake!As I watched this movie, I kept thinking of Quentin Tarantino, not just because of how brutal the violence can get at times, and not just because of the coarse language, but simply how the movie is structured.For example, the opening scene in the diner could have been an alternative opening to Pulp Fiction. This scene also has some Tarantino-like humor. I actually had to check the case to make sure QT had no involvement in this movie! This is the Tarantino movie that he didn't make!If this is not enough to make you want to see this movie, I don't know what else could! If more movies were as well-constructed as this, I would have a lot more absolute favorite movies!Training Day is the bomb, and there are few movies that I could recommend more! I feel like this movie should get a couple more stars, it's that brilliant!i can't say enough great things about it, so I'm stopping here-but definitely give Training Day a watch!",Training Day

141,jeremy3,Entertaining Fiction,6,14 February 2007,"This movie is not Donnie Brasco. It is isn't based upon truth. It is more in the spirit of Bad Lieutenant. Denzel Washington plays a corrupt, insane cop. If you overlook the implausibility of this movie, it is still quite entertaining. The acting is great. Washington definitely captures a really insane character. Although his portrayal is fictitious, there is a grain of truth. It must be very difficult being a narc in 21st Century L.A. However, even as over-the-top as Washington's portrayal, you realize that a cop could be more dangerous than a criminal, if ""under the radar"". Ethan Hawke is also great as a very good cop, but a little naive. Hawke's character is manipulated and charmed into submission by the Washington's ""evil cop"". The ending of the movie was the best part. Despite having a certain fear of the evil cop's authority, in the end you find out that he was really despised. Hawke's good cop is actually saved in one scene by an earlier act of decency on his part. The evil cop eventually is destroyed and revealed as a power-hungry, sick individual that he truly is. In conclusion, don't expect believability. However, if you want to be entertained, this is a movie to see.",Training Day
142,tburke85,Training Day A Solid Action Crime Thriller,8,13 June 2009,"Training Day is a solid action crime thriller with exceptional performances by Ethan Hawke and especially Denzel Washington. Director Antoine Fuqua has done an admirable job of making this movie about a rookie cop who gets into a lot more than he bargained for while on a day with a senior rogue detective to prove he's got what it takes to be a narc. Denzel Washington is fantastic as twisted but charismatic Detective Alonzo Harris who takes a big departure from his good guy roles to play the villain in this one. Washington has show over and over again that he's a talented actor. Well he continues to prove just that in Traning Day and then some. Ethan Hawke is equally impressive as rookie cop Jake Hoyt who finds himself in one increasingly dangerous situation after another. Hawke holds his own against Washington on screen and he may not have the flashier role but he goes a very good job as the hero in this film. The rest of the supporting cast including Scott Glenn, Cliff Curtis, Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and a brief appearance by Tom Berenger are solid in their roles but none of them are given much to do and are merely given extended cameos. They still prove to be effective none the less in their brief screen time. The music seemed to sync very well with what was happening on the screen and the tone of the film. The brutal action violence is well executed but the showdown between Washington and Hawke near the end did get a bit unrealistic. It was still intense though and the two actors really got to show their off their acting chops in this movie. The vulgar language did get a bit much at times but the good more than outweighs the bad in this one. Despite some flaws Training Day is an entertaining action crime thriller with great performances from Hawke and especially Washington who make this movie definitely worth the time to watch.",Training Day

144,The_Core,Grabbed my attention & never let go...,9,27 March 2002,"This film really got to me like no movie has in a long time.  After about the first hour, I was on the edge of my seat and absolutely glued to the screen.  The ending was somewhat weak like has been commented here before, but I'm not sure I could have taken another moment of intensity... I was 'in' the picture and lost to the world like nothing in a very long time. You could have grabbed a sample of my blood and come up with nothing but pure adrenaline.Part of the reason might be a past history with a bit of street background in it (yes, I've met lowlifes although nothing as bad as portrayed here)... this brought up the atmosphere of some remembered horrors, and by the end of the film my heart was palpitating and I was physically choking.  I went into this film with no 'prior knowledge' whatsoever (as a rookie), and it might have been a near heart attack for this over-35 guy... next time I'll read up on the plot a bit first.For the average moviegoer, the realism may not jump out too much... if you've ever been on the streets sometime in recent memory (even briefly, and not necessarily in LA), this film is like spreading drugs out in front of a former junkie -- not pleasant, but try tearing your eyes away.  And Denzel... was truly a surprise.  I've never been too impressed by his somewhat wooden acting, but his 'moment' toward the end is up there with the best rant-fests I've seen from Al Pacino.  The 'best actor' Oscar was deserved, imho.9/10 (one point off for a weak ending).",Training Day

Set in the ganglands of LA over an intense 24 hour period, Training Day is a great look at corruption, deception and disloyalty in the LAPD.

148,shadowman123,Denzel - STILL my man !!,8,24 March 2008,"I could not have picked a better time to watch Training Day as I am going into a career of Law enforcement my-self. From the beginning I understood the situation which a new recruit faces from his superiors and what the pressures are of being a cop as it is. Ethan Hawke does a wonderful job of being a stranger and making us take the ride with him and when he meets Alonso Harris who is unforgettably played by Denzel 'American Gangster' Washington. Training Day is an account of life both for a cop working the rough streets of LA and also if you do your research you learn that it also involves real crips,bloods and various other gangs with their input which means that you get an authentic taste of what life is like for those living and growing up in one of these rough hoods. What makes Alonso Harris scar your mind is that he is not your average Dirty Harry wannabe but he is more like a resourceful , intelligent street wise cop with his Jekell/Hyde tendency's which makes him a joy to watch and no one could of carried this of in style like Denzel. The most shocking thing is that to all of them this was everyday life but unlike us who will be completely blown away by its power . My only problem with Training Day is that it just skips up a notch too fast and misses out some important factors but the stand out performance all the way through are what save this movie. To conclude Training Day is a movie that offers an experience which is hard to put into words , it offers an experience which has to viewed to be felt but all I can say is that this proof why Denzel Washington is one of the most talented black actors to have graced the silver screen , A MUST SEE !TRAINING DAY : 8.6 OUT OF 10THE ONLY MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE LINE BEING CROSSED, IS THE COP WHO WILL CROSS IT...",Training Day
149,harrylosborne,Denzel goes killing - an Ethan Hawke is there too,7,30 September 2020,"Let's be honest here, the star of the show is undoubtedly Denzel Washington, swaggering around LA at his imperious acting best. Given free rein (both to act and to police), Alonzo (Washington) is a swearing, day-drinking narcotics officer playing close to the edge of lawfulness, often opting to bend the rules in order to impose just punishments. His new protege, the stereotypically naive and one-dimensional Jake (Ethan Hawke) is necessary for the plot, but arguably offers little in acting.Taking place over Jake's first day under Alonzo's watch, Training Day tackles a cop's conflict with doing what is right. Alonzo spends most of his time brandishing weapons or using suspect techniques to gain information, whereas Jake is the puritan rookie, playing exclusively by the book. The deeper Jake follows Alonzo, the more he understands how Alonzo has lost his focus, his morals, and his entitlement to wear the badge.Training Day is fun, there is no question. Watching this gun-toting narco detective sleaze around LA is amusing, whilst also hitting hard when Denzel delivers his lines to a tee. Hawke does his best, but is forgettable really; a conduit for the story, his character is often grating and irritating, but does what is required.Training Day is not a new idea - we've seen rogue cops and LA gangs before - but it does nail the core principle: something that is fun to watch, without entering incredulity. A leading man like Denzel (giving one of his best performances) does this film only good, and is definitely one to watch if you aren't looking for a serious cinematic commitment. - HLO",Training Day
150,Aidan McGuinness,Highly enjoyable let down only by being a tad predictable,7,11 February 2002,"I'll start by saying I really enjoyed ""Training Day"". It was certainly one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in this first month-and-a-bit of the cinema year. I'm going to recommend it, with a little bit of caution, and here's why:Firstly big respect to Denzel Washington. Usually he's playing the underdog and we're rooting for him. He's constantly getting the nice guy role and so it's extremely refreshing to see him play the corrupt cop here. His character - Alonzo Harris - isn't necessarily evil, he's just deciding to do a delicate balance of crime and punishment. He takes freely from the scum he prosecutes and has no qualms about doing so. In playing this character Washington is allowed to show far more versatility than his works normally allow. He works well with his attitude to new rookie cop Jake Hoyt (played admirably by Ethan Hawke). Hawke wants to do well on his first day, his ""training day"" but can't stomach Harris' morale scruples. There is a great line of tension between the two that develops more as the movie progresses.It is the plot, if anything, that lets the movie sag a little. For the most part it's predictable and Ayer, at one very tense moment, uses a poorly scripted coincide to back himself out of a sudden ending. The actual end to the movie is also foreseen and, for that, is somewhat disappointing. It might have been nicer to go a different route but I guess some elements of formula must be adhered to. Having said that there's some great lines of dialogue as Harris convinces Hoyt that the way the world *really* works is not as simple as Hoyt would like to believe and that there is a certain ""survival of the fittest"" element you must follow. The cop's corruption - in particular the first middle-of-movie-3rd-act climax - is quite harrowing and sharply executed.Antoine Fuqua does a nice job of realizing the script he's working from. The fight scenes, for example, pack - pun intended - a lot of punch. You can feel the pain of the blows. The camera-work generally succeeds without having to be overly intrusive. The lighting is generally subdued even during high noon - adding to the movie's generally bleak outlook and feel and the score never over-plays any sentimental or aggressive moments.Overall I really quite enjoyed ""Training Day"" and found it a cut above the average buddy-cop flick. With some good performances, a (generally) sharp script and some fine directing I'd give it a 7.5/10 which is well above average for me.",Training Day

152,heisenberg12,"Excellent, Realistic and Disturbing Look at Corruption in a Powerhouse Performance by Washington",9,5 March 2020,"Revisiting Training Day the other day after about fifteen years actually raised my score of it from an 8 to a 9. At the time, back in 2001, when it was released it was following behind a golden streak of movie years dating back to the mid-90s, so maybe it wasn't as appreciated as it should have been since the standards were so high; it was still very good, but something left a little to be desired. This sentiment held true on the rewatch, but only as to the very end of the movie, which in my opinion was still disappointing.Having Alonzo go out like Scarface was a let down and still is. It feels like an easy way out and a lazy way to end the story; it may have been chosen to add to the realism of the movie, but the film was dark enough throughout and didn't need a pitch black depressing ending. They should have at least had Alonzo fire back in a shootout to take out some of the bad guys after him, but the writers didn't allow him to even get one shot off- kind of anticlimactic if you ask me.However, this is really my only complaint with Training Day. In a surprisingly completely original story, Denzel Washington takes Ethan Hawke's rookie NARC agent through the streets of L.A., teaching him that what he learned in the Academy means zilch in reality once he is in the street game.Washington's Alonzo rarely evokes sympathy and even when you think he may, you have to question if ALonzo is just playing the game since he is so deceitful and can fake his emotions so well. However, there is one scene where it looks like Alonzo does let his guard down, and it is in that brief moment that you see that the real Alonzo is a broken man who has been hardened and corrupted by the true realities of the job through the years, which has taken its toll on him, giving him no choice but to play the game.But make no mistake, Alonzo is a bad guy. When the plot unfolds and his reasoning and tactics are revealed, you see that he is a scheming criminal, who is ruthless and will do anything to save himself, even if it means gaming and playing a rookie partner as a pawn in his game of survival.There is lots of truth and revelations as to the nature of cop corruption in this movie that I had never seen this realistic before. The way Alonzo can get dirt on everyone, but only use it if he needs to is very shocking and eye opening. He uses it to keep everyone on the street (and in his department sect) in line, but if they step out of line and get him in trouble, then he will just go write them up for a past violation and charge them. Knowing this, he purposefully tempts those around him to commit crimes (sometimes deceptively) so that he immediately has dirt on them (exampled in telling Hawke to take the dirty money and smoke the marijuana, which Hawke later learns from Alonzo himself is actually a much harder drug in dust- this btw was one of the most disturbing scenes watching Hawke's character get corrupted so early on by this lie).Alonzo has his ""dogs"" or ""boys"" all over the slums of L.A., which are for the most part his informants who he has been protecting from throughout his time working the streets. But you watch as he will play them as an Ace card in the hole if he needs to in order to escape justice himself, and simultaneously he explains why these high rollers can never face the court since they have too much dirt on everyone else as well and it would be hard to get a conviction after years of them serving as informants.In summary, the movie depicts an inevitable corruption that evolves in some police departments, as Alonzo has become corrupted and disillusioned by the realities of the game, which can only be learned through experience. The dangers and temptations, as well as him facing himself in the mirror have taken their toll on his soul, leaving him with no choice but to check his heart at the door in order to survive both the street itself and his own criminality. Alonzo is ruthless and willingly wears two faces throughout the job, always playing chess, but for all of his street smarts, you can't help but despise his bad behaviors and corrupt acts.This is a great movie that is riveting, creates constant tension, and teaches what can go wrong in police departments, especially those that have to deal with the dregs of society and the drug game. Hopefully Hawke's character went on to just write parking tickets like he implied after getting a taste of the realities of the job that no good soul would ever want to be a part of.9/10",Training Day

The Call, from the department head, Alonzo Harris, congratulating him on his promotion, sort of. Denzel Washington, takes on a character, like none other that he has had so far. Sounds like a big business wall street type scenario aye? Not even close, down of skid-row street maybe. This is a story set in Los Angeles, that even when it's daylight, this is the darkest 'beat' in the whole department's city.From the moment that the meet was set at the coffee shop, something is just, slightly skewed. There seems an absence of real concern for Jake's situation and a lot more mechanical rogue cop, trainer 'Doggin' going on here. Alonso wants to catch him up on what's going on, of course, see what he is made of, but Alonzo is dangerous, because he doesn't care, anymore. His soul has departed, and it's simply a matter of time before, he is too. As they departed from the coffee shop, by way of a black Monte Carlo. The director, Antoine Fuqua wanted to show a more real and brutal side of the crime busting business. The place where lines are so blurred...if they even exist anymore.

Scary in some ways, it appeared as if there was no acting, just this over the edge ' Narc ' who you just gotta watch like a hawk! Ethan, was the ' newbie ' but a very likable, ""Just wanting to do the right thing"" type of guy. Some what confused at times about the way in which Harris attended to his profession. Curious about why he would do what he would do. Alonzo, always explaining away the point to a nervous rookie, who in the back of his mind just knew, that there is something here, that won't let him rest until he does the right thing. It almost costs him his life, in the end, Hoyt is a master in his career field...a true Wolf, amongst the dogs. It seemed as though, Hoyt had an awakening. He had to go down into that alley-way because his 'gut' wouldn't let it alone. And in the end, this is what saved his very existence, now that is reasoning with razor sharpness. Plus he needed to get home to that hot wife of his....Recommended, but not for those with weaker film story constitutions. (*****)",Training Day

Noted for the good guy roles, he now has THE chance to shine as the bad guy!The director's opening of Ethan Hawke in the family setting instills in the viewer that he's a cop who wants to make things right, ultimately, to keep his family safe.  It's not a bad premise, really, since we all want that kind of security for our loved ones.His first day in the ""narc"" division is, shall we say, an eye opener. Washington's character stays focused throughout the whole film and that's what kept me on the edge of my seat.  I kept finding myself hoping that he was a good guy after all.  ""Say it isn't so, Denzel!""The raid is where things screwed up.  I really can't believe that all of the ""bad cops"" were willing to let Hawke walk out of there.  Washington was the ring leader, but I don't think any man has that kind of control over everyone like that.  True, I'm not from the streets, but this ain't the nineties, anymore.  You can't control how I feel!  Denzel being the boss, or not, if someone with Hawke's character were in the position to put me away for a very long time, I would make very sure that he was on my side.  The director lost me, there.But I do see a lot of realistic values in the film.  It was very well shot and I believe Washington finally had the chance to shine in this one!  I'm just sad to see it took a role like this to get all the critic's attention. Keep up the good work, Denzel, I'm pullin' for ya'!",Training Day
158,Tiger_Mark,Both Good and Bad,1,4 March 2003,"This film is kind of like the two officers that are the main characters, good and bad. There are scenes that are really good and creative. In particular, the ""card game"" scene towards the end, very  intense. However, there are way too many MTV Music Video scenes as well. No characters other than the main two have any depth whatsoever. You see talented actors like Scott Glenn trying to bring something extra to their scenes, but there is nothing written for them. Moreover, some scenes are just plain silly and you want to groan. Acting tends to be the over the top. However, in my opinion, it is the work of Ethan Hawke that really saves this film over all. Hawke portrays a character that I think most people can relate to, he does what we would probably do if in his situation. Overall, I would give this movie a B-, because it showed potential, but had too many mistakes.",Training Day

When watching this movie it was interesting to see Denzel be the corrupted cop attempting to corrupt the other cop and partner. Ethan Hawke also did an amazing job just learning what it's like to be in the hood and adapting to gangster culture. We also can see Denzel's character clearly was a man that lost his mind. It was interesting to see Snoop Dogg and Eva Mendez in this movie as well for a moment. I did not like the fact that the bad cop was the black guy, but realistically speaking I guess even the black cops are corrupted. It was interesting to see Jay the whole time be the good cop actually fighting for justice and you see how all corrupted people give you no choice but to be corrupted as well. Also, Denzel's character was very good in using lies and reverse psychology to control Jay's integrity. I loved seeing Jay gain not only his integrity back but he also kept his courage with him. I loved Lonzo's final speech and yelling with King Kong ain't got nothing on me. It was so enjoyable to watch the movie.",Training Day

What can I add to what appears at a glance to be 100% glowing favorable comments? Simply, Denzel turns in a unique and brilliant performance, this time as a demonically bad guy.And that is sure not the usual soft spoken, good hearted, empathic casting he so often appears in. His superficially schizoid behavior here is all under his complete control. All thought out and manipulative and lethal, nothing accidental. His only problem is his delusional perception of his own omnipotence, and misperception of how people he perceives as his obedient followers really feel about him. His denial of the ""Big Picture"" is his Achilles heel.Stronger by far then either version of Bad Lieutenant or Gang Related , or too many other Bad cop movies to list, This is just a great movie.",Training Day

2) There are definitely some moments of prolonged tension
3) Denzel's erratic character does a good job of keeping you on edge; although it was a bit too reminiscent of Joe Pesci in Goodfellas for me
4) It is rare for a film in this genre to feature so much character moments and dialogue rather than just being mindless action; the film should be commended for thatNEGATIVES:1) The film is so unrealistic and the two leads are so outlandish that at no point do they actually feel like cops; they're more like mob enforcers
2) It completely took me out of the film that Still D.R.E. plays in the film and then Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg actually appear
3) It rubs me up the wrong way that the Oscars deemed Denzel to be the lead actor and Hawke to be the supporting actor
4) It is definitely too long and there are multiple scenes that could be taken out and wouldn't change the story one bit
5) I know you could argue that this is deliberate, but I just hated Denzel's character so much and I found his actions absurd at times",Training Day

What starts as your everyday police drama with the trained cop (Washington) showing the new rookie (Hawke) some bad ass moves, fastly turns into a nightmarish all-night experience as we learn more and more about the true nature of Washington's character. Hawke triumphs as the accidental hero of the movie, who is thrust into talking his way out of near-death situations and learns how to survive the crooked streets fast. The final 15 minutes of the movie are some of the more intense and violent cinematic experience I sat through in recent years.

Antoine Fuqua's undisputed masterpiece!",Training Day
165,noizyme,Moody cop drama more about streets than drama.,7,30 January 2005,"Wow. That was the feeling at the end of watching this film. I was greatly pleased after seeing it. It was a very easy movie to watch; the dialog went smooth and fast, the clips of gangsta rap and mood of the music was spot-on, and the acting was as bombastic as the characters were written. Also the directing by Antoine Fuqua (Replacement Killers, Tears of the sun...after Training Day) couldn't have been more brilliant and full of visual changes for the audience.Basically, Ethan Hawke plays a new NARC on the beat. He doesn't know what to expect out of Denzel Washington's character except that he is his trainer and an experienced detective. Denzel meticulously plans his real-life curriculum for Hawke to learn, and since Denzel's character is known in the surrounding neighborhoods as a detective who cuts deals with potential rapists, murderers, and drug dealers, he pushes buttons all throughout the neighborhood, brandishing Hawke as his protegé. When Hawke continues to see shady deal after shady deal, he begins to suspect that Washington is up to something but cannot place what it is. It comes down to the end when Hawke must choose what he was taught in the ethics training of the other policemen or what Denzel's character allows him to get away with on the street.There is not enough praise to give the actors and actresses, including Eva Mendes as Washington's girlfriend stuck in the ghetto with her son. I'm not particularly fond of Ethan Hawke in the action roles (to me, he looks kind of fake and unbelievable), but in this movie, there seems to be plenty going on to forget this small mirage. And Denzel was spectacular; he had this character down pact. He loves playing the same types of roles, but this one was almost written for him because of the delivery and positioning that he displays every time the camera is on him.The Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre appearances didn't need to be there, but there's no doubt about the power of being the director's friends. Snoop was better than Dre, I think, mainly because he was given more of a character to portray (while placed in a wheelchair of all things for the most notable cool-cat in rapping business). But other than their puzzling cameos, the movie does great to entertain and keep you guessing every bit of the way.I gave it a 7/10 because it doesn't have the look about a classic film and to constantly watch it, it would get tedious, but the feel and look of the whole thing keeps you entertained for a few watches. It's worth the buy, but rent it first to get a deeper story to see if it's your type of action/cop drama movie.",Training Day

But it is a film that doesn't hold anything back and forces the viewer to take it as it is. There are no clichés, nothing feels sappy, and it is a hard experience for the viewer at times to see the reality of the streets of L.A. and its corruption depicted in this movie.Powered by an amazing performance from Denzel Washington, the man's performance was 100% Oscar-worthy. It is one of those few performances that it doesn't feel like the man's acting, it just seems natural and you think that he IS the character. Ethan Hawke is not bad at all in the film, he's actually pretty good but he lives in the shadow of Denzel's performance in this movie.A lot of people complain about the ending, for some reason.

167,sam_smithreview,Denzel's brilliant acting on display,8,2 May 2016,"In his Academy Award Winning Performance,as best Actor.The movie, as the title suggests, follows a single day in the life of rookie cop Jake Hoyt (Hawk) as he is subject to a single day of evaluation by a senior, decorated police narcotics officer Alonzo Harris (Washington) to see if he has what it takes to be a 'narc'. Almost immediately Hoyt is placed on the back foot, constantly caught off guard by Alonzo's nature, his ability to switch between a cold, no- nonsense street-wise player, a genuinely caring and good intentioned leader, and occasionally jovial companion. From their first encounters though, where Hoyt tells Harris he will do ""anything you want me to do"", the situations Hoyt is taken into become more and more morally ambiguous, from the simple use of excessive force to outright illegal activity, forcing Hoyt to decide which side Harris is truly on, whether to trust him, or whether Hoyt is the unwitting centerpiece of a huge and complex web of lies and set- ups in order for Harris to for fill his own sinister motives. This is a must watch! The one thing that made this film really shine was the performance by Mr. Washington. To me, a good actor is someone who just IS a character...if it isn't obvious that they are acting than they are doing a good job. That was the case with Washington. He just was Alonzo. Every pantomime, every word, every glance was performed masterfully. Did Mr. Washington deserve his Oscar? Absolutely. 200%.

Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke play well off each other and you end up liking each character. The supporting cast does well but it's Washington and Hawke that you are watching. Scott Glenn is good as a drug dealer that's a friend of Washington. The film takes place over the course of one day and what a day that is. From shooting it out with gang members to finding out just how dirty a cop Denzel is, Ethan Hawke finds that his first day on Denzel's beat is a very dangerous one.Bottom Line: I highly recommend this movie.

Denzel Washington is superb, mean looks, nasty bad reactions seeming so natural, I cannot believe he isn't a real filthy cop!

Alonzo Harris (Washington) is a murderous, delusional, manipulative sociopath but we almost like him despite ourselves.  Ethan Hawke gives the best performance of his career as the idealistic but thrill seeking, Jake Hoyt who, to his ultimate sorrow, is assigned as Harris's partner on the LAPD narcotics detail.  Some have complained that the final scenes of the film are preposterous.  While this may be so, these scenes are effective and tell an exciting and engaging story.

175,shaun98,Denzel's great!,7,26 April 2002,"[possible spoiler]
If you ever ask yourself if one performance can make a film, all you need to do is take a look at ""Training Day."" Denzel Washington delivers one of his very best acting jobs ever, as what must be the most corrupt law enforcement officer portrayed by a leading actor. The character is not unlike Robert DeNiro's Travis Bickle; at first he walks a *very* narrow line between sanity and madness, and to his credit he does a fairly good job (up to a point) in barely keeping himself on the right side. We may not like him, or approve of his actions, but we accept him as he is, as well as the fact that he has reasons for what he does that seem perfectly logical and sensible to him.Some critics have been hard on Ethan Hawke, probably because Washington outshines him. That's missing the point. The Hawke character's purpose in the film is to provide a foil, a contrast to his partner's insanity. They are complete opposites, and it's interesting to notice that while Hawke is more idealistic and ""upright,"" he's also a bit naive, and tends to see things in black and white. Washington, on the other hand, perceives the world in shades of gray. While that's probably the more accurate and balanced outlook, he simply goes too far, and pays the price.Is the ending a bit overdone? Yes, it is, but no one will deny it's effective. It was inevitable that his actions would backfire on him. As the film proceeds, he descends further and further into his self-created morass. There is a point in the film where it is immediately apparent that he has finally reached critical mass, and there's no turning back. I was reminded of the Biblical proverb, ""He who lives by the sword dies by the sword."" The wisdom of that statement is all too apparent when applied to the character.*** (out of ****)Released by Warner Bros.",Training Day

This movie hasn't got any depth beyond the plot, this is not Fight Club or Sixth Sense, where watching the film second time around, reveals some details you didn't see before. Here the second watch didn't add anything new to me (except of finding new holes in the plot), but I still liked it and haven't got any disgusting feelings about it as others did. I wasn't bored either.First of all I liked the plot.I liked the idea of the whole movie taking place in one day. And most of all I liked the acting of the leading roles. Specially of Denzel Washington (and I really don't care about the award). I really don't understand most of the complaints people have about this movie. It's not perfect and there are some plot holes ( which most of the complaints don't even touch), but even though it's entertaining. And definitely not the worst movie like some say. Of course there were movies about ""bad cop - good cop"" , but not in this scheme. I think it had even some originality in it. And if you don't like Violence in movies - don't see it. But don't say you hate this movie because of the violence. Training Day's genre is violence. Finally to the character of Alonzo. I honestly think that Russel Crow should have the Oscar. He had a much deeper character to portray (in Beautiful mind), and did an excellent job with it. Nevertheless, the character of Alonzo was about one of the worst kind of people that there are on earth ( and if you see some documentary investigation, you understand that such people exist). Don't complain that you didn't like the character, I hated him either, that's why I think Denzel Washington made a great effort. Some credit to Ethan Hawke also.Some holes in the plot: 1) I think the most visible one, and the most annoying is the one-to-million coincidence of Lisa being the cousin of Smiley. What chances that Lisa's wallet would save Hoyt? 2) Hoyt isn't used to narcotics and we see it on the effect the drugs have on him. But so strong of an effect should have take longer in time to recover from it. 3) After Smiley releases Jake he immediately goes to Alonzo's house. How did he remember where Alonzo lives? He couldn't remember it from one ride being on narcotics. 4) At the end of the movie Hoyt got serious beating from Alonzo. He was face smashed through the window, got hit with a chair, kicked and punched and after all that he managed to stand back and ready to fight again in a couple of minutes.As I said.

I've been impressed with his work for many years. Arguably, with some exceptions, his presence in a bad movie, can raise the rating of a movie a few notches. I don't believe ""Training Day"" was a great crime drama. There were some glaring plot contrivances and a number of underwritten supporting characters made me wonder if David Ayer's screenplay wasn't thought out in its entirety. Despite those flaws, there was a lot to admire in the movie: Denzel's outstanding, charismatic performance as the rogue L.A. detective, Ethan Hawke's fine supporting role as the young protégé caught in a very dangerous corruption web and Antoine Fuqua's stylish direction of the most important characters: the neighborhoods of Los Angeles. Did Denzel Washington deserve the Oscar for this performance? I still say no. I preferred his performances in ""Malcolm X"" and ""The Hurricane"".

He begins the film as a good guy, showing Jake the ropes. He quickly becomes questionable with his techniques that just don't feel right. As the film goes on it is clear that Alonzo is very, very crooked and needs to be put in his place. There is a very memorable line from Alonzo during his drastic downfall, which is, ""King Kong ain't got s**t on me!"" The way that Washington delivers that line during Alonzo's monologue is magnificent. Beyond the fantastic villain character, ""Training Day"" has a great script. Yes, it is unlikely that all of this would take place in just one day if this was real life, but I firmly believe that that notion of reality can be stretched at times in cinema. There is little to be said on the plot, but it is just very well written and executed. Jake's good natured personality is a good opposition towards Alonzo, but his character is left in the darkness next to the brilliance that is Alonzo.I highly recommend this film.

I said reasons, therefore, I would like to mention that it also feels realistic because of Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington ' s genuinely outstanding, mind-blowing performances.Hawke plays a rookie cop who is being ""trained"" by a senior cop that Washington enacts. As the movie progresses, viewers will realize that this is definitely no ordinary training day in the life of a rookie cop ; there is definitely a mystery behind the action and procedures that Washington is instructing Hawke to do. The movie is full of surprises and excitement, suspense and mystery, and ""garnished"" with good action sequences.

183,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,7,15 August 2013,"Denzel Washington won an Oscar for best actor in 2002 for the movie Training Day. Considering the other nominees and Washington's performance, I wouldn't say he deserved it – he wasn't bad, but didn't make an impression either. He based his character on Rafael Perez, a former police officer involved in the LAPD Rampart scandal who covered up robberies and murders.Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) has always wanted to be a police officer so he could rid the society of drugs and dealers. On his first day on the job, however, a much more experienced policeman, detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington), takes him around town in his car and shows him that being a police officer is nothing like he imagined.I didn't like this movie, even though it's very good. I found the story to be original, even though it follows the classic good cop vs. bad cop scheme and you can see it from the start: detective Alonzo is irritating, violent, full of himself but he's also experienced; Jake Hoyt, on the other hand, is a family man, an idealist and, maybe one could even say, a fool – but we like him, feel for him and wish his vision of society was the true one. Hawke and Washington both deliver good performances, which makes this movie good since it mostly focuses on their interactions and overall relationship that develops in one day.Training Day is very violent, therefore it would be difficult for me to watch it multiple times. Another problem with the movie is that it becomes boring from time to time – there are some parts you simply must sit through to get to the good parts. On the other hand, some of the twists were truly intelligent and unexpected. The cinematography and the soundtrack are good too. But the ending seems abrupt, and certain characters should have been more developed, or at least given more screen time – especially those Alonzo calls ""the three wise men"". All in all, Training Day is a good movie, and you're guaranteed to like it if you fancy violence and action.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",Training Day

185,lingmeister,A sinister look at the look of dirty world of undercover police - contains spoilers,7,18 December 2002,"This movie is about a naïve cop Jake, played by Ethan Hawke, on his first day as a narcotic officer, being trained by the dirty corrupt guy who runs it, Alonzo, played by Denzel Washington.  His character is so evil, sinister, and every other bad characteristic that you could think of, he has it, including openly flaunting his infidelity.  It is to the point where if you want anything bad to happen to anyone on the film, it would be him instead of the guys committing the crimes.  But at the same time, he actually thinks he is doing the right thing, believing that he is some sort of demagogue.  Denzel is very good in portraying all that in this character, that is, everything except for any redeeming characteristics. Some other parts are a little more unbelievable, like Alonzo letting Jake in on his secret dirty dealing, not even knowing if Jake will be openly receptive to the assassination and looting of drug money that he and his gang regularly enrich themself with, then putting Jake on the quandary of coming on board or snitch and be blamed for the whole thing.  I would assume if they want to introduce someone into their inner circle, they should either be receptive or do not object to such dealings.  The other cops on Alonzo's team seem to be characters straight out of some illicit gang, with more criminal than law enforcement attitude and personality.  Others issues includes the cardboard cutout characters of the dirty politician and DA. They are like a pack of crooks who has nothing in common except for their corrupt dealings.  Looking at the deleted scenes on the DVD, it was good of them to delete the last scene where they collectively go to Jake's residence for the loot that he took from Alonzo.  The ending is also over the top, with the faceoff between the two cops in the street, with Alonzo's street homies not coming to his aid, instead letting them two take it out mano-a-mano, including sliding a gun to him when he didn't have one. I guess at the end, Alonzo knew it its over for him, having messed around with some people even above this demagogue's head.  So instead of running, he is accepting fate. Despite the movie's flaws, it is still a gritty hard look at the dirty side of undercover police world.",Training Day

Denzel Washington's performance as a tough cop Alonzo is terrific. For me there are just 2 movies ""pulp fiction"" and ""training day"" that have made me feel an exciting fast ride sensation since the first minute until the end.The plot is about the first day of work of a rookie policeman called Jake (Ethan Hawke)who have to learn about the job from a tough street wise cop named Alonzo. During the day Jake is surprised how Alonzo handles different police's situations in a not by the book way, but Alonzo tells him this is how things are done in the field because you have to be a wolf in order to protect the sheep. Will Jake agree with Alonzo's methods to do the job?..... I think a 7.5 is the correct grade for ""training day"" for its worth as a movie, but i give it a 10 because of the emotion that made me feel despite its common Hollywood's final.

So let's start.This is the best movie I've ever seen and I'm not kidding. Acting is, well it's top notch. Both Denzel and Ethan gave 2 of the best actings I've ever seen. They literally killed their role. The script can't get better.Alonzo as a character has hands down the best one-lines ever. He is one of the best characters ever and a top 3 villain ever. Jake became one of my favorite characters and his actions are some of the best I've ever seen. Everyone from the cast does a brilliant job.The plot is fking magnificent. The best one I've ever seen. It was nice seeing Snoop dogg having a cameo there. This is the most realistic movie ever. Street gangs, the good cop, the bad cop, good, bad people, crime, drugs etc.This film will keep you on the edge of your seat for 2 hours and it will make you think about it for a really, really long time. Each scene is memorable and this movie has some of the best moments on the history of cinema.Denzel and Ethan give the performances of a lifetime. The thriller in this movie is unbelievable. The tone is perfect. Action scenes are magnificent.This movie is for everyone who misses the 90s and early 2000s.So yeah this my new favorite movie of all time and i don't think i will ever change my mind.
This is the kind of a movie that i was looking for, and it had even more than i wanted.Don't miss this movie, it's perfect in every single way. Watch it, trust me you won't regret it.Seen 31st August. Finished it 1st September at 1 am.",Training Day

I like movies that shove it in your face and make you deal with it...movies like, ""Black Hawk Down""...no clichés, no touching moments, just brutal, bitter realism. ""Training Day"" was such a movie. However, the one thing that made this film really shine was the performance by Mr. Washington. To me, a good actor is someone who just IS a character...if it isn't obvious that they are acting than they are doing a good job. That was the case with Washingon. He just was Alonzo. Every pantomime, every word, every glance was performed masterfully. Did Mr. Washington deserve his Oscar? Absolutely. 200%.

Interesting to see how people, who we initially take for 'bad' guys care more about honor and duty than persons who's 'job' it is to protect these valuesEva Mendes also has a small role too, that for me is hilarious, but i guess this was just a step forward for her towards 'star'-status later in her career9/10 for story, acting and productionpeace",Training Day
193,TheCasualReviewer,"""King Kong ain't got s*** on me!""",9,17 November 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Jake (Ethan Hawks) spends his first day with Alonzo (Denzel Washington) as a narcotics officer finding out that it might not be as clean of a job that he was hoping for.REVIEW:
This film is completely driven by Denzel. Not to say Ethan Hawke or any of the other cast aren't great, but the life Denzel gives to Alonzo is on another planet. The charisma and aura he builds around his character makes him take control of every scene that he's in. Then you have Ethan Hawke who does really well as his straight partner. Someone who Alonzo can manipulate in the beginning because of being the newby, but not incompetent where he doesn't quickly catch on to what's really happening. David Ayer is really good at creating your average day characters and creating a solid, realistic script with them. He did the same in ""End of Watch"" and in ""Fury."" I would say that Alonzo it the outlier, but I believe that Denzel is what made that character who he is. Then you have Antoine Fuqua (Director) creating these very tense scenes between characters, like the kitchen scene with Jake and Smiley (Cliff Curtis). Scenes like this really bring the film above and beyond.If you're looking for a crime drama that has fantastic acting and some very tense moments, this is the one. 9.1/10.",Training Day
194,darkjosh,Searing Work From Washington and Fuqua,8,17 October 2001,"Audiences looking for a big, mindless, action-driven cop flick in Training Day will be surprised by two things: director Antoine Fuqua, who made the dismally mediocre Jaime Foxx vehicle, ""Bait"", has molded an adult, tense, mature, and engrossing action-drama, and two, Denzel Washington has eschewed his good guy persona, playing a charismatic but unlikable rogue cop.While the story of corrupt cops lurking in the police department may be done to death, a certain timeliness is present with such stories as the recent LAPD Rampart scandal.  Ethan Hawke plays a rookie-cop who hopes to work his way up the rungs of the LAPD to detective by working with seasoned undercover narcotics cop Washington.  Washington proves, however, to have questionable methods of investigation and procedure.  Hawke unwittingly is drawn into the sickly logical and charasmatic musings of Washington until he ends up unwittingly becoming a participant in a coverup.Again, the story has been done before, but rarely has it been tackled with such a tense, uneasy, and guttural realism.  Director Antoine Fuqua injects the film with a searing authenticity: LA hasn't been such an uninviting. dangerous, ugly urban jungle in a while, with bleak, rainy shots of the city swimming in dirt, litter, and graffiti. The use of realistic looking and acting gang members, and also the cameo appearances of rap stars helps keep tensions high as well, and also adds striking resonance.
Anchoring the whole movie is Denzel Washington, in a refreshing change from his usual upstanding, righteous roles.  As the corrupt cop, he gleefully goes for broke in a manic, antihero, larger-than-life performance so unlike his previous work that it will surely garner him an Oscar nomination.
While the last 15 minutes almost undo the fantastic work by the cast and crew, Training Day is an accomplished renewal in the cop movie genre, a promising feature in Fuqua's career, and another great performance under Denzel Washington's belt.8 out of 10",Training Day

Very good minor roles by Glenn and Berenger help this along. Good action and acting.Washington deservedly won the Academy Award for this but Hawke almost steals the show.",Training Day
197,nqure,Trite ending mars a film with an interesting theme,6,3 February 2002,"Films about police corruption are commonplace, but it's interesting to watch a film where the police become corrupted as a result of fighting an unwinnable war on the streets (a war that is unwinnable as seen in 'Traffic'), resorting to crooked methods/heavy handed tactics in their war against drugs. I enjoyed the interplay between Alonzo (Washington) and Hoyt (Hawke), their obvious clash of ideals/brutal cynicism and the early scenes are probably the strongest in the film. Hoyt's druggy trip almost reflects the murky, blurred world that he now finds himself inhabiting. The film has two main plotlines (police corruption, & the Russian mafia seeking vengeance) which eventually come together but I feel this is where the film  loses its hold on reality and descends into farce and implausibilty. If only the film perhaps had concentrated on the theme of police corruption, the possible consequences etc. The scenes & dialogue where Alonzo & Hoyt argue their feelings (wolves & sheep) are excellent. On the one hand, we can sympathise somewhat with Alonzo - the ugly war against drugs is stacked in favour of the criminals - yet most of us would probably identify with Hoyt's opinion. It's a morally grey area which should have been examined more.Because the film sadly descends into a simplistic confrontation between good & evil. It is very easy to criticise but I'd preferred a story that made Alonzo examine himself & question what he has become. Instead he becomes a pantomine villain - boo, hiss, he's behind you!The performances were good esp in the beginning where the actors were given the opportunity 'to act' rather than wrestle with each other. Washington is charismatic - I loved his opening gambit where,impatient with Hoyt's talking as he reads his paper, he orders him to 'entertain' him. Some critics have accused Washington of 'hamming' in this role, but I thought he was good as the police officer corrupted by his sense of power. His role, away from his usual type cast, is reminiscent of Richard Gere's impressive turn as a corrupt policeman in 'Internal Affairs' - a film which is much more psychological and the better for it.An interesting premise, but the final twenty minutes disappoint and let's the whole film down.",Training Day

199,hughman55,Denzel Washington got an Oscar for this? Not so much...,3,1 April 2010,"This movie is about the worst first day at work ever. Must have been a bad year for Best Actor for DW to get Best Actor by giving a ""Jack Nicholsonesque"" over the top performance as a crooked narco cop who trains his new partner, Ethan Hawke, on his first day on the job. Ethan Hawke is a serious cop (and he plays the role well). Even so, his trainer, Denzel Washinton, manages to get him to, or I should say the ""script"" manages to get him to, on their first day together as partners, smoke PCP, take responsibility for a murder, release two rapists, shake down a drug dealer in a wheelchair, drink beer and hard liquor on the job, conduct an illegal search, and more. It defies believability. The core of the movie seems to be a vehicle for DW to be the big angry, over the top bossy, black guy, and call his new rookie ""nigger"" for the first fifteen minutes of the movie. There was no suspense, no tension, just an angry black man yelling at his new white rookie for two hours. Nothing here for me. Why this rates as anything Oscar worthy for anyone is a mystery, more of a mystery than anything in this film...

200,RolloTomasi,Big cop out,5,20 October 2001,"SPOILERS""Training Day"" opens strong. Here you had Jake, a guy who finds himself in this terrible situation. He wants to make detective and work narcotics, so he must spend a day in the field getting some real world' training with a hardened LAPD legend. You see this big brother/little brother dynamic develop between the two. Jake wants to impress this guy more than anything, but soon realizes he's in for more than he ever imagined.Who was it that said, the audience doesn't want to see the second worst day of a guy's life? Well, what a day this ends up being for Jake Hoyt. Ethan Hawke gives this great multi-leveled performance. There's two main things he needs to accomplish: be scared of Alonzo and hide that fear from Alonzo. It's just one day,' he must be thinking to himself, I can get through this.'The film does not build on this promise, but ends up being an unintentional sermon. I never like to feel like I'm being preached to while watching a film. ""Training Day"" claims to know the answers to the questions it poses. Films shouldn't do that. Make the audience think but let them make up their own minds.The cause of this problem is the character of Alonzo Harris. I was disappointed that this guy ended up really being bad. This is a case of a plot twist gone wrong.  While it's admirable that Denzel didn't demand that the writers change the story so his character seems more heroic, the way many stars have, I almost wished they'd gone that route, if only just a little.We're never given a reason to feel sympathetic toward Alonzo. First we think he's a jerk. Then we find out he's really an evil person. The plot features this double fake-out that starts with him going psycho on a couple of would-be rapists. At this point you're thinking, they're messing with our heads. Soon we're going to see that Alonzo isn't such a bad guy. But the story just keeps pouring it on: Evil, evil, evil. This translated into boring, boring, boring.By the time the film got to the business with the three wise men and Alonzo's 'posse,' followed by the revelation that Jake's been set up the entire time, I was no longer involved. I was no longer relating to Jake's character but was just along for the ride, merely curious about what happened next.The card game scene is great and could have saved this film's behind. It's ruined by a coincidence that asks more from the audience's suspension of disbelief than it should. I mean, his cousin? Out of how many millions of people in Los Angeles? Is that supposed to be ironic? It's not even the coincidence that bugs me the most; it's that the scene it's meant to be the payoff of, the scene that had been the most interesting and intense in the film, ends with a big thud.""Training Day"" is another one of those films I wish had taken a different course. At the beginning you're thinking it's going to be about this wide-eyed rookie learning the hard lessons of the 'real' world. But not long into the story it becomes apparent that the film isn't based on any reality at all. It becomes this typical cop thriller with corrupt cops and evil Russian mafia guys. Isn't there enough moral tests in the real struggles of an undercover narcotics officer that they could have built a story around? It's as if no one involved in the film knew anything about narcotics investigation, so they had to resort to this theoretical crap that's straight out of ""Tango and Cash.""Grade: C",Training Day
201,starlit-sky,An Excellent Cop/Action Movie,8,17 December 2001,"Young police officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) tries to prove himself to a senior cop, Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington), to be admitted into his narcotic unit in LAPD in his first day. The whole story takes place in just one day but what a day that is! From the beginning to the end, they witness all kinds of criminal events as they cruise down the back streets of Los Angeles. Jake is a straight arrow and completely honest, yet equally naïve. Throughout the day, he desperately tries to handle the situations he encounters in his own naïve way whereas Alonzo, who is much more experienced in the field, has completely different methods of resolving issues. As a result, they often disagree over how each situation should be handled and Jake realizes that his views are mostly in conflict with those of his senior officer. However, since his objective is to get into narcotics department and since the only way is to impress Alonzo, Jake obeys Alonzo's orders. After all, Alonzo is the expert in the field so he should know better.
The best thing about the movie is that it keeps the audience guessing right till the end about the actual morality of Alonzo. Is he really a corrupt police officer as inexperienced Jake suspects him to be or are his ways really how things are handled in the narcotics department of LAPD? Neither the audience nor Jake really knows the answer to that question for it is Jake's (and also our) first day in that field. Who are we or who is Jake to judge Alonzo's morality who spent many years in this field? Can we really say for sure that his methods are not practised in reality? After every argument, when Jake tries to rest his case, Alonzo comes back with a stronger argument and convinces him that his methods are the best. Of course, you don't know the answers to these questions until the end unless you haven't read the complete plotline. I honestly think whoever is responsible with the publicity of this movie doesn't know anything about the art of movie making. The same goes for the person who is responsible with the plotline which gives away everything about the movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor: DO NOT READ ANY reviews (especially the plotline in the ""Main Details"" page) which give away the whole story. Possible Oscar Nominations: Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke both deserve Oscar nominations (Best Leading/Supporting Actor) for their excellent performances. Antoine Fuqua has done a very nice job as a director by capturing the ambience on the streets and with his depiction of criminals' lives, especially of those in the black neighbourhood. Each scene is nicely done and the suspense is so authentic. I was especially impressed by the tension in the scene where Jake sits down at the poker table with the guys waiting for Alonzo to come back. You can find a similar tension maybe in a horror movie.What I didn't like (***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***): I didn't like the publicity of this movie where Denzel Washington was openly declared to portray a corrupted cop which probably is the biggest movie spoiler that I have ever encountered in my life. The best part of the movie is the puzzle it creates over Alonzo's real character because it is not possible for the audience to decide whether or not issues are handled in Alonzo's ways in special narcotic division. Given his real character away is to kill the joy of the entire movie. Even at the end of their day, during their conversation in the car, Alonzo's explanation is very convincing and makes perfect sense. Only thing I didn't like about the movie itself is the scene where Jake jumps from the terrace of the building to the Alonzo's car after beaten up pretty badly. This scene was not realistic.",Training Day

209,rhefner2002,"Keeps us interested, but the ending is silly",6,5 October 2019,"Washington is phenomenal as corrupt cop Alonzo Harris. For the first half of the film, he keeps us wondering if he's a bad guy or a good guy, in spite of his unorthodox methods. He's actually seems like both. Sometimes he's charming; other times, he's outright despicable. It take a skillful actor to pull off a role like this.Ethan Hawke, as Jake Hoyt, Harris' white rookie partner on his first day as a narcotics cop, is convincing as he wrestles with his concepts of right and wrong--enforcing the law or stooping to the level of the criminals he's dealing with. Alonzo puts him through his paces, big time.The second half of the film goes into dissipation. As Alonzo's actions become increasingly over the top and corrupt, Hoyt, finds himself descending into is own kind of vigilantism. In the ending of the film, his decision to ""do the right thing"" is not only misguided, but it causes Alonzo's demise. Ironic.All through the film, I kept wondering how these two cowboys got away with all this stuff without any other cops or their superior officers knowing about it. Pretty hard to swallow. There's one brief scene with Alonzo having lunch with some high ranking police officials who are clearly indifferent to the law, but it's not enough to answer the question of why the two cops are completely unsupervised.The film is fast moving and captivating and will keep you watching, but the final scenes descend into a typical violent Hollywood shootout that rivals Bonnie and Clyde. This movie could have had a better ending. It just ""drops dead,"" if you'll pardon the expression. And it doesn't answer the moral question that it raised in the first place. If the middle had been cut shorter, there could have been a better resolution at the end. What became of Hoyt? What about the investigation of the shootout?

Hawke meets then detective Alonzo Haris (Denzel Washington) who was assigned as trainer and evaluator for this rookie. Hoyt wants fiercely to get this assignment, but finds very orthodoxes and quaint ways to ""protet and to serve"" of Alonzo. In this day Hoyt will meet a true challenge and will face the total opposite way to proceed from the one he learned in the academy; he will also face some of the more dangerous neighborhoods and streets of Los Angeles.",Training Day

Well the academy award and nominations for those are often noted what is often over looked is the great performers by musicians in the film like Dr. Dre and Macy Grey who play small but memorable cameo's.The action and the suspense. Are well put together and timed. The action is Brutal but not nearly as tough as the language and ideas that are throw around by Denzil's crooked cop. Ethan Hawke looks outplace where he needs to and frightened out of his wits at times. If you put yourself in his shoes you will too.,Training Day

No one ever denied that Mr. Washington could act, but by casting against type (as is often the case) people finally noticed the depth and breadth of his acting skills.Of course, in order to truly shine, an actor needs other elements to be in place as well. And Mr. Washington has them all here. His co-star, Ethan Hawke, does an excellent job of providing the innocent counterbalance so that Mr. Washington looks even tougher by comparison. The action sequences are well shot and grittily realistic. The plot twists, while not truly shocking, are unique enough to keep the movie's tension at a high level throughout.To see my other reviews, please visit: https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com",Training Day

Excellent first hour. Its really LA on the film; some of the bit actors are claimed to be actual gang members, and I cringed imagining myself having to navigate through such hostile territory.The parts that aren't so good are: Crooked cops would not try to set up a first-day-in-narcotics rookie. It would smell bad to everyone. A loose cannon like the Washington character would not have made it for 13 years on the force. The ending was predictable but they should've at least given it a little more time playing up to it. The short story is that the plot gets more and more out there as the movie goes on.

218,DorianWynHowells,This is not your average cop duo flick - this is better!,9,5 February 2002,"I went into this film relatively cold and was really enticed to go and see Denzil Washington playing against type. What I was treated to was a very good film.It wouldn't surprise me if Washington was nominated for an Oscar in his role here as Olonzo, a Narcotics cop who is just a little bent. What? A bent cop? Surely not! Oh yes. There are loads of them in this film, and Olonzo is the most cunning, ruthless and fast talking one to be had!The film's events all take place on Jake's (Ethan Hawke) training day. He wants to be on the aforementioned Narcotics team. He is very naive though, Olonzo shows him what it's really like to be on the streets etc. and things get a little bit dodgy to say the least.Good plot structure and two very confident performance's - especially Washington, he is ELECTRIC on screen - make this a great thriller to watch. Hawke puts in a great performance (not a big fan of him, but this film might just make me see his other films!). The film also boasts some nice performances from Dr Dre, Macy Gray, and Scott Glenn too.So, go and watch this film, and be treated to something that although does follow the rule book as far as thriller's go, but also bends the rules to achieve a nice twist to the story.9/10Enjoy!",Training Day

220,Rhino Rover,Dark and intriguing,8,13 October 2001,"I've always thought that Denzel Washington was/is a wonderful actor. He's proven it time and time again but he has always played morally true characters or the typical Hollywood `good guy' so when the `Training Day' trailers first came out I was really looking forward to seeing Washington portray a completely opposing character. Training Day literally takes place over the span of one day. A young patrol cop, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) gets his big chance to further his career goal of becoming Detective by working with the legendary Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). This man's reputation precedes him and has been responsible for over 15,000 man years of incarceration based on his investigations and Hoyt is now getting his chance to work in Harris's squad. Hoyt finds out that Harris is as tougher than his reputation and quickly begins learning the ropes of street justice but to the contrary of everything he's learned and devoted his life to. `To Serve and Protect' now takes on an entirely new meaning.You know I really hope that Denzel Washington does more of these types of roles. I'm always amazed at his acting skills but he always plays the same type of character. Whether that was a career choice or not, it was very refreshing to see him finally play a more `evil' character per say. In this case, the role was even more amazing in that Harris isn't so much evil but that he has his own outlook on how justice should be handled. In some instances you actually begin to agree with his outlook and root for him. I have never seen Washington give a poor performance. He acts with an intensity that very few other actors have and dives into his character with reckless abandon.What surprised me even more was Ethan Hawke. I've never been a huge fan of his and I sometimes find his characters hard to believe because of his boyish looks. But in this movie they seem to work. He comes across as a young ethical patrol cop trying to make his way to Detective. Throughout the movie he has his morals and ethics challenged by Washington's character and frequently he caves into Washington's dominance. This worked very well and made the movie interesting but more importantly Hawke make his character believable. I was impressed by his performance in this movie.There was a nice little scene with Cliff Curtis (Smiley). I saw this actor in `Blow' and really like his performance there. Hopefully he doesn't get typecast but he was very good in the character he played here. I guess if there's on thing to get picky about was the storyline. It seems a little extreme to have only one day to make or break making a new squad but in the context of the story, this works. Especially when you know the motives behind Washington's character. Overall, this was a dark entertaining movie. If for nothing else, see this movie to see Denzel Washington play a bad character. You'll be surprised and impressed.",Training Day

222,IOBdennis,Intense but somewhat contrived,8,4 September 2002,"A SPOILER OR TWO:  If you get through some of the plot implausibilities and stereotypes, this is an entertaining and intense film.  Denzel's performance is riveting, not because of the performance itself (it's pretty one-sided as far as I was concerned), but because Denzel has always played the nice guy. Here he plays the bad guy.  It's simply interesting to watch this metamorphosis.  But that's also the test of a great actor:  being convincing in any role you play.  And he certainly is convincing in this role and in everything he plays.  So---bravo, Denzel.But for the movie: well, some of it just doesn't work, but you have to overlook some of the implausibilities and go with the action, which is constant and intense.  And using famous rap stars in speaking roles is certainly a mistake.  They come across as wooden.  And some of the plot twists just become a bit too far-fetched: e.g. why does the young girl saved from a rape so willingly provide the information to her UNCLE!?  She starts off her telephone conversation hiding everything, but then almost unconvincingly spills the beans.  Why does the neighborhood in which much of the action take place change it's opinion of Denzel's character so quickly? Oh, yeah, he's a bad cop and he used them and they hate him and he's a pig, etc.  But it just comes as such a pat finish.  Was it dramatic license that forces the rookie into the ""fold"" so quickly on the very first day on the job?  We are cheated out of getting to see the wool being pulled over the rookie's eyes, really.  It all happens so quickly, forceably in the first hour or two on the job.  Pretty neat trick, but are we then supposed to believe that the rookie was that gullible in the beginning?  Yeah, he is pretty stupid, I guess, and green in the beginning.  But wow, very little leg work had to be done to get him involved.  But this of course is what adds to the intensity of the film.  The artifice of compacting into a set dramatic time makes for drama, if not realism.",Training Day

What a disappointment! Consider Denzel's Oscar this year for his body of work, to open the door for more non-white winners, to avoid the threatened botcott, or whatever but puleeze - not for his outstanding performance in this run of the mill violent cop flick. I am reminded of Sylvester Stallone in Copland which was a much better film in this overworked genre. Denzel's performance unfortunately did not add much.By contrast, Will Smith was robbed because his performance as Ali was great and different. Sean Penn was no Dustin Hoffman but did better than Denzel. And of course, in spite of his off screen behaviour and like him or not, Russell Crowe was the best in A Beautiful Mind.Don't waste your time on this film, that is unless you want to see the real Best Supporting Actor performance, a really great turn by Ethan Hawke.",Training Day

Maybe, in this, a lackluster year of performances. This is not a knock on Denzel. I think he is a great actor and quite capable of winning a Best Actor Oscar in even better years. But this role was not the equal of many others which have won Best Actor Oscars. It may not even be his best one. All in all, rent this movie. It is pretty good, especially if you like cop movies.

Harris will show him the streets, and will actually make him feel part of it. Harris' performance repulses Hoyt, but there's something that at the same time makes him admire him. Probably this will happened to the spectator as well. Partly because of the script, and mostly because Mr Washington knows how to be convincing to everyone listening. Hoyt will have to make a quick decision about if being a cop is really what he was expecting, therefore what he wants to be. Harris makes it sound like the only way possible to work in the narcotics division. But it's up to Hoyt to make a decision.The most remarkable, though there is nothing wrong with the directing, the script, etc, are the performances. Washington is really convincing and will make you doubt, you won't know when you have just crossed the thin (white) line  between cop duty and illegality and corruption. And Ethan Hawk should have really won the Academy Award as Hoyt. these performances kill, in more than one way.This kind of great police dramas make me want to know and watch more about the genre.Btw, who the hell said it was a comedy?! it is funny watching as Hoyt smokes the dope that Alonzo gives him to 'be on the streets', but what else?",Training Day

Denzel Washington is on form, won't deny that. The film is well shot, a look at the darker side of LA.I think watching this again, that it does look a little silly and stereotypical sometimes. Blacks and Hispanics and college kids. Also, some of the events or shots or scripting does seem a little 'theatrical' and 'staged', rather than flowing in such a way that we can 'buy' the story. That being said, it does deliver the goods. Training day is one of these films that is not really escapism, it is just a fictional story. The real world of law enforcement can be and is (within reason) a dirty and corrupt empire. It's easier to have a Black or Hispanic scapegoat, or somebody to pull over just for kicks or for another notch in the Detective post.It's an enjoyable watch. I'm not sure how I would feel about it if the two leads were not who they were. Washington rules the roost, and the camera. Hawke plays the honest, determined and somewhat under confident rookie very effectively.

It had the necessary action and suspense elements, but it's also a dual character study as well as a sordid tour of America's drug and gang sub-culture. It's thought-provoking and disturbing.Denzel Washington won the best actor Oscar for this, and I can see why--he's utterly mesmerizing as Alonzo, the senior street narc. He's Satan in gangsta clothes: charming, sexy, seductive, manipulative, and larger than life. Ethan Hawke deserves credit for holding his own with Washington; a lot of other actors would have been blown off the screen, but we keep identifying with Hawke's ingenue Jake right up to the end of the film.

238,compi24,"Review of ""Training Day""",9,30 June 2011,"""Training Day"" is the story of Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke), an LAPD rookie who is looking to join a top-notch narcotics squad led by Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Harris gives Hoyt one simple task; accompany him on a one-day ride-along where he must prove himself worthy of enlistment. Now from this point on the movie maintains a steady level of immense entertainment. The most noteworthy aspect of this movie is Denzel Washington's awesome, and Academy-Award Winning portrayal of Alonzo Harris; the rugged cop that has seemingly blurred the line between what is right and what isn't. His performance is as charismatic and imposing, as it is chilling and antagonizing. Every line that Washington delivered was either intensely funny or incredibly demented (but still funny). Which brings me to the script; ""The Fast And The Furious"" writer, David Ayer, delivers deeply provocative dialogue, as well as a compelling narrative that delves into some very insightful themes. The main theme of the movie, however, seems to be a blend of the ""Crime doesn't pay"" and ""Power corrupts"". So, in a sense, this story not only provides an incredibly accurate depiction of Inner-city LA, and exceedingly tense performances from its actors, but it may also serve as a cautionary tale - a cautionary tale that would not have been told sans the tremendous direction from Antoine Fuqua. Fuqua really did an impeccable job at delivering methodical, and aesthetic visuals. Fuqua also used his personal connections to access parts of LA that most people has never seen, in a sense, giving these parts of LA a voice. All in all, I found ""Training Day"" to be a steadily enjoyable film with great performances across the board, a wonderful story and script, and a solid direction. Remarkable.",Training Day

I wouldn´t be surprised if Denzel Washington gets another Oscar nomination, because here he really shines. It´s different from most of his other work, but he´s very confident and believable when he is teaching the viewers the ""law of the street"" with that lovely accent. Ethan Hawke makes an nice comeback, after a few tough years with not many films worth seeing. Oldies´ like Tom Berenger, Scott Glenn and Harris Yulin have small but important roles, and it´s fun to see artists like Macy Gray and Snoop Doggy Dog in cameos.

Worse, we are not given any strong reasons for the characters doing what they did. It was like ""let's make a dirty cop movie and throw in all of the ugliness that we can"" and the plot went no further than that.I kept waiting for something redeeming to happen in this movie and it never happened. It was an ugly, obscenity-laced piece of garbage that presented black cops in a negative stereotypical light. All it did was further the glamorized hip-hop gangsta lifestyle and pound another nail into some poor viewer's coffin. I usually like Denzel Washington, but in this film I felt ashamed for him.

244,mikel weisser,an electrifying performance by denzel washington hoists film above its average plot,9,28 April 2002,"the last fifteen minutes of Training Day are so average as to almost sink the otherwise fantastic film. this movie went from a 10 to a 9 to an 8 as its closing seconds ticked away. this is not to say you shouldn't watch it but when you get to the part where the ending becomes obvious just rewind it right there so you'll be left with the memory of amazingly realistic dialogue, satisfyingly complex plotting, and some of the best street cop performances ever. no doubt denzel's ferocious alonzo harris clearly thoroughly out-acted russel crowe's jittery timid john nash. the dialogue and plotting are also superior, up to the ending which reeks of the twin taints of outrageous coincidence and typical superhuman heroes and villains in a tired old climatic battle royale.  the video offers an alternative ending which doesn't help matters one bit",Training Day

I greatly enjoyed the first hour, Massa Washington chewed the scenery with a relish reminiscent of Ben Kingsley's Don Logan in ""Sexy Beast"".

246,Illini_Wrestling_Fan,Young Junkie Cop Takes His Last Ride,9,19 October 2020,"Second-year cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) has been assigned a ""last chance mentor"" after his frequent rehab stints, grizzled veteran cop Alonzo (Denzel Washington). Training Day tells the story of their shocking interactions from the unreliable point of view of the addicted young officer Jake.Barely into their first mentoring session, Jake smokes up the evidence of an important drug bust. High as a kite, Jake embarks on a crazy PCP trip including a delusional journey to meet music legends Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg, and Dr. Dre before ultimately physically and emotionally abusing each in turn. In a clear sign of the depths of the chemically-induced abyss, Hoyt actually thinks some random old man remembers Jake's ""career"" as the third-string strong safety for conference-doormat North Hollywood High.When he learns of an exclusive Hillside house party from some 14-year old girl he met in an alley, Jake crashes the soiree with a boxed blender in hand. After a miscommunication with the party hosts, Jake almost loses his life for stealing the 14-year old's pink wallet. Fortunately Jake talks his way out of a self-made mess and for some reason angrily rides the city bus away while fondling his loaded service weapon.Then stomping into Alonzo's peaceful neighborhood, armed and psychotic, Hoyt terrorizes Alonzo and his young family with a loaded gun and has the audacity, the temerity, the unmitigated gall to think that Alonzo's son trusts a gun-wielding home invader more than the boy's own father. Chasing innocent Alonzo across a set of rooftops, Hoyt's quixotic quest is only deterred when the local neighborhood watch finally escorts the disturbed newbie from the neighborhood.In a final ironic twist, Hoyt's Russian drug connections catch up to Alonzo in a case of mistaken identity when the assassins shoot up the car where Jake was last seen.9/10",Training Day

Personally, it isn't the best movie I've ever seen, and not the best movie with gangsters/corrupt cops either. I've watched a lot of such movies, with similar plots but I was positively impressed by the atmosphere which this one creates. The perfect mix of the images highlighting Jake and Alonso driving through the hood and the tensioned music playing on these moments, makes you think and believe that this is a harsh reality and of course, as Alonso said once in the movie, ""what you learn in the academy is nothing compared to what you see on the streets"". Other nice points of this movie is the plot, which is totally imprevisible, always asking if Alonso is good or bad and the morale which implies to stick to the good rules and do what is right, because you never know when this is going to return back at you (I am talking about the saving of the girl who was so close to being raped. That deed, saved the protagonist life, otherwise, the mexicans would have killed him). Of course, there are some small errors through the playtime, but nothing bothered me.",Training Day

I was really looking forward to seeing it since Denzel Washington is absolutely one of my very favorite actors ever! His performance in this one was flawless and really amazing. People just don't know him in such a role and he totally convinced as the bad guy. Denzel found his match in Ethan Hawke, he also gave a stunning performance. It's not only the acting that raises this movie so far above average. The director did an outstanding job in creating a very real atmosphere.

249,jrwygant,It's not just the cop who's corrupt,1,30 December 2007,"The acting was good, which is about the best that can be said for this movie. It exploits ethnicity, racial culture, tough talk, and violence for the sake of entertainment. None of what it presents is justified by the highly predictable ending.Did the people who made this want it to be like ""Serpico"" and ""The Departed""? They failed to understand that it's really creepy to make a hero out of the Denzel Washington character. Fans will say that Washington's character is not a hero, that the dialog and script clearly depict him as a bad cop. Despite that, he is the most powerful character in the film by miles, which makes him the hero. His demise is ultimately effected by an anonymous band of machine-gun toting thugs we have not previously seen, leaving the impression that this guy was so powerful that none of the other characters could stop him -- not a very satisfying conclusion.The first two-thirds are slow, consisting of little more than Washington acting uncompromisingly tough and Hawke acting compromised by his ambition to advance. Only in the last third of the movie does something resembling a plot materialize, almost as an afterthought.The action was unrealistic. The dialog -- of which there was so much that a viewer could follow and understand the movie with eyes closed -- was artificial. It takes more than violence and tough talk to make a good film, unless the viewer is only after cheap thrills.",Training Day

252,grantbullert,"Intensely Dramatic Throughout, but a Weak Close",7,19 May 2018,"""Training Day"" is a high energy film filled with difficult moral dilemmas. It delivers on drama, but doesn't deliver much meaning.-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The pacing and drama is excellent and powerful in this film. The film is two hours, but it only feels an hour long. There are some nice callbacks that pay off pretty well. The story is set up wonderfully for an unforgettable ending. The disappointing thing is that the ending is truthfully quite forgettable. We leave the film feeling as if the final ten minutes were unplanned. Despite a weak ending, Antoine Fuqua commands an exhilarating story with absolute skill. Tension builds all throughout the film, and Fuqua gets the most out of his actors while having them do the least. The drama is in the story not the characters' actions, and Fuqua understands that. *Cinematography/Editing: The work of Mauro Fiore is greatly executed. He doesn't do more than he has to. This is a grim film about a hardened cop clashing against an eager rookie, not an artistic voyage of cinema. His understanding of what the story is about gives him incredible power in his visual storytelling. He doesn't get flashy, rather he presents the information to us in the way we need it. He makes excellent use of darkness and shadows contrasting with dim lights in tense scenes. The editing is mostly unnoticeable, which is what it is supposed to be in a film of this particular type. There are some well cut scenes of tension, especially towards the end. *Dialogue/Acting: The dialogue draws us further into the characters for most of the film. It is realistic and informal, but sometimes it seems as if the film tries too hard to be philosophical. Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington provide good performances. Hawke doesn't seem to have much range in this film, but his moments of calm are the most powerful of his performance in the film. Washington does enough to carry the story, but does not impress as much as he is capable of. *Music/Sound: These are among the weaker aspects of the film. The score is mediocre and does not do much to change the mood. The most intensely powerful scenes were typically without music. Other than a few queues the score hurt the film more than helped it. The sound was lackluster. There was not a dynamic range and it did not do enough to draw the audience into the world that Alonzo and Jake live in. *Production Design/Special Effects: The location, sets, and props were believable enough. They were not totally engrossing, but once again the film is all about the story so the production design is not as important. The special effects were passable. Some shots of people being punched or hit with items looked a bit weak. But it stayed real enough for us to stay invested in the story.*Conclusion: ""Training Day"" is a decent film that is sure to entertain and cause people to think about law enforcement. It may not have provided a clear path of what to think, but it did at least succeed in starting a conversation.",Training Day
253,pogostiks,major problem with this film,6,10 March 2008,"Warning! SPOILERS galore!I was genuinely interested in this film to begin with... and I absolutely loved the acting of both Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke.BUT - about three quarters of the way through this thing I could no longer suspend disbelief.There are just too many things that accumulate for this film to be taken as seriously as it could have been...Yes, there are rogue cops out there. That is not my problem with this film. It probably comes extremely close to the truth when showing how corrupt the cops can be - and also probably very close to what the streets and their scum are like.The problem is with what happens to Ethan Hawke during the day in the life ... First problem. He smokes some pot laced with crack. He is totally out of his head... but probably not long enough to be realistic. He should probably have been almost totally knocked out for several hours... but it seems like only an hour or so after being high he is charging down a street and capturing totally by himself two would-be rapists... Not bloody likely. (And while I'm at it, I can't imagine real cops walking away from the perps leaving them with their handcuffs on... they would have at least taken back their equipment!Please remember that one of the rapists kicks Ethan in the side at least two or three times during their scuffle. Second: Ethan gets beaten up a second time by the hoods in the house where he is left by Washington. Sorry, but anyone who has been beaten up once by rapists and then beaten up a second time by these hoods would have been barely able to walk or do anything for the rest of the night. But not Ethan... he goes after Washington, and not only gets into a tumbledown fight that should ALSO have left him totally unable to move - but he actually jumps off a roof onto the windshield of a moving car and is STILL able to walk and operate on a pretty high level. Sorry, but if anyone reading this has ever taken even a quarter of the punishment Ethan does in this film, they would know that he would have been inoperative for most of the day... and certainly not in any shape to get through the last quarter hour of this film; Like, who is this guy, anyway? Superman?Third: How many 4 year old kids do you know that would trust a guy he's never met more than his own father? How many women who greet their man the way Washington's girlfriend (wife?) does when they stop off for lunch - would abandon him so quickly near the end? She grabs up her kid but does nothing to help protect Washington... and there is no explanation of why.I could go on - but why bother? There are so many holes in this film that although I liked much of it - and could believe the angle of the rogue cops etc... there is just no way that someone like Ethan would have been able to physically make it through this day.Oh, and by the way - in a town of how many millions, what would the odds be that the ONE 14 year-old girl who Ethan saves from being raped would turn out to be related to one of the hoods who is supposed to have killed him for Washington? Oh, come on! That is the weakest part of the entire plot. Could anyone who took two seconds to THINK really accept such a corny device? One would have better odds trying to win the lottery!All of this means that the film is really pretty stupid - or taking its audience for dunces... The only reason I gave this film a 6 instead of a 4 is because it is well-shot and well- acted.",Training Day
254,CarpenterKen,Good cop / Bad Cop,8,10 October 2001,"`Good cop/bad cop.' The police interrogation technique of partners ganging up on a suspect has long been a cinematic staple, but in `Training Day,' the new film from Warner Bros., the competition between good cop/bad cop goes on inside one cop. Narcotics detective Alonzo Harris, played by Denzel Washington in a spectacular performance, is the schizophrenic combination of a streetwise law enforcement crusader and a vicious leader of a police wolf pack that preys on bad guys and good guys alike.  He is funny and likeable, ruthless and despicable, hero and outcast. `There are some profoundly evil people walking these streets,' Alonzo says as the film begins. Will good prevail over evil?  That is the simple dramatic question director Antoine Fuqua poses here, but the route to the answer weaves erratically through crime-infested neighborhoods and sizzling plot twists, jumping from one spellbinding scene to the next. Harris spends a single `training day' working with narcotics  division recruit Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke).  Hoyt is a veteran ofuniformed traffic duty in the suburbs, but Harris sees enough in him to offer a chance to make detective on the mean streets of Los Angeles. The two spend most of the day riding around in Harris' `office,' a vintage low-rider Monte Carlo, as the grizzled but suave Alonzo explains the nuances of working undercover and making the big arrest.  Harris convinces his protégé to smoke PCP-laden weed, saying refusal on the streets would cost him his life -- `If I was a dealer, you'd be dead by now.'  He tells Hoyt not to wear his wedding ring to work, saying suspects would seize on it as a sign of weakness, a vulnerability to exploit.  They drink malt liquor like so much bottled water, and even stop off for a few belts of `the $300-a-bottle good stuff' with Harris' shadowy friend (played perfectly by Scott Glenn). Harris boasts of the `15,000 man-hours of incarceration time' that his investigations have led to, but he allows several small-time criminals go free after Hoyt is ready to make busts.  `We're not racking up arrests today,' Harris says. Hoyt asks, `Just let the animals wipe themselves out?' And Alonzo replies, `God willing.' Fuqua, who made a mark directing music videos for Arrested  Development, Henry D & The Boyz and Coolio, distinguishes  himself with his third feature, after `The Replacement Killers'  (1998) and `Bait' (2000).  The pace of the film never slows, even when the two main characters are simply riding around in a car or sitting in a restaurant.  The action sequences are interlaced with driving rap music and feverish editing, and Fuqua keeps the viewer guessing about what will become of Harris and Hoyt to very last. Even with a scraggly mustache and goatee, Hawke still has a hard time shaking off his boyish innocence, but he comes of age as an actor in `Training Day.' With solid performances as a teen-ager in `The Dead Poets Society' (1989) and `A Midnight Clear' (1991), Hawke started landing some starring roles, including the overlooked lead in `Snow Falling on Cedars' (1999).  A Best Supporting Actor nomination would not be a surprise, given his stellar work as the tormented Hoyt.As for Washington, he has never been better on screen, and we're talking about an actor who has mustered four Academy  Award nominations in his career.  He earned his first nod for a supporting role as South Africa's Steve Biko in `Cry Freedom' (1987), and then won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in 1989's `Glory.' He followed that with Best Actor nominations for `Malcolm X' (1992) and `The Hurricane' (1999). (He should have  won both statues, losing to Al Pacino in `Scent of a Woman' and Kevin Spacey in `American Beauty.') Some wonder whether Washington took a risk by playing a rogue cop in `Training Day,' but other than the upbeat football coach in `Remember the Titans' (2000), his past characters have not exactly been choirboys.  For example, Reuben `Hurricane' Carter was a ruthless boxer and enough a product of the streets to be convicted of manslaughter, and Malcolm X made enemies of both whites and blacks before being assassinated. No, playing Alonzo Harris was not career suicide for Washington. In fact, it's very likely he'll finally win the Best Actor Oscar that his body of work so richly deserves.",Training Day
255,HorrorFreak1997,phenomenal performances anchored by a tight script make this one a classic.,9,31 August 2017,"Training day is a classic film. it's difficult to find negatives here. the screenplay is tight and realistic. the acting is phenomenal, the run-time doesn't feel too short or too long, and in terms of production value the film is top notch. the sound and visuals are great. so lets get into the details of why everything is so great.firstly, the performances are excellent. Ethan Hawke gives us a timid yet bold performance as the rookie narcotics agent who's not all that comfortable with the way his first day unfolds. his character's main goal is to become street ready and become the best cop he can possibly be. he starts out as a soft yet passionate officer who isn't very in tune with all of the street details that are required to perform the job. in scenes where he needs to be a little reserved and in his head, Hawke pulls it off. in scenes where he needs to be bold and charismatic, Hawke pulls it off as well. the key to the character is the outstanding morals he displays. he is at his core, a good man who seeks to do good. Denzel Washington's character is the polar opposite. the grizzled vet who knows what it takes and might cut some corners in order to get the job done. Washington is very charismatic and sells his characters motivations and morals perfectly. his character acts as the corrupting force that could be Ethan Hawke's characters undoing. the interplay between the characters moral differences is what drives the plot and keeps the story flowing smoothly and with consequence. each scene where a moral question comes into play could or could not affect Ethan Hawke's character in a major way. it's interesting to see how each scene plays out and how it will affect our perceptions of the characters as well as the perceptions that characters have of each other. what really ties everything together though is the script. the screenplay allows for both the characters to propel the plot and the plot to propel the characters. it's this balancing act that makes the movie special. an event happens, we learn about our characters, they learn about each other which causes a new reaction or event and the story flows smoothly. every time Denzel's character teaches Hawke's character something, although it may be immoral or even insignificant at the time, it comes into play in the third act. Hawke's character grows and towards the end of the film becomes the cop that he set out to become. completing the character's arc and completing the story with a tightly wrapped bow. it may not be on the level of the godfather or citizen Kane, but it sure is a great film and if you haven't seen it.. watch it.9/10",Training Day

That said, the payback if not impossible enough for the honors that a life in stun begets, has to be carved out of the possibility that only a front-seat tryst with obedience proffers as its salvage of pride lost in keeping one from flying over the cuckoo's nest yet gained at vicariously living large in someone's lost shot at hell, for what can be gained by all can only be gained by one when the rigmarole at question has always been about keeping just that one in check.

Washington's performance is free, charismatic, scary, and loose. Also (unlike Russell Crowe in A BEAUTIFUL MIND), Washington never breaks character. His interpretation of a very evil man is flawless.He practically pops with theatrical sizzle.Ethan Hawke is just as good as naive rookie, Jake Hoyt. Throughout the film, we can actually see Hoyt come into his own and become a leader (as opposed to a beginner). In my opinion, Hawke should have also won the Oscar.

259,quatermax-1,Edge of the seat entertainment...,8,8 February 2008,"Denzel Washington plays Detective Alonzo Harris, a hardnosed, street savvy narcotics cop given charge of rookie cop Jake (Hawke). As Jake's 'Training Day' progresses he learns that his Police Academy rules don't apply in Alonzo's world, and with increasing concern, not to mention personal jeopardy, finds that Alonzo, some of his fellow detectives and even higher officials in the LAPD, have distinct rules of their own.Not an original premise, but here the delivery is bang on. Washington plays on his past comfortable screen personas, initially coming across as the experienced, tough, no-nonsense, but well meaning, detective. We of course, like Hawke's character Jake, a rookie eager to please, are initially taken in by this, but it is not long before doubts about Alonzo's true nature and agenda start to kick in.There are many disturbing things about this film, not least of which is the fact that no-one has come forward to say that it ain't really like that on the streets of LA  in fact they endorsed its accuracy by giving Washington an Oscar for his portrayal.However, Washington's performance is electric and worthy of its Academy Award. Alonzo is charismatic, persuasive, powerful, dangerous and downright scary. Ethan Hawke compliments this with a portrayal that runs the gamut from initial naivety and respect, through wary tolerance, to disbelief, terror and finally rage, in a performance necessarily powerful enough to counter Washington. The two are equally compelling to watch and provide edge of the seat entertainment in a gripping, raw and violent tale of lies, betrayal, corruption and abuse of power (sorry to use the old maxims there, but here they actually apply).Highly recommended.",Training Day
260,joaocruzferreira,The Very Best of Zel,8,18 July 2007,"""Good Cop / Bad Cop""""Training Day"" throws the rules out of the window and hits you in the face with a brutal and highly entertaining story of good cop/bad cop as we are taken on an urban trip of one day on the job for rookie narcotics officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) and his training officer Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). When Harris begins to cross the line, Jake finds himself willing to look the other way.Amazingly set over the course of 24 hours, the movie is a look at the seductive nature of corruption, how deeply it can bloom and how its ruinous consequences permanently stain anyone who comes in contact with it.Washington radiates a wicked, malicious magnetism he's never displayed, by way of contrast with the heroic roles he usually takes on. This is the first villainous turn of his career. Being bad brings out the best in Washington, and his performance elevates ""Training Day"" past its familiar street-cops scenario into something far richer. Denzel is surely the star of this film and was quite deserving of his ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"" academy award, even though I am sure many people claim Russell Crowe deserved it more for ""A Beautiful Mind"". In my opinion, the winner should have actually been Sean Penn for his work in ""I Am Sam"". However, I also think Ethan Hawke deserves some praise, this is a guy that has grown on me over the past few years, especially with this film and ""Before Sunset"".Obviously Training Day is an example of a movie that showcases the talent of everyone involved, especially the talent of director Antoine Fuqua who, in my opinion, is not getting enough work but I am absolutely sure we will see more from him soon enough. 9/10",Training Day

They visit gang-infested neighborhoods, chase drug-dealers and conduct house-raids.

263,mkm-hermanjnr,A solid crime movie with a great villain,8,7 April 2019,"Training Day is a 2001 cop drama/thriller starring Denzel Washington as veteran Narcotics cop Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke as Jake Hoyt, an LAPD newbie auditioning himself to Alonzo for a job on the Narc Squad.The film's most immediately obvious strength lies in the personal, documentary-esque way we follow the two officers throughout their day. We start with a mundane breakfast scene in a roadside cafe to introduce us to the characters and their eccentricities, transition to Alonzo's car and from there we ride along with the characters on the whole seedy and sordid affair.Hoyt acts almost as an audience surrogate, reacting to Alonzo's antics with confusion, admiration and alarm. Ethan Hawke does a great job of conveying a rookie cop's naivety yet combines this with strong morals and sense of honour and duty that makes his character likable.Washington steals the show, however, with his portrayal of Harris. Alonzo is a character who mutates constantly throughout the movie. Washington flicks effortlessly between being charming, cold, amusing, intimidating, sinister and friendly. Harris is just as at home smiling warmly at you as he is blowing you away with a shotgun - and when he decides to pull that trigger, he's already worked out exactly how it's all going to play out in court afterwards.I'd say keeping Alonzo's nature ambiguous until the very end of the movie is another strength of the tight script. Just like Hoyt, we are never 100% sure whether Alonzo is merely a maverick or a flat out corrupt scumbag right until he crosses a very specific moral line (the murder of Roger for money). Even then, Washington's acting is so good Alonzo almost makes the killing seem reasonable!The movie has a brain to it, and features several things that really stand out on repeat viewing. In particular, the scene in which Harris is smiling and laughing on his phone and says ""Make sure you clean the tub out after..."". He then shares a seemingly heartfelt conversation with Jake, making that line particularly chilling once you have seen the movie once and understand what the phone call was referring to...!Weaknesses of the film precluding it from a 9 or 10 star rating from me include a somewhat limp ending and some extraordinary coincidences.At one point Jake's life is saved because it turns out that a girl he prevented a sexual assault on earlier in the day is the niece of a gangster about to kill him. This seems like a big long shot. Since the guy is the head of a large gang, it would have perhaps made more sense to make the girl the sister of one of his gang members or something. Those odds would at least seem a little less ridiculous.As for the ending; after a brilliant performance, Washington's character is gunned down with almost no fanfare by a bunch of oft-mentioned-but-never-seen Russian gangsters. It's not a terrible idea and is fairly satisfying, but I think it would have been better to simply have Harris murdered outside his girlfriend's house by the gangs during the standoff with Hoyt. It would have really highlighted how he was no different (even worse in fact) than the criminals he was manipulating. It would have also added an interesting angle regarding whether Jake would have kept quiet on the murder or not, showing that maybe in a way he ""learned"" to bend the rules from Alonzo.Anyway, despite these minor flaws the film as a whole is well acted, well written and enjoyable to watch or re-watch. 8/10.",Training Day
264,DP-4,Wow.,9,28 October 2001,"First off, Training Day should have been rated NC-17. I was not prepared for the violence, language or subject matter of this movie. That said, this movie blew me away. If there was ever any question of Denzel's acting ability, the question is now definitely answered. Denzel was simply brilliant in this role.Training Day is about a young cop who wants to join an elite drug-fighting task force in the worst way. But before he joins he has to prove himself to the task force leader, Denzel. Unfortunately, Denzel has been is the drug war for too long, and has gotten himself into some trouble. Denzel then uses the young cop to help get him out of trouble.Honestly, the plot is not what impressed me with this film. In fact, I found the plot to be disturbing. But, Washington's performance was the best I've seen in a cop film in many, many years. So, while I can't recommend the film due to its hardcore content, I must admit that Denzel delivers in a big way. He is truly one of the elite actors in movies today.",Training Day
265,DonutLover,how about a nice ice cream Sunday??,2,20 February 2007,"After watching this movie, I needed some chocolate, or something fun and silly, to get the ""ick"" out of my brain. There is really only one, or two movies which I have ever seen which have disturbed me in this way, and this is one of them. (The other was ""Death Wish"", which I saw when I was 19 yrs. old, so it's understandable why it was so disturbing). Why this movie was so disturbing can be summed up in three reasons: 1) a cop never surrenders his gun. Why? why? why is the gun surrendered? The fact that the viewer can understand, that the young officer is trying to trust the corrupt Denzel, is probably what is so disturbing. We KNOW he is blowing it, he should NEVER hand over his gun. And somewhere in his gut, he knows it too.2) The images of the Mexican dude's house, the home, where the rape/murder was going to take place. There was a wife in the home, there were babies in the home, there were crucifixes on the wall. Yet, a disgusting, unacceptable crime was going to occur in the bathroom. Yuck.3) The fact that I, as a viewer, thought that maybe Denzel really was a good guy, and that maybe his ""way"" was the way, to get the job done, the job of a good guy. So, in simple terms, the fact that I too, along with the new recruit, could have been tricked.I know lots of folks liked this movie. I guess if it turned as many people on as much as it turned my stomach, it must have something!",Training Day
266,ferni-tierni,Best Crooked Cop Performance I've seen thus far.,10,20 April 2020,"Training Day is a fast paced maniacal, dirty, crude whirlwind that will leave you reflecting on how you would deal with the ambushes and immorality that Hoyt faced. Are you a wolf or are you a shepherd? Only a wolf can catch wolves. Alonzo's philosophy justified many of the actions he made, but clearly understood the type of person that he was and what he had become. We never knew if Alonzo actually was a good cop at the beginning of his career, but his personality is so crass, vulgar, and duplicitous one can only conclude that he was the crooked cop all along.Ethan as Hoyt gives a good performance as the rookie cop that is hopeful and morally driven. We get some slight instances of character development at the beginning of the movie that solidified his character, but he was largely able to carry himself the persona of authenticity and naivety that was needed for that role. He was continually manipulated by Alonzo and walked the fine line between being submissive and not being weak, excellently. The gestures offered by the movie were brilliant. Hoyt fought and restrained two homeless people that were attempting to rape a teenager, stark contrast to Alonzo just watching and then releasing them after giving them a severe and savage ""street"" lesson. We were reminded repeatedly the temperament and value structure of both Alonzo and Hoyt.The street smart is a recurrent theme in the movie. It was clear at the onset that Hoyt had to forget everything he heard in the academy and adapt to Alonzo's philosophy to be able to survive. I would say that the ability to connect with people on the streets gave Alonzo some needed advantage to be able to infiltrate the circles that he needed to police, but the clear issue was to not transform into those criminals, but, as he mentioned, he needed to become a wolf like them to be able to catch them. The fascinating part about this movie is the complexity and ruthlessness that the streets conditions are displayed for people that want to make a meaningful change. A clear quandary is presented to the viewer where we are invited to reflect on complex and innovative ways to understand the sadist, vicious, uncertain dynamics of the streets.Ultimately, the message sent by the movie is that corrupt cops will eventually get punished for their decisions. Alonzo was playing too many people and ended having no people he could trust or depend on. Hoyt was saved by the sole just action that he did the entire day, providential or maybe unlikely, but the movie teaches us that if anyone aims to construct any change, it cannot be done by a single person, and no one will trust to take that path with you if you continue being duplicitous.",Training Day
267,henfish,High Ranking Performances... Cop-Out Plot!,7,19 August 2002,"LAPD Officer Jake Hoyt (Hawke) wants to make a difference on the streets, so he attempts to join the tough, harsh world of the plain-clothes Narcotics Department.  To succeed in this, he has to endure a training day on the job and convince the Narc's chief street officer, Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington), that he has what it takes.  A difficult enough job for anyone, but Detective Harris has one or two skeletons in his closet, and today they've all decided they're claustrophobic! Firstly.  The acting of the two leads is top-notch.  Washington might have won the Oscar for the showier part but Hawke matches him all the way in what is actually a more demanding journey.  90% of the movie concentrates on these two almost completely in isolation and they deliver through-out; a couple of moving, confrontational scenes at the heart of the film being exceptionally executed.Secondly.  The film does not have the courage of it's convictions. Initially it is almost plotless - and all the better for it.  Harris takes his rookie on a roller-coaster of 'street justice' and, despite the latter's consternation, the pivotal moments are so well handled and the dialogue of argument in the mouth of Harris so persuasive that his apparent immorality is never as clear-cut as it should be.  Had the entire film followed this path, we could well have been left with an intriguing debate on 21st Century urban justice and a refreshing reflection on the idea of 'right' and 'wrong'.  The film, of course, does nothing of the sort.  It's made in Hollywood after all!  No, almost exactly half-way through, we are introduced to a no-brainer plot involving the Russian mafia (oh dear!) and Harris stops breaking the rules because he firmly believes this is the only way to maintain street law, and starts breaking them because he is suddenly a very bad man!  Unbelievable plot twists follow hard by and we are taken into a different, disappointing, cliched nonsense of a film in which (among several lame developments) the residents of a lethal neighbourhood ghetto suddenly develop a collective, moral consciousness.  The very ending is awful beyond words and if it's a nod to Penn's Bonnie and Clyde it's an offensively crude one!It is to the two leads' credit than that, as crassly predictable as the film becomes, it remains very watchable because of their inspired playing.  And for that - it is worth a few hours of anybody's time.",Training Day
268,marz1966,A must see film,10,23 March 2002,"Once in awhile, a film comes along and totally catches you off guard. Training day,is one of those films. I just had expected a typical bad cop film or something of that nature,but my friends, it wasn't. Denzel Washington has proven, once again, that he is one of the finest actors of his generation. His character,Alonzo,a highly decorated officer of the l.a.p.d.,is charming,street wise,cunning,and dangerous. Now, some actors would have made this guy just a bad ass cop.Heartless.However Denzel gave him a just the right amount of humanity(there's a scene with his son,that briefly gives you a glimpse of that aspect.)where there might be a heart deep within the beast. Ethan.My god. He is wonderful in this film.Playing this first day on the job,fish out of water,and some times confused cop,you see why he,along with Washington, was nominated for the oscar this year. I watched this on DVD and after seeing the deleted and alternate ending of the film, I have to give kudos to the director,Antoine Fuqua. It was very wise to leave out some of those scenes...but at the same time, you got the feeling it was true what the character,Alonzo frequently tells the young det.Hoyt(Hawke),""you remind me of me"". Training day is a must see film that may shock and surprize you. It really made me wonder,how widespread is the corruption in the police. Must they,as in the film shows,be criminals to catch crimals??God help us all. See the film. You will not regret it.",Training Day
269,saymaraza,Training day,10,26 March 2016,"I absolutely adore this movie! My favourite Antoine Fuqua film by far. I absolutely love the tensity in Denzel's character, and at the the same time his emotion. Denzel makes this movie. He makes it a success, with some of the best acting I have ever seen on screen. Ethan Hawke also does a great job with the Innocent cop, but Denzel just steals the show. With high tensity and action packed police drama, this is definitely a film to see! Furthermore, there is disturbing dialogue within the film. But once you get past that and get into the world of good cop, bad cop you get into the mind of how Ethan Hawkeyes character is feeling and how he is thinking, and how he is being played for a fool by Denzel. Truly a masterpiece in the making!",Training Day
270,experten,Nice to see Washington when he is not so nice,9,3 March 2002,"Very good cop movie. I was tired of seeing Denzel Washington as Mr. Nice Guy in movie after movie so it feels very refreshing to see him get his fingers dirty. But is he a little dirty or very dirty ? Maybe he is only doing what is needed in a society gone bad ? Training Day has a brutal and serious atmosphere. The dialogue and acting is good, the pacing is rather high and there is some good violence and very threatening and suspenseful situations. U.S.A. sure seems to have some really dangerous neighbourhoods. Training Day is certainly better than most Hollywood cop movies. I also want to recommend 15 Minutes and The Negotiator. Rating: 9/10",Training Day
271,Clockwork-Avacado,The Reality Paradox,5,7 October 2013,"""Training Day"" is an intelligently produced police/corruption movie, which presents us with some very realistic, and very scary situations, showing us that in the big bad world, there are no laws, no rules - only the dictates of angry mobs, and guys with guns. And the environment of menace, and grimness is created expertly. And yet, having appreciated this movie for what it is, I could never bring myself to watch it again. That's because, as good as the acting may be, it's very difficult to enjoy this film overall, not because of its' content, but because of its' approach to the subject matter. To be brutally honest, it compromises its' own integrity, in a way that superior ""realistic""dramas, like ""Taxi Driver"", and ""Get Carter"", would never dream of doing. All of which raises the main problem about the movie: something which I like to refer to as ""the reality paradox.""Basically, it goes something like this: If a film presented a totally realistic account of street life, or police corruption, then it would not be an entertaining two hours of your life. Real life is devoid of dramatic incidents, of heroes and villains, and of moral boundaries, as well as of generally insightful dialogue. Therefore, to be ""realistic"", in that sense, means to be dramatically lacking. Realism is often attempted, but more often than not, the writers realise the need to spice things up with those old Hollywood clichés: in ""Training Day""'s case, there's car chases, a rooftop fight of ridiculous proportions, in which both Alonzo and Hoyt would definitely never walk away from, and a last half hour which totally dissolves the powerfully mature atmosphere which had been built up. That's why I cannot consider ""Training Day"" to be a realistic film, although it is peppered with insightful moments.What it is, is a tour of a really nasty city, presented in an extremely threatening and scummy fashion. I cannot fault Denzel Washington's acting, and even Ethan Hawke (whom I rather dislike as an actor) gives a good account of himself. What I can fault, is the narrative of the movie itself. The world of ""Training Day"", IS believable. It is nasty, and unsanitised. But the story which the movie tells, is flawed considerably, because of its' self conscious theatricality, and rather perverse logic twists. Hawke would not have lasted nearly as long as he did in this neck of the woods. When he's about to get shot in the bath, I sincerely doubt that one lucky coincidence would stop three sinister nutcases from killing him, and it is at this point, that the movie starts to collapse. Hawke has been easily manipulated by Washington's cop all the way through, so his sudden desire to hunt him down seems ludicrous. To be fair, when Roger is killed, I'd find it equally hard to believe that the rest of the cops would not kill Hawke, in best ""Serpico"" fashion, even if Denzel wants to keep him alive as his master fall guy - which seems a touch Machievellian to be taken seriously. Hawke may be reluctant to kill in cold blood and smoke weed, but he doesn't seem principled enough to risk his neck to take down Alonzo, just to satisfy his own sense of justice. The ending is far too clichéd, and out of touch with the more visceral realism of the rest of the movie. And, I'm sorry, but why would the neighbourhood scum not just gun Hawke down in the final confrontation? Stretching reality too much, for a downbeat ending which makes you wonder whether or not the whole two hours was worth your while, and Alonzo's death seems to be a big, clichéd full stop to a film which, if it had the courage of its' first ninety minutes, would not have had a proper ending, and would definitely have seen Hawke dead by the time the end credits roll. So,is ""Training Day"" a great movie? It's well made, by a director with a brain, and a sense of the macabre nature of everyday street life. But, it's far too afraid to go all out, and be really realistic. Just enough to make you scared, but not enough to really make you think. As a piece of entertainment, as a story, as an imaginative vision, ""Training Day"" is definitely lacking, and it's bolted on thriller elements clash with its' grisly realistic moments. Did I enjoy it? Honestly? No. I didn't. But I respected it. An ""A"" for effort, but a ""C"" for content.",Training Day
272,gracie28,If this movie were a meal it would be a cheeseburger,5,20 October 2001,"Very schlocky treatment of a story that had real potential.  The leads did fine acting jobs, but the plot and the schlock got out of hand. Reminds me of an amateur director who had too much money in his production budget. The violence quickly became gratuitous and the scenario, especially around the bad cop, Alonzo, became unbelievable after a short while.  I would not recommend the movie to anyone interested in anything more than a burger and fries.",Training Day
273,mcgriswald,Unbelievable coincidence,2,26 January 2007,"In Altman's ""The Player"" there is a subplot that involves a writer of a film who insists that his film retains his dark ""non-Hollywood"" ending--he is adamant during his pitches that ""life is like that"" and that people don't always live and that endings aren't always happy. He ends up selling out, and his movie has a stereotypical Hollywood ending in which a character played by Bruce Willis pulls a daring last second rescue of the formerly doomed heroine, played by Julia Roberts, complete with snappy exchange between the characters.In ""Training Day"" there is a unrealistic coincidence that allows Ethan Hawke's character to survive a situation where he should have died; I immediately thought about ""The Player"". I can hear the producers insisting that the hero (Hawke) survive, and that the villain (Washington) get a comeuppance. They may have shot an ending in which Hawke dies, and Denzel Washington's character goes on leading his corrupt life, but like in ""The Player"", it ""didn't test well"" with audiences in an advanced screening.I also was never convinced that Denzel could be so rotten, the fact that he always played heroes weighed on my ability to suspend disbelief, but that is my own subjective opinion. Denzel certainly played the character well, but I am not alone in my opinion that the Academy gave him the Oscar as a ""makeup"" for his being passed over before.What ruined the movie for me was the pat ending, and the coincidence that allowed it.",Training Day
274,Bud_Sturguess,A twisted buddy-movie fails in many aspects,1,21 January 2003,"In a twist on the generic buddy movie, Ethan Hawke is a naive rookie narcotics officer paired for the day with veteran rogue Denzel Washington. Throughout one twenty-four hour period, Hawke finds himself involved in scandals and corrupt business, all the fault of dirty cop Washington. Fair for its grit and tension between the two lead characters, but unapplausable for its generic approach. Denzel Washington won an Oscar for his role, and it sure shows, and not in a good way; it seems overly obvious that the lead man crafted his role not to entertain, but to obtain a gold statue. His Alonzo Harris character is obviously a corrupt rip-off of Popeye Doyle (from ""The French Connection""). Hopeless in some places, while Hawke and a slew of other minor characters save the day in a supporting manner.",Training Day
275,youdontsmellbad,"I wondered what it had to say, and then...",4,14 October 2001,"I saw previews for Training Day and foolishly deduced that it was a film with a message, something about street justice versus legal justice.  That's not the only reason I'd see this kind of movie; it was just my preception. I didn't get what I expected but I did stay through the whole thing.Denzel plays a psychopathic police officer (impersonator in my opinion) ""training"" Ethan on his first day as a rookie narc on his way to becoming a detective.  Along the way Denzel spouts philosophical mumbo jumbo about street justice and about how he's the real cops and not the guys helping old ladies with their groceries, that sounds real good on previews -hey they got my seven dollars fair and square, right?  Unfortunately on the way to possibly becoming something appealing intellectually, it back pedals and turns into an over-the-top action-suspense yarn.In the end I was not satisfied, though I may have been had my expectations not been contrary to the true intentions of the movie.  looking back, the best parts of the movie were probably the ones I enjoyed the least- the silly ones.  Were I watching in a different state of mind this movie might have grown on me.  But don't go out of your way to see it.  There's always cable.",Training Day
276,gbrumburgh-1,Grim but riveting cat-and-mouse cop flick with a flashy central performance by Denzel Washington.,8,30 March 2002,"A total downer from beginning to end, `Training Day' reeks with immoral, unredeemable characters while filling the screen with unavoidable bloodshed. Yet what keeps it from being just another standard tale of urban terror is its sharp, imaginative direction (Antoine Fuqua), an ultra-tense and engaging script, a jaunty pace, and knockout performances by Denzel Washington as an L.A. narc with dirty hands, and Ethan Hawke as his straight rookie partner learning the ropes.Interesting shakeups begin right off the bat as Washington plays a  corrupt black cop and Hawke an honest white one.  Jake Hoyt (Hawke) dreams of elevating his young family's lifestyle.  He's given a plum opportunity when he's placed in the hands of hotshot veteran Alonzo Harris (Washington) for a trial run as a narcotics cop.  Hesitant because of the escalated risk but buoyed by the inevitable raise in pay and respect, Hoyt seizes the moment. If he can pass the muster, he's in. If not, he'll probably end up doling out speeding tickets or pushing papers the rest of his career.  But Hoyt is an action man and  seems up to the daunting task.  He learns quickly on his first day of training that Harris isn't your everyday, by-the-book officer. He's a fearless, arrogant braggart who plays hard ball.  Harris has developed his own survivalist style in bringing in the bad guys.  His methods are underhanded and he only plays for high stakes.  Intimidating, remorseless and just as terrifying as the street gangs he infiltrates, Harris exposes Hoyt to the money laundering and sexual favors, the crooked deals, the set-ups, the frame-ups.  Punk-ass thugs and rapists who turn informants are thrown back into the water as bait for bigger game.  And Harris is lord of it all, preening about his L.A. ghetto like a peacock, proud of the infamous reputation he's made for himself on the streets.  He's an avalanche of cocky confidence and streetwise cleverness out to win every drug game he plays, at any cost, at anybody's expense.Oscar-winner Washington is nothing short of brilliant in a role that completely shoots down the upstanding good guy' screen image he's thus far cultivated.  What remains, however, is that undeniable Washington charm, charisma and quicksilver intelligence.  Ethan Hawke (Oscar-nominated) gives one of the best performances of his young career as a man caught between a badge and a hard place -- trying to fit in without compromising his code of ethics.  How far can he go?  How much can he endure?  His boyishly tough yet vulnerable cop gives the audience something to root for.  The character byplay between the two leads is strong, real, and fascinates as Harris draws Hoyt further into his dark world, playing some dangerous mind games along the way.Ravaged, seamy locations and scary, menacing support characters capture the requisite feeling of urban paranoia and moral decay, and surrounds the film with an almost apocalyptical sense of hopelessness and doom.  Peripheral characters offered by Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg and, particularly, Scott Glenn as an equally distrustful retired cop, add intensity and atmosphere.In no sense of the term is ""Training Day"" an urban action flick.  On the contray, it is a taut, stark, ugly, complex character study that shows off some powerhouse talent.  Those who prefer mindless escapism will probably be turned off by its unrelenting grimness; those who prefer cerebral, realistic character studies will see it as a plus.  Repelling and unforgiving, I only wish the conclusion had been a bit more plausible and less grandiose.  It much too much for the realistic story presented.       
Director Antoine (`Bait,' `The Replacement Killers') Fuqua, who began directing rap music videos for such artists as Coolio and Arrested Development has a promising future, at least in this genre.  It is an assured move into stronger film territory.",Training Day
277,redbirds525,A brilliant piece of work!,9,16 June 2003,"This is one of the most incredible films I've seen in a long time. Denzel Washington made this movie as great as it was. There is not another actor you could have cast in the role of Alonzo. He really stole the show with this film.The thing that is so great about this movie is that you've never seen Denzel Washington play a bad guy. And he does it so damn well!! Ethan Hawke is just as good as the rookie cop Jake Hoyt. But I've unfortunately seen too many bad Ethan Hawke movies (BEFORE SUNRISE, GATTICA)to turn me sour. Cliff Curtis is great in this as well as a gang leader with a heart. IF you want to see another great Cliff Curtis performance, check out BRINGING OUT THE DEAD. The supporting cast is great in this as well. Eva Mendez from 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS is Denzel's wife (hottie), Dr. Dre and the guy that played Redfoot in THE USUAL SUSPECTS are members of Alonzo's unit. Denzel Washington's performance is top-notch. And I don't even think this was his greatest performance. Denzel was superb in REMEMBER THE TITANS and in the Oscar-snubbed THE HURRICANE. I feel the Academy gave the Oscar to Denzel because they know they screwed him twice for REMEMBER THE TITANS (where he was robbed of the best actor award) and THE HURRICANE. Nonetheless, this is still a great crime drama and it's not to be missed.Rating: 9 out of 10.",Training Day

Ethan Hawke too is simply brilliant in expressing the character of a cop on his first day of duty who is initially excited about and ready to follow the rules by the law-book but then gets shocked and subdued by the law bending and even law breaking tactics of Alonzo Harris. As far as the movie movie is concerned it a decent flick expressing corruption in the police force but has been made an affair to remember by Denzel Washington. Truly the best negative performance after Norman Bates(Psycho),Dr. Hannibal Lecter(The Silence of the Lambs),Keyser Soze(The Usual Suspects)and ofcourse after that of Alan Rickman in Robinhood and other movies.

Denzel has won the much coveted OSCAR for himself for the LEADING ROLE after winning it for Best Supporting Role in Glory(1989).   But I have One COMPLAINT : Didn't the Oscar juries notice Denzel Washington for his roles in movies such as Cry Freedom(1987), Malcolm X(1992), Philadelphia(1993), Crimson Tide(1995) and ofcourse ...The Hurricane(1999)? That's where my complaint lies: DENZEL WASHINGTON SHOULD HAVE WON THE ACADEMY AWARD FOR LEADING ROLE LONG TIME AGO.
   Even though he was not nominated for his roles in Philadelphia(1993) and Crimson Tide(1995), his roles in those movies were significant ones. Both the movies were GEM of movies. Actually, my PERSONAL opinion is that BOTH Philadelphia and Crimson Tide should have been nominated in the categories of Best Picture,Best Director(Jonathan Demme/Tony Scott respectively),Best Actor(though Tom Hanks won for Philadelphia),Best Supporting Actor(Washington/Gene Hackman respectively. Gene Hackman has done a great job.)
   Denzel Washington had actually proved from the very beginning that he was here to ACT and not only to ACT, but ACT in very MEANINGFUL roles. And it was clear from the very start of his career when the movie Soldier's Story,A(1984) was nominated for the Best Picture in which he had acted and was only his second movie AND he himself was nominated for the Best Actor for his role in Cry Freedom(1987) which was only his fourth movie for the big screen. Actually by winning it, Denzel has proved that Substance rules over hype-hoopla and favour.This was the reward he was toiling for, for the last fifteen years.Actually, Denzel Washington is an ideal example of a  GREAT FIGHTER/STRUGGLER.
   The IRONY is that after playing the GOOD GUY for all these years, he has won it for the BAD GUY role. Anyway, a role is either an excellent  role or a poor role and not any other thing. Anyway now that he has won the Award, my only wish is that he doesn't rest and works only MORE HARDER in more MEANINGFUL roles. His roles are what attract me towards his performances.

Methods of violence and brutality against criminals unorthodoxed. To be smarter and more cunning than any criminal they fight against is whats become of Washington.Their 24 hour ordeal is action packed thriller with an amazing performance by Washington and truly worthy of an Oscar. His portrayal of a cop gone completely insane with his credibility of being a ""someone"" important and big is truly impressive. There's a unique sense of portrayal of the character from Washington. The scene with the Mexican gangsters is thrilling at the same time this movie gave a feel of realism in connection to the present world.Denzel stepping out of his usual goodie good role at the same time playing it with intensity and command.

He took on a role that I had never see him try before and gave such a multilayered performance that I was riveted to the screen throughout the entire movie. You never knew exactly what was Alonzo Harris' true motivation in his actions towards Jake Hoyt(Ethan Hawke)until the final act, and it takes superb acting to pull that off with the sincerity and believability that Denzel did. Ethan Hawke does a good turn here also as the rookie cop Hoyt who struggles throughout the movie with the apparent ""realities"" of narcotics investigation offered up to him by Alonzo. Just how much ""dirt"" is Hoyt willing to take on without becoming untrue to his ideals?I never judge a movie by how ""original"" the story is. ""Being John Malkovich"" was hailed as an ""original"" story, yet I found it only mildly interesting. If Training Day has been ""done"" before, I can't recall seeing it. I judge movies by how well they tell the story that they are telling. This one is told quite well. The characters were interesting, the plot moves along quite smoothly, the visuals really portray the gritty, harsh reality of the LA ghetto.All in all, I found this to be a very worthwhile experience and would recommend it to anyone.I gave it an 8/10.P.S.:I wonder if the writers of FX's The Shield watched Training Day before writing the character of Det.

You can feel his apprehension, disbelief and disgust, yet also his sense of purpose. He's easy to identify with, tough outside, even tougher inside, and simply believable. His transition from ""sheep to wolf"" is both logical and fascinating. 
Denzel in contrast starts out at full volume and stays there.  Even his death sequences - two of them! - are too long.

He's one of those actors who is so good in his supporting roles that he often gets overlooked. From the first time I saw him in Dead poets, I've been following his career and in Training day I thought Hawke gave the performance of his life. This is a fantastic gritty suspenseful story that is so refreshing in the face of all the bubble gum thrillers out there that just want numbers at the box office. This movie proves that you can have both realism and popularity in the same reel. Whatever minor flaws this movie had was more than made up for by the palpable screen chemistry between these praiseworthy actors who took the viewer on a roller coaster ride with the sticky plot, thorough script and various unexpected twists and turns.

It wasn't until near the end that he started to become tiresome.  This movie just adds to the huge resume of Denzel that shows his versatility to play so many different characters.  It is unbelievable that he is the same guy who played in The Hurricane and Remember the Titans.  This guy can act, and this movie is no exception.Ethan Hawke did an excellent job as well, but Denzel is who made this movie so good.  Together though, they were superb!My only gripe about this movie is that everything happens in one day. Jake (Hawke) meets with Alonzo (Washington) one morning on a ""training day"" to see if Jake is cut out to handle his new job as an undercover narcotics officer.  Jake has a laid back, shy and almost sheltered personality while Alonzo is completely over the top and in your face.  The things that happen in this one day are things that probably wouldn't happen in an entire career for most people.  However it is Hollywood, so what do ya expect?
Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the movie.  There were many scenes which made you laugh, others which made you say wow, and then there were the ones which made you say ""yea right"".  However, even my girlfriend (who was expecting it to totally bomb) said she enjoyed it.For a cop movie, it is very original and realistic in that it takes place right in L.A., no fabricated neighborhoods were used here.  However, it does start to stray from the realistic aspect as the movie draws on, which is why I only gave it a 9 out of 10.  But if you can get by that, then you'll really like this movie.",Training Day
287,mchollandmatthew,brilliant movie,10,8 August 2012,this movie is brilliant from start to finish with amazing acting and story.Denzel Washington was brilliant throughout with Ethan hawk eye loved the story as well defiantly a must see the story is about a rookie cop who moves to la to stop crime with a veteran cop to stop crime to get her and the veteran cop is giving him a training day to see how good he can really be for a rookie cop its like an hour or 2 hours long I'm not sure but this is probably one of the best films i have ever seen in my whole life its £3 at blockbuster in Kilmarnock i suggest u should go get it some time its a brilliant crime drama and thriller also the story's good acting amazing and scenes are good 10/10 defiantly go buy this,Training Day
288,Farzad-Doosti,You Wanna Go To Jail Or You Wanna Go Home?,8,29 October 2021,"No actor other than Denzel in this film could play this role so well

289,MrTomCherry,"This Sh*t's Chess, It Ain't Checkers",9,24 September 2019,"Training day is a crime thriller film following two LAPD narcotics officers over a 12-hour period in the gang-ridden neighborhoods of LA.This movie is a crime masterpiece. An outright 10. It is entertaining from the beginning to the end. The plot of the movie unfolds nicely and has a satisfying ending, the action/shooting sequences are amazing, but, in my opinion, the best part of this movie is the character of Alonzo Harris played by Denzel Washington. Alonzo is a long-time LAPD cnarcotics detective who is ruthless, corrupt but nonetheless extremely cool. The amazing performance brought Denzel Washington an Oscar. I highly recommend this movie to everyone even if it's not the genre you typically watch. Maybe it'll change your mind.",Training Day
290,dynagirl,"Nice looking, well directed GARBAGE",2,4 April 2002,"If, like me, you passed up Training Day in the theater because youthought it looked stupid, but after Denzel Washington won the BestActor Oscar, you thought about renting it because, you know,maybe it's not so bad, then DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE!I'm by no means a movie snob. I can appreciate a nice, slick,Hollywood film. But Training Day is the epitome of bad scripting.The characters are painfully cliched and the story is completelyunbelievable--the movie is just plain awful... painfully awful. As forDenzel Washington's character, well, think John Travolta in BrokenArrow.",Training Day
291,spazierganger,"Great acting, pretty good story",7,13 October 2001,"""Training Day"" is a film which features great acting by the two leads, and a story that's very good, until it slips a bit at the end. Denzel Washington plays a corrupt, veteran narcotics cop who's training Ethan Hawke, a young cop hoping for a spot on the unit. Both of the leads, especially Washington, are great. Washington's portrayal of Alonzo Harris will, I think, end up being one of the best, if not THE best, performance of the year. Definitely Oscar-quality material. And Ethan Hawke more than holds his own. Washington has been getting more praise, probably deservedly so, but Hawke does a great job playing Jake Hoyt, totally the opposite of Alonzo, thus making Denzel's performance stand out even more. Aside from those two, there really aren't any big parts, just lots of little ones. Most of those are good as well. Surprisingly, Macy Gray and Snoop Dogg do nice jobs in their brief appearances.Antoine Fuqua does a good job directing, which is a bit of a surprise, considering that his previous work isn't really worth mentioning. I didn't know he had it in him. His directing isn't quite as good as the acting, but he does keep things moving nicely and does a good job of building up tension as the film goes on.The script, written by David Ayer, is the only complaint I have. ""Training Day"" starts off with a great deal of promise, but then loses it a bit at the end. At the beginning, Alonzo doesn't come across as a horrible person. He makes some interesting statements that could make you think, and he has decent reasons for what he does. He doesn't always follow the laws, but he can make you understand why he breaks them. But by the end, he's a completely corrupt, totally evil villain. And then the film is no longer about these choices that he makes, but about Hawke trying to stop a madman. Don't get me wrong, the ending is still exciting and fun to watch, but I was a bit disappointed to see the film abandon the moral complexities that it hinted at earlier. But, with the acting, it's still a very thrilling film, even at the end. Washington and Hawke could have been fishing, and I still would have been on the edge of my seat. So despite my minor issues with the story, the quality of the performances is more than enough for me to recommend ""Training Day.""Rating: 8/10",Training Day
292,tcdarkness,Training Day takes you to hell,8,20 May 2002,"The script, direction, and acting go from superb to almost over the top at times to make the characters too good, too evil, and too dark.  Denzel Washington's performance is much like that.  At times, he is a believable bad guy, at others, he's just the type of guy who makes you think if even Hitler had kinder elements to him.  It's difficult to tell if that makes the film better or worse.  Personally, I don't think it made it better.  It made it just a tad bit less believable.  But in a way, that is necessary to show the badness of the streets and the ghetto/barrio neighborhoods that Ethan Hawke is left in to fend for himself. There is a deleted scene on the DVD that would have, in my opinion, made Denzel seem more human.  I would have liked it in the film and cut some of that ""King Kong"" monologue near the end to make him a more tragic figure at the end.  > 8/10",Training Day
293,LARRYLOVE711,THE DENZ STRIKES AGAIN!!****SPOILER INCLUDED****,8,25 February 2002,"Denzel pulled out all the stops! My favorite line,""King Kong ain't got nothing on me!""Denzel (Alonzo = Zo) smoldered all the way through, even through the contrived ""we're tired of being creative anymore so let's just finish the script"" ending. Ethan showed what he is about as an actor also. Both should win in their categories at the oscars, but Denz for sure.A great movie that left a great taste in my motuh, despite the conclusion.

294,toffeesi,VERY ENJOYABLE!,8,15 April 2003,"Having heard good things about this film, it did take me a while to actually rent it, but it was worth the wait.Although I had been told it was a good film I knew nothing about it apart from Denzel Washingotn and Ethan Hawke was in it!!From the start I got a very Seven/Bad Boys feel, the camera work and things just gave me that type of feeling.....sorry very boring that bit.I got straight i to Denzel Washingtons charater and thought, here is a man who knows his stuff!!The rookie cop with his wet nose stright from the academy wanting to prove himself and basically feeling a bit out of his depth!!I thought ok I see where we are going here, and then off we go downa road I was not expecting!!......THEN POW, it clicks, and I sat there and thought ok....was not expecting that!!.....but I do feel that the build up is let down by the ending, but there you goSo without too many spoilers, I really enjoyed this film, not for the comedy or the action, but for its uncertainty, its mistrust and lies!!Rate this 7/10",Training Day
295,mjoyceh,great performance by Denzel,8,6 March 2021,"I usually do not like this type of film: too much violence. But Denzel Washington's performance is so terrific, I could not stop watching. He was completely mesmerizing. After seeing the film, I looked it up and found out this performance had won him a Best Actor Oscar. If ever an award was deserved, this one was.Denzel's performance deserves rating of 10, the rest of the film a 7, so I compromised by giving this film an overall rating of 8.",Training Day
296,mrsknoll,An amazing rush,10,22 March 2002,"I was not expecting to like this movie.  I'm not for blow-it-up, shoot-em-up or blood-n-guts movies, so I anticipated being mildly amused at best. However, I could not pull myself away from the screen.  Unfortunately, I waited until the DVD came out to watch it and missed out on the big screen action.  The characterization and acting of both Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington were phenomonal.  Denzel is an extremely talented actor, but he blew me away in Training Day.  He WAS Alonzo Harris.  He drew me into this movie so deeply that my heart was racing and I was on the edge of the couch. Both these extraordinary actors are nominated for Academy Awards and they definately deserve them.  This movie was about truth and the search for ""justice"" - street or otherwise.  I was astounded by the directing but more so by the script.  It is an amazing script.  I can't stop raving about this movie!  Training Day will now be added to my list of all-time favorite movies - I recommend this to everyone, especially on DVD for the deleted scenes and alternate ending.",Training Day

298,RayKarago,King Kong ain't got sh*t on this movie !!!,7,15 April 2015,"One thing I will say about this film is that it has some of the best one liners ever put on film. I would say that you would have to watch this film for the one liners that Alonzo (Played by Denzel Washington) spills.The film as itself is a lot of fun but it still has some flaws. Overall praise has to go to Denzel Washington, who is loving every minute of his performance as the villain. He does all the villain clichés, smiling, laughing and ranting, things you just love to see villains do. However, they don't just make him bad, the brilliant writing also makes him a complex character, giving a twisted morale compass. You actually question his sanity because, despite all the evil things he does, he actually thinks he is doing the right thing, its performances like this that remind me why Denzel Washington is my favorite actor and can do almost no wrong.The film also does well at setting atmosphere, you really get a sense of these places in fact I even read that they had filmed in areas such as Compton. The appearances by Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg were awesome and well place and I loved the Latino gangsters that Hoyte has to face at the end of the film, one of them played by Cliff Cirtus who I believe can play any ethnic group.However, I do have one issue with the film and that is its secondary character, Hoyte, played by Ethan Hawke. Don't get me wrong, I will take nothing away from Hawke's performance but they made the character of Hoyte so bland and predictable, the goody goody, always does right and I know thats what they were going for but they could have made him more interesting, maybe he is tempted by Alonzo and almost turns to the dark side or at the end of the film, something to make him more complex, particularly after all he has gone through.Overall, if you like cop/crime thrillers then you will definitely enjoy this, if you want something with a lot of depth this may not be for you but hey, watch and make your own conclusion.",Training Day
299,Illusia,True to the streets,8,23 March 2002,"I waited to see this film until it came out on video. Having watched the dvd, I see why Denzel is being touted for Best Actor at the Oscars. If he didn't win it before, he should take it home for this role. I can't recall ever seeing him play a bad guy before, but I really loved it. This movie was gritty, realistic, and true to form. I loved it. If you know anyone in law enforcement, watch this with them, and see if they don't know someone like Alonzo.",Training Day
300,sundance14,Mail the Oscar to Densel and hang on for a explosive movie,8,6 October 2001,"Densel Washington in his most powerful role ever and true to the bone like none since Glory is what you get at Training Day. One finds oneself torn by his character with a full emotional spectrum from admire to loath. In the end the matter is rather well set but the movie is Washington and I can't think of a current actor who could come close to pulling off the performance he did.Not that the rest of the cast isn't crisp and professional, but they look pretty dull in a straight comparison to Washington.The story is street hard and may not sit too well with the weak of spine types but it is coldly real  even though the ending is a bit over done for my taste. I wonder how many wolves there really are in say Houston PD where I live?  Or maybe I wouldn't want to know after all. The best this year so far.",Training Day
301,hanvl,Great Denzel Washington,8,17 March 2011,"Young, inexperienced naive cop (Ethan Hawke) was transferred in special narcotic department of quite famous and tough cop Alonso (Denzel Washington). Has one try out day in which Alonso should see if he is good enough to enter his team. As the day continues he begins to see that Alonso is quite different form how cop should be and that he not only bend the rules but thrown them all together. But worse thinks will come. This experience is going to change him forever. Story of his film is very good, and a few times I was really surprised by what happened. Acting is good but everyone pales in contrast to Washington who in the role of baddie is great. I think he should play bad characters more often, this one really suited him.",Training Day
302,derekdiercksmeier,Smiles And Cries.,9,12 November 2012,"Antoine Fuqua Is A Very Talented Filmmaker And ""Training Day"" Is His Finest Film. Ethan Hawke Plays A Rookie Cop Who Is Training To Be A Narcotics Officer In The LAPD And Denzel Washington Co-Stars As The Highly-Decorated Officer Assigned To Train Him. First Of All, The Two Leads Are Absolutely Fantastic. Hawke Delivers The Best Performance Of His Career As Jake Hoyt. As Rookie Hoyt, Ethan Hawke Is Never Stiff Or Inauthentic. Washington Is Amazing In The Role Of Detective Sergeant Alonzo Harris. Denzel Washington Practices Total Role Immersion In This Film And After A While You Forget You're Watching A Movie Star And Just Get Lost In His Brilliant Performance. The Film Is Shot In Such A Gritty And Compelling Way Which Lends The Film Such Gravity And Realism. David Ayer's Script Is Intelligent, Taut, And Totally Fearless. As Good As The Script May Be, The Performances Of Hwake And Washington Elevate The Film To Riveting Heights. Everyone Knows That Denzel Washington Is A Great Actor, He Won The Academy Award For This Role, But Anyone Who Doubts The Talents Of Ethan Hawke Will Be Stunned By The Great Performance That He Delivers In This Film. The Story Is Compelling, Even If The Ending Is Less Than Satisfying.

303,obispo2000,One of the best crime films ever,10,14 September 2018,"It is a film I watched at least ten times. I think, it does not need further explanation. 
Outstanding acting of the giant of the cinema, Denzel Washington, and also outstanding acting of all the other actors, even in minor roles (I apologise to not to mention all of them by name for lack of space). A very well written plot, tense and suspenseful, unpredictable at times even for film afficionados, and much enjoyable. Beautifully photographed, it should be teached in film schools. The first image, the rising Sun is unforgettable. The scene in the latino quartier is also remarkable. Noel Guglielmo and his camarades are so authentic. 
It is a contemporary classic, and shouldn't be missed at any price. You'll enjoy it the fifth time as well, I'm sure.",Training Day

Denzel Washington is beyond a great actor. In my opinion, after watching this film, he is among the top two or three of his generation. If Glory introduced him to the masses, Training Day should cement his place in film history. Very few actors have the ability to be effective as both the hero and the villain. Kevin Spacey, Robert DeNiro, and Robert Duval come to mind also. Denzel was the perfect villian for this film. The atmosphere of this film is very gritty and realistic. Still, it does not move slowly, and every little vignette in the story seems pertinent at the end. The only flaw with this film might be that it was supposedly supposed to mirror the life of a rogue LAPD narcotics officer. Maybe it was a little too dramatic in the end, but again it was well worth my time and energy to see this film. 8.8/10",Training Day

The strong point of the movie is the acting, with a remarkable Hawke, who i say he should have won the Oscar, and the very best in the past year, Washington, who gives an amazing performance as Alonzo, who you may like or hate, neverthless always seems to be competely right of what he's doing,it's up to the viewer to decide in which side of the law he is. But, the story isn't good enough to match the acting... anyway i loved it from the beggining to the end. Hate/Like Alonzo, Love Washington",Training Day
307,imdbfilmcricket,"Dismal mess, but Denzel is good",2,8 October 2002,"Denzel Washington's performance is the only good thing in this celluloid disaster.  Training Day is the story of an idealistic young cop (Ethan Hawke) on his first day working narcotics.  Everyone behaves badly, to a greater or lesser extent, and the tone is depressively nihilistic.  I hope we're not supposed to infer that this is in any way reflective of reality. 
Denzel is a fine actor (and a fine looking young man) and I would not begrudge him the Oscar he won for this, but I prefer to see him in better vehicles than this clunker.",Training Day
308,JackRice100,Enthralling story with remarkable performances,9,20 November 2014,"This film follows Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) on his 'Training Day' with Det. Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) Jake has 24 hours to show Alonzo he has what it takes to do whats necessary to get the job done. But Alonzo's methods are questionable and sometimes illegal. This film was amazing. The acting was fantastic, to watch this straight arrow cop have to do things every bone in his body is telling him not to, was completely enthralling. At times Ethan's performance reminded me Bryan Cranston in Breaking Bad just the way he carried and handled himself in certain situations was superb. High praise indeed from me. Denzel Washington gives an Oscar worthy performance. To see somebody switch from borderline criminal to genuinely caring mentor and leader, was simply incredible. The story has twists right to the very end and what makes this film so special and separates the good films from the great. Is that you understand what Ethan's going through, how he sees Denzel's character, how he's conflicted between knowing whats right and what he wants. This is due to the marvellous work of Director Antoine Fuqua, the acting of the two lead roles and the script! The script was sensational it really was, it was dark and gritty throughout keeping a harsh realistic aspect to it. The cinematography was great, some of the shots of the gang driven streets of LA were beautifully done. Overall I loved this film and thought it was done incredibly well with outstanding acting, script that was directed really well. A 9/10 from me.",Training Day
309,mreisman,More plot holes than bullet holes,6,23 February 2003,"I'm not really sure what the point of this movie was, other than to look cool and to give Denzel a badass persona with which to chew the scenery. The characters make reference to the ""chess game"" going on between them, but it's really a game of kick the can.  They only manage to keep it moving forward one hour, at which point it just could becomes a big checkers endgame, full of black-leather gold-chain-danglin' fury, signifying nothing. This movie pistol whips you with countless racial stereotypes, and F's you up with an anticlimactic, silly ending that would be satisfying only after a hit of PCP-laced dope.  The friends who recommended this to me ought get their own special brand of ""street justice"".  Garbage.",Training Day
310,prezike,"""The realness"" indeed",8,11 November 2001,"We've all seen the corrupt cop flick done before, and done well.  But it is not so often that we get much more than the standard good cop/bad cop affair.  Training Day often goes beyond the limits of Hollywood with its careful dissection of the moral and ethical dilemma cops face when dealing with ""the streets"" while still remaining a Hollywood flick.What works so well is the combination of faced paced drama that we and our Rookie cop, Ethan Hawke, are thrown into and the intellectual debate that rages today over ""the streets"" and ""what to do about it.""  Hawke's ethics relate closely to that of MLK while Washington takes more of Malcom X's position (fittingly so). Denzel's character may be corrupt now, but the film hints at a change from earlier views, almost as if ""the streets"" showed him that there was no other way of functioning as an effective Narc.  Understanding the value of being ""real,"" he believes to be most important in getting things done.  A ""naive, wanna save the world"" rookie cop, in his mind, ain't gonna cut it out there. And he tries to get Hawke's character to understand his views.  But while this is happening we are then shown how by being so closely related to ""the streets,"" and even living there, what it has done to him. 
Who is more right in dealing with ""the streets,"" Hawke or Washington? 
There we have the foundation for the story.We are pretty much thrown into Ethan Hawke's position of constant wonderment of Washington's character.  And for the most part it works.  Is this how things get done?  Can one be a ""good"" cop and be effective?  Is there no hope for the victims of the situation?        And the dilemma plays on to a fast beat.  Very good stuff.The only surprise was where was all of the hip-hop music from the soundtrack?  the moody score was effective, but they could have added more than one or two tracks from the soundtrack.",Training Day

The script is pretty good, but it has two major problems.  The films these-types-of-cases-can't-go-to-court-type ending really cheapens the rest of the film.  And then there is the vice that really gets Denzel Washington's character in trouble ... it just does not jive.  Like Snoop Dogg smelling the scent of rookie cop on Ethan Hawke, Mr. Washington's vice smells of plot device (as opposed to character).  Now, sure, lot's of films make this mistake but what makes it so grating here is that the film would have been really good without it.  You see, Mr. Washington's character simply is too smart for this vice to be a character flaw.  It just does not work, and with the easy out ending, it cheapens the whole effect of Denzel Washington, Ethan Hawke, and Anton Fuqua's work.

Somehow, watching Training Day two days after the horrors of September 11th made my heart and stomach that much more sensitive to violence.  But Denzel Washington IS as good as ever. Ethan Hawke is strong in the boy-scout role.  The script is cleverly manipulative and the direction is great.  I even thought Macy Gray and Snoop Dogg hit the right note.  It just felt like a finely executed streak of violence.  Accurate?  Maybe.  But not exactly the kind of film I was in the mood for.  Too many bullets in the chest, not enough redemption.

Most bad reviews I've read talk about how unrealistic it is and how a cop, especially a black cop, wouldn't be as crooked as Alonzo (Denzel Washington) is in the film, but that's where they are wrong. There are cops like Alonzo who really do the things he does and this movie does a great job at showing that.Aside from that, the movie is great.

The two main leads (Washington and Hawke) are excellent in there portrayal of there characters, Hawke a fresh faced rookie trying to work his way to detective and Washington as the narcissistic experienced narc.The film unfolds over the space of one day and although questionable that so much could happen in a day you have only to watch th t.v series 24 to see what Hollywood considers plausible. The acting aside the story is well presented and lets us know a little bit at a time, in between showing us the discussions between Washington and Hawke as they drive around L.A, these vignettes are extremely involving as Washingtons character changes from Mr nice guy to bad guy so quickly that u never no how he is going to act.It is questionable whether Washington deserved an Oscar for this as it is not his best film, but i say it is about time he got one for he has had to wait so long, and if it means that this film has been bought to more peoples attention because of it then i salute the panel for giving it to him, man on fire should have swept the whole lot, lol!!",Training Day

I felt like there were some unnecessary close ups on the fantastic portraits. On the other hand, the balanced cinematography was suitable for each scene. To Add, the title had apprpopiate music for the street theme film, for example electronic and rap smash hits. The soundtrack was played when needed. In addition, the storyline explored youth gang coulture and corruption in communities but it could of dug into a massive picture on the criminal subject matter.

It's not a very deep movie and glosses over a lot of its issues and themes to the point that I missed them originally. Maybe I was expecting too much from this 'dark and gritty' police drama..It looks to be a simple story of morales. Nothing to do with law. Just about egos and mainly noting that a criminal is still a criminal with or without a badge. Ethan's character's turmoil seems to be more that he keeps hoping that Denzel's character will eventually show him something through his unorthodox teaching 'methods'. Instead he simply learns what not to do and that he doesn't believe in Denzel.That's all. The ac tings OK, and the direction competent.

For me, that says a lot (just read some of my other recent reviews). And isn't being entertained what counts?Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington are both superb in their roles, and are instantly beleivable as the naive beat cop and the veteran narcotics detective. Hawke questions Washington's over-the-line methods at every turn, only to be faced with the effectiveness of those methods. With so many recent headlines referencing scandal and internal investigations of police forces across the country, this film is relevant, and carries a gritty realism that left an impression in my mind.Definately not an action summer blockbuster, but too good to be passed up...",Training Day
321,mifamily6,Deserves more than what it's currently getting,9,16 December 2001,"Right now, Training Day has a rating of 7.2/10.I, and many others I'm sure, will strongly disagree with that.  A 7.2?  A seven decimal point two?  That number does no justice to the film.  No, no, no!  Get some more people to go to imdb.com and bring this number up.  I thought the movie was great.  Yes, Denzel was at his usual best but Ethan Hawke stole the show in my book.  Considering his previous movies where he played characters who would have been better portrayed sleeping than speaking (Hamlet, Snow Falling on Cedars, movies I didn't want to see in the first place), Ethan Hawke did a wonderful job as the moral guy.  I have a greater respect for him now.  And let's not forget Denzel.  I'm surprised he doesn't have half a dozen Oscars.  But what does the Academy know anyway? If they know anything (which they don't) Training Day will be nominated for Best Picture, ActorS (plural, for both Denzel and Ethan, who should at least get a supporting actor nom), screenplay, and director.  That's right. Antione Faqua really showed what he's made of with this film, as opposed to Bait which wasn't so good.  I really liked it.10/10",Training Day
322,peyespy007,pretty ridiculous,4,16 February 2019,"I use to like this movie but I honestly can't stand it now. Too many cliche scenes, over the top cartoon like characters (like comic book villains like in baby driver) also undeveloped as well. The part that was most annoying (and it wasn't Denzel overacting) it was the mexican gang scene. How many times can Ese, Holmes, Homies, vato, and then another ten more Ese's be really that necessary. This was suppose to be a serious movie? hmmm. Not even close.The idea of this movie was interesting but terribly done. One dimensional boring or unlikeable characters and violence, cussing, and a few ""gangster"" scenes. There are much better movies of this genre thats thought provoking and doesn't come off cheesy and unrealistic. I highly recommend HARSH TIMES. Its not a good coop bad cop movie but its a very well done film about two friends who are the opposite when they grow into men and have different goals and problems. Christian Bale is outstanding in it too and unlike training day, harsh times has real gut emotions and believable scenes. Also even the unlikeable character has some depth and humanity and we get to see different sides to them unlike Training day where alonzo was awful from start to finish just a bad guy no real relatable traits. I give Training Day a 4/10. Denzel and ethan are amazing actors but i thought the script was bad and made no sense. The story is moronic and the characters are caricatures. Stinker.

324,dreenphlanger,Lost in inconsistency,5,11 October 2016,"This movie started with telling one story, but ended telling some completely different. And it wasn't due to the plot, but due to the inconsistency.The idea itself is nothing new; nowadays we all know many stories about the crime on the streets and how the cops are trying to handle that problem. But at some point, almost abruptly, the story went to some other direction, adversely changing the pace of the movie.The choices and motives of the main protagonists are blurred and unclear, and the movie didn't offer a reasonable explanation for some of their rather radical actions. Even though the acting and the role assignment are more than good, the overall character development is rather poor, giving the impression that the movie is just too short for this story.All in all, this movie is nothing special due to a shallow realization and isn't really worth the time.

Denzel's character marches over the line with such incredible abandon that from early on in the film all sense of realism is lost.  Ethan Hawke does a pretty good job of playing the rookie dazed by the events of his Training Day, but even he can't rescue this script.  I'm surprised that Denzel got an oscar for this because his portrayal is so over the top, although I can't say he doesn't deserve it for his overall body of work.  This film does ask some serious questions, but in such a loaded way that the answer is never really in any doubt.  The ending is just laughable, but at least its the ending.",Training Day

Certainly the performances and cinematography are top shelf, the movie is well paced, and individual scenes are very well scripted. But then you start to notice everything seems to be taking place in the kitchen. There's a phone call in the kitchen, breakfast in a kitchen, money in the kitchen, a mistress cooking Salvadoran style in the kitchen, a poker hand and the Mexican mafia hanging in the kitchen, and the movie nearly ends during a shootout in the kitchen. Certainly the LA Kitchen genre has been played to death!My biggest problem with this film is that the underlying premise makes no sense. Alanzo doesn't need the rookie cop to take the fall for anything, and even if he did he risks both the Rookie's life and the possibility of him not being lured into Alanzo's world way too much during ""The Training Day"". It is unrealistic too to think that even though Alanzo has just gotten in trouble in Vegas he could set up a transfer of a trainee to fill the role of..., the role of,...well I'm not sure what role he is supposed to fill. Renegade newbie who shouldn't have shot Scott Glen and then was killed mysteriously in east LA, allowing Alanzo to skate? If you think back, or try to outline some resolution other than Hawk escaping,  I am sure you will get my point.Something is definitely cooking in this film, but despite all the spice, it is really lacking a fundamental principle.

In this film, the development of all plots is gradual, and at the end, the audience finds that there is so much difference from the beginning.""Power leads to corruption, and absolute power leads to absolute corruption."" Acton's famous saying is straightforward. Alonzo used the humanity rules he understood to pyramid the justification of attacking poison with poison, and used the means of walking on the edge of the law to express the greed of humanity so ""reasonable and reasonable"".

333,RawkStah,"Bad, bad, bad.",1,4 October 2001,"I have never walked out of a movie before.  I don't intend to start doing so.  But, man alive, did this flick try my patience.Training Day is about Jake Hoyt (Hawke)'s first day in training to be a narc.  His mentor' is Alonzo Harris (Washington), a veteran of the LAPD narcotics beat.  Now, Hoyt isn't a true rookie  he's been a cop for over a year, but he wants to be a detective.  One good way to become one is by training in narcotics.  Alonzo has been on this beat for years, and is considered one of the best.  What better training ground could there be? During his day of training, Hoyt learns to disregard the 4th Amendment, lie, use drugs, and all sorts of other things a good cop shouldn't do.Now, there is some validity to having an undercover cop or narc be familiar with the quality of drugs, but they must also remain above the culture. Donnie Brasco and Rush both showed this very well.  Training Day does not.I have a host of complaints about this movie.  I'm going to address them in no particular order.1) The story made no sense at all.  It starts off fine  Alonzo is a typical hard-nosed narc with little to no patience with a rookie who wants to be a do-gooder.  The street has no patience for those types.  Ok  I'll buy that. But then, all of a sudden, we're in the middle of a mystery, and we have no idea where it started or what the details are.  We know that Russians are involved, and some other guy, and then all of a sudden we make a bust that makes even less sense, and then, the movie doesn't end.  It keeps going, adding new subplots, and don't even think that any of these are going to be resolved at the end.  And then the movie is over.2) Alonzo is not likable.  Yes, he's a tough cop.  Yes, he uses methods that aren't exactly legal.  But Washington gives the audience nothing about his character to like.  We grew to like Sgt. Hartman in Full Metal Jacket.  We liked Darth Vader.  We saw the humanity in those characters.  Washington is a very good actor, and has the awards to prove it.  I don't know if it was the way the character was written or what, but we are given nothing about Alonzo to like.  We aren't allowed to see his humanity.3) The pacing is terrible.  This movie went on and on and on, and just kept going after it had stopped making sense.  Now, this, I don't understand. Fuqua started off directing music videos (This is not a bad thing  David Fincher, who directed Se7en and Fight Club started out the same way.  As did Spike Jonze, who made Being John Malkovich.).  He should understand pacing. He directed The Replacement Killers, which starred Chow Yun-Fat and Mira Sorvino  he can obviously work with actors.  So, I'm not sure what happened.  Perhaps the editor should be canned.  Or the writer.  Someone, anyway.I'm done making my list.  There are just too many things to go into with this movie.  I'm not about to write a spoiler for those of you who still insist on seeing this movie, but I will advise you to reconsider.  There are plenty of other movies opening this week.I'd go into more detail, but, this movie was so frustrating that it made my brain hurt.",Training Day

The performances are uniformly excellent, particularly by Denzel Washington in a well deserved Oscar winning performance. Give Ethan Hawke some love as well as he really stood his own with the titan Denzel. I won't divulge too much of the plot, as you can simply read the description. However, my only problem with this movie, and I've seen it twice now, is in a crucial part of story execution.

Denzel Washington's character is just despicable; there's nothing likable about it.

These 2 characters seem to have separate personalities or I can call it the relationship between bad cop and good cop, but somehow the chemistry that is given is very unified and seems inseparable.The story is actually quite simple, but the complexity of what each character experiences makes it very interesting. The story is told quite slowly, but each scene has an important meaning in the story. The character development is very good, especially the hoyt character (Ethan Hawke), from scene to scene, the character grows even though it only takes one day's setting. Also, I like the last 45 minutes, these 2 characters seem like they have separate views and opinions and the atmosphere becomes more tense.

The film makes a weak gesture at introducing an interesting moral dilemma: is it possible to fight the evil of drug-dealing while holding onto one's own sense of morality?  But ultimately, it has nothing complex or thoughtful to say about that dilemma.  The best performance in the film is actually Ethan Hawke's, a character torn by conflicting impulses. Hawke does a fine job of conveying that inner turmoil. Washington's performance is mostly just showing off, but then his character is largely a cartoon character.  The Oscar is a make-up for other better performances that have gone unrewarded.And isn't it enlightening that all of the film's people of color are despicable drug dealer or corrupt cops while the film's conscience is the white cop?I was generous; I rated the movie a 3.",Training Day

Denzel Washington gave a strong performance as usual but I think for the very first time in his career played a negative African - American role. Ethan Hawke was surprisingly great at his role although his role did not have much of affection to show just many physical action. you may think if the performances were good then how come you did not like it ! Answer to that question is simple , it takes more than just big names or good performances to make a movie that everybody can connect to. the most important element is the story. unfortunately the story of the Training day was kind of childish, very unreal and raw! the writers had to cook the story more and answer basic questions on the minds of the audience about the sequences of the movie. for example we never realized who were those Latino guys ? who was Eva Mendez , a girl Washington sleeps with , a whore or his wife ? why didn't anybody help Washington in the neighborhood? The biggest turn off for me was the scene where Hawke shot Washington! it was so unreal! first of all , in real life LAPD guys are trained to shoot and they don't flirt with the suspect just like Hawke did with Washington , they count to 3 or maximum of 5 and then boom they shoot! they don't wait for your bullshit ! second of all , in real life and in an African - American neighborhood no White has the balls to stand with a gun in his hand shooting another African American while he does not have ANYTHING to show that he is a cop! Another questionable scene was at the same moment , when Hawke was going away with the money , Washington who was shot in the butt was jumping up and down ! who on earth can even stand with a bullet in his butt ???? Or how strong a very average and kind of slim man like Hawke can be to survive all that punches he got from Washington , jumping down from a building and still being the tough guy and standing on his feet and giving the bad guy to justice !

Is it because of  the controversy around Washington's Oscar glory? This film is one of the best cop movies since 'Heat'.  Gripping, exciting, and violent.  Quite superb in parts.Hawke plays a 'rookie' cop, (and I use that term lightly) who is being trained by Washington to work the drug filled streets of LA.  What Hawke is exposed to is the highly corrupt world that is LA's (and even America's) police force.  The story concentrates on how Hawke deals with it - a coming-of-age, writes-of-passage drama in one sense, in which Hawke's innocence is lost.  There is only a thin red line between the police and the bad guy - a simple police badge.  Hawke's character remains a glimmer of hope for the system.  All the performances are superb.  Washington at times is chilling, Hawke is brilliant as a terrified cop who grows stronger throughout the film.

And then we just get a straight up black vs. white (racially and idealogically) battle of good cop against hopelessly corrupt cop who has to be taken down.  I was expecting to have my views of justice challenged only to have them confirmed in an annoyingly simple manner.  Sure, the film was skillfully crafted.  The performances were great (though I still think Tom Wilkinson was robbed considering his great performance in ""In the Bedroom"" and the fact that Denzel seems to be having a ball hamming it up in this part having done MUCH better work in earlier films), the direction energetic and the overall production was very solid and effectively gritty.

It is not the first movie about bad cops doing bad things and getting punished. It's not the first movie about black & white cops either. Let's hope it will be the last.There is nothing to say about the acting. Both Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke are playing very well, but the movie never really kicks off and the end is predictable. The movie compensates its poor scenario by a wave of violence and insults. If the US are really like that then it is difficult to understand why anybody would like to immigrate over there. What comes out of the movie is not so much the fact that the nice cop wins but more how poor and miserable the US are. Indeed, not only is the movie showing drugs, violence, alcohol, etc. but it also reveals that 99.9% of Americans are only interested in money. I guess the 'happy end' part shows that there is 0.1% that are above corruption and bribery.A dead boring violent movie that is best to avoid unless you are into this kind of low level scenario.",Training Day

There are a couple plot holes and you have to watch and listen carefully to understand everything that' going on, but it's well written with a couple of clever twists in between.

He is spending his training day (no complexity in the title) following the leader about on his ""average"" daily duties. Ethan Hawk plays the new guy who is all dreams and ideals, Denzel Washington plays the hardened street cop who is all realism and street vibes. If he were retiring in a week the cliché would be complete.We learn very early on that the only way to police the street is to become the street. Essentially by being less of a cop, and more like a teacher to the hoods and gangsters. While you may take them out for selling drugs to kids, stealing from the rich to feed you family is ok. Why break up a rape in progress when all you are going to get is a lot of paper work at the end of the day? Slowly Washington removes hawks' ideals, breaking him down to be one of the team. This starts with hawk being tricked into smoking a PCP laced joint, which inevitably leads him on a downwards spiral as things get more and more surreal throughout the day.The story is nothing particularly new. There is the buddy element, the cop turned crook element and the will he/won't he element of doing the right thing. The script has already dictated who should come out on top by navigating your sympathies in the direction of Hawk's plight. Hawk himself carries himself very well in what is essentially a stock role picked from the Hollywood book of stock roles. And if you turned to the next page you would see Denzel Washington's character. Washington was very good in the role, but it was certainly no Oscar performance. This is an average film with above average performances.Wait until the video comes out in Blockbusters.",Training Day
354,willrasmussen-617-992319,One of the best cop movies,10,3 November 2010,"This has been one of my favorite movies ever so far. To be honest, I don't think I have never seen a better cop drama than this one. Training Day stands out as one those movies that shows the dangers of being a narcotics officer.The way this movie was filmed was excellent with the background music, the shots of the sun rising and the camera angles. The acting is also very good. Denzel Washington plays the role of Alonzo pretty good and Ethan Hawk does a good job of playing the rookie cop. I highly recommend this film for some that is looking for a good action and thriller.",Training Day
355,cedrickroberts,Tremendous Acting!!!!!!!,10,24 March 2004,"Is this really the way things are?  Does it have to be like this?  These were some of the questions that I asked myself as Alonzo (played by Denzel Washington) explained his brutally harsh behavior to his young drug-unit recruit, Hoyt (played by Ethan Hawke).  What a wonderful performance by Mr. Washington.  He has been truly intense in many other movies but I personally feel that he stepped it up a notch while playing this character.  I thoroughly believed that Denzel was Alonzo.  This feat, not to be confused with great storyline, developement of characters, and other movie characteristics, is not acheived by all actors.  Robert Dinero, Al Pacino, and a few of the other great actors have at least displayed this skill once or twice in their careers.   If you can understand the difference between overly-hyped Tom Cruise and the actors that I have listed, then we see eye to eye. The intensity with which Denzel delivered his lines in this movie makes it a must see for any inspiring actor that wants to one day be a leading man. As Ethan Hawke stated on David Letterman, Denzel Washington is one of the best leading men in Hollywood, and I personally concur.  Highly recommended for serious crime-drama fans.  Watch language for young children though.",Training Day
356,movie-man-76,"DENZAL, Finally Plays a Bad A**",8,7 April 2003,"Training Day is a great crime, drama, action, thriller, and cop/detective film. The screenplay is very rich and smooth, very free flowing. Great from start to finish. Training Day is one of my Top 5 favorite films to come out of 2001. The story is about a young police officer (Hawke) trying to make detective the fastest way, by being a narcotics officer for 18 months. He has one day to prove himself to his boss, Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington). This becomes his Training Day. Through out the film he finds out that being a narc is more then he bargained for. The film is about wrong and right and making the right decisions under extreme pressure. Denzal Washington gives a fantastic performance as Detective Harris. He is a man that has no morals and is using the badge to perform crimes against the criminals he is putting away, or trying to put away, either by death or prison. Denzal's powerful performance earned him an Oscar for best actor in 2002. Ethan Hawke gives a emotional performance as Officer Jake Hoyt, the new guy in training. He was also nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actor. Another great cop/detective film that came out recently is Narc (2002). I highly recommend both of these films. I give Training Day * * * * (out of 5 stars).",Training Day

I thought the acting was superb, the story line probably read well, and that the cinematography was well-done, but this movie drug on forever. There just was too little content for the plot line. Not one I would recommend seeing. Of course, if you liked this one, you would probably like ""Bad Lieutenant"" with Harvey Keitel. Sorry, I cannot give this movie high marks, which really disappoints me, as much as my disappointment in having picked this one over five other movies playing that night at our local theater. I must not have been alone, because one of my companions did leave after about 15 minutes and the other went to the concession stand twice.

Ethan, alongside him, just adds to how diverse a roll he can play. From start to finish your met with complete un-predictablility, action and drama. This dialogue is a true reflection of the location and more importantly it never losses it's substance. You will be entertained even when there's no action involved. You'll constantly be glued to the screen and asking yourselfwhat's gonna happen next!?The storyline is absolutely satisfying, especially when the plot thickens. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, or you thought you knew what's gonna happen next, that's when the direction and momentum of the film changes direction without altering away from the main plot. Everything is connected.A cop over-run by his own egotistical attitude, and self-consuming power, and another with a heart of gold. The contrasting relationship between the two is far from lacklustre!Great film, script, sound-track, and shooting from the camera team. A great all round effort in capturing the intensity portrayed by Denzel and the supporting actors/ actresses.Death, deception, drugs and debt, and not necessarily in that order, the theme is a recipe for filming success.

365,Dark Hellion,A Day you'll never forget,9,20 November 2001,"A friend of mine and I have been waiting a very long time to see Denzel Washington in a role where his talent really shines. The best movie I've seen him in to date is Fallen, although I haven't seen Malcolm X, so can't comment on that. For me, the difference between Fallen and most of Denzel's other roles is an edge, a sharpness, a *reality* that just doesn't appear in movies like The Hurricane or Remember the Titans. To put it as my friend does, we wanted to see Denzel play a character that would 'kick puppies and step on kittens' for a change. This movie takes what he brought to Fallen and puts it on steroids.
Washington is Alonzo Harris, a corrupt cop. A man who believes he's part of the big time but, in reality, he's just a small-time criminal hiding behind his LAPD badge. As a member of a covert narcotics squad, he gets to cruise the streets of LA looking for his next big bust. He may have originally been a fresh-faced rookie with an idealistic streak and a notion that justice involved returning the streets to the community, but his thirteen-year tour of duty in the narc unit have left him jaded, disillusioned, and willing to do whatever it takes. Throw young Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) into the mix. Hoyt is that self-same fresh-faced rookie with an idealistic streak, a young wife, and a nine-month-old daughter. He's looking to make detective, and wants nothing more than to be able to provide for his family and take down the questionable elements of society that run rampant in downtown LA. Alonzo, however, has totally different ideas about Jake's future.
Alonzo seems to have surrounded himself with a plethora of fools, and it's implied during the film that he's done it so that he can keep control. Because as long as Alonzo has control of the men in his unit, has control of the streets--which he rules with an iron fist--he has control of his life. As he gets to know Jake, however, he can see that there's something different about him...that he's not going to be just another follower. Jake has one single day to prove to Alonzo that he can cut it as a narc. Failure means he goes back to 'cutting traffic tickets' and maybe never gets his coveted job as detective. MINI-SPOILER However, an incident in Las Vegas with some nebulously defined and never-seen Russians suddenly has Alonzo in over his head. He has to provide a million dollars by midnight or his life is forfeit. His upper-echelon contacts (the semi-satirical 'Wise Men') are worried that he's not going to be able to find the money, and then they'll lose their man on the street, the guy who can be relied upon to get things done when the system can't. But Alonzo has a plan, and that plan centres around Jake. END MINI-SPOILERWashington turns in an incredibly driven and fiercely charismatic performance as Alonzo. Hawke, as his counterpoint, plays his role in a perfectly understated fashion, which only adds to Washington's impact in the film. Washington's character *needs* to be compared to a bland background, just so you can appreciate exactly what it is that's going on.
But when the film comes to its resolution, we're still left with the question unanswered. Which view is the right one? Does Jake's initial idealism have a place in the warzone--the drug-fuelled hotbed of intolerance and violence that is 'the office' for these covert narcs? Or is Alonzo's brutal and almost fanatical version of justice the only way to catch--and kill--the wolves prowling around the edges of the flock?
It's also refreshing to see a movie on this subject-matter that doesn't have a 'message'. Training Day simply explores the issues and puts them on the table, and whilst some people may believe it falls down on one side more than the other, I prefer to see it as giving the audience the option to make their own decision. The real stinger though, is that despite his unorthodox methods, his disregard for due process, and his uncompromising, severe attitude, Alonzo shares the same ideals as Jake. Both of them want to eliminate the scum of the streets. However, whereas Jake wants to create his perfect Aryan-esque world where it's safe for a fourteen-year-old to walk through the worst parts of town in the dead of night, Alonzo is much more interested in landing the biggest of fish--whatever the cost. Pros: Superb acting from Washington and a fine counterpoint by Hawke. A fast-paced character- and event-driven drama that assaults the senses and leaves you reeling from its mental impact. Cons: The last ten/fifteen minutes or so may leave some unsatisfied.
Likely Oscar nominations: Well, I'm going to forego my usual comical comment here. Seriously, Denzel should get _something_ for his performance in this movie. It's just a pity this is the sort of movie the Academy usually overlooks. Verdict: A tour-de-force led by Washington that proves that violence and intelligence don't necessarily have to be mutually exclusive in a modern movie. Go see if if you liked Fallen, or want to see what Denzel can really do when he turns on the afterburner. Plus the ins and outs of this movie can easily lead to lengthy discussions over coffee afterwards.

I also enjoyed how the movie took a turn for the worst or for the better depending on how you look at it, but I wasn't able to predict the shift in the plot.

368,kevinmanf,A character driven,6,9 November 2005,"Training Day sees Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke at full supremacy, both so brilliantly in command of there roles that they compensate for this action thriller's decorous screenplay and lack of ideas. If this film is about corruption, greed, narcotics and violence, by the end it becomes a one on one show between Washington and Hawke's character. What we care for, what entertains us through out the film is not its conventional themes expressed without conviction, but the squabbles between the two morally distinct characters as they visit the most corrupt places with the most corrupt people on the streets.Ethan Hawke plays Jack Hoyt (in a performance equally as brilliant as Denzel's), a man whose dream is to belong to the elite Narc squad. For him, it is an opportunity to fight true crime, the one that matters, to save the world of drugs. But before he can even dream of belonging to the Narc squad, he's got to pass a test and this film is precisely about that Training Day where Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) will be his instructor, a day in which Hoyt will see that nothing in the city of Los Angeles is as it seems, and we realise the unsettling boundaries of corruption.Alonzo Harris, in an inspired and over the top performance by Denzel, is a charismatic individual convinced by his own methods. He believes that giving out street justice is what justice is all about, that the enemy is in the streets, outside the law and he has got to be hunted like a wolf hunting another wolf. Alonzo is clearly corrupt and does not go by the law, he is a liar and may be worse than the criminals themselves since he has power and they don't. The contrast between Hoyt, a man who goes by the law but has little experience in enforcing it and a man who doesn't go by the law but has a lot of experience in enforcing it is the movie's key appeal.The film does a good job of reflecting Hoyt's initial and later feeling about Alonzo's actions on us. Firstly we feel that this guy may actually just be a cop trying to fight crime in his own way but there comes a point when we grow to dislike him.The final moments of the film are the weakest point of the film. You see, what happens at Alozno seems collected out of a container since the only clue we are given for the possibility is shown a little past half way in the film. It feels like the director didn't know how to end the film and found a far fetched way during shooting. Having said that, I like the way the director handles the very last scene: it doesn't force any unnecessary action but ends as it should. This is a film worth watching only to see the character conflict.",Training Day

So after finally watching the movie i am writing this review. The best part about training day is that it grips you from the very first scene. It doesn't give time for you to sink in and get absorbed in the semi dark appeal of it (which at least i felt). It engages from the first scene and confuses you at various moments leaving you mystified as to what exactly will the next scene be (something i assume that every movie buff loves - unpredictability). Denzel Washington like always delivers an incredible performance. But its Ethan Hawke who stands up and delivers a performance equally good as his co-star. The story is well written and aptly portrayed. My favorite moment in the movie is the conversation of the two leads after having interrogated a woman in her house,Training Day

After watching this movie I am not sure if this met my expectations of this movie even 9 years after its release. Alonzo(Washington) and his role really makes me wonder how corrupt and crazy our law systems and society is in the streets and the suburbs. The movie was a pretty long two hours but it kept you in it so it did not feel like it was dragging. Many people say they are unhappy with the climax or the big turning point but i was content with the ending if that helps at all. Everything was realistic, the actors were awesome and the movie really makes you have a connection for whats going on. It is sort of a movie where you actually have to pay attention and it is not predictable unless you ruin it for yourself.

It's kind of cool how they divided all 3 acts in morning, afternoon and evening, the climax in each act all have great build ups, specially the last one.It's one of those movies where you might feel like everything happens for a reason and some stuff is plot device, but it really worked out really well for me",Training Day

Hoyt is an uncomfortable, twitchy man when he meets Alonzo and Alonzo is just as uncomfortable when he meets the Wise Men. Their characters change so well it makes me feel great knowing they actually bothered to earn the awards they got.

Firstly, the plot has some depth and originality, something which cannot be said for the majority of offerings in this genre.  Secondly, the characters are solid and believable. This is in no little part due to the excellent performances put in by Denzel Washington (hardened veteran Narcotics officer) and Ethan Hawke (the rookie on his 'training day').  Another reason for being refreshing is that Denzel is the bad guy - he plays the players to his own ends, and not just to put the criminals away.The action flows nicely from a steady beginning to the fateful climax and, even though the film paints quite a bleak picture of what is required to survive and thrive on the streets, there are not a few moments of humour.Definitely recommended.",Training Day
379,Danfish,Whoa!!! PIPE down there DENZEL!!!,8,8 April 2002,"What's great about Training Day is that it never goes too far over the top. Judging by some of the comments already posted on this page, there are a lot of people who disagree with me on this one. But I thought the whole movie was nicely restrained, right up until the climax (is this review beginning to read like a write up for a high class porn flick?).Yes, yes, so Denzel Washington spends MOST of THE film TALKING like THIS (!!!!), his eyes continually twinkling with a mixture of mischievousness and raw insanity. But if there's one actor who you don't mind over acting, then it's Denzel. Imagine Al Pacino in the same role - although Al would definitely have looked even more ridiculous than Washington going round calling everyone his ""DAWG"" and Ethan Hawke his ""nigga"". Did Washington deserve the Oscar for this film... yeah, kind of... well, no... he just deserved the Oscar that he didn't win for Malcom X.Yet the whole time I was watching Training Day I just knew the final scenes would spoil it. I knew that Hollywood conventions would dictate that the film had to end with Washington and Hawke beating the living be-jaysus out of each other, sustaining several gun shot wounds and facial injuries in the process.Yet the final fight was really well staged, not asking the viewer to really believe that scrawny Ethan Hawke could really batter big buff Denzel. I mean, earlier in the film they asked us to believe that Ethan Hawke (a man whose eyelids look like they're on loan from Droopy Dog) had never schmoked the demon weed before... C'mon.Training Day is an interesting study in nihilism and is largely about, as another user has already commented, how important a set of rigid set of ethics should be to the public servants sent out to protect us. Yet the film never really resolves this issue - Ethan Hawke's character is shown to be deeply principled but largely unable to do his job because of his lack of street savvy and pragmatism, while Washington's Alonzo is shown to be resourceful and charismatic but ultimately careless and evil. So who does the screenwriter think should be patrolling the streets: Ethan? Denzel? Dr Dre (who's actually not as bad as you'd think)?Needless to say, I won't be signing up to join the LAPD just yet...",Training Day

381,gurochuck,What Movie Were You Guys Watching?!!,9,24 April 2006,"I know I'm late as hell and I hate to break the overall 'vibe' about this movie but this movie was great when I saw it in the theater and gets better every time I watch it over again. And this is mainly because of the performances by Denzel and Ethan. I don't know what you guys expected but the movie CLEARLY suggests that Denzel is a crooked, burnt-out, streetwise cop and Ethan is a 'wet-behind-the-ears' clueless rookie. So knowing that, WHAT DID YOU GUYS EXPECT, Malcolm X, Remember The Titans, The Hurricane?? If you were, then maybe you all need to be checked out. The reason why this movie was so great is because it wasn't the typical Denzel 'role model' movie. We KNOW that he can play those roles well so it's a testament to his acting ability that he can portray the other side of the spectrum. And my hat goes off to Ethan because he bounces off Denzel flawlessly.I hate to break the news to you guys but cops like Alonzo ARE OUT THERE and need to be acknowledged. Acting like the problem doesn't exist does not solve it. You don't have to go that deep to know that Alonzo was once a good cop who just got fed up w/ 'police procedures.' If you acknowledge that Jake's shallow-mindedness at the beginning of the film only allows him to look at the perks of making detective and how the progress of the day transforms him, you can really appreciate Ethan's portrayal of him. Let's face it, a bad day at the office when you're a narcotics detective differs greatly from that of an office executive and the different stresses can warrant different results.Even the street rhetoric was authentic. Maybe you guys need to get out of the 'burbs more. You guys didn't actually expect eloquent dialogue with little or no profanity, did you? The only part of this movie I struggle with is Dr. Dre's terrible overacting and that isn't nearly enough to take away from the overall result.Next time you guys bash a movie, make sure to try to be objective and rate what you see and not what you're used to seeing!!",Training Day

Did DW really get decorated for this? Some of the support roles are more convincingly played, lending a greater sense of motive for their actions, and perhaps more focus on their stories might have raised the interest level. Ultimately, it's a watchable but pretty anodyne and forgettable film that, despite the 'drama' billing, sheds little light on the human condition.",Training Day
383,Blou,Another Cop Flick....,6,13 June 2002,"Okay, so after Denzel Washington won the Oscar for Best Actor for this flick, I thought it would be worth my while to watch it and see if it was deserved. In my humble opinion, I believe that the Oscar was awarded to the WRONG man that night.The story revolved around Alonzo (Washington), head of the narc unit of LAPD, who take on a rookie, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) who wants to be part of the unit. This day in the life of movie takes them to neighbourhoods of LA and Hoyt, who has great respect for the narcs and Alonzo finds himself in the middle of a corrupt system he doesn't want to believe.
The performances are alright. Hawke is pretty good as the naive, new cop. Washington is believable as the expert, rough around the edges with a quick wit. But I don't think it's an Oscar winning performance. I do believe Russell Crowes performance in ""A Beautiful Mind"" was much stronger and deserving. No, I'm not biased because I'm an Aussie, but I think politics and personal feelings got in the way of the voting. I mean, ""Training Day"" was at the cinemas here for what, two weeks? Didn't even make the top ten here. When Washington won the Oscar, they brought it back to the cinemas. Luckily I work at a video store, so nothing but 2 hours of my time was wasted in watching this movie4/10",Training Day
384,pauldan,"Great acting, Tarentino-esque violence",8,8 April 2002,"Denzel Washington was SO good in this.  Fierce, nasty, and you could question how much of a soul he actually possessed.  I could even tolerate Ethan Hawke whom I have always thought of as pretty ""light-weight"", but in this movie he was able to put some meat into his character.  This film is violent and nasty and there aren't a lot of people in the flick that I would consider ""good and decent"".  Several scenes were knife-edged (or gun-barrel) violent, reminiscent of ""Reservoir Dogs"". At least one ""coincidence"", as I have seen mentioned in other reviews, was quite annoying.  Knowing that Washington's character wasn't aware of this coincidence made me think even less of his character, basically he was watching out for himself, only himself and didn't give a thought to anyone else or their lives. Fascinating, violent and recommended.",Training Day
385,captcab_99,Very entertaining,8,22 March 2002,It was good to see Denzel play a bad guy.  At first I wasn't sure if he was really up to no good or if he was just educating the new guy.  The ending gets a little carried away but it's still entertaining none the less.  Saw it in the theatre and I will rent it to watch it again.  It's that good.,Training Day
386,byungkeepark,Meaninglessness of Life,9,27 November 2008,"In ""Training Days,"" I see life is meaningless and meaningless. What does Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) ""gain from all his labor at which he toils under the sun"" (Ecclesiastes 1:3)? In the movie, I see everything is meaningless. Harris was chasing after the wind (1:14). Harris thought that he was the wise man and he must die. And he is forgotten too quickly. Life is like that. But in the Infinite, we find meaning and enjoyment in life. We are simply satisfied when we eat and drink. That's the gift of God. (3:13) Harris was wise in a sense, but he is foolish in God's eyes. Harris didn't seem to enjoy his work, and he looked sad all the time, even when he did smile. Solomon said, ""There is nothing better for a man than to enjoy his work"" (3:22). Who is like the wise man? I think Hoyt was the wise man. His wisdom ""brightens a man's face and changes its hard appearance"" (8:1). His wise work saved himself. His saving work of Smiley's cousin changed the hardened heart of a Latino gangster. Hoyt was the one who really enjoyed his work as a policeman.",Training Day

Antoine Fuqua is a genius of the action. In addition, the movie has memorable scenes, as the scene of the racketeers, a scene summit of maximum suspense.The scene of the racketeers is really terrifying and scary as hell, it paralyzed me, I've never seen equal ever.

Washington does a good enough job of it. But the reason the entire ""training day"" took place as it did isn't introduced for a while. Why, or even IF, Washington's Harris decided to pull the stints he did is unclear. Hawke simply follows him around greedily.

This kind of movie is the American good movies which aren't too Hollywoodian for the public the camera filmed different angles taken for suspense and intrigue.

He was to quote Roger Ebert ""over the top and down the other side"".  His performance was wild and out of control--and he seemed to be enjoying it! There is a line that separates a tour de force performance from buffoonery, Mr. Washington skidded all the way to the edge, wobbled violently, but managed to keep from falling over that line.  Viewers will love being along for the ride.  I have never before seen a Denzel Washington performance worth seeing, let alone mentioning until now.  Sure he's a wonderful actor, yada, yada, yada, but he has always been too bland and vanilla for this reviewers taste.  But now Denzel has acquired some long needed ""flava""Ethan Hawke was good too.Antoine Fuqua on the other hand was not good.  He should return to directing music videos at once.  Will someone tell him there are more camera angles besides extreme-up-the-nostrils-close-ups.  The direction was deplorable.  A first year film student could have done better.  I kept thinking to myself ""when did I direct a movie?""  that was the only possible explanation for it being so poorly directed.  This film was saved from it's simple script and horrendous direction only by exceptional acting (Washington and Hawke) and an editor who must also be a magician.The acting and editing not only saved this film from it's unskilled director but from the additions of Snoop Dog and Dr. Dre to the cast.

You instantly warm to Denzel's character. Even as his acts get gradually more and more questionable throughout the movie you want to believe it's not quite what it seems. Perhaps this is all a test, but no he is actually the bad guy. A loose cannon drunk on the power being a cop affords him leading him to a path of corruption.Denzel's performance is excellent. I particularly liked the emotion behind him explaining to Hoyt why they can't do everything above board after murdering a drug dealer. Retrospectively looking at this scene you can tell he is a desperate man, like he doesn't really believe his own lies anymore but he has no choice. His fall from power at the end is also spectacular.Credit to Hawke who played the naive and eager-to-please rookie. He was perfectly cast and was truly believable in the role.One criticism I have of the story is that Hoyt's rescue of the girl being attacked which subsequently saved his life was a bit too convenient for me.

Are critics afraid to pan Denzel?Denzel never convinces us that he was ever more than a thug with a badge. He plays the character so over-the-top in love with himself that he doesn't even know the boys in the hood hate his guts.  The role of narcissistic punk comes way to easy to Denzel (but that is true in most of his roles) and he pushes the character way beyond any belief.    Hawke never grabs us an innocent but well-meaning guy, just young and really, really dumb (gives the gang his gun to see?).  Why do they give a guy a drop-dead beautiful, could be a cover girl wife when it is no part of the story?

It shows a cop who turned into a criminal, because he thinks that this is the only way to deal with crime at all. It shows how another cop's ideals of his job (and maybe the world as a whole) come crashing down in only one day. And most important of all: The movie doesn't give any answers to the questions it arouses; the viewer has to make up these answers on his own and it's not clear whether he will find them - or whether they exist at all.In a way, TRAINING DAY has got a ""happy end"".

417,niqstar,Clash of Characters,7,12 January 2015,"What looks like a classic cop/gangster scenario at first glance is much more fascinating when boiled down to the interactions of two very distinct character types. The hardened, loud-mouth, streetwise detective (Denzel Washington) against the quiet, nice-guy rookie, who seemingly has a lot to learn (Ethan Hawke). I'm sure most, if not all, know the type of person that easily and consciously draws attention to themselves. Sometimes they are seen as obnoxious and loud, sometimes as lively and entertaining, but they are always at center stage. And weaker characters, be it due to personality traits, social standing or whatever other reason, are often swept away in the wake of such persons. The prolonged exposure to such a character and the struggle to overcome him is what elevates this movie beyond the standard fare of the genre. The other driving point is the old-fashioned standing up for what is right even against the odds, and while those two unfold nicely, the logical integrity of the actual story may become questionable at times. The gritty portrayal of police work and the urban scenery strive to offer a good amount of realism and are indeed successful if one is able to look past the classic police thriller at the surface (and the display of questionable morals that could be too readily decried as wildly unrealistic). The acting and the technical aspects of the movie, as well as the good pacing, help to enable a good amount of immersion.Overall Training Day is a solid movie whose merits lie beyond an entertaining storyline.

Truly scary stuff with the thrilling situations Hawke finds himself in including a very traumatic bathtub scene.

421,Peeknuckle,Almost Perfect,9,19 May 2005,"Despite the last 15 minutes, Training Day is a powerful, gutsy film that has award-winning performances by Denzel Washington (Alzono) and Ethan Hawke (Jake). Ethan Hawke plays a complex character that is only rivaled by his current stage performance of Hurlyburly.The movie follows Jake who is a rookie narcotics cop and wants to get in on the action and be part of Alzono's undercover team. Alzono is king of the narcotics group, a ruler of the streets who sets his own rules within the department and on the street. Alzono enforces his own definition of justice, punishment, and morality.Take away the guns and violence and this is about morality on the streets where there is no true understanding of how justice plays out, except by force.The supporting cast and cameos by Snoop and Dr. Dre are terrific, as is the cinematography and grainy feel. Denzel's performance is rivaled only by a similar role in Man on Fire.If only.If only this wasn't a studio film and didn't have to have the tied knot ending.

He pulls off the performance amazingly, and when I watched the film I was just shocked.Not only was Denzel's performance great Ethan Hawke's character Officer Hoyt was also well written.

426,pizzolog,Awful or Excellent?,8,3 February 2004,"I am not sure how to rate this movie, 1 of 10 awful, or 10 of 10 excellent.
If you like being frighten and appalled while watching a movie, and enjoy walking away feeling disgusted and dirty, wanting to burn your close and take a shower, and derive joy from having bad dreams at night, than THIS is the movie for you!
Training Day depicts the worse aspects of humanity, betrayal, treachery, greed, murder; and shows an unsuspecting trainee cop pitted against this onslaught while he searches to do the right thing; and photographs it all in a horrifying way.  This is NOT a feel good movie.  This is not a movie for the faint of heart, nor children, nor anyone under thirty who may well be scandalized. This movie is disgusting, vile and is a piece of trash.
On the other hand, Training Day is movie making at its Very Best!  Denzel Washington is remarkably good with his performance of Detective Alonzo Harris; and Ethan Hawke, the trainee, seems to come out of no where to match Denzel's performance scene to scene with the excellence attributed only to the premium big name heavy weight actors in Hollywood today. And that's not easy to do!  Denzel Washington is as good an actor as there ever was, and better then most. Hawke's performance is superlative.Astonishing performances were also rendered by Tom Berenger, Harris Yulin, Raymond J. Barry, Cliff Curtis, Macy Gray, Scott Glenn , Nick Chinlund, Jaime Gomez, and on and on.  How did they all get so good?!This movie is an excellent film due in large part to Denzel Washington who makes everyone around him perform better at their work.  Director Antoine Fuqua, and actress Macy Gray openly admitted this on the DVD's special feature segment.The intensity of Training Day paralyzes the viewer and doesn't let go until the end.  This movie is a ride into hell.So, how does one rate this film, Awful or Excellent?",Training Day
427,Homid-NC,A gritty film.,9,12 October 2001,"I personally have to say that Antoine Fuqua is an outstanding director. This is the better of the two ""action"" films I have seen (The Replacement Killers is the other). He has a great eye for film when it comes to directing and even his music videos are entertaining.This film caught me off guard. As I'm sure many other people than I have felt going to see it, I thought it would be horrible. When the first 10 minutes or so went by, I could tell it would AT LEAST be entertaining. When the story began to unfold, I was actually into the movie.
The character development in this movie is great. Denzel Washington played a great anti-hero and I would not be surprised if he won some awards for his performance. Ethan Hawke also played an immensely convincing role.
The director, perhaps, was the best part of the movie. Fuqua has a magnificent eye for setting up scenes. The drug hallucination part was a brilliant way of showing it.I gave this film 8/10! If you have a chance and you like action and good plots, GO SEE IT!",Training Day
428,cpusavant,One of the few films where Ethan Hawke gives a stellar performance,8,9 October 2001,"I had my hopes up when I went to see Training Day opening weekend. Thank god it didn't let me down. In fact, I was more impressed than I expected. Denzel Washington gives an amazing performance as a rogue cop who tries to recruit another. For a second, think back to Washington's Oscar-winning performance in Glory, and compare it to this film. Washington plays a great bad good guy. In Glory, he plays a racist black soldier for the Union, who eventually comes around and loses his prejudice. In Training Day, he plays nearly the same role, a disillusioned cop who makes the system and his role as an undercover narcotics cop work in his favor. However, in Training Day, he does not come to his senses. The contrast and conflict between Hawke and Washington is stellar, and the action and suspense is unbelievable. This is a must see for anyone who likes cop/military action movies. Don't miss it.",Training Day
429,tonyaaw23,A bit surprised,7,6 October 2001,"I had never seen Denzel play a role like this. I'm used to seeing him play the ""good"" guy. He is kind of a bad Malcolm X but he wasn't a villain. His acting was great in this movie but the movie overall lacked substance. The plot was unclear and it just seemed to be a day of him and the rookie visiting people. I liked the movie but it would've been much better if there was a REAL plot to it. I would've liked to see him meet up with the Russians but hey, maybe next time.",Training Day
430,JudgeMalone,solid crime drama,7,19 October 2003,"This is a well-crafted, taut crime film with not too much corn, which is refreshing in H'wood these days. It was fun to see Denzel Washington play a bad guy for a change; he deserved the Oscar. E. Hawke, T. Berenger, H. Yulin & even Snoop Dogg were good. This is the kind of tense, interesting, character-driven thing that Quentin Tarantino should be doing instead of making ridiculous Matrix-style martial arts garbage for the masses.",Training Day

Now, he's done a lot of great movies; Virtousity, Fallen, Hurricaine, Remember the Titans, and though they are all well acted, they are also the same type of character, calm, quiet and cool.  Olonso in Training day is different.  He's a 'brotha', he's a scoundrel and he's out of control. Great new role for Washington. Ethan Hawke is a name I have stayed away from, I never really liked great expectations or gattaca, but I did like him immensly in TD.  I will follow his career with great interest. TD is one of my top 5 all time favorite movies, on the scale of smart dialogue, funny irony and good acting.

Nonetheless, it is a movie I would highly recommend to my friends to watch to get a glimpse of the dark sides of life which may be unbeknownst to a lot of people particularly those who live a sheltered life. The movie also has a message that certain individuals like Alonzo given a certain degree of power to influence either positively or negatively other people lives in an unbridled fashion could have devastating effects. Altogether, it was a movie that my sweetheart and me would say ""Life as it is on the silver screen.""",Training Day

Basically an update of every cop show from the 70's, it offers no surprises in any area except Denzel Washington's performance, which is stellar. Ethan Hawke tries very hard with the unbearable ""innocent young believer"" role, but ultimately can't overcome the weakness of the script or stand up to the power of Denzel Washington, who should make a career of playing villains.Worth watching!",Training Day

The scary thing about this movie is the part of Detective Alonso Harris, played by Denzel Washington is a true character type found on the streets on many US cities.  The character type can not be confined to any race or color.

Almost immediately Hoyt is placed on the back foot, constantly caught off guard by Alonzo's nature, his ability to switch between a cold, no-nonsense street-wise player, a genuinely caring and good intentioned leader, and occasionally jovial companion. From their first encounters though, where Hoyt tells Harris he will do ""anything you want me to do"", the situations Hoyt is taken into become more and more morally ambiguous, from the simple use of excessive force to outright illegal activity, forcing Hoyt to decide which side Harris is truly on, whether to trust him, or whether Hoyt is the unwitting centerpiece of a huge and complex web of lies and set-ups in order for Harris to for fill his own sinister motives..This is the movie that won Denzel the Oscar that year for Best Actor!!

He's basically a corrupt cop. The actors performances were absolutely top-notch. Directing was superb and the storyline is believable. My only complain about the movie was that some scenes were just unnecessary. They could have been left out. Definitely a recommended for anybody! Buy it on DVD as soon as you can.

He won the Best Actor Oscar in 2002 for his portrayal of a shady streetwise detective, but let's face it- he does nothing remarkable in this film. He just raises his voice and tries to ""out-act"" everybody else on screen. Ethan Hawke was also nominated, and is actually much more impressive and truthful as the rookie cop (whose first day on the job with Denzel lends the film its title.) Denzel is always competent, but his turn as the bad guy in TRAINING DAY never amounts to anything but a gimmicky career move. I suppose his Oscar win just goes to show how much the Academy loves an actor showing off, whether its Nicole Kidman or Charlize Theron uglying up for their Best Actress wins, or Al Pacino, Tom Hanks, or Dustin Hoffman playing handicapped for theirs. In this case, Denzel was the Biggest Showoff of 2001.",Training Day

As I heard people talking about this film in such a great way I decided to mosie on down to Virgin and buy it. Sat down with a vision of a fair and insightful representation of corruption and places like the jungle. What did I get? A jumped up half bad action half ridiculous philosophical gibberish. Don't get me wrong Washington played his part well but he was up against Russel Crowe from a (Beautiful Mind) and in my opinion the real winner in Will Smith (Ali). Anyway lets just say the film was a let down in a big way. Ethan Hawke was a hell of a lot better in this than some of his others but overall a disappointment don't go out of your way to watch it.,Training Day

Because the role is always the same : ""A man ho has to run from his family to protect his wife and child and also has to deal with the mafia. or like in this movie he deals with Drug-mafia's and for once he's the Bad Guy!.""This one wasn't special although i must admit i have a ""Soft-Spot"" for the ""Beautiful, Foxy and Sexy Femme Fatale"" Eva Mendes.This movie just didn't do it for me.Denzel Washington is an actor but is he a great actor?He has won an Oscar, but let me ask you this : Is everyone ho wins an Oscar ""Worthy"" of winning the Prize?Is John Ruiz truly a Heavyweight Boxing Champion of the world?Is Lennox Lewis one of the all-time great Heavyweight Boxing champions?The answer on the Denzel Washington question will always be a split decision, in my eyes.The best movie i saw of him was : ""The Hurricane"".That was truly a brilliant performance, but ""Training Day"" is not.And i think that movie will always make the grade in my book.The ""annoying"" thing about this movie is that the ""predictability"" is pretty ""obvious and boring"".When i mean ""Predictability"" i mean : Guns, Drugs, Mafia, shootout and This and that.And even if Denzel played the ""Bad Guy"".There wasn't anything ""Special"" about that role.Russell Crowe's ""Beautiful Mind"" but especially Will Smith's Ali are much better ""Performance's"".Some people on ""this Board"" seem to think this movie is ""real day to day life."" or think that this Denzel's best performance.Well i don't think so!Hurricane was his best, Malcolm X i wasn't impressed with and Out Of Time was Good to watch but Sanaa Lathan and again Eva Mendes made it even more Tasty!And all that talk about this movie being real ""day to day"" life?How ""Out of touch"" can you be?At the end of the day everyone is in titled to his opinion.So my conclusion : This movie isn't one of ""Denzel's"" better performance's. Eva Mendes will always be ""Beautiful"" on the screen, she is a ""Very Underrated"" Talent.Ethan Hawke seemingly is very popular for his ""role"", witch was pretty good.And there are a lot of ""unnecessary"" ""Rappers"" invited like Dr. Dre and Snoop ""Doggy"" Dogg.And that doesn't much help the credibility of the ""real life case"" of this movie, that is put forward by some people on this board.And although the movie is rated ""High"" by many in my eyes the movie was nothing special than a ""Mediocre, Nothing Special Predictable"" Performance.For the people ho enjoy these kind of ""Action, Drug Mafia and Denzel type movies"" I'd recommend it.But for people ho are looking for ""more"" depth and a better or a more ""Real Life"" performance, i say : This is not the movie for You!My Score : 4.2""Groeten"" from Gerrit",Training Day

Ethan Hawke really holds his own too.  He masterfully displays the development of his rookie character.  Disillusionment sucks!

And the performance isn't that great. I give Ethan Hawke some credit, for at least his character is believable and he does a decent job of moving the plot along. What little plot there is. Basically, it doesn't make that much sense. Bad cop versus good cop. From there, its up to the viewer to fill in the gaping holes.

Denzel Washington's performance is incredible; viewers will forget his past ""good guy"" performances as they are absorbed into the dark depth of this crooked, but experienced, narcotics officer.  You will not look at the ""crooked cop"" idea in the same generic way after seeing this film. He deserved the ""Best Actor"" Oscar, but it's a bit disappointing (but not TOO much) that it was for a bad guy role, after all of his remarkable previous movie performances. Ethan Hawke's performance as the trainee was very believable as well, for his ""training"" was a true crucible in deciding whether ridding the streets of criminals took becoming a criminal. Though it's a rough movie in terms of language and thematics, the violence was not as pervasive.

463,Quiz_Kid_Donny_Smith,"Good movie, Denzel makes it a great movie",9,8 August 2002,"***Spoilers!!!***I started watching this movie not knowing what to expect. At the end I wasn't disappointed. It was a well-structured, well-balanced cop-movie.Training Day is about LAPD Officer Jake Hoyt, excellently portrayed by Ethan Hawke, and Narcotics Detective Alonzo Harris, brilliantly portrayed by Denzel Washington. Jake Hoyt is going to be a Narcotics Detective too, just like Alonzo Harris. He has a great sense of justice and honesty. But before he really starts to work he joins Alonzo Harris on a training day, meant to introduce new detectives to their work and their neighbourhoods. The only problem is Alonzo Harris is probably the baddest character ever portrayed by Denzel Washington. He's just bad to the bone, he steals, he cheats and he beats. He's in this line of work just to get rich. Because Jake Hoyt is nervous and new to this line of work he accepts some of the suspicious behaviours of Alonzo Harris but slowsly he starts to realize what he is doing and most importantly... He starts to realize that he is being sucked into it against his own will.The story line makes up for a good movie, but if properly executed it could be great movie (as with all story lines probably...). Let me tell you this, this movie is executed properly! Alonzo Harris has some cool lines but when Denzel says they sound great! Put some mediocre actor in this movie instead of Denzel and this movie would have been good, but not nearly as good as it is now. He performance lifts this movie to a higher level.Now we are completely forgetting Ethan Hawke. Ethan portrayes his character excellent too. He acts very convincing as the cop who only wants to do good and help people (isn't that their job? :)).Scott Glenn's character Roger is nice too. He plays a bigtime drugdealer who is being betrayed by Alonzo Harris.Musicians Dr. Dre, Macy Gray and Snoop Dogg also have nice parts. Especially Snoop Dogg's part is cool. A crackdealer in a wheelchair!Although she didn't play a big part I want mention Eva Mendes who plays the role of Sara Harris. She is just drop dead gorgeous!!!All in all this is a great movie.

It even starts off with some really cheesy smart-ass talk about Denzel having his morning paper interrupted by Ethan Hawke and so Ethan had better have a really damn entertaining story to justify interrupting his ""entertaining"" newspaper.I dunno. I mean, if you are a real bad ass like Denzel's character who is bored to tears by Ethan Hawke's traffic stop story and you like to routinely shoot people and split their ill-begotten cash, what exactly do you find entertaining in the newspaper? The recipe section? The legal notices? Or is it just some dribble from a screenplay writer who was churning out a gun porn film that is one of the dime a dozen that hover somewhere above the straight to video benchmark, and are mostly forgettable as they are paint-by-numbers plots with a mildly interesting twist and stocked with at least one recognizable name?

The film is successful in creating an atmosphere of impending danger and edginess. The script is good and the film is well shot. The story itself disappoints.

469,thepods,A gripping yet shallow thriller,6,22 June 2007,"I enjoyed Training Day on a few levels, first off, Denzel Washington is superb as Alonzo and the tough, gritty action sequences make this a very realistic and violent thriller, however apart from Washington's change from the good guy he usually portrays to a corrupt and vicious narcotics officer, I felt the film had no real clear story.There is a story somewhere, a rookie cop on the force to fight the bad guys only to get a wake up call that it's not like that is an interesting idea for a crime film but the movie gets lost in its constant attempts at carrying many different moral themes. In the end this is a good versus evil action movie disguised by a career best performance from Washington and being marketed as a fast paced crime thriller, and if it had presented itself as what it really was I would have like it more.Verdict: The cast do a great job, but it could have been a far greater film had it been directed by, say Spike Lee or Quinten Tarantino.",Training Day
470,johnryanbragg,I mean... it was alright,7,1 January 2019,"First things first, Denzel Washington most definitely deserved the Academy Award he won for his portrayal of crooked LAPD cop Alonzo, and Ethan Hawke got a nomination, sure, don't really care. However, I felt like this film had a weak plot and was somewhat carried by the performance of the leading and supporting actors.In conclusion, it was an ok film to watch, more bearable towards the end when things start to pick up, otherwise I honestly wouldn't recommend it 100%.",Training Day

But from the opening shot, the film had me hooked and never let me down.  There were only a couple places where I was able to start dissecting it, but then the plot would pick up again right away and I'd be engaged.  This is a great work of fiction based on events that could actually occur and people who probably exist.  After reading a certain ""Rolling Stone"" article the summer before the film was released about the Death Row Records/Rampart Scandal, I felt that a film like this should be made.  And it was.

Going into this movie I had expectations (another bad habit I have) of seeing a ""best picture nomination, and best supporting for Ethan Hawke.""  Not too smart of me.  Hawke's performance was good, but nothing close to oscar caliber.  If there are going to be any oscar nods for this movie (a far shot) would be for Denzel as best actor.

The last third of the show went a little overboard, losing some of the believability, but overall it enthralling, albeit sometimes disturbing. (I noticed that Jaime P Gomez from Nash Bridges played the part of one of Denzel's ""henchmen"" and think that his name should have been on the billing as well as Dr Dre, Snoop Dog, etc.) The entire supporting cast was fantastic, the background was realistic because it was the real thing.

The film didn't go very far, and took a hell of a long time to get there.

It is sad that despite a big budget and big names, they can't top the lower budget TV series The Shield, which takes this story and does it right.

Its probably more of my problem then it is the films but it never really caught my interest. I kept expecting the 2 characters to run into a big plot, but that never happened. It was more of an assortment of things, which I wasnt prepared for. And (I dont care if he won an Oscar for it) I really hated Denzel Washington's character. And not in the good way that they wanted me to (i.e. Tom Berenger's Sgt. Barnes in Platoon) but more just in an annoying ""Oh my god, why wont you die already!?!"" way (i.e. That spoon kid from Mimic). It just seemed like he was TRYING to win an Oscar for it. I never really believed him as the character (that was problem with Denzel in John Q too. But I did happen to like that movie a lot better then this one.)It did have some good movies. Some of the situations they got in were very cool and I did like Ethan Hawke's character and some of the other supporting cast. So it wasnt a total loss. But still I didnt like it much. I give it a 4, maybe a 4 and a half out of 10.",Training Day
486,karowrite1,Awesome performances!,10,29 July 2002,"In this edge-of-your-seat action thriller, Denzel Washington tosses off his good guy image and turns into a tough crooked street cop; rough, calculating and coercive. On the other side of the coin is the truly gentle ""homeboy,"" Ethan Hawke, whose performance equals that of Washington. Hawke, as Jake Hoyt, becomes the only one of the rookie cops to take a stand against Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington), and a helluva stand he takes, too.This is a powerful movie, unequalled by any other new videos I have seen. Together, Washington and Hawke create a new genre in the film industry, and proffer dual performances that are above reproach. Bravo!!!",Training Day

488,linkinpark45,Very good performances from both actors!,10,1 June 2013,"This was a very good movie for several reasons: it dealt with many things police officers have to go through on a daily basis; showed that some people can accept and live with corruption, while others will try to stay true to the badge, and the most important: it shows how unreliable some people can be in certain situations. Washington plays an experienced, but corrupted narcotics detective and Hawke as a rookie, but a very loyal detective. Both did very well in their roles, especially Washington which got him an Oscar. Besides the main themes of this movie, it also shows how people change because of corruption and unreliability, therefore portraying the film very realistically. I also liked the fact that despite differences, Harris and Hoyt got along throughout the movie and during the last part, turned against each other: another lesson to learn - money can break anything, even friendship. Good movie, 10 out of 10, i recommend it, a lot of lessons to be learnt.",Training Day

490,grantwedan,Great Movie!,8,21 March 2012,"""Training Day"" tells the story of young cop Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) assigned to Narcotics, partnering veteran cop Alonzo Harris (Washington) on his first day. As he tries to improve Hoyt's ""street IQ"", Alonzo appears to push the boundaries of what is acceptable policing to their absolute limits, forcing Hoyt to question both his own motives and those of his superior. The film is all about asking yourself one question: how far would you go in order to do the right thing? And without trying to sound righteous, this is a question that all of us must ask ourselves from time to time. Do I do the right thing and refuse or capitulate and go with the flow? It is this theme of morality that lifts ""Training Day"" beyond the mire of most cop movies. The other huge bonus is the performance of the two leads - both Washington and Hawke are brilliant, utterly compelling and believable in their respective roles. However, I think that the Oscar went to Washington for two reasons. One: he is playing totally against type. Washington isn't known for playing characters with a prominent dark side, let's be honest. Two: Russell Crowe didn't deserve a second Oscar after ""Gladiator"". Hawke, I feel, was probably a little peeved at not getting as much recognition as this is easily the best film I've seen him in. But Washington is at his scene-stealing best, especially towards the end. Most other actors only appear for short periods of time (Dr Dre, Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg, etc) and don't really contribute that much.Unlike most other cop movies, ""Training Day"" feels a much more realistic picture than others in its stable. LA isn't the playground of the rich and famous that we expect in the movies - it's a scorching hot-bed of drugs, gang violence and simmering racial tension. And it looks great. This is a wonderfully shot film, drawing you into it's shady suburbs. For the first time in years, Los Angeles looks and feels like a real city and not just a main street full of skyscrapers. For all it's accuracy, I confess that some of the ""hood"" dialogue lost me (I'm a pasty white boy, can't help it!) and this marred the ending slightly, which did feel slightly contrived and hurried to fit the time frame. What it did do was leave me wanting more and I haven't seen a film in a while that left me like that.",Training Day
491,dic_r,"""Training Day:"" The Film Is A Powerhouse!",10,10 January 2005,"Denzel Washington's best acting performance since....""Glory."" No haahahhaha! I was just kidding! You thought that I was going to fall into that Oscar trap, huh? No, really, ""Glory"" was an excellent film, but between the time span of ""Glory"" (1989) and ""Training Day,"" (2001) twelve years if my mathematics are not failing me, Washington has done other top-notch films, namely ""Devil In A Blue Dress,"" (1994) ""He Got Game,"" (1998) ""The Siege,"" (also 1998) and ""The Hurricane"" (1999). This film just happens to have Washington as a completely wicked cop. To me, this film contained one of Denzel Washington's top-notch performances as villain F.E.S. Detective-Sergeant Alonzo Harris. Washington is completely wicked as he double-crosses everybody he knows to get the job done and then some. He holds nothing back. This film has heart, emotion, and adrenaline. It has something, a majestic quality, that Tony Scott's mean, tough ""Man on Fire"" (2004) tried to capture, but not quite as successfully. An incredible Oscar-nominated performance also for Ethan Hawke, who unfortunately lost to Jim Broadbent in ""Iris"" (2001). Probably most people Antoine Fuqua's best film to date, edging out ""Tears of the Sun"" (2003) and ""King Arthur"" (2004). The storytelling never felt stiff in the joints and just moved freely pretty much the whole way through. By the way, was that Eva Mendez as Washington's wife in the film? JUST KIDDING! I knew that! The whole world would know that by now!",Training Day
492,robertcolin72,My Review,6,30 December 2004,"I really wanted to like film more than I eventually did.The film starts off in great fashion with Alfonso's (Washington) character being outlined immediately as an ultra cool narcotics cop with a street reputation and the mean streak required to survive in that type of work, you could not help but warm to his character's style and grace.Hawke plays an understated role as a rookie narc cop undergoing a trial day on the job to see if he can hack it on the mean streets.The plot lets the film down for me. About half way into the film the point seems to get lost somewhere and I was left feeling as if a massive opportunity to make a good film into a great one had passed.Washington is excellent none the less bringing humility, profanity and plenty of guts to his performance.",Training Day

""Training Day"" instantly went into my Top 10 movies of all time after I saw it once. Denzel is the perfect person for his role in this movie, and Ethan Hawke makes for a great guinea pig/scapegoat. Denzel plays a character so manipulative and so desperately evil, you'll forget that he is actually one of the ""good guys"". Sure, Denzel's character (Alonzo) has worked himself into a bind, and time is running out for him, so he has to act quickly and cunningly. It's easy to imagine Alonzo as a good guy before this, but as a good cop gone bad, he nails this performance. His best work ever, and Tony Scott's best ever.",Training Day
494,thecoorodinator,"Definitely worth watching, could have been better",7,9 January 2021,"I can't believe it took me so long to watch this film. I found it on Sky Movies over Christmas. I also didn't know, until I checked here on IMDB, that Washington won an Best Actor Oscar for it. I don't know why I missed that, I can only think that the work I was doing, due to the aftermath of 9/11, didn't allow for focusing on anything much else.The film starts off slowly., sets the scene well and gives some background and foundation to Hawke's character. It was certainly strange seeing Washington playing the role of 'bad guy' though it is not nearly as clear cut as that. The film shows there is no black and white, when it comes to the fight against drug crime and gang violence, only various shades of grey.The film covers the 24 hrs of rookie cop Jake's (played by Hawke) first day working with veteran 'narco' detective Alonzo (played by Washington). Jake is a proud, ambitious and naîve rookie with a very pretty young wife and 9 month old baby girl. Everything a young man making his way in the world could wish for right? Jake had just had the opportunity to fast track his career, to make detective in a year, by having a day's probationary try-out with Alonzo to see if there's a good fit, and if Jake has 'what it takes' to fit in with the narco 'team'.Jake is naturally apprehensive and nervous about things and likens it to football tryouts to be picked for the team. He just wants it to be the next day, so he can look at the team sheet and see if he made it.What happens from the point that he meets Alonzo onwards is not the day he thought it would be. Both Washington and Hawke work really well together, though at times I think that Hawke could have brought a little more to the role. What should have been a natural, for most people, temptation to join the dark side for Hawke's character didn't come across as much as it maybe could have done. The interplay between them was excellent though, as was the wonderful, of short, performances given by the numerous extras that provided the backdrop of the black and Hispanic neighbourhoods, bordering but quite on ghettos, but certainly what would normally be totally no go zones for the police. At times I found myself imagining what it would be like to be in Jake's shoes and felt my heartbeat quicken and fear in my stomach.Overall there are some fantastic messages that come out of the film, especially about treating people as you would like to be treated. The bug question asked is exactly how much flexibility is there in the way the law is enforced in order to be more successful in the fight against drug crime? It's a slippery slope and certainly one that cannot be answered in one film. This film does not try to answer this question, only to ask it.Overall a superb experience watching this film, one that I remember for some time to come. I've decided that 7/10 is appropriate, though certainly a 10/10 for Denzil Washington's performance. For me an overall 10/10 would have required a little more from Hawke, and a long met film giving more of a chance to really see how ingrained in the system the canker was. Perhaps also some more consequences for those that quite irresponsibly were supporting, and profiteering, that canker.",Training Day
495,saurabh_97,This training is not what he'd expected.,8,10 December 2016,"Training Day seems passionately made and well crafted. It's fast paced from the start, scene-to-scene, though slows down at some places, likely for the need of character development. One small scene where Alonzo talks to his son in Spanish, is emotionally captivating, even when one is unaware of the language; and most importantly - describes his somewhat affection for his closed one, amidst his brutal actions and dialogues throughout the movie. What Denzel Washington's character (Alonzo) mostly does is evidently the 'wrong' convention of doing things; it does sometimes looks like this 'cop' has a pretty decent idea about how things work (he even exclaims during one scene, ""Nothing's free in this world, Jake. Not even arrest.."") This makes Alonzo implausible.The film aptly uses the location of Los Angeles, which suffers from the socio-economic issue of drug cartels and gang wars, also relevant to the plot's context.I've seen it once as of, but definitely wouldn't mind watching again, since it's no-campy, complex story line makes one to delve deeper into it's dialogues, thus increasing it's re-playing ability.",Training Day
496,thewayofthegunn,An interesting exploration,8,14 December 2005,"After watching all the special features on the DVD, I gained a better appreciation for this film. Both the director and the writer are ""graduates"" of project areas in the USA (Director: Pittsburgh, Writer: LA). The cast and crew spent a lot of time researching both the gang situation in east-central LA and the lives of undercover narcs. The film was pre-screened to gang members and the police to ensure its authenticity. This is a gritty, not pretty film. It has not been hollywoodized to appeal to the masses. It doesn't have a happy ending, the good guys don't always win...much like real life. The movie projects a definite shade of gray, so please don't look for black hats and white hats. For Ethan Hawke's character, it is his journey into the Heart of Darkness, with Denzel Washington, as his Kurtz.For those who complain that Denzel Washington won the Academy Award for best Actor; perhaps you should ask yourselves why he was not nominated for Malcolm X, and why he failed to win for The Hurricane.

This was that film.  I do not even know if Denzel Washington or Ethan Hawke turned in good performances, I couldn't get my mind past the question; ""why did Denzel say 'yes' to this piece of trash?"".  Must have been for the money. I know that they got my (and my wife's) 18 bucks and I want it back!!

499,hike_on,A filmmaker's dilemma (some spoilage included),4,1 December 2001,"Do you take big money from a studio, thus enabling you to hire the actor that could make your movie great, knowing that the studio will make certain script requirements guaranteed to ruin the whole thing?This movie was so bad, but came so close to being so good.  I was thrilled for the first, say, 105 minutes of Training Day.  Then, rather than giving us a shocking ending, which would have been ok, or an ambiguous ending, which would have been better, we are given a cheesy formulaic ending.  Not only that, the last 15 minutes are an assault on the viewer's intelligence. We are required to believe that Hawke's character would give up his weapon, we are hit with a ridiculous coincidence with the wallet, and it is suggested that our hero would know how to use LA's bus system to travel (quickly, another joke) from Boyle Heights to South Central (for those of you not from here, that would not happen).  Then Washington's character leaves Hawke's alive, and...oh forget it, the list just keeps going.But up until that point, I was so impressed.  Hawke's internal struggle was great to watch, and pretty plausible.  Washington, awful as his character was, was a joy to watch.  It was fairly reflective of local issues, coming on the heels of the Rampart police scandal, in which cops in one part of the city (where most of the movie was set) took over the streets, making a huge impact in crime while doing some terrible things.  The action scenes (until the latter moments) were fairly realistic looking and fun to watch.  The character actors in smaller roles (Macy Gray, Snoop Dogg, and especially Cliff Curtis and his friends) were outstanding.  You know, this movie had everything I would have wanted, except for an ending that didn't p*** me off.Go see this movie, but once it moves to the bathtub, feel free to stop.",Training Day
500,aspence26,"This movie is great. Even with its ""Hollywoodness""",9,21 April 2002,"Soo many critics of this film have talked about its plot holes and unexplained events, and its over-the-top action. First off, in my opinion, there were few of these flaws in the movie. I admit there were a few but no movie is perfect. I have watched the movie three times, not because it was the best movie I have ever seen, but to look for these giant holes in the plot and to watch the over the top action scenes. Nothing I saw and noted was that big of a deal to throw the whole movie into the crap pile which is what many people have done. I guess a lot of people don't realize that when these blockbuster movies are created it's not for the people who will look into every nook and cranny of the story and dialogue to find some piece of imperfection. They write it for the average movie go'er. This average movie go'er isn't there to look for the flaws they are there to, in a sense, be put into this movie.If Ethan Hawke hadn't been beating so badly that he couldn't get up and fight back then the next scene of him being hauled off to the hospital would really make the movie less interesting. On the other side if he hadn't received those brutal beatings then his fighting back wouldn't be as enjoyable. Thats what people want to see a glorious fight back, or a tragic fall. In providing the audience with this the writer has to make some adjustments to reality.  Maybe the streets of LA are not correctly portrayed and maybe the way the they went about their police business isn't all realistic, but without these tweaks it wouldn't be a good in your face cop movie. I mean reality can't always be as entertaining as Training Day was.Reading over this I kind of rant, its late and I should be asleep. I hope some who read this can see my point.",Training Day

509,blaff,Heart of Darkness on the streets of LA,6,20 July 2002,I like the movie. I live in LA and saw up close neighborhoods I wouldn't venture into with a panzered Humbvie. But I learned that gangs have a code of honor. The story of a rookie cop Jake (Ethan Hawke) getting his street IQ bumped up a few notches by veteran Narc Alonzo (Denzyl Washington). But is Alonzo the truth the way and the light or a seductive demon? There's enough seduction and mystery to keep us interested. There is a boatload of really good acting between the two leads as they drive around the streets of LA fulfilling Alonzos agenda. Unfortunately the movie has two really week moments for which I suspect director Antoine Fuqua is still taking heat. Both moments are heroic unbelievable revivals of Jake. I suggest Antoine should have made an alternate ending without such a heroic revival and stuck that on the DVD for the viewers who were taken out of their theatre seats and put on the streets of LA. 4 stars.,Training Day
510,slimakasoldado,Great authentic movie,10,4 July 2008,"Although the subject matter in Training Day may be unfavorable to acknowledge, the movie is still significant because of the quality of work throughout this film. One of the most authentic depictions of the streets in recent memory. The gangsters in this movie act like they came right off the corner. I think it is important that people realize that this movie is not at all far fetched when you consider the Rampart scandal and the story of ""corrupt cop"", Rafael Perez and the ""boy scout"" detective that eventually blew the whistle on this corrupted department. Rap fans would be interested to know that this same Rafael Perez and one of his colleagues David Mack have been linked to Death Row CEO Suge Knight and many loosely suspect they had some hand in the rocky events that eventually led to Tupac and Biggie's deaths. Great performances by Denzel and Ethan. To me this movie is hard to look at for some people because the injustice it shows never affected them and in a sense they either feel guilty for it in a way or they just despise the whole environment but whether you chose to accept it or not you can't hide from this movie because the subject matter is relevant and the movie's quality is exceptional.",Training Day
511,dcameli,Denzel deserved his Oscar,8,2 September 2008,"I had never heard of the movie Training Day, until after I saw A Beautiful Mind. Then I had only heard of it because I could not believe how Russell Crowe could have lost the Oscar for best actor. So I researched some critic reviews on Training Day, got my snacks, rented the movie, and sat down to try to figure out why Mr. Washington beat Mr. Crowe.Boy it did not take me long. The very first scene in which Denzel Washington's Alonzo appears, grabbed my attention and made me stand back and say ""Okay, I think I'm going to like this performance"". However, not only was I absolutely blown away by Mr. Washington's potrayl of a cooked cop, but I found the movie to be extremely enjoyable. Ethan Hawke was a perfect contrast to Washington, and the director and writer did a great job of capturing the feel of such a neighborhood.It's still hard for me to say that Russell Crowe did not deserve to win, however after seeing this movie and knowing what a great actor Mr. Washington is, I can honestly say that I have no complaint with his victory. It was a tough decision to make between the two, but in the end I am glad Mr. Washington got his Oscar.",Training Day
512,muhammad-uz-rauf,A Movie 'MADE' for an actor like Denzel,9,26 August 2008,"I love movies like this and Im sure Denzel Washingtons enjoyment of acting in this movie greatly assisted him in achieving the Oscar for best actor. The movie is intense and I can't pass on a picture about a corrupt police officer and who better than Denzel. I was gripped to the screen the entire time. He has always done a great performance with movies involving gangsters and the ghettos, the violent sides of society. His being a police officer added a bunch to the movie and really increased the interest. He is actually a gangster at heart yet is a cop so feels he has power over people and may do whatever he wishes.",Training Day

He had me sucked into his role almost to the point I forgot I was watching an actor play a part. He WAS the part. The movie did a good job of making you argue both sides (or philosophies of police work). It was difficult to sway one way or the other (at least 'til the last 1/2 hour). Good movie, great performance by the cast.",Training Day
514,yo_maxx27,A great movie,10,8 August 2011,"This is one of the best action movies ever. I warmly recommend it to anyone. Honestly, this movie deserves a much better rating. I don't get it how such a movie can get a 1?!?. To give 1 to a movie it means you didn't find anything good in it. Really, there is nothing which is good in this movie? The acting, the costumes, the haircuts, the soundtrack, the storyline ,..., none of this? The problem with this ratings on IMDb is that anyone can vote. Almost all the movies have one star ratings and also ten star ratings. I don't get why some people, only vote to give a bad rating to movie which is good. If you don't like a certain genre of movies you shouldn't watch them. Some time ago I only liked comedies and I didn't bother watching other type of movies, but since I grow up I understood that every movie genre has at least a one good movie. There are good dramas, horrors, comedies, action movies, science fiction movies and so on. So when I rate a movie, I don't let the genre of the movie affect my judgement. For example I'm not really interested in science fiction movies, but there are SF movies which I rated with ten stars because they deserved it. So, in my opinion people shouldn't let the bias affect their judgement when they rate a movie. Training day is a great movie and nothing will change this fact. Also, Denzel Washington is a great actor and the fact he won an Oscar for his performance proves my point.",Training Day

Acting like the problem doesn't exist does not solve it. You don't have to go that deep to know that Alonzo was once a good cop who just got fed up w/ 'police procedures.' If you acknowledge that Jake's shallow-mindedness at the beginning of the film only allows him to look at the perks of making detective and how the progress of the day transforms him, you can really appreciate Ethan's portrayal of him. Let's face it, a bad day at the office when you're a narcotics detective differs greatly from that of an office executive and the different stresses can warrant different results.Even the street rhetoric was authentic. Maybe you guys need to get out of the 'burbs more. You guys didn't actually expect eloquent dialogue with little or no profanity, did you? The only part of this movie I struggle with is Dr. Dre's terrible overacting and that isn't nearly enough to take away from the overall result.",Training Day

As others have mentioned, the scene where Harris is exposed as what he really is, is absolutely spectacular.

Denzel plays a terrific part as Alonzo Harris, a cop with a dark personality.From the moment you set eyes on him you can relies that Alonzo is a feisty character, who will stop at nothing to get what he wants.Ethan Hawke provides excellent backup but Denzel steals the show. I don't want to give an plot lines away but there are only three movies in cinema history I have given 10/10, and this one was so close to being number four.I sincerely hope to see Denzel put in another performance like this one.Plot is excellent as it leads you into false sense of securities and even shouting at the TV set.I loved every breathtaking moment of this film and I am sure you will too.Quite extraordinary.",Training Day

Voila, we have ourselves John-Woo-esquire action sequences, ending all semblance of plausibility.The performances were great.

527,jaysikura,Surprisingly good Cop flick,9,11 September 2001,"In all honesty, I have to admit that I went in to see Training Day at the Toronto Film Festival with somewhat less than stellar expectations. When I walked out I was impressed with what turned out to be a well written, well directed and incredibly well acted L.A. cop thriller. The story focuses on Ethan Hawke's character, a lowly cop being promoted to a narc who goes out on a day of training with an unconventional undercover veteran played by Denzel Washington. I won't say too much more about the plot but I must say that both actors play their roles very well; Hawke is very subdued while Washington is completely over the top. The movie moves at a satisfyingly quick pace and keeps you hooked right until the very end. The film does have its flaws but for a film of its genre they are so few and far between that you barely notice them. If you're looking for a fun way to spend two hours without having to think too hard then go out and see Training Day.",Training Day

And if you like me thought Denzel Washington is always mama's boy you'll be very pleasantly surprised. Add to that some really nice music and a surprisingly decent performance by an actor I normally like to hate - Ethan Hawke - and you have some solid entertainment to look forward to. Macy Gray does a great scene as a mom in the hood. The story takes place in just one day and that is of course not that credible but the story is so gripping and exciting you will not think about that until after you've seen it.

541,not4me2say,What's wrong with this picture?,8,6 October 2001,"There is only one reason why this flick will never have its rightful place in Hollywood history. With great anticipation, I watched Denzel Washington (who I believe walks on water) take on his first roll as a bad guy. Even though his performance was stellar, there was just something significantly wrong with this film throughout. While contemplating the thin line between art imitating life and its opposite, consider the following.A Hollywood good guy who takes on the role of a bad guy is best served by pairing with someone who is also reputed as good. Remember the movie ""Heat""? Ethan Hawke is not that guy.While the movie was set in the most notorious urban jungle, the good cop managed to do some things that simply can't be done by a white cop in a real environment of the same notoriety. Even people from the squeaky clean suburbs know that downtrodden minorities have no love (or trust) for white police officers simply because they are white (the oppressor). I could go on criticizing Training Day for other little quirks, but it really would not matter. There truly is only one reason why this potentially great movie (great like Gladiator) won't ever be regarded as such. Somebody made a fatal casting mistake. If Cuba Gooding Jr. had been the rookie, you can bet that this movie would have been in line for several Oscar awards. As fate would have it instead, Denzel Washington's first performance as a bad guy may go down in history as a forgettable moment. Imagine a sequel to this movie starring Ethan Hawke now as a veteran.

Denzel's character is hard to figure out and its not until the end of the movie that u know what he truly is. But throughout the whole movie u'd try to make guesses on what kind of person he is because of what happens and what he does. Ethan Hawke also played a great performance as a rookie cop who just wants to be detective. The language in the movie is very vulgar. But that just makes it more realistic. And the violence, i'd say there was not much of it. Oh but there were a few pretty violent scenes. I'm used to seeing Denzel as the good guy and seeing him spouting vulgarities and being kinda crooked, its a surprise. But he does it really good to because the whole show is about manipulation and u dunno if denzel's character really is telling the truth or is he just out to play u.

The moral dilemnas and predicaments that arise for the aspiring narcotics officer are real problems that officers must face at times.  The movie portrays how some officers find themselves in the ""underworld"" environment, without ever planning to enter it.The scene in the car, after they do the felony stop on the teenagers, shows how a seemingly strong-minded cop might be manipulated and it all starts there.I was also impressed by the realism as far as police work.  The way the suspects refuse to cooperate, the artificial respect of the dealers with the cops, the drug sell hunting, the drug swallowing, the language, etc.If you're a law enforcement officer, especially a patrol cop, this is a REQUIRED viewing.Let's remember that as extreme as the film might seem, most of it happens regularly in the big cities.

This film goes beyond painting the picture of a bad day as an undercover cop; it draws you into a world that is both frightening and intriguing. Denzel is perfectly cast. He does not just make this role better, he makes it possible. The fact that most of us can not conceive of disliking Denzel Washington is precisely what makes Alonzo Harris ( his character ) compelling. The evil of this crooked ""wolf"" is so plausibly wrapped in charm and humanity, that the decision to dislike him is painful. Denzel causes us to empathize with Hoyt's ( Ethan Hawke's ) gut wrenching dilemma - the audience is forced into the same, brutal indecision. Hawke skillfully plays his part, and is totally believable. I could identify with his character in every hesitation, and each surrender. All in all, a brilliant film.

553,FijiRevisited,Setting it straight,10,12 April 2007,"Let me start out with this: This movie is amazing. End of story. I've read through the other reviews here, with people nitpicking the movie and finding minuscule ""plot-holes"" that are too stupid to be repeated here, and let me just say: WHO CARES?!?! Training Day is a great movie, and here's why: Denzel Washington. This film is the Greatest Actor in the World's shining achievement, and that alone makes it great. The character of Alonzo is one of the most menacing villains to hit the screen, and it's all because of Denzel. He BECAME Alonzo - almost everything that Denzel says in this movie is purely his creation (and I know - I've read the script.) For those of you who said Denzel was not Oscar-worthy in this film - you are extremely wrong. Just sit down and watch all the clever things he says (that he made up), all the subtle nuances. The scene in the car after they kill Roger is one of my favorite scenes of all time, because he goes from ghetto and evil to sweet and almost fatherly. The shift is brilliant, and Denzel pulls it off completely.Like I said above, picking out irrelevant ""plot-holes"" is pointless...every single plot-hole that was brought up in other reviews has a logical explanation, but people are so against this movie that they feel they need to find some need to tear it apart, and since they can't tear apart Denzel's amazing performance, they focus on minuscule plot elements. This movie is GREAT. It's a gripping tour into a side of the streets we aren't exposed to, and Alonzo is our guide. And try and tell me it isn't classic cinema when Alonzo, broken and beaten at the end, puts a cigarette into his mouth and says ""I'm still winnin'...I can't lose...""

554,SjoerdJan,Why do I always favour the bad guy in good & bad cop flicks?,7,11 February 2002,"I rated this film 7 out of 10. I enjoyed watching it, but it isn't so great as to stick out above the rest of the films in the genre. Personally I often favour the bad guy in good vs evil flicks, and this one's no difference. Alonzo (Denzel Washington)is a real badass slick-talking-smooth-walking copper. He's got ""bad cop"" written all over him and his wrong car and clothes I liked it. And of course his counterpart Jake Hoyt(Ethan Hawk) is the obligatory goody-two-shoes rookie on his first (and only, as far Alonzo is concerned) Training Day on the job as a narc. [SOME (a wee bit) SPOILING AHEAD, SO WANNA-WATCH-AS-A-VIRGIN TYPES STOP HERE] Believe you me, Alonzo really proves to be a bad number, and of course he tries to drag Hoyt along and prevent a way back to good coppers land. And of course this will not stick in the end. I would like a film on this subject where the bad cop is less obvious and the good cop is a badass himself too. I hate the goody 2 shoes types like Hoyt, it's so, emm well, obvious and thus boring. Enough complaints, it's a good flick, lots of badass action, junkies dealers pimps and ho's, and some no go neighborhood shots! Enough pace to keep you at the edge of your seat for the 2 hours it lasts, a great killing scene and mis-en-scene and a satisfactory getting-rid-of-the-bad-character scene. 'nough said, go watch it an U be the judge! Denzel gets a 9 out of 10, Hawke 6/10. Notice Dr Dre and Snoop Doggy Dog as Paul & Blue (if you dig these fellas)!",Training Day

Certainly the finest performance of Ethans career that truly deserved an Oscar. ""a genuinely caring and good intentioned leader""!!! What film was he watching? The guy was corrupt through and through.Denzil makes some brilliant movies but he always plays the same character. Don't get me wrong - his I cant criticise his performance.

A good thing about this movie is that it gets straight into business. There's no hanging about in this film. The film follows a rookie cop (Ethan Hawke), trying to make his way up in the world, but first he has to go through a tough narcotics officer (Denzel Washington) to get there. All seems to be going well until secrets start to emerge and conciences start coming into play! Dr Dre, Scott Glen and Snoop Dogg also star in this action thriller. Packed full with excitment, suspence and some sweet tunes from artists such as Dre and Nelly, Training Day is not for the faint hearted! 10 out of 10.",Training Day

Formula, formula, formula!  (At least in most blaxploitation movies, the hero gets to be black!)Fantastic performances and a high budget help it to stand above other films in the genre. Now, I really enjoy Pam Grier movies, Dolemite, Cleopatra Jones, Shaft, and so on.  I can watch those and have a great time. I also enjoyed Training Day, but let's be real about what kind of film this is.  At its core, it is blaxploitation.
*** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD ***Stock characters fill the script: a lone hero who is pure of heart and wants to clean things up, a collection of bad guys with one really bad guy who leads them that's in it for the money, and ultimately ""whitey"" is in control (the nice, older white gentlemen Alonzo meets in the club.) Unimaginative dialog is  characteristic of the genre and that detail wasn't overlooked here.

559,eb03,Great Performances,8,26 March 2002,"Training Day is a gritty character-based crime drama.  It focuses on a rookie cop, Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) hoping to make a strong impression on the leader of a group of LAPD undercover narcotics officers, Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington).  As Hoyt's training day unfolds he is faced with moral dilemmas with what he was taught in his past training and what Alonzo says and does.  Alonzo's policing methods toe the line between ""good detective work"" and ""illegal.""The interaction between these two characters is really the heart of the movie, and Washington and Hawke play their roles brilliantly.  Washington definitely deserves his Oscar for this performance, as he constructs Alonzo as a very over-the-top cocky veteran who believes that his way is the only way of doing things.  Hawke's character is a perfect foil to this, as he's subdued and uneasy as he faces tough choices but also hopes to make a strong impression on Alonzo to advance his career.The plot develops very nicely, and I recommend watching the movie twice because the second time around, there are small details that you notice which all tie in to the ""chess game"" that develops in the film.  Also watch the DVD for insightful directors commentary from Antoine Fuqua.  It provides interesting background on the acting of Hawke and Washington and the realism of the undercover cop and gangbanger characters.  Strong acting by musicians Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Macy Gray in their limited roles.  Each created memorable characters.To sum it up, great acting, great directing, and a great movie.  It's a shame I missed it on the big screen.",Training Day

He made me believe he was a crooked narcotics officer with no regard for anyone but himself, yet I was mysteriously attracted to him and repelled to him at the same time!The psychological and physical games orchestrated and performed by Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington) on just about every character in the story were both believable and brilliant.The story does teach a lesson, ""What goes around, comes around!""

It was fun to feel his fears and his awe with him as he spent the day with the Machiavellian Washington.I would give this film 3 out of 4 stars.",Training Day

He(Denzel) does a really good job playing a crook , corrupt cop who takes advantage of his position to commit crimes... and he also uses his apprentice , a rookie cop called Jake(Ethan Hawke) to do something the he(Denzel) has set up... Frankly , i seriously think this was one of Denzel Washington best performance ever and that movie should be considered as a classic gangster movie...However, I think that the ending is great but could have been different , less brutal...Anyway, if you are someone who likes crime , gangster movies you'll will really appreciate this movie",Training Day

Until when can you tolerate the bad society without to really became part of?13 years is too long time!Undercover cop Alonzo Harris(Denzel Washington)after the 13 years spent together with criminals,drug dealers and offenders became a criminal too. The corrupt cops like Harris appeared with the cop movies but earlyer in secondary roles.Afther the movies like Copland and L.A.Confidential we know that corrupt cops does exist.After 24 hours together with his superior Alonzo Harris,the rookie Jake Hoyt(Ethan Hawke) will be convinced about this thing.Jake has one day to prove that he is a 'good' cop but he will be pulled deeper and deeper in Alonzo's world,and his life will be changed forever.At the begining he don't knows that his life is in danger,but in the next hours he will run for his life.Housband and father,man of justice,he don't understands Alonzo's actions,he can't cheat,steal or perpetrate a crime.Thinking about his job and his family he respects the orders but when he finds himself responsable of a crime comited by Alonzo takes gun in his hand and starts hunting his superior.Hawke's acting is very good but is a 'shadow' behind Washington's character.Cruel and arrogant,he is Mr.Cool(like John Travolta in 'Swordfish').Denzel Washington is a great actor,this movie is one of his bests. He usually don't plays negative roles but he is the ideal actor for Alonzo. This suspenseful actiondrama is of the 2001's bests,the story reflects the truth,the play of the actors is great and the soundtrack can't be missed. It is recommended for every Denzel Washington fan!Rating:9/10",Training Day

Well Ethen Hawk is a good supporting actor and this combination of the two opposite makes this movie even better. I like this movie because it shows you how thing aren't what they seem and how croocked the system can be. I don't think anyone else could've played these roles better.

Denzel seems really comfortable in his role as bad cop and Ethan Hawke is the perfect casting for the insecure rookie that gets confronted with challenge and choice between good and bad every 10 minutes or so in the movie. What I also find really well done is the fact that the entire movie takes place during one day and not more. It really adds to the tension and realism of it all.Wonderful movie...anyone who likes action without too much special effects will love this movie.",Training Day
567,thebrightwhite,"an Oscar?, what were they thinking ?",5,20 August 2013,"I think that I have spent too long watching this film so I do not intend to make this take up more than 3 minutes: I like the director, I love the lead actors, I love the genre, and I have been advised by many to watch this accordingly. But This film was incredibly dull, offensive in its blandness, and predictable and more than anything else what surprised me it has absolutely no intelligence on any level at all. Gee when I think what we got from for example 'the inside man'. Now there was a film: smart, slick, engaging, unpredictable, characters I could believe, and the feel of New York. This movie at most may offer a slice of the dark side of corruption in LA told by a relatively convincing palette of actors but there were far too many problems here that sank this movie for me: Denzel Washington was too self-conscious in many places, Ethan Hawke was oddly more convincing than Washington all around. This emphasis on ''nothing is as it seems'' was played out for me by the first 40 minutes when there just seemed to be no plot other than here is a typical ''non typical'' training day: whatever!!! It was insulting! Surely this film cannot grab anybody with any imagination. I'd prefer to watch sly Stallone or Steven Seagal any day if I wanted mindless dross like this, at least those alternatives can be funny or amusing on a certain level. My time is up, or rather its time is up, and I wasted too much time tonight on this already. Happy to kiss this one off guys (btw I rarely make a negative review but I had to let this one out despite the Oscar for Washington), what were they thinking!!! :)Good luck!",Training Day

From watching Denzel in other films, i never thought that i could ever see him play the antagonist. But to my surprise he did a wonderful job. The way that he allowed us to see that his character was this brutal, uncaring person that was only looking out for himself; its what makes him such a stupendous actor.I also have to say that the film was very well directed. this movie was authentic, it shows some of the things that happen in real life and in the real world. some of the pressure that is put on some police officer in the corrupt world of the law.It is good to know that there is some officer that would still rather do the right thing, just like how Jake (Ethan Hawke) did.Nevertheless in my opinion this is the best movie all of the actors in training day have worked in.",Training Day
571,wheat04,Training Day Review,7,20 June 2010,"Director Antoine Fuqua did Training Day justice in this crime drama. The story starts as a rookie narcotics officer Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) first day with a corrupt veteran detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Jake is stunned by the methods that Det. Alonzo uses in his daily routine. Because Jake wants to become narcotics office he follows Alonzo instructions. As the story unfolds it is found out that Alonzo is in debt with the Russian mob and they have a deadline on when he must pay them back or he will be killed. This causes Jake to be thrust into Alonzo world of using drugs, stealing, and even killing. This film is centered on the theme good versus evil. Jake is the naive rookie narcotics officer trying to bring down the overbearing corrupt veteran detective Alonzo Harris. The cinematography was great in showing this. The camera angles and lighting were great for the fact that it showed the desperate measure that Alonzo was willing to through in order to pay back the money and save his life. A few scenes stood out as very powerful scenes in the movie. In the beginning of the movie Alonzo with a gun forced Jake to smoke PCP. Little did Jake know that this was part of a big plan Alonzo created to get out of debt. The use of slow motion was awesome as Jake smoked the PCP. There was also the use of different colors in the lighting. It showed how zoned out Jake was. Another scene in Training Day was where Alonzo was cornered by the Russian mob there was misty fog. The lighting was very dim and then the gun shots rang out. Hundreds of bullets were let off. This was a very powerful scene in the movie.This is a great must see movie. Highly recommended.",Training Day

Parents beware: the level of bad language used leaves nothing to the imagination! On a side note: YOU GET TO SEE EVA MENDES COMPLETELY NAKED!!!!

574,craneger,Alonzo's betrayal . . .,8,24 November 2010,"There is one quick line in this feature that is pivotal to the plot: when Alonzo takes Jake to see Roger, the dealer, Roger asks Alonzo about the Russians. Roger says, "" . . . you know I've got your back."" So, think about the irony: Roger was promising Alonzo protection from the Russians; if Alonzo had not killed Roger, he would have been safe! This, I believe, is the supreme irony of Alonzo's reckless campaign to save his life by killing the one man who was prepared to save him. The hubris that Alonzo demonstrated is a symptom of his arrogant self-reliance - he planned everything in order to get his money, with no thought for the lives of those whom he used to achieve it. And this ties back to the joke Roger told Jake about the snail: Alonzo is like the snail in that he thought he could go anywhere or do anything without being stopped!",Training Day

Then we had the Hispanic/Black street gang members primarily portrayed as bad guys but then assisting rookie to get to Alonzo , so were they then doing good ? Not a traditional American cop movie , as there was no clear distinction between bad guys and good guys and as there usually is a very clear one I thought Training Day was quite radical for the USA , as it portrayed a mix of bad/good guys doing bad and good , so who was the good guy ?",Training Day

579,chuchog,A magnificent depiction of a shady world,9,13 December 2005,"The magic of the movies is that they allow us to see worlds and experience emotions that are sometimes distant from our own and our immediate environment. Antoine Fuqua in Training day brings to us a world of gangs, drugs and corruption that is alien to must of us, but which nevertheless exists, sometimes transcending its own borders and coming to us in the form of news (The rampart scandal) and no matter if we close our eyes and ignore it, it will not go away. In that world we have two police officers, officer Hoyt, a rookie just assigned to an elite anti narcotics unit, and officer Alonzo, a veteran of the force, commanding the unit. Each one of those officers has his own set of values and morality, but no one is completely good or completely evil as absolute evil or absolute good are inexistent (in humans at least), ultimately they just want to take care of their own problems. Hoyt wants to take care of his family, his young wife, his new born child, he wants to escalate positions (don't we all) in the force and this new assignment may be the perfect place to start and he will do anything to nail it. Officer Alonzo has a more complicated set of problems, he has to get a million dollars and he has to do it today; otherwise he will be killed by the Russian mafia, but he has a plan and the plan involves Hoyt (a virgin shooter above suspicion) and Roger (a drug dealer with a lot of money in his kitchen floor). Basically the movie unfolds as Alonzo's plan goes into motion showing us glimpses of a corrupt and disturbing world, a world with its own rules and twisted morality, Smiley forgiving Hoyt's life as a return for having protected his cousin's honor, gang members shooting indiscriminately to protect the sandman's property, Stan and his friends giving Alonzo carte blanch to basically kill Roger and steal his money so he can save himself, etc. Denzel Washington work was impeccable; a well deserved Oscar, showing us a man who has moved the line a little bit each time to the point that he doesn't know where he is now, a man who has moved to the edge in a desperate attempt to save his life. Is he really that bad? After all he is a father, a husband, a friend appreciated by his team (if you think you can get away with it, we are with you) and colleagues. Maybe we just caught him in a bad day...a training day. If we want to make a better society for every one, we have to know what are the obstacles we have to overcome, training day show us some of those obstacles and then some.",Training Day

Ethan Hawke also did a great job playing a character that is a kind-hearted person who knows right from wrong. This is a dark movie that will leave you guessing, and will leave you on the edge of your seat.

It is actually a journey into the real world of the streets of LA as it is presented by prestigious detective Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington). Hoyt soon realizes that Alonzo's methods are far from legal. All through his training day, he finds himself having to choose between his ethic and what Alonzo tells him what he should do, because the real world is a ""jungle"", and one has to be a ""wolf"" to survive in it. So, according to Alonzo, an officer could co-operate with drug dealers, steal money and even murder as long as he succeeds in his primary mission. Hoyt never seems to agree with this and when he finds out that the training is in fact a setup, he has to come after Alonzo. In the end Alonzo dies as a wolf because in this kind of game there is always a greater wolf.This was a really interesting movie. It shows a completely different aspect than the ideal world of police in the US as it appears in many other movies or TV shows. There is also an excellent performance by Denzel Washington.

Hawke could be seen as the ultimate in anti-stereo typical cops, white and legit. the political factors in this film cannot be missed however the film is well shot, well written and well acted apart from Scott Glenn's terrible turn as Roger. the film is a symbol of denzel Washington's rise to the top and the line ""king Kong ain't got nuthin on me"" serves as an ego boast for Alonzo and Washington. Training Day Lacks the real magic however to make it a long time stayer in peoples minds but never the less a good watch.",Training Day
592,zheka212,Denzel's worst movie,1,15 March 2006,"This was probably one of the worst cop dramas I have ever seen. This is one movie Denzel did not deserve anything for -- it was a total waste of time and money at the movies. I think I make a more convincing gangster wanna-be (and I am white and short).Still trying to figure out what the ""movie critics"" see in this one -- it definitely is not the portrayal of a human (or any other dilemma), coming of age, or dealing with one's personal demons.If you ever have an opportunity to watch this movie when you have time to kill and it doesn't cost you anything -- I guess you should go for it -- maybe you'll see something I did not.",Training Day
593,camilleaquene,This is a fabulous movie,10,2 May 2017,"If you're not watching this movie with your boss...you're doing work ALL wrong! Me and my boss love this movie (nope, we're not cops). I'm not going to give any spoilers or anything. It is one of Denzel's better movies in my own opinion, but I'm not a huge fan of his anyway. Due note that the first part is probably exactly what a cop would say. I really am not a cop.",Training Day
594,the_muffler,It's my favourite movie,9,23 February 2006,"I remember being lent this on DVD during the summer holidays by a mate soon after it was out. I must have watched it every day/second day for about a month! I loved it so much I could never get enough. Denzel and Ethan are a perfect match for this movie; I can't imagine anyone else playing their rolls. Can you? You will either love this movie or find it just a way to 'pass a night'. If you connect with it then you'll never forget it. I know I haven't and I haven't watched it since 2002 because I can remember every part in detail! Training Day is one of those movies which breaks new ground in terms of how a movie can come across to people. It was filmed in such locations such as Imperial Courts neighborhood which, until now, hasn't been filmed. The talk is the talk... you get a real sense of what it's like for these guys as narcotic officers and for what it's like for these guys as the 'bad guys' themselves. At the end of they day they're ""Just people and they always were"" (Ethan Hawk in a making of Traning day interview).The movie isn't the fastest paced one around - there are some slow moments but they are played out meaningfully due to some great acting talent which gels the scenes together well. The more you watch it, the more subtle lines and actions you will pick up which make this movie authentic.Overall, to each his own. I have found this to be one of my favorite movies due to great acting, great directing, great casting (Hawk, Washington, Scott Glen etc) and an interesting storyline.",Training Day
595,jordansimpkin2054,Pure Brilliant,10,30 January 2006,"Awesome, one of the best films ever and Denzel Washington does a very convincing portrayal of the cop who crosses the line, but you have to agree with some of his motives. I love when he shoots Roger and Jake freaks out, he makes a very good point when Jake asks why he shot a friend. ""Why was he my friend, because he knew my first name? Roger sold crack to kids and the world is a better place with him dead!"" Every point he makes about modern day ""street"" justice rings very true to modern day crime and justice. It sets the tone very well for an awesome films and all though he is ultimately the bad guy, Alonzo Harris is one of the best characters to every grace the big screen and you can't help but like the guy. There are some great cameos from Dr. Dre and Snoop DoggA true modern day classic. Highly recommended",Training Day
596,willkayl,One of the best cop movies ever made.,10,6 August 2019,"I'm confused by the low ratings...this film is perfect if you're looking for a good, superbly acted cop film. Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke are amazing in this film. And with a stellar supporting cast, this film gets better and better every time I watch it.",Training Day
597,kevdef,"Great Performances, Great Movie",10,29 March 2008,"Without a doubt, Denzel Washington's performance in this movies is outstanding. Nevertheless, a lot of people criticize the plot while underlining that ''Training Day'' is not too great a movie to deserve any other acknowledgment. From my point of view, those statements are false because especially Washington's and Hawke's performances make this movie worth watching, plus, the plot much more interesting. Additionally, director Fuqua did a superb job, which is characterized by a magnificent authenticity in the presentation of Los Angeles' suburban areas. Again, I recommend this movie heavily, if you love gangster movies, then you cannot afford to miss this one. Generally, Alonzo Harris' quotes are legendary: ''To protect the sheep you gotta catch the wolf, and it takes a wolf to catch a wolf.'' - ''This s***'s chess, it ain't checkers''.",Training Day
