0,SnoopyStyle,starts slowly,8,3 February 2021,"It's 1939 Suffolk, England. Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) hires local archaeologist Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) to dig some mysterious mounts of earth on her property. He sees the potential for an unprecedented Anglo-Saxon find. When he makes a big discovery, prominent archaeologist Charles Phillips arrives to take over the dig. He brings in married couple Stuart Piggott (Ben Chaplin) and Peggy Piggott (Lily James). Edith calls in her cousin Rory Lomax (Johnny Flynn) to help.This starts slowly as a two star vehicle. I didn't see much potential for great drama. It seems like a small quiet English indie and that would be fine. Quite frankly, the whole cast hasn't even shown up yet. That small story does slowly become more. It becomes a romantic melodrama, an emotional tragedy, a family drama, and a war epic. I think the moment that Lily James shows up is when the movie announces that this movie wants to be bigger. Everybody is performing together to form the story into a beautiful ball of twine.",The Dig
1,Prismark10,The Dig,5,27 February 2021,"The Dig is based on historical fact and then the filmmakers had to construct a screenplay to turn it into a movie.It is certainly a film of two halves. Landed widow Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) invites excavator Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) to tackle the large burial mounds at her rural estate in Sutton Hoo.The dig uncovers an undisturbed ship burial with a wealth of Anglo-Saxon artefacts rather than Viking.Once it is uncovered others arrive such as Charles Phillips (Ken Stott) from the British Museum who takes charge and takes credit for the work.The first part is interesting and is beautifully shot. I remember doing Sutton Hoo at history at school.There was certainly mutual respect between the sickly Edith and the lower class but clever Basil. He forms a fatherly attachment with her son, introducing him to astronomy.The film comes to a grinding halt in the second half when the story is done. All of a sudden the focus moves to the impending outbreak of world war 2 and the other side characters.There is a totally pointless fictional romantic subplot involving Peggy Piggott (Lily James) who has come to help in the dig with her new husband Stuart.While Stuart is busy enjoying the company of other men at the pub as it turns out he is a closeted gay man. Peggy forms a bond with Edith's dashing cousin Rory who has been photographing the dig.There was a good drama here of how once again. The contribution of an ordinary, determined clever man from lower class roots is overlooked.",The Dig

Edith is ill and has a son Robert who wants to help.If you read the by-line you know what they discover. They create a little drama around it. But hey, it is all about folks digging in dirt.

3,kosmasp,Can you dig it,8,26 April 2021,"I mean I am only surprised that not at least 90% of the reviews have this not as their summary line. That aside we have a movie based on something that actually happened ... a finding that may feel significant to you or it may not. Though if it is the latter ... well I reckon you can still find this enticing. I was not awar of the histoy behind this and could still ... dig it.I had to do it one more time. You have to keep digging - ok that's it for now though. Great performances and a drama revolving around a woman and a man and ""mission"". Not to mention personal trouble and issues one has to overcome ... so you know quite essential. As you can tell I can not tell you how close this is to what actually happened or how much exaggerated it is ... still if you like dramas this will be right up your alley.",The Dig
4,Sleepin_Dragon,I loved every minute of this film.,9,5 February 2021,"What a fascinating, unusual film this was. The story is different, but totally captivating.A film that can truly be loved by the whole family, themes that are a suitable for all, with a story and series of events I can imagine many enjoying.It is fascinating that the events of this film coincide with the start of the second world war. It doesn't focus massively on the undertones of WWII, but it simmers in the background until the latter part of the film.It looks exquisite, the production values are fabulous, and best of all, the acting. Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes are both superb, many other top notch performances elsewhere, always great to see Ken Stott.It's not the usual kind of film I go for, but I was won over in minutes, this is an exceptional film.Loved it, 9/10.",The Dig
5,classicsoncall,"""We're digging down to meet the dead.""",8,28 February 2021,"On the brink of Britain's entry into World War II, self trained archaeologist Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) is sought out by land owner Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) to excavate and investigate what look like ancient burial mounds on her property. Starting out as virtually a one man operation, Brown's early findings pique the interest of the local Ipswich Museum, and eventually gains the attention of Charles Phillips (Ken Stott) of the British National Museum. It's not until the end of the picture that we learn the name of the Sixth Century Anglo-Saxon discovery which came to be known as the Sutton Hoo Treasure, a burial ship with related antiquities dating back much further than originally expected. A number of human interest stories are inserted into the picture to humanize the participants, as Ms. Pretty faces her own mortality with a debilitating illness, while Mr. Brown takes a favorable liking to her young son, an enthusiast of astronomy for which Brown is a willing mentor. As the film progresses, the commoner Brown maintains a stoic resolve against the elitist pretensions of Charles Phillips, and is favored by Ms. Pretty to receive the proper credit for his discovery. The film makers opt to sentimentalize the end of the picture with Britain's entry into World War II, as Ms. Pretty bequeaths the fantastic find as a gift to the British Museum, where it would be seen by the most number of people. Held in safekeeping during the War in an underground location, the Sutton Hoo was finally exhibited nine years after Edith Pretty's death in 1942.",The Dig
6,lee_eisenberg,I wonder what England used to be like,9,10 February 2021,"I had never heard of the archeological dig in Sutton Hoo, so that made ""The Dig"" even more of a treat. Focusing on both the excavation of Anglo-Saxon artifacts and the relationship between the digger (Ralph Fiennes) and the landowner (Carey Mulligan), the movie has a lot in store. The setting on the eve of World War II further raises the stakes.The story also draws attention to the Anglo-Saxon culture. It's worth noting that the Anglo-Saxons weren't England's original inhabitants, but became the dominant culture after invading. Their language - often called Old English - looked like Icelandic (the Norman invasion of 1066 made English more like the Romance languages); there's even an Anglo-Saxon Wikipedia. It would be neat to see what English would like today if the language hadn't changed (for example, we would still have the letter Æ).But anyway, it's a fine movie. An intriguing story and great performances all around. Definitely see it.",The Dig
7,jboothmillard,The Dig,5,2 April 2021,"Mark Kermode talked about this British film on BBC News The Film Review, I liked the look of the cast, and it sounded like a relatively interesting fact-based story, and its recognition at the British Academy Film Awards drew me to watching it. Basically, set in 1939, Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) is a widowed landowner in Suffolk with a set of large burial mounds at her rural estate in Sutton Hoo near Woodbridge. She hires local self-taught archaeologist-excavator Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) to unearth whatever is buried. Brown is told by his former employers that there is more important work to do on a Roman villa. But Brown is convinced that the mounds could be Anglo-Saxon rather than the more common Viking era. Working with assistants from Pretty's estate, Brown slowly excavates the more promising of the mounds. One day the trench collapses on him, but they dig him out in time. Meanwhile, Brown ignores daily letters from his wife, May (Monica Dolan) and spends time with Edith and her young son, Robert (Archie Barnes). Edith struggles with her health, warned by her doctor to avoid stress. Brown is astonished to uncover iron rivets from a ship, making it the burial site of someone tremendously distinctive. Prominent local archaeologist James Reid Moir (Paul Ready) tries to join the dig but is rejected; Edith instead hires her cousin Rory Lomax (Johnny Flynn) to join the project. News of the discovery soon spreads as the site is declared to be of national importance. Cambridge archaeologist Charles Phillips (Ken Stott) arrives and takes over the dig by order of the Office of Works. As war approaches, Philips brings in a large team, including archaeologist Peggy Piggott (Lily James), who uncovers proof that a buried ship found is of Anglo-Saxon origin. Brown is demoted to only keep the site in order, but Edith intervenes, and he resumes digging. Brown discovers a Merovingian Tremissis, a small gold coin of Late Antiquity, and Philips declares the site to be of major historical significance. Philips wants to send all artefacts found to the British Museum, but Edith, asserts her rights, concerned about war raids in London. An inquest confirms Edith is the owner of the ship and its priceless treasure, but she despairs as her health continues to decline. Peggy's husband Stuart (Ben Chaplin) has neglected her, so she starts a romantic affair with Rory, which is halted when he is called into action by the Royal Air Force. Edith decides to donate the treasure unearthed to the British Museum, requesting that Brown be given recognition for his work. She dies in 1942. The treasure was hidden in the London Underground during the war. Nine year's after Edith's death, the treasure was first exhibited, but without Brown's name. It is only in recent years that Brown's full credit for his contribution has been recognised; his name is now displayed permanently alongside Pretty's at the British Museum. Fiennes gives a good simplistic performance, Mulligan is likeable, and James is okay. I will agree that the romantic subplot is distracting, but the historically important excavation story is interesting to see play out in a very British fashion, overall, it is an alright drama. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Outstanding British Film of the Year, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and Best Make Up & Hair. Worth watching!",The Dig
8,searchanddestroy-1,Refreshing sadness....,9,11 March 2021,"What a beautiful, moving story and film, and acting....I was stunned by this feature, and I realized that it was real good for mental health to discover such gems from time to time. That's unfortunately not the kind of film that audiences in theaters will come to see, at least not the bulk audiences. There is not real love interest here, not as in other films, I mean. This is a so sensitive and poignant story, so unexpected story telling. Thanks Netflix for having released this movie.",The Dig
9,CinemaSerf,Touching efforts from Mulligan and Fiennes.,7,31 January 2021,"Just as the rumblings of the start of WWII start to be heard, some excavations on the Suffolk estate of Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) start to reach the ears of the Department of Works. It turns out that the local enthusiast Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) has discovered the remains of a 6th Century, Anglo-Saxon, ship remarkably preserved. The authorities - in the guise of Ken Stott - arrive to ensure all is preserved properly, much to the chagrin of those doing a perfectly adequate job until then, and when a golden horde is discovered, everyone starts to realise the significance and magnificence of their find. Mulligan is super as the ailing lady who must reconcile what is best for the treasure with bringing up her own young son (an engaging Archie Barnes) who knows she is ill, and who has taken quite a shine to Basil over the course of the dig. It's based on true events, though the characterisations have been somewhat adapted to introduce a bit of a love angle with Ben Chaplin (Stuart Piggott) and Johnny Flynn (Rory Lomax) gently vying for the attention of Lily James (Piggot's wife Peggy). The performances are largely competent and it is a good looking period drama, with plenty of quality production effort and a decent, if hardly groundbreaking, script. The factual history is a little compromised by the romance, but not significantly and Simon Stone has managed to create a film well worth watching.",The Dig
10,Calicodreamin,Beautiful,8,7 February 2021,"A really beautiful and enjoyable film, great acting and an unusual storyline. The characters were well cast and well acted, I felt emotionally involved in the story. Great cinematography and use of voice-over during scenes.",The Dig
11,evanston_dad,Tasteful and Dull,5,2 February 2021,"""The Dig"" is tasteful and thoughtful and competent and......a bit dull.It's the kind of movie that people who don't watch a lot of movies think an art film should be. It has a sheen of intelligence just by taking place in an English period setting and starring a bunch of people with British accents. It looks pretty. Everyone seems sad all the time. It's about war. It must be ART!Carey Mulligan is a fine actress, but her character is entirely defined by one word: DYING. So how much fun can that be? Ralph Fiennes is, no surprise, excellent. Lily James brings the film some spunk, or tries to, but the tone of unrelenting moroseness does her in. The film is about a fascinating topic, but did it have to be quite so gloomy?There's nothing especially wrong with it, but at the same time there's not a whole lot that could inspire me to recommend it to anyone I know.Grade: B-",The Dig
12,deloudelouvain,Not bad in this genre.,6,9 February 2021,"The Dig isn't a movie I would normally go for, as drama isn't the genre I enjoy the most, but it's also a biography what makes it interesting to watch. It's a story that is worth to be told, that is easy and pleasant to follow. The cinematography is simple but effective, nothing spectacular, just flawless and professional. The acting from the whole cast is what makes this movie a good movie. Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes were both very good in The Dig, but so were the rest of the actors. Just don't expect a lot of action in this movie, it's a drama with an interesting biographical plot.",The Dig
13,siderite,"Beautifully shot, well acted and based on real events, but...",8,4 April 2021,"The film is based on John Preston's novel with the same name and covers the story of the discovery of an anglo-saxon ship used as a burial site, possibly for king Rædwald of East Anglia. Fiennes nails it again with his understated yet very thorough acting (Suffolk people even credited him for his accent), Carrie Mulligan was great, but let's face it: it's an attempt to make digging in the dirt for two years dramatic and interesting. The movie is full of metaphor and in a way it tries to be also an archeological artifact, a snapshot of British life before the beginning of the war. You have your low class people working away from their family, the dutiful wives, the drama of having to hide your sexuality, the large inherited lands that rich people had, the beginnings of the age of technology, the excitement and fear for the future with the war coming and so on.So, it was a clearly well done film, good production value, great acting, historical storyline. It wasn't meant to entertain in the classical sense of the word, so do not expect that and you will enjoy it. Not everything was good, though. Lily James' character felt like a side story that could have easily been abandoned or expanded, for example. As it was, it felt plastered on. Also the technical aspects of the dig were kind of in the same boat (pardon the pun): they felt both too much and not enough. I guess it is difficult to make archeology fascinating.Bottom line: good film, have to be in the mood for this kind of take.",The Dig
14,Cineanalyst,Buried Treasure,7,30 January 2021,"""The Dig"" is a fascinating story, it being about a WW2-era excavation of buried Anglo-Saxon treasure, and it's apt that much of the surrounding drama revolves around exploration, impending death and preservation for posterity. A costume drama set in the past about exploring the past, where ancestors once explored the seas and pilots now fly in the skies.I'm less fond of the editing style that has audio of conversations overlapping silent moments, although the cinematography and production design stand out. Unfortunate for a Netflix release, it sometimes has the appearance of video lag, as though the the audio and picture had only become out of sync due to a poor internet connection. Otherwise, it doesn't seem much better than a confused imitation of Terrence Malick-esque ruminations, such as in, say, the recent WW2-era ""A Hidden Life"" (2019). I'm not sure what the filmmakers were trying to go for here, either--maybe that cinematic editing travels through time much like the burial grounds, but I don't think it's effective.Besides that, Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes lead a fine cast. Both face their own mortality at one point or another while uncovering the ancient graveyard. Other characters, including a romance with a drafted pilot and a homosexual husband, some of which appears to be added fiction in this based-on-a-true-story, also call attention to the fleeting nature of life by seeking happiness or meaning while it lasts. And, of course, the archeological find itself is the greatest series of artifacts from the deceased preserved for posterity. This goes to one of my favorite analogies of film-as-death, including as recorded ghosts for future generations to see. ""The Dig"" reflexively alludes to this through the still photography taken within the movie of the excavation. That the movie replaces the historical photographers of the event with a would-be soldier in the deadliest war in history may further underscore this. So apt is this that it largely compensates for any pacing or technical imperfections in the picture.",The Dig
15,A_Different_Drummer,Mulligan extraordinary as usual,7,30 January 2021,"This film is throwback to the classic British dramas where a look or a sigh or a nudge is more important than anything actually happening in the story. Not for everyone, but brilliant if that is your cuppa. Mulligan in recent times has portrayed everything from an American teenager to a London copper and continues to excel.",The Dig
16,tabuno,A Solid Period Piece About A Major Archeological Discovery With Interpersonal Emotion,8,5 February 2021,"This period piece based on true events depict the discovery and excavation find in Britain just prior to and during the beginning of World War II. The movie depicts an amateur excavator hired by a widow to investigate some mounds of dirt on her property. The set design is well conceived, the acting polished and maybe well understated. The relational interactions between the primary characters are fascinating as they do not fall into any of the contrived script contraptions to great effect. A subplot involving a young lady archeologist and her relationship with her husband bordered on being a uninvited distraction, but seems to blend acceptably well into the movie as a whole. This movie is both exciting and revealing, but in the wet, gray weather also exudes a rather somber sad tone throughout.",The Dig

Basil Brown found and excavated a 7th-century Anglo-Saxon ship something that is considered as one of the most important archaeological discoveries of all time.I liked this movie very much because it was very interesting due to its plot that was based on real events. The interpretations of both Ralph Fiennes who played as Basil Brown and Carey Mulligan who played as Edith Pretty were simply amazing and I believe that they both did an excellent job. The direction which was made by Simon Stone, it was very good and he succeeded on maintaining the audience interest to the end of the movie.

19,cruise01,Beautifully done drama that is slow but decent with its story.,6,1 February 2021,3 out of 5 stars.The Dig is a fair drama film about the 1938 excavation of Sutton Hoo in England. Edith (Carey Mulligan) hires an archeologist Basil (Ralph Fiennes) to dig a site what may be a undiscovered historical site.It was a decent plot. Based on a true story about a discovery. While museums archeologists were after. And wanting to claim what they discover.It is a slow moving film. Slow build up. And a sub plot with Lily James character and her love story that takes place besides the main plot.The cast ensemble was decent with there performances. Carey Mulligan. Ralph Fiennes. And Lily James were all decent with there roles.The setting had a beautiful background of England. Decent story and performances. Definitely a forgettable film.,The Dig
20,eddie_baggins,An enjoyable Netflix drama that loses momentum as it goes,6,7 February 2021,"Shining a light on the little known story behind the important discovery of ancient Anglo-Saxon artefacts at the Sutton Hoo dig site in England during the late 1930's as war threatened to rage on around the peaceful country, Netflix's latest prestige drama is the very definition of an easy watch movie that is one the whole family will be able to enjoy.At times Australian director Simon Stone's film threatens to be something more than this, for the first 30 to 40 minutes the tale of Ralph Fiennes archaeologist Basil Brown's work on Carey Mulligan's widow Edith Pretty's farm land that is based off a hunch she has about the mysterious mounds that are located on her property is one that will grip you in its English countryside beauty and thrill of Brown's early digging on the site but the film sadly starts to lose momentum and focus from here on out as other characters join the fray and the tales focus has awkward shifts that never feel totally earned.Looking to cast a wide net on on those involved with the Sutton Hoo site excavation, the initial intrigue around the job at hand and Brown and Pretty's friendship and working relationship is a strong component of the early stages of Stones film but when the likes of Johnny Flynn's wannabe pilot/photographer Rory and Ben Chaplin and Lily James Mr and Mrs Piggott enter the picture it feels as though Stone and the film lose themselves to subplots and dalliances that vary in their intrigue levels for viewers and The Dig starts to become less about its titular task and more about dramatics that don't add a whole lot of engagement to what was at one stage a focused and gripping true life tale.An element that remains strong throughout The Dig is a collection of strong performances from its talented cast with Ralph Fiennes getting his best role in sometime here as the socially inept Brown while Mulligan is her typically assured self as the ailing Edith.Both performers are reasons why The Dig is so gripping in its initial phases and its a shame they begin to get less screen time together and overall when the likes of Flynn, Chaplin and James roll into the frame. It's not that these performers are in any way bad, its just by the time they arrive we as an audience have already grown attached to the journey's of Brown and Pretty and their respective drive to uncover what could be one of England's most noteworthy cultural discoveries and find meaning in their lives after respective failures, disappointments and heartbreak.Final Say -A film that is beautiful to look at and one that will grip you early with its characters and dirt covered subject matter, The Dig is a solid Netflix prestige offering that suffers from a lack of focus and too many plot strands as it progresses along its merry way.3 tarps out of 5",The Dig
21,Red-125,They couldn't just trust the real story.,7,2 February 2021,"The Dig (2021) was directed by Simon Stone. It stars Carey Mulligan as Edith Pretty. Mrs. Pretty is a widow who lives on a large estate. She is convinced that there's something of archeological significance on her property. She employ Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) to excavate one of the burial mounds. Brown is a skilled and experienced excavator, but he has no formal academic training. The result of his efforts can now be seen in the British Museum.This could have been a great movie, if director Stone had just worked with what actually happened. Naturally, staff of the local museum wanted to direct the excavation, as did staff of the British museum. There was an inquest to decide the ownership of the find. World War II was (literally) about to begin. A perfect 90-minute movie. However, it ended up being a less-than-perfect 105 minute movie.That's because director Stone brings in a (fictitious) cousin of Mrs. Pretty and a beautiful young female archeologist married to a stodgy , unromantic male archeologist. (Guess where that goes?) The inquest--an absolutely essential scene about who owns the find--is botched. You have to work backwards to figure out what happened. Worst of all, you never see the dramatic results of the excavation. You can see them in the British Museum, or online, or on a postcard. However, you don't see them in the movie. (Maybe the British Museum didn't like the movie, and refused to give permission.)All in all, what could have been an excellent movie turned out to be pretty good movie. It's worth seeing as long as you don't expect great things. It works well on the small screen. The Dig has a pretty good rating of 7.3. I agreed, and rated it 7.",The Dig

24,paul-allaer,Watch it for the wonderful performances from Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes,7,20 January 2021,"""The Dig"" (2021 release from the UK; 112 min.) reminds us at the very beginning that this is ""Based On a True Story"". We then go to ""Suffolk, England, 1939"" as Basil Brown arrives at the house of Edith Pretty. Turns out Mrs. Pretty has hired Mr. Brown to do some archeological work on her estate. Her young son excitedly asks Mr. Brown ""Are you going to dig upo the mountain?"". Mr. Brown, taking room and pension at Mrs. Ptretty's house, starts to dig and soon is working his way towards some intriguing finds... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is directed by little known Australian director Simon Stone (""The Daughter)"". Here he brings us a historical drama about what later became known as the Sutton Hoo treasure, one of the biggest archeological finds in British history. The setting of 1939 is pivotal in several ways: of course the threat of WWII is in the air, but even more important, the way of life in those days was just entirely different, and being in a remote English area (near Ipswich) only reinfornces that. So be prepated for a slow moving film, I didn't mind it one bit. Even more critical for the movie is Carey Mulligan's exquisite lead performance. Playing a person who is more than 20 years her senior in real life (Carey is 35, Mrs, Pretty was in her mid-50s in 1939), she does so with grace and style and presence. The role couldn't be more different from what Carey did in the recently released ""Promising Young Woman"", which was in my top 3 of the bests films of 2020. Ralph Fiennes is equally great as the excavator Mr. Brown. Last but not least there is a wonderful orchestral score by Stefan Gregory, who I must admit was previously unknown to me.""The Dig"" opened last weekend in select theaters for a short run before then moving on to Netflix. (Seems like every other new theatrical release these days follows that pattern....) Thankfully the film opened at my art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The early Satruday evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (exactly 5 people including myself). Never mind. If you are in the mood for a good ol' fashioned hisstorical drama featuring outstanding performances from Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater (if you still can), on VOD< or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Dig
25,alindsay-al,An Above Average Well Acted Film,6,1 February 2021,"Another week in Lockdown and another Netflix film to watch and this time it is The Dig and here is my review for it. The premise of the film is based on true events and sees an archaeologist embark on a historically significant dig in The UK.Main Character
Ralph Fiennes is a great actor but this is one of his best yet, he plays Basil Brown and is tremendous. He just nails this performance in his accent is absolutely on point, he really commits to it and does a great job of giving a relatable and likeable character in the lead role here. Carey Mulligan plays the woman who hires Brown for the job and she was also very good, she is a tough woman and I liked the dynamic between the two characters, Mulligan develops as the film progresses and it is effective and that is due to the high quality of her performance.Supporting Characters
There is a decent sized supporting cast but I find it hard to say too much about them, Lily James, Ken Stott, Johnny Flynn & Ben Chaplin all give really solid performances and show they are good actors but they aren't really given anything to work with. For me the film started to focus way more on these characters then was necessary and it took away from the film, it wasn't due to the quality of acting it was just the fact that they were dull characters.Story
The story is interesting, to a point. The first half of them film was the most interesting seeing Brown trying to work out exactly what he is excavating and what it could mean, also this is where Fiennes and Mulligan really shine and their dynamic is the most explored. But there is just no denying that it thinks it is more interesting then it is and falls short. It also doesn't help that in the final act of the film the story focuses more on the supporting characters and Fiennes in particular fades more into the background and it really hurts the film.Script
The script is functional and decent, kind of like this film. There are some decent bits of dialogue and the main characters are well written but there isn't any real big moment that stands out and it does feel like the film does lack some punch to it.Style
The style of the film has good cinematography and good direction showing the landscape of the film and how good the scenery looks for this film because it is a highlight. But this film has a pretty slow pacing to it and at times it moves at a snails pace and it does hurt the overall feel for the film.Overall
Overall, this is an above average film with some really good acting. Though I would say this is only one to give a chance if you like really well acted films with a base in history but for most people this is one you can give a skip.",The Dig

The landscapes within misty sunrises are quite breathtaking and whilst this never gains any great momentum, the build to this world famous discovery is exciting in its way. The romance between James and Flynn is a bit of a distraction in truth, however without it the story might have been difficult to sustain. A gentle charmer of a film.",The Dig

The cast is excellent and all put in great performances, especially Lily James and Ralph Fiennes.
It's not just about an archaeological dig though, it's about past lives, present lives and how things are remembered in the future.
There are also several strands to the relationships between all invloved too, including working relationships, family relationships, class and secret relationships.
I don't know how much of the story is fiction or fact but it is well told either way. All this set with a backdrop of the coming second world war.

31,masonfisk,GREATNESS IN A SMALL DOSES...!,10,3 May 2021,"A Netflix original from this year starring Oscar nominee Carey Mulligan & Ralph Fiennes. Fiennes is a life long digger (hired as a archeological shovel man) so much so he claims he can tell you what kind of dirt exists on a particular piece of land...from a distance. Based on a true story, we find Mulligan, a well off widow raising a son, has grassy dunes on her property & decides (for prosperity) to bring Fiennes in to dig up these mounds to see what's there. At first balking at the paltry sum she offers, they finally agree to 2 pounds a week (!) & on site help to dig up these plots. Of course when he makes an important discovery earlier on (w/a cave-in nearly killing him), the museum cognoscenti, personified by stuffy Ken Stott (who I loved in Jim Sheridan's The Boxer), takes over the site which prompts Fiennes to quit but being he's developed a great rapport w/her (especially her son who during one sequence bikes to his house to plead for him to come back), he returns gaining the respect & admiration of the rest of the excavation team (which includes newlyweds Ben Chaplin & Lily James) since time is of the essence (WWII is soon going to be upon them). The easy going & offbeat nature of the story is quite winning tackling a subject (the time & place becomes paramount as well) most people wouldn't engage in just because of its niche status or something you might find in a dry documentary on the History channel. The leads are quite wonderful, especially Mulligan whose character is slowly dying but manages to get herself to the dig site (seated weakly in a chair) since she knows her time is fleeting.",The Dig
32,dierregi,Poignant without being cloying,8,1 February 2021,"I was glad not to have been turned off by the unappealing title, because this movie is definitely worth watching. Yet another of those plots loosely based on real life, it tells the story of Basil Brown and Edith Pretty, those lives intertwined when Edith asked Brown to excavate in her Suffolk estate with the hope to find valuable archeological remains.With two actors of the caliber of Fiennes and Mulligan in the leads, one would expect the best and they deliver, even if the main plot line seems slightly boring. But the movie is made of nuances and it is also a character study of Brown, an unassuming man who was unjustly overlooked and Edith, a fragile widow whose life is threatened by a serious illness. Luckily the pair does NOT fall in love. Brown is married and could easily be Edith's father. Besides, Fiennes is definitely not at his most attractive here, nor his part requires him to be.When Brown starts to find interesting remains, the British Museums send a team of specialists to Suffolk to take over the excavation. Brown wants to leave but Robert, Edith's son, is bonding with him and Brown is easily convinced to stay by Edith. Brown continues digging with the team, which includes the unhappily married Pigott couple. Edith enlists her cousin Rory to take photos of the site and a mild romance develops between him and Peggy Pigott.Unfortunately for everybody involved, these events take place in 1939, when England was about to being hit by WWII destructing wave.Besides the main cast doing a good job, the film is shot beautifully but realistically in the green, but rainy English countryside. One does feel for Edith, an endearing character with a strong personality despite her fragile health. Even her son Robert, instead of being the usual obnoxious child, is a sympathetic character who reads SciFi on pulp magazines and dreams of space explorations. The scene with Edith and Robert sleeping in the antique ship should melt even the hardest heart.Eventually all the characters have to face life's harsh reality and follow their separate paths. As a reminder to posterity, we have the wonderful artefacts found in the dig, to remind us that even if individuals lives may end abruptly, we share a continuos bond with those who lived before us and those who will come.",The Dig

34,jadepietro,The Good Earth,8,11 February 2021,"IN BRIEF: Fine acting gets slightly plowed over with a melodramatic subplot turn that alters a charming mood piece.JIM'S REVIEW (RECOMMENDED) Understated and a tad stodgy, Simon Stone's The Dig is a conventional but compelling retelling of a true story about an archeological excavation in Sutton Hoo area of England in 1939. Widow Edith Pretty hires Basil Brown to dig up burial mounds on her estate in hopes to find artifacts and hidden relics. Their mission is not remotely greedy or treasure hunting folly. They both have a deep honor for the past and a mutual respect for history. When they uncover parts of a ship, news travels afar and brings others to the site. It also brings more characters and melodramatic entanglements that interfere with the charming main story of the two lead performances.It is hard to unearth the more interesting relationship of the solitary Mr. Brown and his loyal boss from among the unnecessary sub-plotting of this new batch of archeologists, family members, and other interlopers. These intruders include: Edith's handsome cousin Rory (Johnny Flynn), museum curator and historian Charles Phillips (Ken Stott), and Peggy and Stuart Pigott (a plain-looking Lily James and Ben Chaplin), a married couple sent to assist in their services and bring some drama to the proceedings. The problem is that these stock characters all seem to be more contrived plot devices than authentic figures and they take away valued screen time from our two central protagonists.The English countrysides are quite bucolic, lensed as Constable paintings come to life by Mike Eley. Mr. Simon solidly directs and there is a lovely brooding score by Stefan Gregory that sets the right mood. The film is well acted, especially by Mr. Fiennes, Ms. Mulligan, and a charming Archie Barnes as Edith's son, Robert. Whenever they fade into the background, so does the film's emotional impact. Once Moira Buffini's screenplay loses their story-line and focuses on the other less appealing characters and their romantic interplay, the film becomes less interesting and more contrived.The Dig respects its material well enough, and it presents a very engaging tale. But the script needs more depth in its sketchy secondary character's development to give this story its real quest for glory. (GRADE: B)",The Dig

In many way if was self-evident they were trying to aggrandise a really quite boring event, and the obvious insertion of some bizarre sub-plots was done to stretch it into a movie.The acting was comprehensive and Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan were really quite brilliant(and I not a fan of the latter after that terrible body part movie, Never Let Me Go). I'm not sure I was left convinced by the formal interactions, and the ever-so clipped accents, we were in 1939, and serfdom disappeared some years ago! Whilst good there is no Oscar here as neither provided sufficient range within their roles.The movie was just stuffed with stars in minor roles it really was incredible, Danny Webb as a butler, Ben Chaplin as a lesser archaeologist, etc etc, great fun!We just didn't have enough treasure shown to underpin the magnitude of their finds, a silly omission.It was slow slow slow bordering on stop, and in hindsight very little script of note, it was panning camerawork, as if we were interested in Suffolk.Overall I enjoyed movie and am giving is a hard 6, worth a watch.",The Dig

No Viking treasure will free these souls from the inevitability of war.The cast all capture that necessary sense of fragility, as if they could all be snuffed out in an instant.

Don't be fooled by the war setting or clips of spitfires - this is one of those exercise classes you can take sitting down whilst reading a book.
It is also fantastic!The characters are amazing and the acting is superb.
The story is very simple; but because you get to care for all the people involved it has real gravity to it.Issues of the age are there but portrayed in a subtle and meaningful way - a lot of modern movies treat the past in an overly theatrical way, suggesting that anyone who strayed from the ""normal"" was instantly ruined or kicked to death in the street.The British stiff-upper-lip is handled amazingly here - the sacrifices people make to avoid ""causing a fuss"" are significant and heartfelt.
It was nice to see people of the era portrayed as human beings doing what they thought was for the best (even if it wasn't) rather than just evil bullies.
My parents are from that time and, although not as dramatic for screen, their mindset was not so simplistic or barbaric as some would like you to believe.
I really liked the tone of this movie.I watched this with my girlfriend, on a Sunday afternoon after a roast , tucked up on the sofa with snow falling outside.

It stars Carey Mulligan as landowner Edith Pretty and Ralph Fiennes as the self-taught archaeologist-excavator Basil Brown, both of them gave strong performances.
The English countryside is its own character, as the film wouldn't be as amazing if they wouldn't have shown off the gorgeous scenery. The cinematography is incredible, it's beautiful shot with natural lightning, indoors and outdoors are stunning.
The screenplay and overall writing is mostly good, even great at times. But I felt the movie didn't need a romantic storyline that isn't historical accurate, the big changes to Peggy Piggott is another thing I didn't really like as she is supposed to have been an experienced archaeologist and had studied archaeology, for an example. The age difference for some of the actors is something I can look past except for Peggy's husband which should be two years older.The musical score is simple but touching, with its piano and other instruments, Stefan Gregory created a phenomenal score that's so fitting to the film.Archeology is something I have always been interested in and seeing a film doing it in a realistic way was life. I knew nothing of the Sutton Hoo excavation before watching this film, and after doing some research I'm glad Netflix distributed it and gave Simon Stone the chance to direct it, amazing direction and a great film.

There are various tensions and romantic interests throughout the movie as we see if Edith's suspicions are right about what lies beneath the soil. It is one of those movies which is very watchable without you ever really getting enthralled by any of the characters.

Requesting the help of her cousin Rory Lomax (Johnny Flynn) to photograph the effort, the site slowly gives up its Anglo-Saxon treasures attracting the attention of first the Ipswich museum and then the pompous Charles Phillips (Ken Stott) of the British Museum. A battle is on for both the control of the site and the resting place for the treasures found.Against this backdrop there is a critical illness emerging, a son (Archie Barnes) and his attachment to the father figure of Brown and a potential romance between Rory and archaeologist Peggy Piggott, trapped in a loveless marriage.Talent:

+ Young Archie Barnes impresses as the son Robert
+ Cinematography by Mike Eley shows the open Suffolk skies at their best
+ Based on fact, a fascinating historical record of the real excitement of uncovering the past

She plays a much older role than her actual age and an age difference between herself and Fiennes.The film develops especially with the addition of other peripheral characters such as relatives of Pretty, archoeologists from the local museum and national archeologist Charles Phillips, by order of the Office Of Works who demands to take over the project from Brown.The tangents I mean include the failing physical health of Mrs. Pretty. A father/son relationship that develops between Brown and Mrs. Pretty's son Robert.The onset of World War II lingers over the entire project with RAF planes on exercises above the Suffolk countryside and radio broadcasts being heard at several times throughout the film like a modern day news station on loop.A character called Piggy Piggott (Lily James) plays a young archeologist brought in to assist Phillips who develops a love interest with a character called Rory, related to Mrs. Pretty. Piggott herself neglected by her fellow archeologist husband Stuart. Rory himself is awaiting to be called up to active service by the RAF.As I have described above the screenplay does have many external plot lines that can veer the viewer away from the central storyline the excavation of Anglo-Saxon burial artefacts discovered in the mound in n undisturbed ship burial.The original local excavator Basil predicted such artefacts would be found before the area was swamped by 'proper' archeologists from museums.Phillips wants the finds to be taken to the National Museum in London but Mrs. Pretty asserts her rights especially with the onset of air raids in London.
quelle surprise the courts will decide.Edith Pretty's health further deteriorates and eventually she does succomb to heart problems. The artefacts from the site are protercted during the war in the London Underground before being displayed in the National Museum with no mention of Brown's intuition or involvement in it's discovery until very recently.For Fiennes himself it is a far cry from his other varied filmography and he plays the Basil Brown role with gusto.The film does have historical accuracy issues but the main message of Basil Brown's seclusion from the great discovery until recently is valid.",The Dig

There's broad consensus that it's a well-acted and well-shot film despite its shortcomings. With only Days of Heaven under my belt (along with quite a few video essays about Malick's style), the only two rights I have here are to agree that: the comparison made here is valid; and the movie is decent at best. With low-angle, wide lens shots, wind-carried camera coming towards and away from the characters, and detaching the dialogue from the on-screen events that let us hover over the characters, it may well be argued that the technical approach rendered the film said poetic quality and a dream-like feel that implicitly beseech the viewer to give in to the meditative atmosphere that prevails the scene. Alas, this approach seems to be at odds with the most salient plotline in the story, or at least the one it was going for at first: the excavation of Sutton Hoo. For the movie neither probes into the remarkable discovery that forms the supposedly overarching thematic plotline nor does it completely ignore it. The story set it up in a fairly compelling way, only to ditch it quite early for the dramatic plotlines surrounding the two lead characters, leaving the historic achievement merely skimmed over.To be fair, Basil Brown and Edith Pretty are multi-layered characters that reveal themselves more and more as the story proceeds, and I could tell that from the get-go, only looking at Fiennes and Mulligan's sorrow-laden countenances that seem to hide (and actually are hiding) secrets underneath the story would later unravel. Still, the movie wasn't keen on diving into the characters' profiles, leaving much to be desired. Then, out of nowhere, the story shift its focus to another subplot concerning Lily James's Peggy Piggott. It's quite possibly the most interesting segment in the story, and Lily James really gave one of her most riveting performances to date. Be that as it may, this jarring shift from one storyline to another is rather distracting, aggravating the movie's lack of consistency even further, and the fact Mrs. Pretty's storyline was sidetracked for no reason makes it all the worse. Thankfully, and as the story wraps up, the movie finally acquired a discernible identity. The character arcs were mostly tied up gracefully and neatly, the technical prowess at its most thriving, and the film regained its contemplative tone with a dash of weltschmerz tossed in for effective measure. Despite its blatant inextricably linked issues, The Dig is a stunning-looking, great film with even greater performances buried inside a rather muddled one.(7/10)",The Dig
51,tm-sheehan,A Fascinating True Tale. Oscar Worthy,9,17 February 2021,"My Review - "" The Dig "" on Netflix
My Rating 9/10
I have a dear friend to thank for recommending this fine movie today just when I posted my preference for Carey Mulligan to win The 2021 Oscar for Best Actress for her superb role as Cassandra in ""Promising Young Woman.""Carey Mulligan's role in ""The Dig"" couldn't be more different from her role in ""Promising Young Woman.""in which she played a Femme fatale seductress that goes on a revenge spree for the sexual abuse her best friend had suffered.
In ""The Dig."" Carey is cast as wealthy landowner Edith Pretty who hires amateur archaeologist Basil Brown played by Ralph Fiennes to investigate the mounds on her property in England. He and his team discover a ship from the Dark Ages while digging up a burial ground. The archaeologist embarks on the historically important excavation of Sutton Hoo in 1938.This film is based on a true story and both the lead actors give superb performances Carey Mulligan as the frail ill and lonely Edith Pretty mother of young Robert who grows very attached to Basil Brown the archaeologist.
Carey Mulligan is so touching and understated in this role as a woman who wants to see Basil Brown complete his important work that eventuates in one of the greatest Anglo Saxon Viking discoveries ever.
Ralph Fiennes as the Suffolk archaeologist Basil Brown gives one of his finest performances as the archaeologist-excavator Basil Brown who is employed by Edith Pretty to tackle the huge task of excavating the burial mounds at her rural estate in Sutton Hoo near Woodbridge.Lily James plays Peggy Piggott, who uncovers the first distinctively Anglo-Saxon artefact and falls for Edith's nephew Johnny Flynn played by Rory Lomax when she realises her marriage is a sham.
The set design location and camerawork in ""The Dig ""is beautiful to watch an interviewer stated that he'd never seen The Suffolk countryside portrayed so beautifully and I have to agree at times the scenes look like impressionist paintings.
Summing up this film is all I love in a movie great performances ,great direction from Simon Stone and great script writing by Moira Buffini based on a novel by John Preston.""The Dig."" Is a truly enjoyable film I was interested to read that Edith donated the treasure to The British Museum requesting that Basil Brown be given full credit for the discovery she died in 1942.
The treasure was hidden in the London Underground during the war in case of invasion and theft and was first exhibited - without any mention of Basil Brown - nine years after Edith's death. Only recently was Brown given full credit for his contribution and his name is now displayed permanently alongside Pretty's at the British Museum.",The Dig

As an engineer and a science enthusiast myself, I rarely struggle to find some sort of enjoyment in movies based on true stories about scientific discoveries, technological advancements, or impactful historical events. Therefore, despite a premise that doesn't immediately catch my attention, Simon Stone does a wonderful job in making this film quite interesting.Mike Eley's cinematography produces some of the most gorgeous shots of the year, transforming The Dig into a visually satisfying movie to look at. The main narrative focuses on the excavation itself and the findings of a shockingly old (Anglo-Saxon) ship, which turns out to be more captivating than I ever anticipated. However, the romantic subplot involving Peggy Piggott feels out-of-place and rather dull considering the objective of this film. It really hurts the overall pacing, dragging an otherwise well-balanced flick.Moira Buffini's already excellent screenplay is still elevated by the remarkable cast. Fiennes (Harry Potter) and Mulligan (Promising Young Woman) share a heartwarming chemistry that really suits their characters. Lily James (Rebecca) also demonstrates her impressive emotional range once again.

Lily James and Johnny Flynn added an extra layer to proceedings.The most impactful element here was that the film itself began to resemble ""a snapshot"" into the lives of others in a different time and place.

Sometimes it was a bit over the place in that regard because new characters appear and become important, without a proper introduction and in some ways even overtake the importance of the leading protangonists. But other than that its a beautful feature with very nice attributes. Carey Mulligan is fantastic in the female lead and follows up her acclaimed performance in ""Promising Young Woman"" wonderfully. Ralph Fiennes also is great in a very calm but absolutely mannereed and controled peformance. Nice support by Lily James as well.

First of all, I really liked the production design and overall visual look of the film. The Dig is certainly a period piece and the costumes, location and accents really sold the time period the film is set in. Some of the shots and colours shown in the film are very beautiful to look at. I don't have much of an interest in archaeology but I was fascinated by the whole excavation. The score was nice to listen to however I think the film used it too many times throughout.There isn't a whole lot of plot because The Dig is primarily character driven. Due to this, the film moves at slow pace which didn't bother me much but there were a few moments where I wanted it to speed up. There is a lot we learn about each of the characters as the film goes on and because of this, emotion is created as we start to care for each of them. The film does a good job establishing the relationships between characters. I felt the most sympathy for Carey Mulligan's character and her performance made me care for her ever more. Her accent is good and the subtle expressions on her face convey so much about Mrs. Pretty and the way she's feeling. Ralph Fiennes delivers yet another fantastic performance. He's fully believable in the role and plays Basil Brown gracefully. It came as a surprise to me seeing Lily James as I had no idea she was in it. She does a good job but her subplot didn't feel necessary to the main storyline.All in all, I do like The Dig. It's not a film I would revisit but I do think it's a well made period drama with excellent performances and a gorgeous cinematography.",The Dig
59,garethcrook,Marvellous,7,1 February 2021,"Suffolk in the late 30s sets the tone of this film. Suffolk in any era sets a tone to be fair. Ralph Fiennes is Basil Brown, with a thick accent that to at least my ears sounds very convincing. He's here to excavate. Employed by a widower, Mrs Pretty (Carey Mulligan) to find out what's under a series of earth mounds on the seemingly vast property she lives on with her young son. It's considered a folly by others in the field, a distraction from more important projects with a war looming. It's a simple start, to a story that will open much wider. A little mutual appreciation of one another between Pretty & Brown and lots of digging out in the endless Suffolk skies. That's where the tone comes from. There's a relaxed space, a calm, a sense of wonder of the world. It's quite spectacular. Based on a true story, what lies beneath the earth is as spectacular as what hangs above it. I'm not sure I should spoil it, but suffice to say it's something big, something important, something that will see Basil needing some more help. Enter Rory (Johnny Flynn), a ray of energetic sunshine it has to be said, just as we learn that his cousin Mrs Pretty has a condition that means she should be avoiding stress. Not easy when The British Museum wants to muscle in on the dig, upsetting everyone, especially Basil. His face doesn't fit, but his impeccable work earns him some respect, this film though is here to help set the historical record straight. And so they dig, the team growing larger as the warplanes fly above. The supporting cast is very good. Ben Chaplin, Lily James, Ken Scott, they all create a wonderful microcosm of class structure, ego and even sexual tension. Basil has always had his theories about what it is they might unearth. Theories that Charles Phillips (Scott) 'The Expert' debunks time and again, only for it to come clear that our hero Basil was right all along. There's a lot more going on here than the dig itself, as with all good stories, it's merely the vehicle that brings characters together and let's their story be told. Stories of loss, of love, of fear and hope.",The Dig
60,ChungMo,"Two movies in one - one unusual and interesting, the other trite and predictable.",5,16 May 2021,"A rather unusual story of an ""excavator"" (really an archeologist would hasn't gone thru formal training) and an ailing widow with a young boy gets an excellent treatment, from the direction, cinematography and the actors until halfway thru when a new set of characters get introduced and the film shifts gears to a very predictable romance between a young woman married to a stuffy academic and an about to be enlisted strapping young man. The married couple actually makes no dramatic sense as we are not given any backstory as to how this marriage happened or how the wife only now figures out what's wrong.Now if somehow the original characters were integral to this second story it would have been different but it like we are watching another movie that was filmed next door and the actors from the first were asked to come in and be extras.

61,trinaboice,"A slow-burning exploration of discovery, time, and character study",7,19 January 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Based on a true story, this drama tells the historical account of the 1939 excavation of Sutton Hoo near Woodbridge in Suffolk, England. They actually found two medieval cemeteries on the site that date from the 6th to 7th centuries on a homeowner's private property. They found an undisturbed ship buried with a bunch of Anglo-Saxon artifacts. For an archaeologist, that had to have been extremely exciting. This, however, ain't no Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost ArkThe film is directed by Simon Stone and based on a novel by John Preston. It fills in some reimagined holes in the historic excavation. Just like the ship that remained hidden for centuries, the insightful film is a study of characters who are also overlooked by others around them. It's a slow, steady exploration of people and things that disappear in time.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

Respect for things and peopleTHINGS I LIKED:
The movie features some of my favorite actors: Ralph Fiennes, Carey Mulligan, and Lily James. Speaking of Ralph Fiennes, he actually helped to establish a real archaeological field school in England with his brother called The Poulton Project. It's a multi-period site that has special significance because of a medieval cemetery that students excavate every spring and summer! Very cool.
If you want to see two completely different performances by Carey Mulligan, check out her most recent movie PROMISING YOUNG WOMAN. You'll want to watch my review of that movie before you see it though because of its subject matter. Carey Mulligan is sure to receive an Oscar nomination for her outstanding performance in that role where she plays a young, beautiful woman. In THE DIG, she appears 20 years older!
A lot of the camerawork looks like it's hand-held because so many scenes are shot up close and personal, a good choice.
The film is well crafted and beautiful to look at as a period piece.
Be patient while the many layers of the story and its characters unfold.
The emotive score by Stefan Gregory is lovely and effective.
You just might look at artifacts in a museum differently the next time you go.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
It's a VERY slow-moving movie.
Did Ralph Fiennes put a cotton ball under his lower lip or something? Every time he spoke, I was completely distracted, trying to figure out what was going on with his mouth. Don't get me wrong...I still love him as an actor.
Lily James doesn't show up in the movie until almost a full hour into it. I absolutely adored Lily James in the live remake of CINDERELLA. She was PERFECT in it. In that movie, she played the daughter of Ben Chaplin, so it was SUPER weird seeing her kiss him as his wife in this film. I wanted to see more of her story in the movie.
Not a lot happens in this very straight-forward, almost dry telling of history.
Not much humor.
There's no specific villain other than time itself.
There's no urgency to the story. Perhaps that's intentional as time slowly marches on...You can watch my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",The Dig
62,rubenm,"Good, old-fashioned, British period movie",6,31 January 2021,"A movie about archeology could easily become boring. Digging a hole in the ground and hoping to find something interesting is not exactly spectacular stuff from a cinematographic point of view. The great merit of 'The Dig' is that it isn't boring. The film, set in rural England in 1939, is based on real life events, but elements are added for extra dramatic effect. The search for a hidden treasure itself is fascinating, but this film is just as much about the people involved in the dig as about the dig itself.
To begin with, there is the fascinating interaction between the lead character, a self-trained working class man who wants to be called 'excavator' instead of 'archeologist', and the lady of the manor where the digging takes place. This mutual appreciation between two very different people, played by Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan, is the foundation the story is built upon.
But there is also the contrast between the locals and the arrogant archeologist who travels to the scene as soon as he becomes aware of the importance of the find. A third storyline involves the wife of one of the archeologists, who adds a bit of thirties-style sensuality to the proceedings ( a bare midriff!). And there is the looming threat of the war breaking out, visualized by the fighter planes flying over the digging scene, and woven into the story through the character of a drafted photographer.
This is a nice period movie about a fascinating slice of British history. But in my opinion, it lacked focus. There are so many themes and storylines that the film doesn't really make clear what it wants to tell. The positive way of looking at it is to call it a multi-faceted story, the negative way is to call it a hodge-podge of ideas. But fans of a good, old-fashioned, British period movie with strong actors will certainly enjoy it.",The Dig

I know it's not what you want to hear.""The Dig stars Ralph Fiennes as an archaeologist that embarks on the historically important excavation of Sutton Hoo in 1938. Surprisingly, it has been popular on Netflix for the past couple weeks after its release. That might be do to the fact nothing much has been released, and also the stacked cast. With the presence of Ralph Fiennes, Carey Mulligan (who is appearing a lot lately), Lily James, and Johnny Flynn, the acting is top-notch. There are two different character stories going on; one with Fiennes and Mulligan, and the other with James and Flynn. The firsts with Fiennes and Mulligan is more engaging than the other. That's mainly due to the pacing of the movie. For an almost two hour long runtime, it feels a little too long. Every act does have a significant event that picks it up. I felt the first and second were the most eventful. The storyline concerning James and Flynn is good as well. Lily James is great in her role and she's my favorite character in the whole thing. Her storyline, though, is quite predictable and doesn't have enough big events to immerse yourself into it.I should commend this for having amazing cinematography. If the category weren't as stacked as it is this year, and if this were released early enough, this would be considered for sure. The score is nice for the story. The production design and costumes look good. Overall, it's a pleasing movie to look at. Simon Stone hasn't made anything mainstream, so this will for sure get him in the mix sometime in the future. Moira Buffini adapts the novel well. We haven't seen anything from her since 2011's Jane Eyre. The Dig is a well made movie. I don't think this is amazing, but just a good movie. That seems to be the general consensus. If it were a little more interesting rather than a quiet drama about history, I would've been more into it. For what it is, I would recommend The Dig.",The Dig

68,steiner-sam,Making an impact in a field dominated by snotty nobs,7,17 June 2021,"The film is set in 1939 in Suffolk, England, and is based on a novel about the archeological excavation of Sutton Hoo. The film's basic outlines are based on fact, but some characters and a romance needed to be introduced to spice up the story.Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) is a wealthy, widowed landowner in poor health, with a rambunctious young son, Robert (Archie Barnes). Her rural property has some mounds on it, and she hires a local excavator of archeological sites, Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes), to explore what is there. Brown has been an excavator all his life, having learned from his father. Although he left school at age 12, he became an expert on his area's earliest history through correspondence schools and personal reading. He assumes the mounds on Pretty's are burial sites and is astounded when he finds evidence that they include a 6th-century Anglo-Saxon ship in which royalty was likely buried.The story follows various tensions that arise when first Ipswich Museum and then a pompous Cambridge archeologist, Charles Phillips (Ken Stott), try to take over the dig after its importance becomes known. First, Brown is sidelined for a time, but his skill is reluctantly acknowledged, and he makes some additional key finds.The story is ""bolstered"" by highlighting the fraught marriage of Peggy Piggott (Lily James) and Stuart Piggott (Ben Chaplin). Stuart is portrayed as gay, and Peggy finds solace in the arms of Edith's cousin, Rory Lomax (Johnny Flynn), who is helping at the site. Tension is also added because of the impending war that will shut down all archeological activity.Success is found, and artifacts from the important discovery end up at the British Museum. Sadly, Edith Pretty did die in 1942.I'm always curious what movies do with ""facts."" In this case, they had an attractive 35-year-old actress play a woman who was actually 56 years old and in ill health, five years older than Basil Brown, played by 58-year-old Ralph Fiennes. The movie portrays some romantic tension between Edith and Basil because of their shared interest in archeology. Peggy and Stuart Piggott had been married three years in 1939 and divorced in the 1950s, though they maintained a cordial relationship.This was an entertaining film showing a blue-collar, self-taught man making an impact in a field dominated by snotty nobs.",The Dig

A 1938 period piece about the discovery of a treasure trove in a place called Sutton Hoo in a race against time to find the treasure before war robs the dig of its manpower.And it has a similar back story to Mank, in that Feinnes' character does not get the archeological credit he deserves by The British Museum for his work in unearthing the discovery.It's beautifully shot and evokes a strong sense of time and place, but some of the subplots are poorly executed; especially the love triangle that centres on Lily James and Ben Chaplin as a young married couple who aren't actually in love (because Chaplin is gay).That's all a tad clumsy and the whole thing, although spiffing in parts, doesn't quite make the cut.Fodder, but palatable fodder.",The Dig

Director Simon Stone also impressively crafts phenomenally edited sequences (thank you Jon Harris) to capitalise off of these impactful moments of dramatic tension, exacerbating the meticulously placed silences throughout - where the unspoken words deafen audiences with their intentional presence - until the quality of the material present in the script is elevated even further as a result. Commendation is therefore owed to the outstanding sound designers - who really bring their A game here - & additionally, to cinematographer Mike Eley, who genuinely astonishes with his gorgeous camera work / uses of natural light, gently immersing audiences in to the story with handheld shots that feel warm, grounded & hopeful - akin to Terrence Malick's 1978 classic, ""Days of Heaven"".Can't recommend it highly enough.

71,Okonh0wp,A meditative slice of life film you're pleased to spend a couple hours in,8,23 February 2021,"""The Dig"" might be seen by some as a boring period piece. It's true that it doesn't have much to say or move at much of a brisk pace.At the same time, it's a rare film that projects a warm comfort staying put. The relationships between the characters and the ephemeral tone makes this a nice place to spend two hours.Ralph Fienes plays an amateur archeologist constrained by the rigidity of British class (Ralph Fiennes): He's the apotheosis of working class roots who has learned everything of the trade first-hand and is shut out of the mainstream archeological community.His counterpart, Edith (Carey Mulligan), is a young widow of a higher class sitting in a wealthy manor that she would trade for company or a sense of having done something. She loves with a son, a domestic staff she keeps at a distance and a quiet sense of regret over lives she could have lived including that of being an archeologist herself.The event that ties them together is the discovery of a Viking ship beneath her estate. The two form a beautiful platonic relationship (something cinema is severely lacking in) of admiration that bridges class in addition to the fact that one of the two got to fulfill their lives ambitions.As the dig gets bigger, more characters are led into the story which includes a love triangle between Edith's cousin (Johnny Flynn), a junior archeologist from the museum (Ben Chaplin) and his wife (Lilly James) that serves as a reminder of what Edith's life might have been if she indulged in her desires.In the sense that many films might get you excited about a field of knowledge you didn't know much about like blackjack (21), brainwashing (Manchurian Candidate), or nuclear power (the China Syndrome), I left the film without much of a greater education on human archeology except for the most important part: The human stakes involved. Who gets credit for a discovery and can anyone truly deserve it for something someone else built? To what extent is the ability to gain knowledge driven by wealth and access to capital?This is what makes Dig worthwhile.

The film is incredibly boring when there's no advancements on the excavation. I think the premise is great and interesting, but the terrible execution ruined most of the interest.There are plenty of subplots that just don't matter, and happen to really slow the movie down. There's a love subplot that feels unnecessary, and I really couldn't be less interested in such subplot. Every film has to have several subplots to keep the film going, but at least make it more about the main characters, or more closely related to the story.The Dig is an overall decent film, but the screenplay slowed down this already slow paced movie. At times I was constantly looking at the clock to see when this movie would end, but it felt like time itself slowed to the same pace as this movie.

78,themadmovieman,"An enthralling slow-burner that uses patient, understated character drama to fantastic effect",8,30 January 2021,"An intriguing little piece of British history, The Dig tells a slow-burning story with understated and genuine drama throughout, turning what could have been a rather dry tale of archaeology into a genuinely gripping character drama. Its historical context takes a little while to become fully relevant, but ultimately, The Dig really proves itself as a captivating watch.One of the things that I really liked about The Dig was its patience. Never dragging yet never rushing, the film takes its time to build up all of its main strengths, from its characters, their emotional back stories, and the overarching historical context of the outbreak of World War II.Complete with elegant camerawork, a beautiful score and impressively atmospheric direction that makes it an eye-catching watch from the first few moments, The Dig has enough confidence and depth to keep you engrossed even if its story isn't advancing apace, something that's a lot harder to pull off than you may think.One of the big reasons that the film's patient pacing and style work so well is because of its understated, genuine drama. With calm yet fully convincing performances across the board, particularly from Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan, this isn't a showy period drama by any means, but eases you into a story about real people, making them the centre of attention far more than the historical significance of the event.I'm not particularly well-versed in archaeology, and I didn't know about this discovery before watching this film. I think that might be the case for many other people, but the great thing about The Dig is that it's primarily a character-driven drama, and one that uses emotional intrigue to bring you closer to the story at hand and allow you to appreciate its importance.One element where the film does seem to falter is in its use of the historical backdrop of the lead-up to World War II. Set in the summer months of 1939 before the outbreak of war, there are sporadic references to the coming conflict through the first two acts of the movie, but they don't seem to bear much relevance to this story about an archaeological find.However, the film slowly begins to unveil how the historical context plays into its characters' personal lives and the fate of the dig itself, with dramatic focus shifting significantly in the final act, but just at the right point that the sudden arrival of the war into everyday life feels just like what it would have been like to experience it first-hand, taking over everything seemingly normal in an instant.As a result, while the historical backdrop seems almost contrived at first, it really comes good as the film progresses, another demonstration of how the patience of The Dig really plays into its hands throughout.",The Dig
79,madhukar30,"Beautiful, simple, subtle and poetic !!",7,7 February 2021,"The Dig is an amazing movie that portrays human emotions to almost poetic levels. Though the film is based on a true and important archeological find in the forties, the movie is more about human emotions of the various characters involved at different stages of the movie. It is one very rare and excellent movie in which none of the portrayed characters are bad or have shades of negativity.The cinematography is crisp and neat throughout the movie. Production design, costumes and makeup departments have done their job very well. Editing though good, could have been better had the The Dig had a run time of about 100-105 minutes instead of the 112 minutes runtime. Music was as gentle as the beautifully adapted screenplay from a novel, full marks to them. Ralph Fiennes does a wonderful job ably supported by a band of supporting cast, but Carey Mulligan stole the show, with a tremendous performance that I will remember for a long time.Overall, The Dig is a wonderful movie that touches the heart through some fine acting performances, provided one doesn't mind the slow burn. The Dig would suit mature audiences who have seen a ""Lot"" in life to understand the nuances of the complexity of the human emotions that are portrayed so beautifully by the actors, full credit to the director Simon Stone on that.

Mostly because of the amount of precious artefacts recovered. There was no surprise that the Anglo-Saxons populated the area, so it's not really comparable to any, say, south-american excavation revolutionizing our understanding of precolombian civilization.Anyway, the story is of Basil Brown, a ""guy"" who is called in to excavate a whole bunch of burial mounds. These mounds, being literal mounds of dirt, do not do much in the real of opposing to being dug up, and as such the digging goes on as expected. There is one pathetic scene of a cave-in (in a situation where it couldn't actually happen, but that is how desperate this film is for attention), but otherwise there is little conflict in this film that's beyond some harsh words at the team table.And, you know, conflict happens to be one of the major pivotal points of filmmaking. You really *do* need an antagonist in your film, if you're gonna have something that the protagonist is struggling against. And a protagonist's struggle is what causes the viewer to identify with the protagonist. I am sure that any filmmaker put in charge of several million quid's worth of budget knows.So, Basil Brown digs the defenseless mounds of earth, finds a wooden ship, a guy from the British Museum shows up, and the end...
I would not recommend The Dig. While there are some vaguely interesting attempts at period recreation, there is very little else of interest, and, i dare question why the subject matter was even considered exciting enough for a full-length film in the first place. Did they think Fiennes was going to magically generate a protagonist-antagonist relationship out of thin air?My vote: 5/10 - please look elsewhere for entertainment, *even* if you are an archeologist.",The Dig

Stone's decaffeinated film somehow mimics Ivory's British quality, but doesn't match his mystery. We are not facing Downton Abbey and much less The Crown. His characters at 10 minutes are already defined. On the other hand, the epic of search and discovery, essential in a story of this kind, is not exciting. When some characters and situations run out of gas, the director focuses the focus on others and even modifies the narrative structure to regain the viewer's interest, with partial results. Perhaps the melancholy of Mrs. Pretty and Mr. Brown defines the climate of the film, but this affects its results.Since the photography is beautiful, the music is omnipresent and invasive and the performances are very good, in particular those of the infallible Fiennes and Mulligan who are joined by Lily James, in charge of the young archaeologist Peggy Preston, perhaps the most interesting and that brings oxygen to a history that will be protected and defended by the now omnipotent shield of the ""based on real events"" and the inextinguishable cholulism that the English nobility continues to generate",The Dig

This movie tells the story of arguably the greatest archaelogical find in 20th century Europe. It is a story that is just made for excitement and suspense and triumph. The movie has none of these qualities. It is all told very matter-of-factly. There are a couple of attempts to inject some human interest into the proceedings with a subplot dealing with the health of one character and a perfunctory and unnecessary romance between two others, but sadly it is all just rather dull.I really wanted to like this movie and the best I can say is that I didn't hate it.

I know that I should have liked this film more if it wasn't for my open stupid taste in film. This might sound strange but I would completely disregard my 7/10 because I know deep down this film is better than that........however sadly this just isn't my type of film. I really struggle to like and engage in period films like this, however I must say this film is one of the better ones I've seen.If you're somebody that loves period drama's or second world war films (without the war and action, more character driven films) then this is the film for you. There actually isn't an area about this film which is bad. The directing is great, the acting is top class, the story is fascinating, the cinematography is good and the score is good also. I would 100% encourage anyone to see this especially because its on Netflix as well. Trust me the 1hr 55min runtime will flyby for you, it did drag a little for me.......but thats me haha.I don't think I can really explain why I can't like this film more. Everyone has their genres of film that they like and don't like. Its not so much that I find films of this nature terrible, I just never get the urge to be enthralled, mesmerised or left marvelled by this genre ??? So overall even though I'm giving it a 70% out of 100 I still think its a good film however by own stupidty hahah, I can't make myself like it anymore.Anyone else would give it 8 or 9/10 and they would be correct !! I wouldn't argue with them whatsoever.",The Dig
88,pawebster,Interesting but also dull,7,29 January 2021,"I have never liked the words ""Based on a true story"". Either give us a story as true as can be, or just give us a story. Here it's a bit like the Railway Children - exciting incidents at intervals. Realising that archeology might seem dull, it was decided there should be a couple of dramatic accidents and a love affair, neatly spaced through the running time. If only they could really have devoted themselves to transmitting the fascination of the archeology involved. It would have been a big challenge, but great if it had come off. (By the way, it's weird that we are not properly shown the treasure - not even in the end credits.) Instead we have a hefty dose of the dreamy ""last summer before war"" trope, admittedly with the odd downpour. I'm getting round to saying it's a bit boring. The actors: Carey Mulligan is too young, but otherwise wonderful (as is the boy playing her son). Ralph Fiennes is excellent. Lily James is wearing oversized modern designer glasses, lest we forget that she's a beautiful young actress of the 21st century. Johnny Flynn is too old, but gets away with it and really inhabits the period, especially in his manner of speech.",The Dig

90,cordenw,Boring,2,4 February 2021,"Don't know what I would have done in the old days when you couldn't fast forward but I was very thankful for the feature while I was watching this pedestrian crossing of a movie.
The only thing that stirred any feelings in me was the portrayal of the class system that I ran away from all those years ago. How they treated their servants and staff just like they were only one step above beasts of burden still gets me angry. How they got away with it for so long is beyond me.The storyline is so-so interestwise, the discovery of an Anglo-Saxon burial ship that was thought at first to be a Viking ship... Because it's Anglo-Saxon it moves back the dates of human occupation at the site and apparently that's very important to arcteryx...... sorry, ""archeologist"" intelligentsia.Big deal! They found a Viking ship in a pub's car park close to where I used to live and they didn't make a movie about that. In fact the first time they discovered it they covered it over with blacktop and put some tables and chairs out there.
Of course, the discovery in this plot only catches the interest of the upper crust, the poor peasants are too busy working the fields to be interested.So they have to fatten the story with a tragic illness, a backdrop of the second world war breaking out and a tiny bit of gratuitous nudity... don't blink , you'll miss it.
There is some good acting in it though and some good exploration of the counterplay between the educated professor and the gifted amateur archeologist but it's not enough to turn it into a great movie.I like Ralph Fiennes and I like Carey Mulligan but they didn't have a lot to work with.

93,tigerfish50,Digging for Depth,6,1 February 2021,"Based on actual events with World War 2 looming on the horizon, there's much to admire in 'The Dig' - acting and cinematography in particular. The opening sequence tells how a widow commissions a local working class archeology enthusiast called Basil Brown to excavate several mysterious mounds on her property. Sadly, the film short-changes the achievements of this accomplished amateur, just as self-interested academics had done seventy years beforehand.After some significant artifacts are unearthed, the narrative subsequently shows how a pompous bigwig from London's British Museum arrives to muscle Brown out of the project's driving seat. A collection of colorful characters engaged in various intrigues while making momentous discoveries should have provided more than enough dramatic interest. Unfortunately the screenwriters appeared unable to find sufficient substance in the archeological affairs to sustain a feature film - and invented a tepid romance to flesh out the proceedings. This minor sub-plot provides little more than distraction and the story loses its way. If the script had probed a little deeper into the core material, complemented by a background of the beautiful East Anglian scenery, an impending worldwide catastrophe and ancient mysteries, the result would have surely been far more memorable.",The Dig
94,arabnikita,Patient and beautiful story with great acting and solid production,8,13 February 2021,"A story about archeology isn't something that can easily grab people's attention but this film will make you care about little brushes and coins by the time it's over. Ralph Fiennes plays an excavator who is hired by a small estate owner to dig up some ancient barrows. The owner is an ailing woman and knowing that her days are numbered, she is personally invested in the hope that he will be able to discover something of value that will leave a legacy. One thing she didn't account for is the start of World War 2 and how much of an impact it will have on both the excavation and the lives of everyone involved in it.Normally, when people think about archeology it's the dinosaur bones and ancient temples that come to mind; not nails or rotten planks. Certainly, nobody thinks of Archeological Politics but that is what becomes the central focus of the story considering the significance of the discovery. However, this movie is a lot more than excavation because underneath all the digging, lies a multitude of little tales about everyone involved in the process and thanks to the first rate acting, we end up genuinely caring about their fates.To compliment the skilled actors, the film utilizes high production values with scrupulous attention to details ensuring a smooth and touching viewing experience. The Dig feels like the sort of a story that would occur before a war. Each character deals with their own troubles whether it's life ambition, love intrigue or treasure. Sadly, when the winds of war begin to blow, everything freezes in time as priorities change and the world stops caring about archeology.If you are looking for a balanced and patient drama with great acting and smooth atmosphere then The Dig is for you.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for Movies and TV shows",The Dig

The little bits of tension and drama in there like the love affair or the spat between real and amateur archaeologist just play out pretty quickly.It just does not seem like a story that translates well to television and perhaps a documentary would have been a better format because it could have handled the same themes AND it could have addressed the Sutton Hoo and the artefacts in more detail.",The Dig

101,bastille-852-731547,Mulligan and Fiennes excel in well-crafted drama,8,22 January 2021,"I'm a big fan of Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes, as both of them are remarkable actors who are able to uniquely infuse character development and range into any role they can play. Needless to say, this British drama about an excavation of the Sutton Hoo burial site right as World War II was beginning certainly delivers. The film focuses on two main characters, Edith (Carey Mulligan) and Basil (Ralph Fiennes.) Edith is a woman living on the property near the Sutton Hoo, reeling from grief yet also thoughtfully determined and autonomous in both her interpersonal and private lives. Basil is a mild-mannered archaeologist helping lead the excavation. Mulligan and Fiennes each portray remarkable emotional cores in their performances, and clearly are also able to convey the general sense of fear and uncertainty at the time in the United Kingdom as World War II was beginning through their performances as well as the broader historical context of the story.The cinematography of rural England is absolutely outstanding, with superb lighting and wide shots. With a delightfully simple aesthetic and a stirring score, these aesthetic qualities combined with gripping performances and well-detailed historical context create a uniquely powerful impact on the viewing experience. All of the characters are also very well-developed through the calmly understated yet deeply sophisticated writing, and a clear sense of purpose is present in all of them. The tensions between Edith and several individuals representing cultural institutions, such as the British Museum and Ipswich, about exactly what to do or where to send the discoveries from the excavation are also very gripping, creating an additional layer of depth to the story. Ultimately, what is so unique about this film is that it is simple and elegant on some levels, but powerful and layered on other levels. Its ultimate meanings on the significance of culture, history, and collective sacrifice will be read differently from viewer to viewer; nonetheless, this a very powerful and well-made drama that clearly succeeds as both a character acting piece and a potent historical study.

This is in no way a groundbreaking film at all but it's just a mostly enjoyable self contained story that does what it needs to do. The performances from Lily James, Ralph Fiennes, and Carey Mulligan are pretty good. Each have their own moment to shine without taking too much of the spotlight. Each has their own self contained story that's mostly interesting even if Lily James's character feels a little cliched at points. The story is engaging as it follows an archaeological exploration of a old Anglo-Saxon vessel. However, a solid 1/3 of this film is somewhat boring and slow. These moments are whenever we follow characters that aren't portrayed by Mulligan, James, or Fiennes. The screenplay is fine. There is nothing extraordinary about it and it isn't bad but there's nothing really special about it. The cinematography was very good though. Each shoot looks very beautiful and is framed in an interesting way. Costumes and set design are on point too. This is a quiet little film that's gonna go under the radar this year.

Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes are both really good and the character dynamics were what drove the film, and it made it a lot more interesting. All of the plots are developed really well, and the film never feels like its juggling too much. My big issue is that the pacing is way too slow. Scenes drag on way too much, and it meant that I just wasn't as engaged in the characters or in the story as much as I anticipated and wished.

The parts that make it not very good is the over-attention to unrelated cliché themes without any lead-in, investigation, or resolution; the historical goofs that really wouldn't have been that diffiult to correct; and the whole approach to how and when it was made. The most interesting theme related to the lead role was opened and closed within 30 seconds - very frustrating to watch rare opportunity so clumsily discarded.

But when they introduce Lily James,Peggy Piggott, the story changes. And as of now I still don't know to what. I like Lily James. I was excited to see her pop up because I didn't realize she was in it. But I still can't find a reason for her character. Other then, she was lonely? I was watching a movie about excavating, and then I wasn't. Very weird. Her story arc had no bearing on, well, the story. Then to find out, the character she fools around with is fictional. What? So now we know. Someone wanted her in it, so they made up a story line. With a guy going to war. Except, he wasn't real. So now I'm doubly sure her character was disposable.
For those who didn't see two different movies like me. I envy you. If they kept on track with the two main characters, Basil Brown and Edith Pretty, I just know I would have given it ten stars. But sadly, seeing a pretty face that has no purpose, well, has no purpose.

129,fiona_r_lamb,Hot diggity dig!,7,30 January 2021,"Another gem from Netflix came to my attention this week (last week it was the equally fantastic Summerland). I only found out at the end that this was about Sutton Hoo! I remember studying that at school way back when.Anyway, I did enjoy this movie - great cinematography and the acting was sublime by everyone. They are all so versatile especially Ralph Fiennes and Lily James. She looked so dowdy and different from her character in Mamma Mia II. I was very impressed by the entire cast - including the young son. The costumes seemed very well done too. The only thing I did not enjoy was the music - at the beginning it was rather unbearable and I found it hard to hear the dialogue. And the camera work was sometimes odd but it calmed down later in the movie.Yes it has a very slow start but then in the middle things speed up with the introduction of a whole new bunch of characters.Bit of a tearjerker at the end - for me anyway. So have some tissues at hand.",The Dig

133,robertasmith,"A well written, acted and directed story",8,29 January 2021,So rare to watch a wonderfully gentle but poignant film. It tugs at the emotions as it tells a largely true. Some liberties are taken with the truth but largely accurate. The real story of Peggy Piggott is fascinating and worth a film in itself. However the real stars of the story are Edith Pretty and Basil Brown portrayed brilliantly by Mulligan and Fiennes. One small criticism is that Carey Mulligan is too young for the part but she carries it off superbly and the performance by Ralph Fiennes is one of the best I have seen in a long time. The whole cast is superb and the backdrop of imminent war is ever present throughout the film. I have visited Sutton Hoo a number of times and studied the excavation and I still marvel at the work Basil Brown did. As an archaeologist myself I can say his work even by today's standards was of the highest order. Many of the academic archaeologists before and after WW2 were useless when it came to excavation and recording it. Basil Brown did everything right and it is fantastic he is at last getting the credit he deserved and that Edith Pretty wanted for him. It is to the great shame of the academic establishment it has taken so long. The film portrays this extremely well.,The Dig

I heard more people talking about it, and thought I need to watch it. I'm so pleased that I did as it's a wonderful tale and beautifully told.Fiennes it his usual great self. Mulligan excellent as are the support cast. I loved the humour, the scenery and the house.I've seen the hoard (or parts of it) in the British Museum and my only small gripe is not enough of the treasure was shown in the film, it would have been great to see the helmets, shields, bowls etc in their entirety rather than a few bits.

140,Instant_Palmer,"""and the 2021 OSCAR SNUB AWARD goes to...""",9,29 January 2021,"'The Dig' is a beautifully photographed period film (circa 1939, Suffolk, Great Britain) that seemed a lock to garner first Oscars for Ralph Fiennes (*overdue) and Cinematographer Mike Eley. Therefore, I'm instituting the 1st Annual ""Oscar Snub Award"" to the film most undeservedly left out of nominations. This year it was a no brainer - 'The Dig' wins and it wasn't close. So on with my original review B. S. (""Before Snub"")...Metaphors supporting Themes abound in 'The Dig' - ""life is fleeting"", ""the search for meaning in our lives"", ""our relevance in History"", and ""is this all there is"". Classic themes for dramas that are the eternal questions within our lives. The film intertwines those themes within the central characters, each conducting their own search for answers.The framework of the story occurs on the eve of WWII for Great Britain. The impending gravity of such hovers over the film, intensifying the characters' emotions and urgency in searching for answers to such questions - the telescope and magnifying glass used within the story serve as metaphors to that end. Collapsing walls of the dig site that almost takes Basil Brown's life illustrate the tenuous fragility of life which could end in a moment of randomness. There are many more such examples in 'The Dig'.Such poetic filmmaking takes painstaking attention to detail in production to pull off at the level achieved in this film. Utilizing the beautiful cinematography of Mike Eley and deft touch of Film Editor Jon Harris, Director Simon Stone succeeds in elevating the The Dig to an elite level of film art.This is without question the Best Picture of the Year, and I am thankful this beautiful film came in at the last possible minute to save an otherwise (and understandable) blah year in the film industry.Director Simon Stone's Oscar nomination for both Director and Best Picture is a virtual certainty.Ralph Fiennes (Basil Brown) never misses (except taking home an Oscar), but I predict he will FINALLY* be recognized by Academy members en masse for his best of the year acting in this film, along with Mike Eley for Cinematography.Carey Mulligan (Edith Pretty) should be nominated except she has two Oscar worthy films, both with a deserved good chance to take home an Oscar. Her spotlight lead part in 'A Promising Young Woman' has much more Oscar potential which will negate her role in The Dig - Mulligan should get Actress of the Year for putting forth two such great performances in one year!At the end of the night (Oscar night), 'The Dig' could sweep up wins in the aforementioned major Oscar categories for 2020 - I certainly wouldn't bet against it happening (EDIT: Boy was I wrong 😑), and In terms of total Oscar nominations, this film sets up as the front contender for 2020. Then again, it could be a dodgy awards year - competition of last minute entries (is it going to get to the point where releases occur the day before the voting deadline?), and above-the-norm ""agendas"" abound in the industry these days [EDIT: Boy, was I correct about this (I am sorry to say)].While the ensemble cast is highly competent, I don't see a particular supporting role having enough ""spotlight momentum"" to break-out and win an Oscar, although Lily James (Peggy Piggott) is a long-shot.If there was one weak point in the film, it would be the digression to the character Peggy that seems to be thinly integrated into the film. This hole in the film likely comes from Editing decisions, and will probably cost Lily James, Jon Harris (Editing), and Stone and co-writer Moira Buffini (Adapted Screenplay) Oscar nominations.The film runs under 2 hours, and it would have only required adding another 5-10 minutes to fully integrate Peggy into the story - Peggy is at a crossroads in her young life and her marriage to a man not interested in women forecasts a gloomy future - She gets sage advice from Edith Pretty (Mulligan) on seizing the day (and not to make the same mistakes she made).My advice to Stone is ""Don't start something without completing it"". My guess is there is extra footage on Peggy and perhaps a Director's-Cut extended version will be released at some point completing Peggy's story - I'd like to see that.👍👍 to all involved in 'The Dig' - the film is a treat for the eyes - the acting superior - production execution excellent - it is 2020's Best Picture by classic film making standards, despite being the biggest Oscar snub of the 2021 Academy Awards.Here's hoping ""agendas"" and politics are left out of recognizing the best in film arts. (EDIT: Clearly agendas are NOT left out based on nominations MIA🙁)* Ralph Fiennes sits atop my IMDb list of 'Best Actors Without An Oscar' (EDIT: and will continue to be atop the list for at least one more year - Note: At least Glen Close has a shot at graduating off my no-Oscar list 🤞)",The Dig

There are no surprises in The Dig, but it is beautifully put together. Ralph Fiennes is great as the taciturn Brown, and Carey Mulligan radiates quiet strength as Pretty. They are ably supported by Johnny Flynn and Ben Chaplin, though it is Lily James who gets the opportunity to shine as an innocent learning something about men and the world.The screenplay by Moira Buffini, based on the novel by John Preston, might flag up that tab A will be slotting into hole B well in advance of every move, but it does so with admirable craft, and it's very hard to complain.
Simon Stone has done a great job with the direction, but cinematographer Mike Eley and editor Jon Harris deserve serious credit for the way they have made the Suffolk countryside burn with a golden hue throughout, and for the way in which the scenes are gently constructed to take in the characters amidst the landscape, and the history they are a part of.For me, it's a unfortunately off-putting how unthinkingly uncritical the movie is about the class structure, and how that structure, in the world of the movie, drives no conflict or disillusionment. Rather, the upper class are seen as stewards of the land, & bastions of right thinking, while the lower classes are seen as rightly deferential and grateful for the opportunity to serve. (Something which makes it very reminiscent of Downton Abbey, even without the Lily James connection). I find that unrealistic, untrue, nostalgic refusal to examine the past a missed opportunity and a failure.But if you want to watch a beautiful-looking mid-twentieth century take on British heritage cinema that will while away a rainy afternoon; you've found the treasure you seek.",The Dig

148,JBLOSS,Superbly shot reimagining of Sutton Hoo,8,31 January 2021,"The Dig is a delightful film that reimagines the mainly true events of 1939 when Anglo Saxon treasures buried in a boat grave were unearthed. The cinematography captures the Suffolk landscape beautifully as the story unfolds with the local ""amateur"" archaeologist or excavator Basil Brown engaged by a local landowner Edith Pretty to investigate the mysterious mounds on her land. The story concentrates as much on the characters as it does on the dig itself and is all the better for it. Ralph Fiennes makes the best stab at a Suffolk accent that I think I've heard on screen, I think some criticism of it are way off the mark and I speak as having a father born and bred in Suffolk. There are only a couple of criticisms I'd raise which is the subplot of involving Edith Pretty's cousin and one of the archaeologists (played by Lily James) romance is fictional and really a bit superfluous. The fact Britain is about to plunge into war could have been handled differently. The other is where are the treasures! Anyone who has been to the British museum will know they are stunning. It would have been nice even in the end credits to have seen them. Overall I really enjoyed this film though and thoroughly recommend it",The Dig

150,sarcasm_for_free,I didn't 'dig' it.,4,16 February 2021,"The Dig commits the most unpardonable sin a movie could, and that is the fact that it's boring. All the nice performances, good cinematography and spot-on period detail in the world can't change the dull script, and I ended up making jokes about the ongoing staidness to my friend just to survive the runtime.The event that it didn't impress me shouldn't come as much surprise, after all this movie arrives hot-on-the-heels of overrated tripe like Normal People and Bridgerton. At least this is just a movie, only two hours you'll never get back. The others are full-blown TV series which go on for much longer. Give the next episode a try if I hated the first? Not on your nelly. Life is too short.What else can I say about it? A bunch of uninteresting adults, and an unbelievably annoying kid, potter around a large field talking nonsense while excavating for a large ship. If you can stand the company of these bores for a period of more than a few minutes, then good luck to you. I found their inconsequential lives utterly tedious, and the few moments where things threatened to get intriguing were soon snuffed out by more verbal guff and long strolls in the country. Yawn.About halfway through, as if realising the complete monotony of what they were serving us up, they introduce a new couple of characters... a sexually-starved bride and her nebbish husband who kind of take over the movie. Neither of these unexpected additions contributes anything of note to the story, besides more dreary padding.Basically, I didn't give a hoot about any of these prosaic individuals, no matter how much cheap melodrama they threw at us (especially late on). It all adds up to a real snooze fest that, unless you're a sufferer of acute insomnia, I'd bail out while I have the chance. 4/10",The Dig

Films on subjects like this can be either dry or trivial or triumphalist or worthy or just bad.But from the first scenes this film is beautiful. These is no other word. The outdoor scenes (and much of it is outdoors) is just breathtakingly gorgeous at times. This is Suffolk and wow does it look good. If anyone has seen the BBC series ""The Detectorists"" they will get the idea. It captures the big skies of East Anglia so well, sun through the early morning mists, or even after the rain like works of art. The stage on which the action is set is sumptuous.As for the action - its just so good. Almost dreamlike at times - I found myself thinking of ""The Go-Between"" (also set in Suffolk, of course!) with dialogue over the top of action that is not taking place at quite the same time. Hard to describe, but its like memories.Some of the film is a shade predictable - the small enthusiast verses the big guy, the mismatched couple and a possible tragic love story, the child's eye view at times, the repressed sexuality of the period - it's all there. But it is so well done.The only downside is that this film - this photography - deserves the big screen, but most people will now see it on the small. This is such a shame. Its deserved so much more.",The Dig

Beautiful scenery, excellent acting. Perhaps the story could have been told a bit better had it been allowed the space of a limited series. Characters needed more development. Extremely disconcerting for me was that there were more than a few scenes where we hear the voices of characters but their mouths aren't moving. What?! Way too much of this. Maybe the result of doing away with the scenes where the characters actually spoke these lines, to shrink this down to movie size?

I thought the drama follows only Ms Pretty, but then it turns out that every woman is depressed, the guys are mainly delusional and the different story branches are going nowhere.We have an amateur dig man Mr Brown, who makes every mistake in the beginning that you can ""achieve"" at a dig site. Then we have the fat museum guy who is incapable of leading a team nor collect the discovered items. And after the first half of the movie relationships go south, so everybody is whining in self pity. And why the fuzz about some sand dunes that used to be wood of a ship?

It seems like they were just on the verge of really diving into the discovery itself and (critically) why it was so gosh darned important, and then suddenly the story was hijacked by terrorists or something. How else to explain the sudden shift?Instead of paying off all that buildup in digging (literally the name of the film) and character development from the first half, we're suddenly saddled with a whole new cast of characters who are almost completely irrelevant to the story but whose personal relationships suddenly take over the entire second half of the film, pushing the original characters onto the sidelines and derailing the entire effort. Not only are the original characters sidelined, but the discovery itself practically becomes an afterthought.Instead we're left following a bunch of random jerkweasels down idiotic subplots about adultery (actual) and homosexuality (implied), none of which have even the slightest relevance to the original story or characters. Was this another case of producers putting their grubby little fingers into things and wrecking it all up?

However, it fictionalized the story adding a homosexual relationship that never occurred in real life and an affair involving the wife of the closeted husband. I feel this was a tacked on ploy that was not true, and was done because that's what Hollywood does. If it was real and Germaine to the real story I would have felt it relevant, but the fact it was made up entirely is a disservice to the people that actually existed.

A fragile magic lies in the unspectacular treatment of all human relationships being involved, in and around the place of the digging. The most touching moments suddenly reveal itself with subtle understatement, deeper meaning in seemingly unimportant details, unspoken words, the way people look at each other, or refuse to look, tells more than any outburst of drama, as if the emotions have to be excavated in a similar way to the ancient Anglo-Saxon ship in the ground, hidden under layers of dark earth.

They're often left untouched as a form for respect to the dead. Whether it's a recent law I don't know - but archeological finds in Denmark belong to the state. Always. It's actually illegal to not report findings to a museum because it's a national treasure, you *technically* don't own it, even if it's on your land.I enjoy the movie, I thought the storytelling was great.

176,goldenlampshade,Dreamy British future classic,10,3 July 2021,"The combination of The Dig's cinematography, score, and period piece Englishness made for a phenomenal little film. It's cinematic scope was impressively crafted given such a quaint premise and deliberate pacing. The stakes arise naturally and it's screenplay is so tight it was able to weave between the intersections of anthropology and history, using cogent and powerful central metaphors to explore the notions of time missed chances and permanence in a really interesting and deep way. I cannot forget to mention it's frankly amazing direction where sometimes a conversation is happening over a wideshot of some beautiful scenescape or something, contributing to its overall poetic and dreamy quality (the director clearly also send to the Mr. Robot school of framing and understood all their assignments). I was fighting sleep myself for a while given the hour I was watching but managed to make it through to the end on sheer investment in the vibe created here in the studio today.A super cute lovey war paranoid Casablanca meets equally war paranoid well shot Darkest Hour.

Then, suddenly, a bunch more characters are added, including a young married couple in which the husband is a closeted gay man. Then we learn the wife, who starts chasing after the cousin of the lead protagonist lost her father to drowning. And her father had some other tragic ailment too. Then an RAF pilot in training tragically crashes in the river that goes right by the property and the cousin takes his gilly weed and dives in but the pilot is dead. And as the ancient artifact is dug up, the lead protagonist named Edith tragically comes down with a fatal case of acid reflux.Then they all get together for a party at the penultimate end.Then WWII breaks out at the final end.Great performances with a script that plays loose with the facts.

The acting, script and cinematography are all first class.There's no gung ho whooping, yelling, swearing, or high fiving, so a Yank or young audience will probably find it boring and slow, but if you want to watch an absorbing, intelligent, gentle paced movie then try this.

187,anniemarshallster,"Anglo Saxon attitudes - class, art and sex in the 1930s",10,2 March 2021,"Every word of this film is freighted with meaning, as is every image. There's nothing superficial or redundant. The assembly of events via sound and image is subtly double-edged, conveying what is and what might be, occasionally teasing audience expectations and presenting alternatives which challenge our preconceptions of what should be.
To make a period drama that genuinely conveys how the people probably felt rather than how we would like them to have felt requires emotional and historical insight, some innate poetry and a willingness to take risks with audiences' levels of empathy and understanding. So, a necessary note of appreciation for the direction by Simon Stone, the script by Moira Buffini, the lighting, the camerawork, the design (costume and set) and the performances by everyone. There are no small parts in this film. It has been an incremental process of delicate decisions.
This film is a meditation about England and the English at a perilous moment in history as much as it is about Sutton Hoo and its treasures. There's poetry intertwined with myth, magic and humour - all underlying the concrete facts. In its conjunction of emotion, time and landscape it seems unlike most modern British cinema; one has to hark back to the past, to the extraordinary films of Powell and Pressburger in the 1940s, especially A CANTERBURY TALE, to match this mood, style, humour, sadness and triumph. Clearly, I believe The Dig belongs in very special company.
This is our current Zeitgeist. It speaks to us now. I anticipate we will still feel as moved by The Dig in another seventy years.",The Dig
188,mha-89327,Beautifully Delivered & Unstated Quality British Drama,8,4 February 2021,"'The Dig' is a delicate tale with multiple layers. As is the case with good drama, the characters are multiple and varied in in their subtleties and their complexities. Interestingly, one of the lead characters is not a sentient being, but a meadow in a Suffolk field in England. However, this field is no ordinary fallow area of grass, it is populated by large mounds - likely ancient burial sites. Thus, this movie is innately interwoven with an archeological story of excavation and the potential of wondrous historical discovery.Parallel to this quite prosaic undertaking are several very human and engaging stories of grief, tragedy, recognition, ambition, greed and human revelation. These tales are very human, delicately explored on the screen through a well written script, exposed with a sensitivity not unlike the granular and studied removal of spoil from an archeological dig.There are numerous captivating dramatic portrayals, not just involving the central protagonists, but also in the revelations of the supporting cast as well. Thereby, this producton represents a beautifully crafted piece of British drama where almost all cast members are given space of annunciate their role and emphasise their voice and their dynamic characteristics on screen. Humble characters are given the dramatic landscape and opportunity to shine. Thus, quiet characters are highlighted in a vibrant silabancy, adding to the dramatic ambiance of the production. A most enjoyable experience for this viewer, at least for me, anyway. Highly recommended.",The Dig

The Sutton Hoo helmet is one of the most iconic finds in the history of archeology- and it doesn't feature.It's like making a movie about Howard Carter and not showing the golden burial mask of Tutankhamen - crazy.Some may argue this movie is entirely about the characters - fine, but I desperately wanted to feel the moment when these beautiful artifacts were held and seen for the first time and it didn't truly deliver on that point.",The Dig

Carey Mulligan is way too youthful for the character she plays , Mrs. Pretty, but she does an excellent job nonetheless. The movie educated me about a field -archaeology and excavating --and a discovery (Sutton Hoo) that I knew nothing about.The storytelling of the film has an unusual structure, and I see that some other reviewers have complained about it. They miss the point. The film starts with two main characters - an elderly excavator trained by his father and a kind but sickly aristocratic land-owner. Halfway through, the film unfolds and we start following a team of university-educated archaeologists and eventually focus on two young people who have a lust for life and, seemingly , for each other. In this, the film mirrors the transition that Great Britain experienced as it transitioned through the 20th century and especially through WW-II.

Carey Mulligan is outstanding as Edith Pretty, a widow with a bad heart but with a sense of discovery on her British estate. She employs Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) to lead a team excavating the mounds of land to find what treasures lie beneath.
Beautiful cinematography adds to this gem as England is on the cusp of war in 1938. Lily James is charming as a woman in a loveless marriage whose future plans are stymied due to the impending conflict with Germany.

Clearly, all is not well, it looks like we have a marriage of convenience, if you get my drift. This subplot, becomes as important and as relevant as the actual excavation as well as Ediths and Basil story .Even though right after the Piggots arrive most of the major treasures are found, its not enough as the script eschews the interesting historical dig which the movie is SUPPOSED to be about, for a romance subplot.I actually realized as I watched the final long scene play out, that they had not even bothered to mention in the movie if a body had been found, or if they had done any digging of the other mounds. You will find more of that information HERE on IMDB trivia page, then in the movie.The movie ALREADY had characters you could care about in Edith, Basil, Robert, and the fictional Rory character, but to try and shoe-horn in the ole romance story on the eve of war trope, all in order to be considered for the Oscars, absolutely ruins the movie.This could have been a LOT better, Ralph Fiennes is nearly wasted here as he become a secondary character, once again AFTER the Piggots show up.This is NOT Oscar material, but then again, if you had told me 2 minutes after watching Parasite that it would later win best picture I wouldnt have believed you.",The Dig

With crisp writing and superb acting from all involved, we are transplanted into the lives of ordinary people who stumbled into an extraordinary adventure. Some reviewers complained that too many extraneous characters were introduced at varying times, but, that (it appears) is how the actual events may have unfolded. And all of the characters are treated in a way that tries to explore their own demons and proclivities in a manner which never seems to wander into stereotypes.

The Dig will certainly not be a film for everyone as many may find the subject matter to be plain dull, but it is without question a well-crafted film from opening to closing that will leave you satisfied.Set at the dawn of the Second World War in 1939, The Dig centers around Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) whose land she believes is ripe with treasure just waiting to be found. Given the position she finds herself in, Pretty hires excavator Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) on a recommendation, and he along with a few assistants from the estate work hand in hand to dig into the mounds of Pretty's land to uncover what lies beneath. Following the discovery of a couple of iron rivets that once belonged to a sea vessel, Brown informs Pretty and word of the finding slowly begins to trickle out. Once the news of the site goes public, an excavation team formed by Charles Phillips (Ken Stott) comes forth and begins assisting on the project with hopes that Pretty will sell the ship to the British Museum for all to see. Along the way, outside forces such as investors and buyers all do their best to persuade Pretty's decision making as she suffers from a worsening medical condition which leads to personal strife, Naturally, their collective quest winds up revealing much about every single person who is present doing their part to unearth the Sutton Hoo leading to friction, but ultimately understanding as everyone soon finds their personal peace.The highest mark that can be awarded to The Dig would come in the form of its characters and performances. Every individual character that is introduced throughout the film has a place in the narrative that allows no two characters to serve the same function or feel the same as the next. Although the focus of the film is on a small handful of characters, everyone is given development into their stories which makes them far more believable while giving credence to their motivations from start to finish. All of the details feel purposeful and nothing appeared to be left on the table, so for that, I must give praise to Buffini's exceptional character writing. However, characters and dialogue are only as good as the person bringing them to life. All of the main performers deliver good work that will keep you captivated as they navigate from scene to scene. Ralph Fiennes manages to do a lot with a little as his stoic assuredness bleeds through every word he speaks. Carey Mulligan's tumultuous emotions ebb and flow as she battles with internal and external difficulties all while bringing a deep passion to the screen. Lily James' personal conflict feels fully realized with every moment as she shines in a role that feels utterly soothing. And young star, Archie Barnes delivers a moving performance that will have you experiencing every emotion as he steals nearly every scene he is in. All around, The Dig is a triumph in character, from both the written word to the dedicated performers, not an ounce of talent feels wasted on either side of the camera.The major issues I detected while watching The Dig, came in the form of its pacing and plot. The film has a fairly straight forward story that everyone can understand, but it simply fails to make any of it interesting. Nearly every revelation presented within the film happens seemingly out of thin air with little to no build-up. A series of moments will transpire until something is revealed to the audience but it never feels earned because no gradual development is made, thus making things feel meaningless when you should be feeling elated. On top of that, there are at least two moments throughout the film where a character is turning their back and stepping away from it all, but because a new incentive is placed forth, they return to their duty. On its own, this technique is fine, but when done multiple times for the sake of adding extra scenes of dialogue, it feels terribly pointless. However, the biggest gripe I have with The Dig stems directly from its overall narrative. We are immediately introduced to a small handful of characters from its opening moments who all share a common goal. Then, halfway through the film, a bevy of new characters are introduced with their own stories that are so far removed from the main narrative leading to a shift in what we should and should not care about. When James' character Peggy Piggott was injected into the script I was skeptical at first. However, as her story unfolded, I naturally grew to care for her struggle and subsequent growth more than I ever did with Pretty and Brown's dig. Being far more interested in a romantic side story of a character and the backdrop of the war than the actual excavation is not a good sign. Unfortunately, The Dig has all of the necessary components from dynamic characters to an interesting setting in England just before the birth of the Second World War, but none of it can save the dreadfully dull plot.Simon Stone's The Dig is a film that essentially suffers from a lack of genuine consistency. Buffini's expert screenplay brings Preston's original novel to life through great dialogue, and even greater characters. Every performer gives it their all even if what is being presented is nothing all that engaging. Stone's work behind the camera is fantastic with wide-reaching landscape shots that paint the beauty of the natural world to tracking shots that absorb you into its scenes effortlessly. Tragically, the general story that is being told is one that fails to ""wow"" in any way and it also falls short of connecting the audience to its struggles leaving a significant taste of disappointment in one's mouth. Luckily, the entire film does not drastically suffer because of the flat plot. Yet, I must reiterate, The Dig will not be a film that everyone will enjoy. From its slow pace to droning moments of silence, it can at times have you checking your watch and looking elsewhere. In spite of that, The Dig is a film worth watching full of riveting characters that carry it from start to finish in an excellent fashion.Final Verdict: C",The Dig
227,oldguy7547,I will watch this again,9,6 February 2021,I don't know anything about Oscar awards nor do I care. I know what I like and I really liked this movie. The acting was very good by all the principal characters. The filming and the scenery was beautiful. I thought it would be a bit of a chick flick and perhaps it was but I still enjoyed it After reading about the true Sutton Hoo it seems the stuck to the theme of the reality. The romance was added but I felt that was not needed as it really did not bring all that much to the storyline. In all I will be watching this again.,The Dig
228,susanxx-76-348573,Sutton Noo!,2,7 February 2021,"Based on a true story but casting, apparently, does not reflect the real people involved well. Poetic licence takes over but this story is overlong, boring and the cast cannot rescue it.
What should have been a great watch ended up anything but and by the end I could not care less about the characters, the great find or what happened to the treasure, the land or the people. Recent reports appear to indicate that the characters bear little, if any resemblance to the actual people involved.
I cannot see anyone being interested in this as all we seem to see is rain and mud and a bit of treasure and even an inferred gay liaison.
This is 2 hours of my life I cannot get back.",The Dig
229,epacrisimpressa,"A flawed work but worth seeing, especially for Ralph Fiennes.",7,2 May 2021,"What a shame this film had no idea where it was going. The first half is excellent, as others have said, but it completely loses it way from the middle on. Ralph Fiennes gives a master class in acting, and the overall production is exquisite: costumes, sets, cinematography, are all very fine. However the producers clearly lack respect for history, since they cast Carey Mulligan as Edith Pretty, a woman she in no way resembles, neither can she distract us sufficiently from this fact. Further, they have so many irrelevant bits and pieces thrown in, while almost totally ignoring the actual treasures that Basil Brown and the team found. I found a lot of their choices really peculiar. It would have been better to make a top-notch documentary.",The Dig

Beautiful blurred backgrounds and warm English countryside light throughout. Also - sharp as a tack (must be 5k??). Thank goodness Nicole Kidman couldn't do it - wouldn't have been able to take my eyes off her new chin. Carey Mulligan is far superior but that precocious kid of hers - oh dear. You yearn for him to grow up quick so he can be sent to war. My big beef though Is that Fiennes' makes no attempt at a East Anglian accent. He is Devonian throughout reminding me of mark Rylance in BFG. I'm from Norfolk and know his attempt is way of the mark but the Americans don't know that and will probably give him an Oscar. That is disappointing but overall it's enjoyable afternoon fayre ...,The Dig

The story, though not riveting, explored some of life's deeper meanings and trials. Very good all around. It did seem like it could have used a few more minutes at the end to wrap things up a little better. Also, a little more information and focus on the history of what they found was expected but not delivered. This is less of a history focused movie, and more a movie focused on the complexities of human relationships. That said, it's not a typical love story. It does have various ""love"" stories within it, but also focuses on the fact that our time is fleeting and precious, so we should consider how and who we spend it with wisely. I came for the history, and though I got a full on drama instead, I was not disappointed. It was done in a fresh way. One last warning, I wouldn't call this a feel good story. It was a bit sad.

As ""Titanic"" used the oceanliner and its inevitable fate as the backdrop in a deeper story - albeit a fictional one, so does this movie use its own backdrop as a fulcrum of sorts for several forays into the pathways of human experience.As always, stories of humanity, no matter how well the visuals are conceived and presented, will fall flat and lifeless if the *characters* are not on a par with the screenplay and look. No worries: these main stars have never disappointed before and most certainly do not here! And the young actor, somehow, and unexpectedly - well, he's about as good as it gets, and his scenes with Fiennes are golden.We've all seen movies that we users basically like a lot, yet contradict the terrible scores from critics - ""Hillbilly Elegy "" anybody? - but when both user reviewers and critics are agreeing and are saying the same things, it's a pretty safe bet you will not be wasting your time.

I knew a young girl with rheumatic fever when I was a teen in the 60's. I learned about the heart problems that can occur from it at that time. Maybe there are those who do not understand where medical science was at that time.
The character development was great. I took away one star as I would have wished this could be viewed by younger people to get a sense of what those days before war was declared.

It's as if the makers thought an archaeologically centred film would be too dry without some kind of love interest. Instead more could have been made of what a narrow escape the Sutton Hoo find had. If it hadn't been found in summer 1939, that piece of land would have been used as a British Army tank training ground a few months later when war broke out.

250,alightinthedarkfilms,A fine show until....,6,29 January 2021,"I was really enjoying this in the first half. The acting was first rate, down to earth, focused and skilled, dialogue was also quite realistic. Then...here we go again... the show dissolves in the standard fashionable route preferring PC undertones and diverting the emotional eye away from what was humanly and historically fascinating in the opening act. A clumsy musical score only goes to punctuate this as the film is driven down an abandoned rabbit hole. Why won't you just stop with the emasculation, quasi historical snobbery rubbish and allow the romances to shine in what is a fair and solid drama arc. Stop scraping our bones please!Didn't like the talking out of shot either, a cheap trick and in my opinion lazy. Directing the actors to speak in the shot and then edit the scene using the best performances is what making a film is. This director appears unsure, including in what it is to make a film, preferring to copy Fellini or the like. Its almost like two different films in one. If they merged then why not that has been achieved... sadly not here, these often, under lit sub plot, bumped clumsily into each other like two walrus's, I mean in a painful way.I love Ralph Fiennes in this and many of his films, he seems to be one of those rare individuals working in British Film and why does even bother? I mean, he must be seriously wealthy by now...still he remains true to his craft and keeps growing as a skilled artist.

It is slow, comfortable, and makes heroes of those who truly are unsung heroes.I liked it. It has heart and you care for the characters who you are supposed to care about.

252,FlossieCat,An enjoyable film but...,8,1 February 2021,"We watched this last night and thoroughly enjoyed it. The contribution that Basil Brown made to archaeology and that particular discovery was emphasised and he was given the credit that academia, for some years, denied him..In some respects it was a real life event used as an allegory with Britain on the cusp of another terrible war with Germany and with the threat of invasion. Meanwhile in the quiet Suffolk countryside an ancient burial ship is being excavated of another German invader whose people, fifteen centuries previously, had invaded and conquered the island and who had brought their culture and language, ruled the country and given England both its name (Engla land) and its broadly invented identity as an ""Anglo Saxon"" country.We even got a hint of the ""Anglo Saxon"" warrior caste when the body of the young RAF pilot (another warrior) who has crashed and drowned is seen laid out (like a burial) in a small boat and brought to the shore.The photography was glorious with lovely lingering shots taken at dusk and dawn of the countryside and the mounds, while the recreation of the ship burial was superb. All in all a slow somewhat Ingmar Bergman-like approach to both dialogue and cinematography which was hugely enjoyable.Now to the buts. Did nine year old Robert really cycle from Woodbridge to Diss (30 miles/49 km) without anyone noticing?Carey Mulligan was too young to be Edith Pretty who would have been 56 in 1939 and Ken Stott was too old to be Charles Phillips who would have been 38 in 1939.The photographs of the excavation were taken by two teachers who were on holiday in the area and Edith's cousin Rory is an invention purely to provide a fictional love interest with ""Peggy"" Piggott whose marriage to Stuart Piggott actually ended in 1956. She went on to pursue her own academic career and in later life was in regular contact with Stuart .Finally why did the screenwriter feel obliged to suggest that Stuart Piggott was gay? As far as I am aware there is no evidence to suggest that he was, so why was it introduced?Or is having a token LGBTQ+ and/or a person of colour now de rigueur for all films?",The Dig

A made for Netflix period piece, The Dig recalls those dark days as Great Britain prepares to go to war with Hitler's military machine. An amateur, yet skilled archaeologist, Basil Brown, is retained by the wealthy owner of the Sutton Hoo estate to allow him to search for ancient artifacts on her sprawling farm. Mrs. Edith Pretty rankles The British Museum's curator, by selecting Mr. Brown university over degreed archeologists supported by him.
Basil enlists the estate's farm staff and the young son of Mrs. Pretty, Robert, to begin searching for the treasure trove. Her handsome brother Rory (Johnny Flynn) joins the dig and falls in love with Mrs. Pretty's assistant, the lovely (and very married) Peggy Piggott (Lily James). A substantial sub-plot is developed by this entanglement.
Mr. Brown's surprising, father-like mentoring of Robert, is a wonderful second sub-plot, that adds an endearing twist to the story.
Clearly one of the best films of the year, Aussie Simon Stone directs a beautifully flowing tribute to Brown. Stone is best known as an actor, but received praise for 2015's The Daughter, his first directorial outing, which he also wrote.
The Dig is a huge cinematic success; Mike Eley's eye for the simplicity of the land and delicacy of the English countryside is praise-worthy. Stone and Eley both have earned Oscar considerations.
Clearly this is Ralph Fiennes tour-de-force. He makes one genuinely care for his Basil Brown. Fiennes' portrayal of Brown's steadfast allegiance to Mrs. Pretty and her son, really adds to the re-telling of this true story. Cary Mulligan as Edith Pretty is wonderful, as always, playing a character who was fifteen years older than herself.

Alas, not enough to make it interesting.While the start is promising and portrays Basil's (Ralph Fiennes) passion and great work, halfway through the movie the storyline just switches. What started as an ode to Basil's work, the importance of the find and Mrs. Pretty's trust, quickly turned into a story a love story about two characters we hardly care about. Suddenly, Basil is nothing more than a sidelined character who's just kind of ""there"". Like the makers of the movie just decided to make a completely different film halfway through.I feel the movie does little more justice to acknowledge Basil's work than history has done by not acknowledging it. His importance and find have been overshadowed by a random love story we've all seen before in many other movies and to have sidelined the archeological find and Basil's importance for some cheap love story, feels wrong.",The Dig

Kramer, movie critic for 'Salon' ezine, wrote, "" There is a nagging sense that the film should have played up the importance of the Sutton Hoo find more,"" as he faults the movie for concentrating more on the characters than on the archaeology.I disagree with him as I watched this film with questions about life, death, how we live and the choices we make for whatever reasons at the time. As the archaeological find of the Anglo-Saxon burial ship proceeds, we are confronted with the thought that this ancient ship was constructed, then buried, by real people. This plays out against the backdrop of England preparing for what we know will be a horrific war in which millions will be killed. Life in the midst of death, death a presence in every life, and yet we as a people live on. What will archaeologists of the future find of us?Ralph Fiennes conveys the the fully realized character of the proud, stubborn excavator with profoundly effective subtle changes revealed by his eyes, his pipe, and his occasional hint of a smile. Carey Mulligan as Edith Pretty, the owner of mound being excavated, is more of the cliched stalwart, stiff upper-lip British lady; the well-written script heavily favors excavator Basil Brown.The director utilized a sure hand in the shaping of the film, the cinematography was gorgeous and the only somewhat jarring note was the rather buffoonish behavior of the so-called professionals from time to time.",The Dig

290,Fatemeh_Hadi,An Inspiring Soothing Real Story,10,9 February 2021,"It is one of those films that are soothing for me to watch. Knowing characters like Edith existed (and continue to exist) turns on a light. She tells excavator Basil Brown that she ""feels"" something lays beneath the mounds on her property. Of course she is an experienced archeologist and of course, as Daniel Kahneman says, she has the ""expert intuition"" but she says she feels, nonetheless. She pursued this undertaking not only because as an archeologist she could recognize the patterns but also because she was compelled by her inner forces to try and create something very much worth experiencing and not just for herself. As the story progresses she finds out she is terminally ill. She draws strength from each to face the other and manages to make such harmonious realizations of both endeavors. It reminded me of a scene in which Harry (in Harry Potter stories), abandoning all apparent logic, goes to see Hagrid in his shed. I don't recall in what context this happens but I do remember as a result of this act, everyone (that mattered) came to a better understanding of the situation. It doesn't seem like a significant scene but it had stayed with me, I think, because it shows how beautiful it can be if we sometimes embody something more than mere common wisdom.In a scene Mr. Brown's wife, trying to reassure him of his work, reminds him of some of his own words. She remarks archeology is not about the past nor it is about the present but that it is about the future, so that future generations know what came before them, know their forefathers. Because of their findings it became clear that Anglo Saxons were cultured people that had rich rituals, art and trade.After extracting the treasure and after all the excitements are over, Mr. Brown returns to the cite to carefully bury back the ship or more precisely the impressions of the ship, giving it the respect it deserved. Not only by his conviction, he shed some light to the lives of the people who had lived more than thirteen centers before in the land but also he had the capacity to pay respect to the people who were gone eons before.And all of this happened while some people were thinking the best thing could be done was waging a war against humanity and, well, the rest were making preparations for defense.One thing I'd like to point out is I think a typical child does not respond to the pain of that magnitude like how Edith's son is portrayed. A child's response would be more like Conor in A Monster Calls. Now that I've mentioned this I have to confess I adore both Carey Mulligan and Felicity Jones.

The movie is not exactly casual watching. You have to really sit down and wait the movie closely. Some of the dialogue gets heavy, and the little details require a lot of attention to catch.

Archeology might be a tough sell for the premise of a film and it was these actors that drew me in. The first half gets it so right, it's just about the time period and characters digging while becoming excited as they unearth the past, it's rather simple yet these actors have no trouble keeping you interested. In fact it was refreshing to see English people presented on screen becoming excited over finding evidence of their ancestors and past to this ancient land given the current hostile attitude towards the English and Celtic peoples by particular political groups and media companies who like to remind us we have little culture and heritage.Then suddenly it's as if the writers thought viewers would become bored and in comes a new character, a rather modern-behaving ""liberated"" female with her controlling husband, inserted into the plot to remind us how women should really behave in the current age as if we needed reminding.

308,noahtaylorvt,Bigger than just us,8,8 February 2021,"Established by early shots, that somehow manage to capture a sky too big for any camera, The Dig reminds viewers that life is more than the ground panning by our stumbling feet. Each and every camera shot is painstakingly placed matching up time of day to the emotions and nuance of the script. One can almost forgive some of the stilted, and all too perfectly worded exchanges late in the film as inconsequential; weighted against the larger picture enveloping the viewer. Yet for every stumble in that script, a verbal polished relic of adoration emerges to further bind image to sound.With the sheer volume and regularity of movies being released in the arms race of streaming services, the script and story are often the lynch pin in weather or not a movie stands appart, and yet, the casting in The Dig almost asks us to forgo these thoughts and coalesce like water colors into a scene simply by the remarkable cast put together by Lucy Bevins. The directorial work Simone Stone cannot be understated here. His vision possibly shines the brightest in how understated yet convincing all of the actors take to their parts. Every actor on display sheds their persona and let the ensamble of characters, story, and music take the forefront.The score by Stefan Gregory fades and crescendos in harmony with the poetry on display continually throughout The Dig's runtime. Comparisons with Jóhann Jóhannsson's exceptional work in Arrival would probably be a solid association for moviegoers that enjoyed that sound scape. The interweaving violin and cello work had my breathe weaving in rhythm as the cinematography constantly impressed.If you are simply a fan of cinema, The Dig will leave you feeling a sense of awe, hope, and comfort, knowing that the form as art is alive and well.",The Dig
309,sspina,Well done but unnecessary,5,4 April 2021,"This is the type and style of film that I normally love but this one just didn't connect with me.To start with the positive, the casting was great, Carey Mulligan is fantastic as always. The cinematography was beautiful, the dialogue was well written and felt really believable.Now to my issues with the film:To start with, a lot of my criticisms are just things that irritate me personally in films and they're to do with editing. The main ones being:
a) when the music is more dramatic than the scene warrants. The score for this was nice but just like these big, dramatic, orchestral pieces for like most of the film when there was not all that much happening.B) the overuse of the thing where there's dialogue playing over a different scene. This works when the scene happening is relevant to the dialogue or if there's a clear connection or dramatic irony at play or if it's used for like a few seconds as a scene changeover. But this was like long bits of conversation playing over like a bit of a scene that was completely unimportant. Like we're hearing a conversation but seeing the characters walking to the place where they're having that conversation for a really long time for no reason... that just bothers me when it's used frequently in a film, I'd much rather see the conversation that's actually happeningBut my actual main criticism of this film was that I just didn't feel like there was enough story to fill a film. The story and the characters just weren't particularly interesting for me. I don't really feel like I learned anything or took anything away really. I didn't connect emotionally with any of it really and there wasn't really the highs and lows of tension that you expect from a film.And don't get me wrong, I usually love a slow film when it's well done but this just felt like a bit of a waste of time to me so I was disappointed, I was so sure I was going to love this film but...never mind!",The Dig

In 2 hours they dig a mound, find treasure (we get a glimpse of a couple of golden unidentified objects) and give it to the museum. That's it. I suppose the pathetically weak romantic subplot involving two minor characters was an attempt to add momentum. The other main draw was apparently the dialect coach who helped Fiennes. Great.
If you want scenery, go for a drive. If you want to know anything about Sutton Hoo, visit Wikipedia. If you want romance, watch Bridges of Maddison Country (if you must). Otherwise, you'll learn nothing and experience little, but hopefully have a nice nap with The Dig.

But this is a poorly written story beneath the quality of the actors in the film. The pace is too slow after the beginning character development. Well acted, except for the lame and vastly overdramatized social message inserted as the film goes on with Lily James character and her husband. Had the story concentrated on the history, and the archaeological importance as well as how the basic characters involved it dealt with those issues, it could have been good. As soon as the obviously politically pandering sexual element enters the film, it becomes aggravating and foolish.

321,heartspill,Don't expect bull whips and magic trinkets,8,18 February 2021,"It is quite amusing to read through negative comments of reviewers who obviously expected an action filled plot of the likes of Indiana Jones. But unlike Mr. Brown's fictional contemporary, the life of an archaeologist is a far cry from Hollywood's take on this humble profession. This film rather adequately depicts the reality of archaeology in the 1930's and 40's, much of which still persists today. The shovel and mattock are more often the tools of choice than the trowel and brush. The tedious and often dull excavation work requires a strong social aspect and comradely on a site sees them through the often miserable work conditions, with inadequate site facilities and unfavourable weather conditions that persist in this part of the world. It is thus no surprise that much of the movie shows these mundane but essential relationships, the human aspect of being an archaeologist. It may come across as being dull but it is ample in accurately portraying archaeology.
The arrogance of some formally trained archaeologists, especially those of high reputation, are legendary and the tension between the excavators and the scholars is portrayed rather well, albeit with a bit of tongue-in-cheek humour. But there are also the difficult diplomatic endeavours to massage some egos and satisfy juxtaposed agendas by various parties involved just so that the excavation can continue. The excitement of finally revealing the secret of a site, not always as sensational as Sutton Hoo - gold and other treasure are a rare occurrence indeed - make up for the all the hardships encountered.
Archaeology during that time often lacked the scientific rigour of modern excavations and this movie adequately depicts this.
The performances are convincing and do the true nature of the profession justice. The set of the excavation has been reconstructed with great care and the archaeology depicted true to the detail. All in all it is a slow but thoroughly enjoyable movie. If you loved Indiana Jones or Tomb Raider then this movie is probably not for you. If you love archaeology as much as I do, then I would highly recommend it for you.",The Dig

You can feel the sense of giving award winning performances. I thought the trailer very misleading and wished I hadn't watched it. Far from being a celebration of life it was morbidly focused with relief from a couple of characters, including the young son. Not a good way to spend an evening and just not enough positivity to balance out the central characters' resignedness to misery. Best watched only as a what not to do.",The Dig

325,domwong1-1,"First half wonderful, second half irrelevant",5,10 July 2021,"Firstly, the acting was top notch. Fiennes, playing a subdued Indiana Jones, was superb as was Mulligan, amazing as a widowed, rich and dying single mother. The crescendo to the find was brilliantly done and the treasures within had so much potential, including the inquest.And then it suddenly switched to a bizarre love story between two characters who didn't feature in the first half at all. No relevance to the dig or anything really from the first part. Very disappointing and confusing. There could have been so much to work with but they simply decided to forget it all as a footnote and focus on something else entirely. The treasures, the inquest, the relationship between Fiennes and Mulligan - felt like I'd been cheated.So, watch the first part and be happy and turn off when Peggy arrives because there is nothing to see after that.",The Dig

When the plot started to stray from Basil and Edith, soon followed by Johnny Flynn's character appearing, for me the film went downhill. Even had Johnny's Rory been a genuine character from history it was obvious that he was going to portray a) a hero and b) a love interest. I never believed the connection between him and the ill-married woman and it just seemed put in to give Johnny a role. (I like Johnny Flynn's music and really wanted to like him as an actor too). Another major gripe for me was the soundtrack. I started gritting my teeth at the predictable and interminable 2-note keyboard with chords behind, so cheesy.",The Dig

And of course, in good old Hollywood fashion, the token 'gay' representation gets thrown in there. Why? My G*d is that going to happen with EVERY SINGLE MOVIE now? It's so painfully obvious and it absolutely destroys the 'flow' of the movie. A 'side plot' just to make room for political correctness. How utterly pathetic.

341,RamseyReviews1,"Not a ""hole"" lot to like. Good acting but the story just wasn't interesting enough.",5,2 February 2021,"5/10 StarsThey tried to dress this movie up with world war 2 droplets but in the end it bombed. A story about a man and his hole just wasn't entertaining enough for me. Odd sequences of dialogue between characters while the characters were doing mundane things. Almost felt like the movie was just glitching at times.I found myself more interested in the start of world war 2 then I did the dig. Probably because after the first 45 minutes or so it seemed like they were pretty much done with the project and forgot that the movie had another 75 minutes of runtime left.The Dig is a previously untold real life story of an excavator (Basil Brown played by Ralph Fiennes) who is hired by a wealthy widow (Edith Pretty played by Carey Mulligan) dying of cancer, to dig up her land in hopes of discovering something historic before World War 2 shuts the country and project down.I'd say the biggest problem with this movie was they didn't make the dig itself important enough to the plot. There was little suspense nor was there much build up behind the story. The writers didn't do a good enough job describing why this dig was so important to the characters involved or history in general. They got caught in between making this movie about Basil Brown, who's credit for his discovery was lost in history and Edith Pretty, who was dying from cancer and wanted to leave behind a legacy for her son and family to be remembered by and the historical importance of the actual findings from the dig itself. They should have picked a lane and drove everything else around it.I did like the acting by the two main characters, Mr. Brown and Mrs. Pretty. They both were very intriguing characters in their own right. I just wish I could have had a little bit more from them and less from the side story love affair between 2 randoms that oddly enter the film halfway.I liked the soundtrack and the shots of this small town in England. I liked the aura they were building up as they incorporated scenes of England preparing to fight World War 2. Wish they would have played that urgency up more though. The impending warn in combination with the fact that you now have a character in Brown desperate to make a name for himself with limited time to finish what will end up being the biggest archaeological dig of his life who desperately needs the support and encouragement of a women in Pretty who's health is quickly deteriorating should have made for a good movie. And even though I think they executed it poorly, I still think The Dig wasn't half bad. Has its moments, especially within that first hour that I enjoyed.Overall I think this movie can be skipped but if you watch it until the end you probably won't be as disappointed as my review will lead you to believe. It will have its moments with the well acted characters. However you'll leave it wondering why they didn't execute the story better and probably find yourself to be just down right uninterested in what they did show.",The Dig

The prospect of a film based on the discovery of Sutton Hoo, starring Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan, sounds like the perfect combination. And it starts out promisingly, with wonderfully rich period detail and stunning scenery. It becomes clear at once that this is a movie for the patient viewer, with its deliberate English dramatic pacing. Where it began to fall short, for me, is when it became apparent that there was going to be very little done with the fact that Sutton Hoo is perhaps the most significant archaeological site in Britain and its discovery and what was learned from it is an amazing tale. Some of that could have been woven into the narrative, just a bit. Otherwise, there was very little interpretive value in the film, and while it is a drama, the stories of the main characters, which are told with a bit of artistic license, are not very compelling or interesting. The side plots of minor characters even less so. The magnitude of the discovery, to me, was not successfully conveyed in this movie, which is a shame. In the end, it is a good British period drama with solid acting, adequate writing, high production values and beautiful cinematography, that just never quite gets to the point it should and could have. For folks who are not fans of British slow burn television, it will be mind-numbingly boring.",The Dig

354,brucekuehn,Ralph Fiennes is quietly astonishing,9,10 February 2021,"Acting for motion pictures is a strange occupation. A whole crew of people with their equipment is standing in front of a person pretending they are not there and trying to inhabit a character different than themselves. When all the work is finally done, an audience watches and hopefully is transported away and into a story in an experience similar to a trance. In a really successful film, there are many artists who are considered for the ""technical awards"" and The Dig is one of those, but let me write about one actor.
As an audience, we know instantly when acting is done poorly but sometimes I fear we miss when it is performed so well that it is invisible. Ralph Fiennes (he is Welsh and everyone by now should know - pronounced like Rafe Fines) delivers a performance that is so complete that it is as close to perfection as anything I've ever seen. There is not a millisecond where he is not this ""excavator"". He portrays a simple man who is very complex. He appears to be a common farmer who is really a self-taught intellectual. He is a humble man who knows his worth and wants to be remembered. Honest pride lies under a quiet nature. His job involves shoveling massive amounts of dirt while being directed by his acute scientific mind.
All this is revealed by our actor. The body language, the shuffling gate, the stooped posture of a laborer, but the quick eyes that show his knowledge. He also is a man of his time and not ours. There is something so authentic in the performance that it suggests time travel. He reminded me immediately of the old timers I knew as a boy who are now long dead. Men who never really got all the dirt out of the deep cracks in their hands.
Ralph Fiennes never cries or shouts or has the long soliloquy, but what a transformation! He simply becomes. That, to me, is what screen acting attempts but rarely achieves.",The Dig

In fact she was an experienced and competent archaeologist in her own right.

Since this sharp left turn involves the introduction of female issues and a new female character who enjoys considerable face-time, and who makes critical discoveries and insights, perhaps it was thought that insufficient attention had been paid to the recent mandate regarding empowering female characters in film.

You say because Ralph Fiennes. I agree, today he is probably

I didn't understand what the author wanted to say with his work. What should I understand after watching this movie, how will I become better after seeing this, what will the movie can teach me?
Is this movie about passionate people ? ""No, I didn't see a passion for digging in Carey Mulligan. When she was called to look at the found ship, her reaction was about the same as if I would see a promotion for a second free hamburger at McDonald's.
There was an attempt to create several hooks that logically
should have led to the development of the plot. But for some reason, the director or screenwriter did not develop this. It can be seen that the authors of the film have a bad idea of what really burning people look like, who are burning with ideas to find something new.
The result was a shallow and sometimes not logical movie, I do not feel sorry for any of the characters.

409,rup_74,A Film of Two Halves,6,5 February 2021,"A movie that focuses on pre-war archaeological discovery is currently newsworthy with ""The Dig"" being released on Netflix on the 40th anniversary of the first installment of Indiana Jones' rollicking adventures; ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Whilst, Indiana Jones is pure fiction and action oriented, ""The Dig"" is a romantic drama that meanders from the outset. Having said that, the key events surrounding the excavation of an Anglo Saxon treasure ship are loosely based on true events. A wealthy widow played by Carey Mulligan permits an experienced amateur archaeologist (Ralph Fiennes) to investigate what lurks beneath the mysterious hillocks that frequent her windswept coastal Suffolk estate.The film begins beautifully with the countryside offering a dreamy backdrop to the main character's burgeoning friendship and their respective plights. The viewer is transported back in time, and becomes a participant in the hunt to find hidden treasures. The camera work poetically caresses the senses, and it's undoubtedly a movie that demands a spare plot so the viewer can soak up the atmosphere, and fully appreciate the masterclass performances from the two leads.This initially, well rounded art house film gradually morphs into a more wishy washy affair with a group of newly introduced characters stealing the lead actors' thunder halfway through. Another recent slow burning, visual piece - ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" (2019) flourished by having unhindered character development, and by remaining true to its inherent nature from start to finish. It (seemingly) wasn't made first and foremost as a box office venture like material made for Netflix often is. A decision was probably made (in The Dig) to shift gears from its established tempo, so as to grab the attention of the kind of viewer who might be nodding off, or who prefers a bit more sex appeal. As a result - it's a movie of two halves. 6/10 overall",The Dig
410,bhkhannan,More toil than story,3,1 February 2021,"The Dig (2021) **When stuck in a plot hole, crime writer Raymond Chandler used to send in a new character with a gun. Simon Shine has employed the same concept, minus weaponry. People just keep turning up in the Dig, adding very little to the story, which in itself, setting aside National Trust hype, is on the slim side. A sixth-century burial site (thought it does cast new light on the Dark Ages so we are told) is not in the same archeological class as a velociraptor or an Egyptian tomb. Mostly, we are misled. For the first third it looks like we are heading for Lady Chatterley's Lover territory with posh lady (Carey Mulligan) eyeing up the digger (Ralph Fiennes) until his wife turns up. Then it looks like it's going to be a battle royal between Fiennes and the Establishment, but that is headed off.It's 1939 so the Second world War is on its way. Cue the arrival of wannabe pilot (Johnny Flynn). A top archaeologist (Ken Stott) also appears but that doesn't go anywhere either, bringing with him Ben Chaplin and Lily James fresh from their honeymoon. James gets the hots for Johnny Flynn and there's just enough time before the credits roll for them to get at it.This is the kind of film that has money to spend on an old WW2 aeroplane or maybe a CGI version of one but not enough for decent sound recording equipment. Most of the time conversations are over the shoulder or in long shot. It's not just words, it's expressions, faces that tell a story, and being denied these seems bizarre. It may be an artistic decision, some critic thought we were being made to ""dig"" for the story. But it's hard enough to work up any enthusiasm without being made to work harder.Ralph Fiennes is excellent, a son of the soil, self-taught, but no shrinking violet either. His scenes with posh lady's son (Archie Barnes) are very touching, the young lad having invented a whole world for himself. Carey Mulligan just looks as though she's about to burst into tears, probably wondering how she managed to be talked into playing (at age 34) a woman who was actually 56 at the time of the dig and wishing Nicole Kidman and Cate Blanchett (closer to that age) who were at one point attached had not left her to it.The dig itself is interesting - but only for about five minutes. We know all we need to know about the boring sifting and brushing and digging from other films and we don't learn more from this except how easy it is for a wall to suddenly collapse and nearly kill someone.
The most intriguing part of the film came at the end when we discovered that the burial ship dug up was buried for the duration of the war in an Underground station in London. How did they manage that, I wondered. Whereas I didn't wonder much about anything else in this film.",The Dig

However, the material meanders. It's very much a run of the mill BBC pot boiler of the kind that Miramax trotted out twice a month in the early '90s, with very little to get you excited. The creatives seemed to have picked that up halfway through the script, so they added a completely inconsequential love triangle amongst the co-stars and saddled poor Lily James with some terrible situations and silly dialogue. Ben Chaplin and Lily James picking out sleeping arrangements sent me to the fridge for sustenance to bare me through the last 45 minutes. The stakes of the find at the center of the ""action"" are that Anglo Saxon civilization had attained cultural heights in Ipswich much earlier than previously known. That seems to be totally irrelevant to the protagonists. Moments of consequence, generally when Carey's characters take on the cultural establishment, mostly happen off screen. (Ran out of money? Ended up on the cutting room floor?) If the characters, the writers and the director don't care about the stakes, why should I?",The Dig

425,rpvtimcotter,The Dig is two films that should be nowhere near each other.,4,3 February 2021,"One is an interesting, yet slow drama of an amateur archeologist meeting a woman who's willing to take a chance on him all based on real life events. The other is an appropriate period piece about a young woman finding herself in a loveless marriage with a gay husband in the 1930's, a less forgiving age of such thing. On their own, they both have merit. Together, they make a confused story, weaving around the two distinct plots so often that it seems like it's forgetting what it's about.It's an unfortunate result as both these plots are filled with charismatic writing and carried by phenomenal acting, Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes in the former plot, and Lily James and Johnny Flynn in the latter.Depending on which story drew you in, watching The Dig is like treading water, shifting between above water and below. Those shifts can sometimes bring jarringly violent as well, giving its audience the wrong kind of realization of just how much of this film is at war with itself. Is it about the glaring classism in the field of science or about love and loss? Is this a character study of people of that era or a story of how learning and honoring the past can bind people in the present?The movie attempts to bridge these gaps by including moments where the two distinct plots and themes intersect, but those moments of fleeting and stop short of making the point come across to its full effect.Perhaps the creators of The Dig did not think the nonfictional aspect of the plot centered around the Sutton Hoo excavation were enough to fill an entire film, a point to which I agree. Then the question becomes one that a movie-goer should never ask: why make this film at all?",The Dig

Wow! Fiennes in the lead role. Couldn't go wrong could it?
He comes across as lobotomised and the Suffolk accent is ridiculous. You can just imagine him looking in the mirror saying 'moooorrniiiin' over and over and crunching a carrot to get in character.
The performances all round are pretty bad and the Lady Penelope character acts about 150 years out of place.
Worst of all is the film where almost nothing happens. Enthralling it isn't. Unless you enjoy watching Fiennes put on and take off wellies.
It would have been vastly improved by making the artefacts/treasure themselves as the main story and a nuanced and subtle Mr Basil Brown (it didn't help that this alliterative name continually evoked images of Basil Brush! Boom! Boom!) would still have been the central character and hogged the limelight but the iconic helmet etc. were nowhere to be seen.
Instead we were left with a seemingly challenged central character and innocuous, irrelevant sidekicks (e.g. the wife of Fiennes) who again appeared to be one brick short.
Slow torture it were and it's a shame as the subject matter could have been handled so much more adroitly.
Spielberg or Ridley Scott would have insisted on imagined flashbacks to the burial with CGI. If Ray Winstone could do it in Beowulf!

However, the ultimate tragedy of the characters and the looming threat of a war in which we know thousands died overshadows any hope that can be gleaned from Basil Brown's insistence that we live on and we're part of something continuous. By the end of the film, it seems Edith Pretty was right in saying 'We die and we decay'.The subtle, intelligent performances from Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan and stunning cinematography from Mike Eley of familiar countryside made this film. Archie Barnes (who played Robert Pretty) also put in an impressive performance; his face is one I expect to see in British film in the coming years.What made this movie good when it could have been great was mostly down to a poor, unoriginal story decision. The romantic subplot was completely unnecessary and felt chiselled in, only adding runtime and pushing the balance of pacing to too slow. Some editing decisions were also not wholly effective, choosing to replace shots of dialogue, acting I should like to have seen, with wider shots of the characters and landscape while the dialogue played under these.This may seem like a more negative review, but this film really touched me. 'We all fail' (Basil Brown) will stick with me as the hard but nonetheless comforting lesson of 'The Dig'.",The Dig

The film is beautifully shot, the atmosphere of pre-war Suffolk is captured in subtle muted colours and the local accent is accurately portrayed. Treat it as a film, and you will love it. However if you look for the facts, you will find many variances. In particular you will discover that Peggy's liaison is fictional, and the two actual photographers were omitted.

It could easily have been edited down to an hour. The movie was saved by the impeccable performance of Ralf Fiennes as Basil Brown, with a pretty credible Suffolk accent.
SPOILER ALER
The writer clearly needed to pad out what, after all, is a very simple story with the entirely irrelevant triangular love saga of the frigid relationship between Stuart and Peggy Piggot, and the fictional cardboard-cutout character of dashing young Rory Lomax. The Piggots had apparently just come off their honeymoon, but clearly had no interest in each other and Peggy eventually fell for Rory. Earlier in the movie, Rory, who was about to join the RAF, had bravely dived into a river to attempt to rescue the pilot of a Spitfire that had crashed into it. Rory appeared to hold his breath for several minutes while extracting the pilot's body. This whole side story was irrelevant, ill-fitting and distracting from the main plot.
Having praised Ralph Fiennes, I cannot say the same for Carey Mulligan as my instant reaction on first seeing her on screen was ""Oh there is a young actress trying to portray a character much older than herself"".
Being new to Netflix, this is the first of their home-grown movies I have watched. I was disappointed at how they could spend so much time and effort to make a movie that looked so good, but in its structure and narrative was so disappointing.",The Dig

467,davidrodd,Fascinating history,9,19 October 2021,"Having been to Sutton Hoo in the past, I was interested to learn a bit more about its history. I accept that any movie will distort history for the purpose of making a good story better, but I felt that the main points were covered well and I enjoyed the film sufficiently to recommend it to friends and family who had also visited the site.

I love archeological films and I love films set in wartime Europe, especially England. I cannot find anything about this incredible story there I didn't like. Even the slower moving sections held my interest. Getting to know each character, their stories and their impact on the outcome was a mixture of amazing cinematography, screenwriting, acting and storytelling. Do not miss this movie because you will miss one outstanding film. Make popcorn, build a nice fire in the fireplace, cuddle up with your best girl,or,guy and have a wonderful evening.",The Dig

The only bug bear I had, was, it wasn't long enough. I wanted to see what happened with the other characters. Myself and hubby were already making our own endings up, and it would have been nice to see if we got it right. Such a feel good, but sad film. Made even better to know it was based on a true story, and the treasures can be found in the British Museum. Only gave it 8out of 10, as I felt the ending was rushed, and there was a lot more that could have been told.",The Dig
477,amfriedland47,A story for the ages,10,1 February 2021,"Others will review the acting, direction, costumes and cinematography, all of which are excellent. To me, however, this film is distinguished by its slow revelation of the human spirit in the context of the slow motion of history. The mounds hid treasures unknown for over a thousand years. The ""excavator"" - the real hero of the story - is an under appreciated genius, whose work is quickly commandeered by the representatives of formal society. The owner seems to be just another wealthy heiress, until you learn the tragedy of her widowhood and her frail health. And the minor character of the excavator's wife is first seen as a bumbling ignorant woman, until you see her strength in supporting her husband in his moment of weakness and defeat. There's more, but all in the same vein of discovery of that which is at first hidden. ""The Dig"" connects past, present and future, one generation to those that came before and those that will come after. Truly, a story for the ages.",The Dig
478,jwycoff-641-926025,Man finds thing. Museum gets thing.,6,5 February 2021,"And I killed 2 hours that needed killing. And somewhere in the last half, the movie turns into a teen drama or something like it.I won't be a total downer though. The Dig has superior acting, a great setting/period, and an amazing ""based on true events"" story line. Unfortunately, after the big reveal around 20 minutes in, there just wasn't any more tension or drama. What drama there was felt forced and trite.In the second half the main characters, the main plot, and the ship all take a backseat to the drummed up love triangle of the ancillary-at-best characters that we care nothing about. This just feels awkward and doesn't really accomplish anything. The plot engine was definitely idled at the half. In the end the museum wins and the girl in the love triangle gets banged among the ruins of an old farmhouse and Ralph is left wondering why he wasted his talents on this experiment. That is all. Enjoy!",The Dig
479,beijingweek,Wonderful film in the tradition of some of the British classics,10,31 January 2021,"Great acting and marvellous photography. Ralph Fiennes's rural character has echoes of similar country types in classic British films made in that era, such as Thomas Colpeper in Canterbury Tale (who wants British soldiers to appreciate the ancient history of the pilgrim way). Likewise Lily James character is an uncanny parallel to the young female archeologist played by Sheila Sim in Canterbury Tale - whose sweetheart was in the RAF! This film also reminded me of Went The Day Well, especially the poacher who trains his dog to help him evade the local bobby.",The Dig

481,john-2023,"Er...so, where's the treasure?",9,1 February 2021,"Just watched it on Netflix. Great watch, despite the rather shocking lack of interest in the actual Sutton Hoo objects, which are are barely shown. I was expecting a sort of montage of them over the end credits, but no, all we got was Ralph Fiennes reburying the ship as everyone prepped to hunker down and do their bit for WW2. Very strange omission, especially for international audiences who must wonder at the end what all the fuss was about. Not enough to have a character yell that they proved Anglo Saxons weren't cavemen. Likely revisions in the actual history, particularly regarding ages of participants at the time (Carey Mulligan) sent us scurrying to Google to find out what was true, and what was mayonnaise. A lot of mayonnaise! Especially regarding the romantic subplot, but at least they avoided any Fiennes and Mulligan sexual tension, despite the plot gasping for it, as it were.",The Dig

485,aimeeleroi,"Beautiful, Well Rounded Movie",9,10 September 2021,"It is such a beautiful movie, stylistically and substantially. The cinematography throughout the entire movie is absolutely stunning. It's not a dialogue heavy movie, so the cinematography really visually caries as much weight as dialogue would-especially in instances where characters aren't speaking a whole lot. The director of photography for the film really understood how to use lighting to tell a story as well because the lighting-especially in certain shots-was downright stunning.The cast is absolutely fantastic as well. I enjoy pretty much any Ralph Fiennes movie I see, but he was particularly wonderful and well placed in this role. Lily James was phenomenal and well cast also; I didn't even recognize her until I looked up the cast list part way through. Carey Mulligan was wonderful as well; the boy who played her son, Archie Barnes, is absolutely darling and did a fantastic job for a role that I'm sure would have been quite challenging. The entire cast worked so well together as an ensemble. All of the characters are so well rounded. The story doesn't just focus on the archeological aspect what brought all of these characters together, it gives you insight into so many other aspects of their lives.It's definitely a movie that once you've seen it once, you can watch it again and really pick up on all the nuances and subtitles in the acting choices made by every member of the cast that really flesh out their characters.",The Dig

It's one of my favorite archaeological digs and has some of my favorite art. I was so excited when I saw that this movie came out and was so ready to watch it. I could only make it halfway. It breaks my heart to say it.The way the movie starts feels like you've missed the first 15 minutes of the movie. The slow building of drama and plot was so slow that a movie made by tortoises would have been faster. It has a great cast and the camera work is amazing but I just couldn't get into the story. It was hard to even care about the characters. I grew up on British TV and films, so I recognize that not all movies need to have Michael Bay explosions, but this movie is so dry and dull. I will probably attempt to finish it (if only to see the recreated art work) at a later time when I have lower expectations.",The Dig

489,garethallen-65236,Keep calm and keep digging,10,5 February 2021,"This film is compelling. The the plot would sound dull and ordinary if said aloud, but I could not take my eyes off the screen. Its as British as you can get. A moving, life affirming film thst plays to all its strengths and doesn't try to be anything it isn't but succeeds in everything that it is. The cinematography is gorgeous with wide beautiful landscapes of rural Suffolk countryside through various weather conditions. The acting is riveting and utterly authentic and the chemistry between all performers believable and holds your eyes and ears on the screen.
With strong links and having lived in Norfolk for 10 years, seeing the Suffolk accent absolutely nailed perfectly by Ralph F was a joy. The soundtrack was perfect and added everything it needed to and never caused a distraction to what was on screen. Having watched a number of straight to Netflix films for a long time now this is quite simply a cut above anything iv seen for a long time and would I'm sure in another time been a wonderful cinematic release.",The Dig
