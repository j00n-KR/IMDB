0,SnoopyStyle,wacky... too wacky,6,3 July 2021,"Barb (Annie Mumolo) and Star (Kristen Wiig) are middle-aged best friends. Their small town lives are thrown upside down when their work shuts down. They try to get back their shimmer by vacationing in Vista Del Mar, Florida. The ladies encounter hunky Edgar Pagét (Jamie Dornan) and have a wild night. Unbeknownst to them, he's on a deadly mission from evil supervillain Sharon Gordon Fisherman (Kristen Wiig).The supervillain part threw me off at first. I assumed it to be a movie with a movie. It's probably a step too wacky. It seems to me that Barb and Star would be funnier as fish out of water in this world. They should be the wackiest part and the movie world would react to them. Instead, everyone is wacky. I do really love hilarity of the threesome including the song and dance. That's the crux of this movie. I like Barb, Star, and Edgar. The rest may be too wacky like loud music that drowns out a good song. There is still some good fun to be had.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

Edgar is depressed and is part of a diabolical plot to release killer mosquitoes on the town.One of the criticism of Hollywood is there are few part for typical normal figured middle-aged women. Kristen Wiig decided to write and star in own film. The film is funny as you have to laugh at the talking club. Good chemistry.Guide: F-word. Implied sex.

2,paul_haakonsen,Hilarious and feel good movie...,6,29 August 2021,"Well ""Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar"" definitely turned out to be a surprise of a movie.When I sat down to watch the 2021 comedy ""Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar"" I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into, as I had not heard about the movie prior to watching it. However, I must say that I wasn't really harboring much of any high expectations, given the movie's cover/poster, sporting two women sitting on a crustacean and holding drinks.But as it always go, I believe in giving a movie a fair chance. So of course I sat down to watch this movie from writers Annie Mumolo and Kristen Wiig, who also happened to star in the movie.And boy this movie turned out to be something else. This movie was simply so enjoyable and just crammed with great comedy. There were so many scenes that makes you feel good and either makes you laugh or puts a big old smile on your lips. So yeah, if you get the chance to sit down and watch ""Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar"", do it!The two lead actresses Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo were great in the roles of Star and Barb.If you enjoy comedies, then you definitely should sit down to watch ""Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar"". My rating of this 2021 comedy from director Josh Greenbaum lands on well-deserved six out of ten stars.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
3,deloudelouvain,Absurd but certainly not bad. I enjoyed it very much!,8,3 March 2021,"Humor, it's something we will never agree about, as what's funny to somebody seems completely ridiculous to some one else. So yes Barb And Star Go To Vista Del Mar will devide people in two groups, the lovers and the haters. Count me in the lovers as I enjoyed this movie very much. I get it that it's absurd humor, but that's just the thing that makes it good and stands out from the rest. Somebody didn't like the songs, and I normally hate it when they start to sing in a movie, but in this case I have to admit the songs were hilarious and one of the best parts of the comedy. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo were the perfect duo to play in this comedy, a waterfall of words, never stopping rambling about everything and nothing. It added to that funny feelgood sensation. The whole cast was good and they all contributed in making this comedy a movie that I will watch again in the future.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
4,ksf-2,they need a vacation after their vacation,6,3 July 2021,"Produced by Will Ferrell and Kristen Wiig, so we know how things are going to go. Two gabby women, who have just lost their jobs at Jennifer Convertibles furniture store, decide to take a vacation. Off to Vista Del Mar! When they arrive, the hotel staff sings a song, but the music is so loud, we miss half the words. And.. they talk. And talk. And have adventures. And talk some more. It's all pretty silly, which is the whole idea. A farce. Has some funny bits here and there. Turns into a spy film. Sort of. Otherwise, not so much directed by Josh Greenbaum... has won many film festival awards. Written by Annie Mumolo and Kristen Wiig. Amusing, but nothing great.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
5,Edvis-1997,6,6,12 April 2021,"It's really decent movie. I dind't think that I'm going to like it but I did. Acting was on point, main characters did great job. Talking about plot. I've enjoyed beginning and middle of this movie but I'm not a fan of ending. It has other cons too, like too much of green screen and I didn't enjoy dancing and singing. I was swinging to give it 6 or 7 but after ending I couldn't give it 7. I would say it worth about 6.2-6.3. To sum up, really cute movie to watch and this year serves better movies than last year.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
6,Cineanalyst,Amusingly Absurd,6,4 May 2021,"""Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar"" is such a joyfully silly movie it rather defies criticism--at least beyond whether one finds it funny or not. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo, writers of ""Bridesmaids"" (2011), team up again, including with Mumolo joining Wiig on screen as a co-lead. This doesn't have the same impact that comedy did a decade ago, when women performing cringe humor still seemed novel and where the structure of the narrative was more intelligible than the nonsense here. I also don't understand why a picture that occasionally breaks into musical numbers, a crab doing a Morgan Freeman impersonation, parachute culottes and a turtles-escorted water nymph bothered to explain Barb and Star's ""shimmer.""Regardless, I enjoyed it well enough. Wiig, in dual roles, and Mumolo work well as a duo in an extended SNL-sketch sort of way. The business of good-natured nitwits--who seems as though they've been pulled out of the 1980s or something and placed into the modern day (I mean, a mobile-phone case for a land-line phone--what?)--inadvertently thwarting a revenge scheme that could've been thought up by Dr. Evil from the Austin Powers series seems as though it's a spoof of some genre I'm not familiar with, or maybe it's merely a slight twist on general buddy comedies combined with a parody of a Bond brand of villain. Anyways, as with ""Bridesmaids,"" Mumolo and Wiig might be best at writing for scene-stealing supporting roles. There, it was the Oscar-nominated Melissa McCarthy. This time, it's James Dornan--apparently, an actor whose career has heretofore been languishing in some pornographic franchise. Him breaking out in comically-sad song, ""Edgar's Prayer,"" frolicking around the beach in a parody of music videos is the movie's real climax.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
7,westsideschl,"Not My Type/Scene, But ...",8,1 May 2021,"Humorous take on the classic older ""girls"" (actually women who are still in girl mode) on vacation (the Florida beach scene in this case) in part to hook up.

8,cruise01,Random comedy film that gets more eye rolls than laughs.,4,7 April 2021,2 out of 5 stars.Barb and Star gets more eye rolls than laughs. It is a comedy film that tries to have its charm and giggles with its laughs from its likable cast. The humor is not that funny. The cheesy plot was bad. The direction is colorful and quirky. Its definitely forgettable.,Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
9,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar,10,19 February 2021,"10/10 - definitely a love-or-hate kind of movie (I for one loved it) that is part musical (I'm looking at that showstopper from Jamie Dornan), part rom-com, part spy flick, and a whole lot of satirical fun",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
10,drqshadow-reviews,"A Silly Original Concept That's Amusing, But Sorely Overstuffed",5,1 April 2021,"Laid off from their dream jobs as part-time layabout furniture salesmen, two chatty middle-aged Nebraska women splurge on a trip to gulf coast Florida. One last chance to take a risk and try something exciting before easing into their golden years. Groundlings alumni Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo (the duo behind 2011's Bridesmaids) are the titular gossips, all decked out in a series of outfits delivered direct from the 1996 Sears spring catalog, recklessly throwing caution to the wind and partying far past their bedtimes.There's something silly, yet entrancing, about watching that happen; a pair of picture-perfect squares suddenly empowered to let it all hang out, no matter how ridiculous they might look. Much of the well-targeted humor plays upon that theme, culminating in an unlikely romantic rivalry over a handsome-but-sensitive beau (Jamie Dornan). It's goofy and absurd, maybe a bit on the light side, but good for at least as many chuckles and snickers as a strong modern SNL skit. The screen gets too crowded in the later chapters, though, with a rush of competing sub-plots and bit roles elbowing in on the ladies' extravagance. Those might be good for a one-note laugh here and there, but they're also involved enough to demand some sort of future resolution, and dutifully punching those out during the climax is a chore that weighs down the whole ship.While the going is good, Barb and Star is loose fun with a few fleeting sharp points, but many of its bits are derivative (Wiig basically plays Dr. Evil in an unnecessary villainous turn) and the home stretch is a drag. Don't let it keep you awake, should you find yourself nodding off: all the best material is in the first hour.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
11,robfollower,Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar,8,14 July 2021,"Barb & Star is a quirky, heartfelt & hilarious comedy that virtually everyone can get a kick out of. Barb and Star Go To Vista Del Mar is the new comedy film starring Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumulo. Also penned by the duo, the film follows two middle-aged golden gal's Barb & Star as they finally leave their hometown for the first time ever to embark on an adventure of a lifetime in Vista Del Mar. While there, the two get themselves in over their heads as they find themselves entangled in a villainous plot to wipe out the city.The plot manages to make some sense despite being wildly absurd, but mostly you're watching because Barb and Star are just so darn charming. Mumolo and Wiig still got it going on. For starters, Barb & Star are two of the funniest characters in recent comedy I can remember . Their snicker-doodle baking personas are absolutely hilarious. Kristen & Annie crush it with their performance of the two leads. There's something so unique about the duo's chemistry & style that you simply can't help but applaud at how committed they are to these roles. Although Barb and Star are caricatures, they're made up of so many clever little details you won't fail to find something familiar about them. They're over the top but never annoying and never too much. Jamie Dornan as love interest Edgar, Dornan is loose and game to go for it; he's an untapped talent for comedy.The film also looks so damn beautiful. The cinematography is absolutely stunning thanks to its gorgeous color choices and setting. Everything feels vibrant, from the backdrops of Vista Del Mar all the way to the costumes, set pieces, and location.There's a lot of gags about moderately aged American ladies, despite the overwhelming wackiness on display, at no point does it ever feel mean-spirited. ""Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar""is like watching a cult film being born. Barb and Star Go To Vista Del Mar is un-apologetically and exuberantly silly, fully committed to the twin performances by hilarious comediennes Mumolo and Wiig, a very fun and extremely unique comedy ! 8/10.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

15,aidanratesmovies,Just turn your brain off and be ready for a good time,9,4 August 2021,"Hilarious and weird, Barb and Star can feel at times like a drawn out SNL sketch- but as odd as it is- it makes the most of its absurd premise and ends up feeling similar to many of the 90's comedies I grew up on (mainly Austin Powers and Wayne's World). This film is all over the place, if you were to describe what events happened in this film, people would probably wonder...no, definitely wonder what the h*** you are talking about. The film is written by the same team behind the comedy Bridesmaids which I wasn't too fond of- and was glad this film was a much different change of pace. Wiig and Mumolo, in addition to writing and producing, also star as the titular characters Barb and Star and are honestly bound to be iconic in some sort of cult comedy way. They not only go all out on their performances but are so incredibly quirky, that its proves to be quite hard to dislike this movie for any flaw it may have. The whole romance debacle between the main characters and Jamie Dornan feels quite a bit predictable and has its smaller frustrating moments- but thankfully Dornan is no generic male lead- and dedicates himself to the fullest extent in his performance- and quite honestly is able to watch the craziness of Mumolo and Wiig on screen. The plot is ridiculous, but the jokes are so incredibly well timed and goofy- it's something few comedies even dare of trying today and feels deeply nostalgic and inspired by comedy classics of the past- especially considering its SNL star alum. In the end, Barb and Star is a weird quirky comedy with messy moments, but it's anything but average and you'll be bound to laugh many times before the credits roll.My Rating: 8.4/10.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

More YoyoReview:You'll find me saying this much through the review, but the movie is definitely one meant to lift spirits and just be fun to watch. It accomplishes this goal very well and it starts with the music that fills this movie's various scenes and sequences. From the opening shot, the soundtrack is wonderfully full of the energy and diversity this movie is, from classic 80s tracks to remixes with the EDM, all the music kicks the energy up notches and helps brighten up what would be simple scenes. Barb and Star really have a lot of sequences that really belong on 90s television and though it's not masterpiece cinematography, it is successful in just being fun. Dancing night club scenes, adventures on the beach, and even the ""romantic"" moments all have the same positive roll that was rather enjoyable and never broke the theme of the movie. That theme is again being comedically ridiculous to the point of taking a bunch of shots and hoping some hit you to have you watch the movie again and again. Kristin Wiig and Annie Mumolo have a lot to do with this fun as I feel their writing flowed with their comedic background and brought with it a lot of variety that I think many will love ad probably is my favorite aspect of the movie. Barb and Star has a lot of randomness to it, but that randomness opens up for a variety of comedy styles that will certainly catch a laugh or two during the 2 hour run time. You want kids lip syncing to 80's power ballads? You got it! Dialogue and catchphrases worthy of memes and mimicry? Again you got it. Want Napoleon Dynamite vernacular and random antics occurring? They have it in here. Adult comedy flows like the water of Vista Del Mar and should be right up the alley for those who love just random silliness. Other things that I enjoyed included the references in the film, plenty of nods to other films, running gags, or famous cinematic comedies that makes a movie geek like me laugh more than the sexual antics that are constantly beaten in the film. In addition, despite all the ridiculousness of the movie, the film does have a little more character layering than I had anticipated, helping put a little more reason behind the comedy craziness.While the random theme is fun and makes much of the spirt of the movie though, it is also going to be a limitation for some looking for a little more structure to their comedy. Barb and Star's adventure has little guidance in terms of explaining the ridiculous nature of the movie, just going with the flow of let's be silly and have fun and who cares the means of why we are doing. That randomness gets a little too much for me, the interruptions in the fun for random tangents sounds much like a 5 year old telling a story. True they can be quite fun divergents, but often they took away from other things I was having fun with. In addition, the origin story of the main antagonist, these moments were a little too stupid for my liking, the random coincidental events of things happening, the banter with the girls sometimes going a bit too far that the joke got old in the 5 minutes spurts. And yet the biggest thing I would have loved was seeing the plot catered a bit more towards story and less toward comedic sprints that could have roped it all together. Like Bridesmaids, I've seen Wiig and her group balance story with comedy and I had wanted this movie (especially after the first scene) to really rope it that strongly together. It did not work as much for me, but the fun distracts you more from not handling a potential spy movie that again could have been very entertaining on both plot and comedy wise. Had they focused on that perhaps the organization could have further maximized the presentation for me and helped divert the stupidity a little more. And a personal preference for me is of course more of Yoyo, the little boy who wore lots of hats and yet could have done so much more if given time.The VERDICT:Despite my low expectations, Barb and Star were a fantastic voyage into the sunny paradise of fun to escape the blahs of 2020. The comedy is diverse and filled with a lot of angles to entertain a variety of pallets, which alongside the music, references, and timing makes for just an engaging piece of comedy. And if you are a fan of Kristen Wiig style comedy, you will really find that there is a lot of potential to have fun for these fans who I believe are the target audience. However, if you want a little more creativity, a little more plot and serious nature to bring the comedy together... you may not enjoy the tangential comedy that you will get with this movie. As such, if you need something to pick you up and make you laugh, give this one a try as it was one of the more entertaining films to cross my path. However, if you really hate quirky, over the top comedies and check out something else instead.My scores are:Comedy: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
19,rannynm,"Comedic genius with hilarious lines throughout while friendship, romance and spies take center stage",8,13 February 2021,"Barb And Star Go To Vista Del Mar is comedic genius! Hilarious lines are sprinkled throughout this film while friendships, romances and spies take center stage. Barb and Star really show how age is just a number.The storyline follows middle-aged best friends Barb (Annie Mumolo) and Star (Kristen Wiig) who visit Vista Del Mar. On their vacation, they encounter the charming undercover spy Edgar (Jamie Dornan). Edgar, unbeknownst to the women, works for a villain (Kristen Wiig) whose plan is to murder all of Vista Del Mar.This film shows how Kristen and Annie's comedy is at its peak. The motion picture parodies spy thrillers by exaggerated water spirits, deadly flies and turtle-filled lies. Even though the film pokes fun at action movies, there are serious topics discussed. Both friends are middle aged and believe their prime time has passed; they believe they are unable to have the adventures they've always dreamed of. Throughout the film, they overcome these doubts by falling in love, riding banana boats and fighting an evil super-villain. We also see the villain's backstory. She was born with a rare skin condition which made her vulnerable to bullying at a young age and it was difficult for her to make friends.The moral of the movie is that no matter how old you are, adventure is out there for you; you just have to go looking for it. Both Barb and Star were hesitant to leave their mid-western hometown, believing that their adventure time had expired. They take a chance and go to Florida. Barb sheds all her fears and rides dirt bikes and walks on burning stones. Star falls in love, even when she thought she would never have another opportunity.I give Barb and Star Go To Vista Del Mar 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 15 to 18, plus adults.

Gosh awful film.The Barb and Star characters were annoying, not funny, their Midwestern accents were grating -- and I know they were meant to be. I gave this film a one only for the piano player scene at the hotel and his song which had some chuckles.Sure, the production colors popped when they got to Florida so that was nice to watch for a few seconds, but even when the story started taking place there, Florida overall was made to look cheap and made me want to never go.And whatever that spy thing was with Kristen Wiig in a duel role was a waste, waste, waste. Jamie Dorian's Seagull song was gosh awful, not funny at all.

26,kjproulx,A Great Comedy That's Almost Too Weird To Enjoy,7,19 February 2021,"Regardless of how good or bad a film may be, sometimes you remember it for odd reasons. In this case, I absolutely see myself remembering the experience of watching Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar. It's not very often that I watch a film with too many tonal issues to count, but still walk away having enjoyed myself. In nearly every other case, I would've said a movie with this many inconsistencies would be a trainwreck, and even though this movie is far from being praised by me, it truly does have some hilarious moments. I don't think this film will find a very large audience or even be liked all that much by those who do, but here's why I think it may be worth a shot on a rainy day.After leaving their hometown for a much-needed vacation in Vista Del Mar, Barb (Annie Mumolo) and Star (Kristen Wiig) find themselves caught up in a plot that may be an endangerment to everyone on their trip. The plot is simple, an evil woman and her sidekick are plotting to flood Vista Del Mar with murderous mosquitos and then comedy ensues. That's honestly the set-up for this film so I didn't want to beat around the bush when diving into this review. During the first scene, you're clearly being asked to forget wherever you think this film might be about because it's more ridiculous than you think. For this reason alone, it at least held my attention.Creativity is definitely not in short supply here, but that's also an overall detriment. I'd be lying if I said that I didn't laugh quite a few times here, but I just as much found myself either cringing or wondering why certain choices were being made. There are times when the story is serious, times when it's silly, genuinely funny, and just downright random. Tonally, as I said, this film is all over the place. Yes, there is a throughline, but when a comedic beat is followed by a dramatic beat, only to then break out into a musical number, it just seems messy. There were multiple occasions where I just thought to myself that I was watching a very sloppily constructed film, which in hindsight just isn't true at all.Sure, the film is tonally all over the place, but I truly believe that was a creative choice. Jamie Dornan steals the show with a few sequences that had me laughing quite hysterically, Wiig and Mumolo are great as this duo, and I overall thought the look and feel of the movie were meant to remind you to not take it all so seriously. Nearly a full day has passed since viewing this film and I still don't exactly know what certain things were there to accomplish. When I say this film can be very random at times, I mean that. From talking crabs to leaping over canyons with a moped, it's been a while since I was able to watch a new film that was this weird.Overall, as I said, this film is tonally all over the place. It's about three different movies in one, wrapped up in a visually strange package. Written by both Wiig and Mumolo, it was clear that these two just wanted to have a blast making a fun movie and there absolutely succeeded with that. There are many memorable moments here, but it's just hard to recommend this film without making sure you're extremely aware of how random of an experience it will be.

She has potential to be hilarious but she takes things just one step too far in her comedy which ruins each bit she does. Anyhoo even though I don't like her I did find myself laughing out loud at this movie because of Mumolo's ""Barb"". I have relatives that look and act just like her and so it reminded me of them. The whole culottes thing and the way they liked the tackiest stuff and were so weird and quirky was funny. I liked the little Asian kid too. He was so cute. I do not know why Jamie Dornan was ever a thing. He was all wrong for the ""shades"" films...he looks like a little hobbit toady. He was woefully out of place in this. He even looked uncomfortable and embarrassed. I liked Andy Garcia's brief appearance and of course Morgan Freeman's crab was great. I can't believe it but I would recommend this just for the absurdity of it. If you have relatives like Barb and Star you can totally vouch for the fact that people like them actually do exist and they are very cute and endearing but also hilarious.

Kristen Wiig is so talented and plays two different characters in the movie. Her writing partner, Annie Mumolo, is an Academy Award-nominated screenwriter and Kristen's writing partner of the comedy hit Bridesmaids. While their writing includes a lot of crude humor I don't enjoy, I recognize the importance of being able to laugh at a lighthearted movie with a simple message.
There's a funny line about culottes, so I thought it was really cute that the movie opens with a written definition of what culottes are.

33,sweidman-28016,Hilarious and Fun,7,22 February 2021,"""Imagine that's you and me riding on that banana boat. Just bouncing around, with our arms and legs spread wide open, with water and air going all inside of us.""Lifelong friends Barb and Star embark on the adventure of a lifetime when they decide to leave their small Midwestern town for the first time - ever. Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar is another collaboration between Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo and it might be their must absurd one yet. To make this clear, the movie has no right to be as funny as it is. The whole thing is so incredibly stupid, and it knows it. It takes advantage of the dumb plot and puts all the comedy in it that it can. I was laughing the whole way through. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo are a great comedy duo. They give some truly hilarious performances that will make their characters memorable in the future. It's fun to watch what situation they will endure next and how they react. Since they're so positive throughout there's no negativity in the movie if that makes any sense. They had a job to give us a good laugh and it delivered. From what I heard, Jamie Dornan is incredibly happy to be apart of this project. He genuinely gives a good performance and shows that he'd be great in comedies (other than the Fifty Shades franchise). Also he's not a half bad singer. There are a couple musical numbers in there for good laughs and they fit perfectly. It enhances the silliness.There's a side story involving a villain's plans to get rid of everyone in Vista Del Mar. Like the rest of the movie it's not supposed to be taken seriously. But here I felt it was a little too much. Kristen Wiig plays this villain here and she's funny, but I didn't want that story. Had they found another way to increase the stakes, I would've been even more pleased. Everything in the movie is ""realistic"" except that one part and it takes away from the movie a little. It's funny at times but doesn't always land. People will either get the humor or think it's too stupid. I for one think Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar is hilarious and an enjoyable time. I'd suggest being open to anything before watching. My expectations were low, but it's much more fun than I thought. You can rent it for $19.99 now or wait till it comes out later for cheaper.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

I just don't know why they decided to go down this route. None of the surreal elements landed and they tainted the better parts of the film. They were far too ambitious with the story and the execution was just poor.Very disappointing.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

Director: Josh Greenbaum
Starring: Kristen Wiig, Annie Mumolo, Jamie Dornan, Damon Wayans Jr, Reyn Doi, Wendi McLendon Covey etcOverall rating 76/100Barb and Star go to Vista Del Mar is about two life long middle age friends Barb (Annie Mumolo) and Star (Kristen Wiig) who embark on an adventure of a lifetime and decide to leave their small midwestern town for the first time ever, they soon find themselves tangled up in adventure, love and a villains evil plot to kill everyone in the town. Barb and Star was strange and crazy and definitely flawed, but I couldn't help but love it, there was some really good stuff here.My first few positives would be the humour, strange tone, clever links with previous scenes, the performances and chemistry between the leads, and the fun scenes and numbers. This film was absolutely hilarious, the two leads were incredibly funny, the writing was clever and fresh. The jokes just worked and made me laugh on so many occasions, it was all just so cleverly set up and delivered perfectly by the two leads. I also loved the strange tone, the humour, script, visuals and performances were delightfully strange, often making the film feel like an odd fantasy dream, but it just worked. You just have to embrace the weirdness of the film because it worked really well and gave the movie a unique charm to it. I also loved the clever links with previous scenes. The film did a really clever job at linking certain props or one liners and cleverly using them either in the next scene or later on in the movie, it made the film stick out more, and it meant that a lot of thought and attention to detail was given to the film which I really appreciated. I thought the performances here were absolutely fantastic. Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo were absolutely fantastic. They were hilarious, their comedic timing was excellent, they both had so much charm and likeability to them, it was nice to see Kristen back doing what she does best. They both also had excellent comedic chemistry with each other, they just worked so well together and bounced off each other, their chemistry exploded on the screen and you could really tell the fun they had when filming. Finally, I also there was a lot of unique and fun scenes and numbers. This film was so creative and fun with so many of its scenes, I had never seen some scenes done like this in a comedy before where they incorporated the main characters personalities into the gag in the scene or the location. The fun musical numbers were also a great touch to the film as well.My next few positives would be the comedic writing, fun set up, uplifting themes. How self aware the movie was, as well as the hilarious contrast between the two main characters when they messed something up. I thought this movies comedic writing was just excellent, there was some unique jokes that had never been used before that were just so good, I also thought how the running gags and jokes were incorporated into each scene was just extremely clever and refreshing never once tiring which a lot of comedies these days unfortunately do. I also thought the set up was a lot of fun, having the film begin with Barb and star living their boring and mundane lives repeating each day was a really great way to start the film, this paved way for a really fun set up, having both characters want to try something different and get out in the real world set up so much development for both of the characters. I also thought the movie had a lot of well executed uplifting themes. The movie had great messages of never being too old to change your life for the better and to experience new things, I thought that is was a great message to convey and through the character development of both characters this was executed well. Finally, I also thought that there was a hilarious contrast between both main characters when they messed. They both had so many great parts to their personalities but what I found hilarious was how both Barb and Star how to wriggle themselves out of situations, Barb makes an excuse and lies and then Star says something that doesn't match Barb's explanation whatsoever, this was hilarious and just made both characters so loveable to watch.My first few negatives would be the oddly structured beginning with lack of introduction to the main characters. The slightly lazy conflict for the main characters, as well as the over the top tone with the villains and lack of connecting both stories. I personally found it fairly strange for the movie to start with the villains and not the main characters. It seemed oddly structured to me and gave a lack of context into the characters so it just felt out of place, so for me it would have been better if the film had started with Barb and Star. I also thought that their was some slightly lazily written conflict for both main characters, them both being fired from their job and the conflict that came from that just felt very forced and brushed over and they could of done more, it just felt lazily written so the characters had something to do for the next scene instead of having meaning and depth to it. I also thought that the movie had an over the top and conflicting tone with the villains, they just felt slightly too out of place to the whole movie, and were slightly too campy and over the top for me, I wasn't a fan of any scenes with the villains in if I am being honest, one thing I also thought was badly written was the lack of connecting both stories, we didn't know anything about the villain or her connections to Vista Del Mar or the main characters until half way through, it made it feel almost like two separate movies. It was also a big missed opportunity to not have some form of connection with the villain and Barb and Star, them being friends with her when they were little would have been really interesting and added more depth and relevance to the villain.My next few positives would be the character development, contrast between both characters, the development to the plot as well as the connection between different characters. I absolutely loved the contrast between both main characters and the character development that it gave them. Barb went on the trip to let go and try and new things, and to no longer be afraid, and Star went on the trip to love herself and view herself in a more positive way. Splitting both characters for a good chunk of the movie really helped with this. It distinguished both of their different personalities more, it gave them both room to grow as people and to strengthen their friendship, and the character development to the both of them was excellent because of this. I also loved the development of the plot and how it was structured, it all just flowed so seamlessly and smoothly, the movie gave an equal amount of time developing both characters, I also particularly loved the scenes that were repeated but with Barb instead of Star to show the contrast between the characters. Finally I also loved the connection and chemistry between Kristen Wiig and Jamie Dornan. Both characters had similar issues with love and not feeling loved, so their connection and development with that made sense was effectively done.My final few negatives would be the odd casting, slightly lazy conflict for the villains and the generic villain. I personally thought that Jamie Dornan was miscast. He tried his hardest but for me, his kind of acting doesn't fit comedy, he looked really awkward and out of place for most of the movie. I also thought that the conflict for with the villain and Jamie Dornans character was slightly lazily written, having an agent come in to keep an eye on things just because Jamie's character was hanging out with Barb and Star was a bit lazy for me, I found it hard to care due to the lack of chemistry with their relationship and how nasty she was to him. The villain in general was just very generic, her motivations were very typecast and we had seen it all before, and her just wanting friends was slightly underwhelming as a way of making her good or defeating her.My final few positives would be the fun final act, heartwarming moments and a satisfying ending with good character arcs. I thought the final act was great, when Barb and Star finally reunited and had grown as characters it made their reunion that much great, the final act was fun, hilarious and entertaining and the movie went all out crazy which I loved. I also thought that there was a lot of heartwarming moments that really worked, the connection of the main characters and the way they opened up to each other saying how much they had learned about themselves was very charming to watch. It all ended in a very satisfying way with great character arcs and a feel good final number that just made you smile.Overall, a bad villain that didn't connect, some odd casting and occasionally lazy writing stopped Barb and Star from reaching its full potential. But I still loved it. The film was charming, hilarious and uplifting. With Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo doing brilliant jobs. I still had a great time with it and its messages were very uplifting. As the main characters needed to have time apart to grow as people and to make their friendship stronger, some really great work here.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

37,pkpera,Miracleholic,4,16 February 2021,"It started with some Asian paperboy doing his job weirdly, I guess intended to be funny - partially was it. Scene where 2 main charactresses refused to sale on their workspace was good announce of what will coming: sub childish humor with 2 middle aged women. Plot was everything but not original, with plenty of miracles, actually much more of them than in some longer medieval fairy tale, especially at end. I guess, that worked for most of viewers, considering rating and reviews here.
Yes, we need humor, some fantasy in this restriction days, but what about involving a little intelligence in it ?I can to wig writers, and one of them is Kristen Wiig herself for this mess of script.
Too bad, because location is really beautiful, and was shot very colorful. Actually direction and camera work were good. Acting not, and that little bird like chirping of 2 main heroines was often annoying.They managed to get even Andy Garcia for some cameo here (uncredited), not sure that he will be proud of it.Only one thing missed at the end - announcing what comes when they return home.

The inclusion of an over the top action sub-plot was as unexpected as it was unnecessary for a movie that probably should have kept focused on the character acting talents of Wiig and Mumolo.

42,lotekguy-1,Disappointing attempt at a coming-of-middle-age comedy,4,12 February 2021,"As any SNL fan knows from the range of her sketches, when Kristen Wiig is on her game, she can be hilarious; other characters of hers can be pointlessly or excessively annoying. In this outing, she and co-star Annie Mumolo play the eponymous gal pals who seem destined to splurge on a big vacation. They lost their jobs and were ousted from their suburban social circle (a nicely satiric group of tea-sipping Karens' Talk Club) on the same day another friend gushes over her recent vacation to the titular Florida destination. And they're off.Unfortunately, their trip coincides with an over-the-top supervillain's elaborate revenge plot against that resort town. She is sort of a distaff Dr. Evil, whose pasty complexion makes Tilda Swinton look like a sun-baked beach bunny. That's not pale-shaming; it's key to the plot. Such as it is.Remember Romy and Michele's High School Reunion from 1997? Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino were a delight as ditzy innocents with a lifelong bond that synced their minds on a wavelength beyond most peoples' comprehension. This one plays as if those characters are back 20+ years later, having been drained of all their charm. Barb and Star work and live together, chatting incessantly over mostly meaningless minutia that has kept them on their own island of reality. Their characters grow tiresome long before they grow in their story arcs. The result is a tedious experience, relieved somewhat by a smattering of truly funny moments. Among those are a few clever songs (one going almost full Bollywood) and surprising, mostly uncredited, cameos from stars who must have assumed the final script would turn out much better than the working version they were sent.Barb and Star is mediocre fluff. Even so, for those who watch, here's a bonus tip. During one character's semi-romantic song on the beach, watch the shadows on the sand to see how many different times of day were involved in the filming of one sequence. It's something for the unengaged to do.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

45,Golden_Hope,Insane fun,7,20 February 2021,"This movie is complete non sense and I loved it so much.It can be hard to find a place when making a comedy that is absurd but isn't just like stupid if that makes sense but this movie finds it.At first I wasn't won over by one of the main plots and didn't understand why it was there, I thought the movie should have just been about the main characters trip but it proved me wrong and tied it all together perfectly.The jokes are a mile a minute and yeah sometimes they are duds but it doesn't matter because there will be another one any minute that won't be and will really land.I also think that even though this movie is completely illogical I think it really got it's characters. They were fleshed out and that's what made them funny. You knew them after watching it, they didn't just say stupid lines for the sake of it, you felt like that was actually what them characters were like.I also loved its colours they were just so sweet and candy like.

This film is the latter.I love the old Austin Powers films, at least 1+2, so I get this style of film, but where those films attempted to set up their jokes, this one does not, with lazy sight gags and zero attempts to build scenes.Seriously, this is what Kristen Wiig is up to? Lazy phoning-it-in writing, this has nothing of the wit of films like Bridesmaids.The fact that this film is rated even as highly as it is proves to me that modern comedy is dead, and it's a bad thing that the entertainment industry has become a collective of Yes-men and women who spend so much time patting each other on the back, that they never stop to think what they've made actually sucks.Oh, and if you say ""it's good if you're high"", then it's not good.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

49,RMurray847,Terrifically silly...but also just not that great.,5,15 March 2021,"Since the start of the pandemic, there really haven't been too many straight up comedies. Lots of horror, plenty of indie movies (including some with a ""comedic"" tough) and loads of dramas. But good, fun, ""Friday night date night"" comedies? Not so much. So along comes BARB AND STAR..., and clearly this movie is not aiming for awards-show glory. Watch the trailer...if what you see amuses you, watch the film. It makes a delightful, bubbly, utterly silly diversion. I DEEPLY appreciate the film for giving me a 100 minute diversion that required me to make no intellectual investment and had two stars that clearly were quite invested in their work. It's a delight to look at, and I felt darn good after watching it. 4.5 stars!!!BUT, now, two days later, I have to be honest. I was so starved to see a silly comedy, I completely overlooked the fact that much of this movie is a mess. 2.5 stars in a non-COVID world. So let's call it 3.5.I know, I know...I'm a total party pooper and is it fair to rate the film this way? I've rated all other films I've ever reviewed based on how they struck me when watching. Is it right that I give this one a big asterisk for cheering me up during a dark time? I don't know...but I have to say that the disconnect between my experience watching it and my experience thinking about it later makes me think that I DO need to review based on a bit of reflection.So, it tells the story of Barb & Star, who live (if memory serves) somewhere in Nebraska, and have roomed together for years, ever since divorces/widowhood. (Their ""hometown"" scenes were actually filmed in Socorro, NM...which is about 75 minutes down the road from me.) They never desire to move much outside their safe little community, and working at their furniture store. They are frivolous characters, and they are totally fine with that. A shakeup happens in their lives though, and they take the advice of a friend and spring for a vacation in Vista del Mar, Florida, at a painfully brightly colored resort, just to try something new and have a good time. Day One, they meet a handsome, younger Irish man at the bar (Jamie Dornan) who is having a bad day, already drunk, and the 3 have quite a night together. One that most people might have some regrets about the next day. But their relationships blossom from there, in fun but silly ways.But in the midst of this frivolity is a plot to kill the citizens of Vista del Mar by a super-villain who lives in a lair! (Her primary henchman is Jamie Dornan!) So the two plots converge in ways that take this film from silly to absolutely ridiculous, but not always in a good way.I was totally fine with the silliness (even though Dornan, game as he is, just never quite seems to capture the tone. His solo song was a highlight of the film, but the rest of the time, I was wishing for a more comedically adept actor). The bright colors. The silly dialogue. The visual jokes. All fine. But then the idea of taking this frothy film, and forcing a ""spy plot"" onto it only ends up being funny on paper. The actual viewing of the last 15 minutes or so of the film is really deeply unfunny, and ham-fisted and just not interesting. I think they could have taken the basic characters of Barb and Star and put them into a silly film that DIDN'T go off the rails, and would have achieved something really memorable.Anyway, if you, like me, are craving a film that is set in a world not at all like our own (in the silliest possible way), you should enjoy this film. If you want a ""smart"" movie...please look elsewhere! Thank you, BARB AND STAR, for cheering me up for an evening. It was kinda like eating a whole box of chocolates, though...I felt some regret the next day.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
50,jeromesgabilo,RIDICULOUSLY FUNNY,5,5 October 2021,"It has the usual cliché plot for an action comedy film, but no matter how mediocre the production is it was still funny enough. The script was great, but the musical scenes were a bit corny for me.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
51,stephenstephenbyrne,A Ray of Sunshine,7,14 March 2021,"This is kind of a silly movie. I can totally understand if this style of humour doesn't work or even irritates some people but I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a lowkey smile on my face for most of it. Like the characters of the movie itself, its good nature just kind of rubs off on you",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
52,rhmacl,Chuckle Fest,7,20 February 2021,"B&S go 2 VDM is a fun flick for unexpected reasons-who'd have thunk that Jamie Dornan was such a wit!? The Wiig/Mumolo team create lovable characters with all the anxieties, histories, pain, and qualities necessary to convey the self-deprecating laughs anyone would expect from Wiig. Mumolo is not as well known but who can forget her turn as the hyper-anxious passenger in Bridesmaids who conveys to her there-to-fore unknown seatmate, Wiig, that she dreamt the night before that the plane ""...went down,"" and Wiig, by the way, was in it? And perhaps this is when the elephant in the room needs to be addressed; this film is not as funny as Bridesmaids, a contemporary comedic classic (which continues to bring joy each re-run), but it nonetheless has some chops. Wiig seems a little bit more 'polished,' and the comedic quality is correspondingly less so. But there are some very funny turns, though the funniest are with Dornan. Despite the quibbles, the writing IS outstanding; the dialogue is genius and rapid fire-I often found myself laughing at something but suppressing it because I did not want to miss the next lines... Wiig and Mumolo make a great team when it comes to the process of creating internalized comedic pressure, the kind of chuckles you can't contain, but don't overwhelm, even though I know full well I will watch the film again because I know I missed some fun while having so much fun.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
53,benjamin-ensor,It's coming out of me like lava....,1,13 February 2021,"Awful. Really really just... awful.

54,WankerReviews,not very funny,2,14 February 2021,"This movie isn't terrible but it's not funny either. It had good intentions but I only laughed once. It's competently made. It has a beginning middle and end. The villain has a motive, and it's well structured, but that's where the positives end. It reminded me of Austin Powers, very zany and colorful and not to be taken seriously, but without likeable characters or interesting story. Not that I hate any of the characters, but none of them drew me in, except for Damon Wayans Jr, he was the only reason I got one laugh out of this. Kristen Wiig is not funny, and only liked her in Bridesmaids. How does she have a career?",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
55,Tina_jeppesen,I love Kristen Wiig,3,8 April 2021,"So that said I'm disappointed:( when I saw she was a writer I couldn't wait to see it, because she seemed
to make any sketch funnier on SNL & I loved Skeleton Twins, Bridesmaids, Walk Hard, & most anything she's in I thought she made it better.

56,Wikkid_Gamez,One of the most rediculous movies I have seen lately...,8,6 June 2021,"... and I absolutely LOVED it! I couldn't stop laughing! It was just what is needed with everything going on. Its fun, colorful, cheery and completely rediculous (in a good way). One of those movies you can watch again and again, good background while going things around the house. The music numbers are really well done and funny, the acting was great. It's like a toss up of those cheesy movies like Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion crossed with the even more rediculous ones like Airplane with a touch of Austin Powers type bad guys and a little bit of musical thrown in. Definitely worth a watch if you enjoy stuff like that.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

It won't play to anyone who is after a whip-smart intellectual comedy and some parts are a little trying (the cuts to the talking club - ugh - I find Vanessa Bayer annoying...) but for the most part it is loopy kooky colorful ride.Jamie Dornan's musical numbers are made all the more hilarious if you mainly know him as the killer from 'The Fall,' as I do. So unexpected.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

If you happen to appreciate them, most probably you will like this movie. The actors are in character, the clothes are a joy for the eyes. All body shapes are flattered, just like with rich people custom made clothing. The plot is hilarious and I guess it never meant to be taken seriously, so no extra words about that. Just enjoy the landscapes, the views, the colors and the coreography. And the heartily undertones, as drama is scarcely seen in this one. At first, I almost disconnected at the lengthy dance involving the main actor (the guy from Shades of Grey), but then I realised I had to retune the way I was watching this movie. I then got to enjoy this movie.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
60,actaction,"Often funny, but plot needlessly goofy",5,4 June 2021,"Hard to rate this one... I'm not necessarily against this type of Austin Powers goofball humor, talking crabs and flying culottes, but because the characters of Barb and Star are so strong and fun it often seems tacked on and distracting. I was down for a spy plot, a little bit of sun soaked musical fun... but it's also littered with an epicness that all comedies seem to want to bring it to nowadays to make the journey worth it. Sometimes it's okay just to let the comedy play out, no need to go to every ridiculous end. It's plenty fun, colorful, full without the Dr Evil type villain and killer mosquitos. Damon Wayons Jr is a good example for how to be both goofy and grounded in a character, nearly every scene with him is just as strong as the special effect heavy villain in the evil lair. I just wish somebody had pulled it back & brought it back on the rails. We need more great high concept comedies, but not more Spy Kids.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

Colourful and beautifully shot, with the leads hamming it up good and proper, in fact a little too good. Add a secret spy, and a not so secret one, a very silly plot, lots of pretend sex, silly songs and you get this very silly far fetched, and to be honest, boring film. Usual cliches are all played out and for me I struggled to stay interested.

It was just annoying.The storyline itself was absurd and very weak. It looked like it was written by a child or someone under influence. This movie was all over the place, even strange.
It opens with an over the top villain in her secret lair with a plan, so don't expect a movie about two women in their 40's living out their midlife crisis in a vacation town.This movie was just absurd but not in a good way.

What did I just watch, please someone tell me what I just watched Phyllis from The Office goes to talking club with Barb and Star. Morgan Freeman crab is the best character. Barb and Star get very drunk and then Cheeseburgers in Paradise starts playing and then they go to like a rave party. It was the best scene because the scene is so random that it is hilariously bad. How did they go from Bridesmaids to this. The stuff with the villain is very bad, very boring and very confusing. Deadly mosquitos stinging people and killing them was so random. Why is this a musical? The music was so bad. The comedy doesn't land.

72,devojonesy1977,Just lazy.,3,13 February 2021,"To be honest, it's not the WORST film I've seen so far this year. It just really seems like since this covid outbreak, really great writers aren't even TRYING anymore. Wiig and Mumolo, who are great comedic writers, weren't giving THIS film the same attention or creativity that they had with the much superior ""Bridesmaids"". Sure it's unfair to compare the two, but it's hard not to. ""Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar"" just seemed all over the place. It never really came together as a wholesome hilarious film where you fell in love with the characters. It began to feel more like an ""inside joke"" between Wiig and Mumolo and the audience were left out. It also seemed to care more about the location than the development of the characters. And the plot was like something that these two women couldn't agree on, so it became this hodgepodge of sight gags and very little humor. I know we've all been shut in and feel uninspired during these times.

112,wfairfan,Insufferable characters and little comedy,2,7 April 2021,"I begin with this statement: I love, love, love the comedic talent of Kristen Wiig. She can usually bring laughs with just a simple expression. She, imo, may be the funniest of all female SNL alum. But this movie is so far beneath her capabilities, it is stunning. Wiig's most successful film, Bridesmaids, was a comedy with a touch of drama, and showcased her co-writing and considerable dramedy skills. This* twaddle is as far from that film as is possible. The Barb and Star duo are, well, obnoxious. It's possible to portray 40-something, single, middle class, far from worldly friends without the incessant witless observations and nonstop chitchat going on between the titular characters. This film fails at every level, including the 'supervillain secret plan' trope (upon which the two predictably stumble). Cannot wait to see Wiig's next* work, even so. I guess she's entitled to an occasional bomb. Her Bridesmaids costar, the talented Melissa McCarthy has had a string of them and scores a hit now again.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

This movie is filled to the brim with personality, it is completely random and out there, but Barb and Star are the best, and I also love every single scene with Edgar, so good to see Jamie Dornan in an adorable and funny role like this! I especially loved their party scene where they dance to My Heart Will Go On, I have rewinded that scene more times than I should have, hahaha",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
114,milksa,Not good.. but could've been!,3,5 August 2021,"I love Kristen Wiig.. and there were certainly moments I laughed. The Trish scene was really funny. But not enough good stuff to make this a tolerable movie. The stupid songs, talking animals and ridiculous Austin Powers-like villain made it just over the top stupid. And I'm actually embarrassed for Jamie Dornan. Had to be a $$ grab for him. It's a shame because the Barb and Star characters as a whole are hilarious! The movie plot was just horrid.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
115,bcirilli,Watched it twice in 4 days,8,11 October 2021,I'll be honest. I wanted to watch it because it looked silly and light. I had a friend over and showed her the trailer & she wanted to put it on. I didn't expect it to be so funny. I love that everyone is incredibly silly and having fun with it. I had another friend over & showed her the trailer. We put it on straight away. I legitimately laughed at the jokes again or in different parts. This is a fun feel good movie. It is not serious & not meant to be. This is the type of film that you put on when you just want to feel good and watch actors who looked like they genuinely were having fun while filming. Thank you to everyone for making me laugh and I'll be watching it again (along with recommending it to my friends.) Don't watch it if you can't suspend belief. It's fun & funny.,Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

Yes it was stupid but not crude as this type of movie tends to be. Jamie Dornan was terrific and really great looking in it, particularly his eyes. He has come so far from the Christian Grey role. I look forward to all his roles now, beginning with The Fall and his other serious roles. Kristen was good as well. I just watched The Martian where she provides a bit of humor in her role. Jamie's singing is good as well.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

126,LennardTeo,Best Friends Forever = Kristen Wiig & Annie Mumolo,10,29 April 2021,"I think the movie, Bridesmaids (2011), made Kristen Wiig (Star) & Annie Mumolo (Barb) famous for their co-writing, because they were nominated for an Oscar.This movie, B&S for short, again co-written by them, features them as 2 BFF's (Best Friends Forever), and their misguided adventures to rediscover themselves. While I enjoyed B&S very much for its honesty and humour in both imaginary and real life situations, I could not help but feel both Kristen Wiig & Annie Mumolo going a bit 'Adam Sandler' for me.Adam Sandler, another SNL Alumni, had tirelessly crafted out his successful movie career, essentially telling almost the same story, using different characters, and their colourful backgrounds.However, I believe Kristen Wiig & Annie Mumolo can actually breakout of the comedy black hole, where most funny movies in the last 20 years end up. They could try writing and directing Drama, Crime, or Mystery, something to show how amazingly talented this Power Duo can be.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
127,AmericasFan,Austin Powers,7,4 May 2021,Best way to describe this humor and how ridiculous it is would be to think Austin Powers. You need to understand the base of the humor and then you will enjoy it. Kristin Wig actual plays the good character and bad character like Mike Myers did in AP.

The comedy ranged from the slightly surreal (the women's ""talking club"") to the saucy (without being blatantly coarse) and taking in sight gags. The two leads were excellent both individually and as a team. I can't recall when I (or an audience) last laughed out loud so much.

Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo's characters were so endearing in spite of their absurdity. I seriously enjoyed being on their vacation adventure. The whole cast of characters were great. Jaimie Dornan... so funny.Oh- and that trailer is the best kind; one that gives you an impression, but doesn't give anything away. You'll soon realize there's so much more to this movie.

146,chrisk0,Silly doesn't mean funny,1,16 February 2021,We have the girls gabble on about an imaginary friend they'd like to have named Trish. They describe her at length. This was meant to be hilarious. A lounge singer has a song about liking boobies. Is the word itself supposed to make it comedy gold? Wiig and Mumolo thought so I guess. Is the extended gabbling about anything that popped into their heads supposed to be funny because it's done with a nebraska accent? Again they seemed to think so. A tedious movie. Jamie Dornan pretends to be a comedic actor while having no business being a comedic actor. The whole thing was forgettable after about an hour.,Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

Possibly good for young children who have not yet developed a sense of humor but are easily entranced by shiny things. Kristen Wiig's signature brand of quirky humor is fine for an SNL sketch (or the first 20 or so minutes here) but quickly begins to grate and drone and feel entirely one-note.

170,johnnynokeys,Takes the crown for WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!,1,12 May 2021,"I watch a lot of movies... movies are a passion of mine. I was blown away by the degree of how HORRENDOUS this movie was. I made it to the 23-minute mark (the long, unfunny, beaten to death ""Trish"" talk on the plane scene) and my girlfriend and I gave each other a cringing look and had to shut it off. I returned to it the next day because I was curious as to the extent of how bad this movie was going to get.No exaggeration this movie had the most annoying characters with not a single thing that was funny about it. The plot was awful, the writing atrocious. It's just a bunch of random crap thrown together that doesn't make any sense or go anywhere. It was extremely PAINFUL TO WATCH. Their accents in the film were definitely not Nebraskan... they were like some sort of bad Norse-Canadian Minnesota accents or something in between. The male lead in the film sometimes had a Scottish accent, sometimes not. It floated in and out. The Austin Powers rip-off characters were just contrived and unnecessary. They try to rip off The Lonely Island with a random music video/song style scene just thrown in there. Parts where they incoherently babel at the same time was too frequent and grating on the ears. ALL the attempted jokes missed the mark and were so bad and unfunny that I feel a 3rd grader would've written a funnier script and screenplay. I found myself cringing all too often during this film. The ending was so stupid and contrived and unoriginal. The part with Damon Wayons Jr and his whole character was pointless and unnecessary. The list can go on and on...I liked Kristen Wiig in Bridesmaids and some of her small bit roles in movies before that, but her and her co-star should never be allowed to write anymore films or in the very least should be banned from public release for everyone's safety and well-being. This film is the true meaning of UNWATCHABLE, seriously... there should be the picture of this film poster next to that word in the dictionary. This movie has now become the definition of unwatchable to me.The positive reviews have to be people that are paid or bots. I can't believe it still has a 6.5 and ""The Animal"" has a 4.8. The Animal is bad but I at least made it through it without too much pain or regret. This truly is THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN. Never thought it would be a Kristin Wiig movie.And the people comparing this to such films as Austin Powers and Airplane and Naked Gun should be tested for severe drug use... this poor excuse for a film is not in the slightest like those films and certainly no where near the same level.

The writing has layers of humor that can appeal to almost anyone, if they're willing to accept some of the absurdism. Just accept it. Just go with it because this truly insane film hits so many notes of comedy accented by vivid sets and fun cut aways (packing their suitcases). And hats off to Jamie Dornan. He truly trusted his director and writers/costars because you have to admit, that character on paper would've been indiscernible. And yet he ends up charming at the end, in a caricature way, but still sympathetic. Wiig's dual performance is the cherry on top of all around incredible character moments-and lovely to see Phyllis and Vanessa.

Thought it'd be a fine silly way to enjoy an evening but instead just left me bored and unamused. No idea how something so colourful in style can be so dull and lifeless in content.On the plus side did feature Richard Cheese and everyone looked like they had fun making it. Doesn't do the viewer much good mind. Best avoided.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
177,greatgoogilymoo,0 stars,1,10 July 2021,"Completely unfunny. Could tell within the first couple minutes it was going to be trash. Most of the jokes are like they are playing to 7 year olds. Everything about this movie sucks, the musical numbers are bonkers and just stupid. The entire movie plays like a fever dream Wiig wrote down then pitched to a bunch of suckers who were more than happy to greenlight it because it was from her. This shouldve ideally never been produced or seen by anyone, at minimum shouldve been a straight to home video/streaming release. Absolute cringe.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
178,s-86854,I just love it.,8,14 February 2021,"Well, there is no doubt that this is a silly movie, simple plot, weird characters and bizarre musical numbers etc. but I dig it, I dig it 100%. It's just what I need in this time. If you are like me, just crave for a laugh and don't want to put too much thought on a movie, then you gotta check this out. Kristen and Annie is gold.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
179,ross-williams-84969,Very annoying,3,19 February 2021,I enjoy silliness & embrace it normally but this movie was quite terrible ...Annoying for the majority of the watch which is a shame as I feel it has potential!!!Embarrassed to have selected this for Friday night viewing with my partner.,Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
180,HereForTheReviews,Not Bridesmaids and not even close,3,9 April 2021,"I wanted to like this movie, but it's just not that good. The plot is senseless. It seems as if the two leads were sitting around drinking and decided to make a movie, and it went downhill from there. Special mention goes to Kristen Wiig's hair: it is so bad it's a character all its own. It LOOKS like a wig, ha-ha, but that was probably the intention. Anyway, we rented this for $2 and were sorry we wasted our time. Try again, Kristen.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
181,jason-32279,Worst Movie Ever! Save Yourself and Do Not Watch It,1,2 May 2021,"This movie is beyond awful. It is an insult to my intelligence, beyond moronic, and incredibly stupid.

182,iomnieres,Ridiculous and Official,8,6 May 2021,"Good stuff, full of ridiculousness and scenes you weren't expecting. At one point I though it was musical, but it's not and exactly that thought made me laugh so much. Barb and Star talk about all themes a lot and it doesn't get boring for 1 sec. Absolutely recommending it for a casual and fun watch, but watch it with understand - it's got a lot of dormant modern jokes. Like Morgan Freeman giving his voice to a crab and ofc it sounds like he's a superior omni-being.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
183,kjhall-73561,Only watch if you like to laugh,8,17 April 2021,I love to laugh and I have been looking forward to this one since I saw the previews. The movie delivered some really funny moments and the premise is ridiculous. I love it!,Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

187,victoriumist,Baffling waste of resources,2,9 April 2021,"I have nothing against general silliness, absurd and lack of logic in movies. I can easily embrace more than what this movie had. But one would expect this silliness to serve as a foundation for all sorts of jokes, gags and shenanigans. When you strip your script off a meaningful plot it's usually to make space for this sort of stuff, just like we see in every episode of ""Family Guy"" - the plot is there just because there has to be one for the sense of completion, but what we really are in for are the gags between.That's why this movie is so baffling - the plot is stripped down to an absolute skeleton that is too cliche to be even considered a proper parody (cartoon villain and friendship crisis caused by a lie - a true definition of lazy writing) but the jokes aren't even there. Some could argue that the humour is in the characters, but as a long time admirer of Kristen Wiig SNL characters I can only see a faintest shadow of her mediocre ones here, even though she had a chance to play two of them in the movie. It really looks like the script got less love and attention here than literally any 5 minute sketch on SNL. Maybe they believed Wiig's comedic genius will carry the whole movie. Sadly it didn't work. The only time I was close to a giggle was during the Vanessa Bayer parts. That's it. Inexcusable lazy writing and wasted potential.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
188,zquaratella,"Was it just me, or did this film make no sense?",3,11 September 2021,"A lot of the reviewers are saying that they loved this movie, but I had a really hard time following any of what was happening. I found the jokes predictable, the writing contained excessive periods of moralizing, and the green screen work was distractingly bad. Like so bad that every exterior shot has halos around the characters. I felt like I was watching the weather channel.There are some small moments that had laughs, but I guess I never have met anyone like these two characters, so maybe I'm missing the jokes.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

Highly disappointed in this movie, such a waste of talent.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

Just pure, utter joy and kindness! If you don't like silly and fun then not for you, BUT if you love silly, happy, weird and random, then you can't not love this! Every moment of this film is made with so much love and kindness and there isn't a single moment where you don't fell this. This film makes you a better person! Every time I've watched this, it seriously makes me high with happiness and love. I watch it very week and it makes any bad things go away. Gosh darn it, I just love this film so much :) Infinite stars/10 <3.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
193,roxylady_1977,This is the kind of funny ridiculousness I need more of in my life!!!,10,7 August 2021,"My husband and I sat there cackling at thus movie! It is so funny, and stupid and hilarious. I have already watched it 4x and have told all of my friends and clients to watch it. Jamie Dornan is just adorable and soooo funny! Kristin Wiig and Annie M. Are just too frickin' funny! I love this movie so much and will watch it a lot!",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
194,rugolin,Another bad comedy from people who should be funny,1,2 May 2021,I was kind of gobsmacked at how unfunny this film was right from the opening scene and just got worse and worse. I have a 6 laugh test for films where if it manages to make me laugh at least that many times I would say it is a good comedy. The score I give here is zero laughs for nearly two hours. Kristen Wiig and. Annie Mumolo banter back and forth like 12 year olds who never grew up and is somehow even more grating than Will Ferrell(who unsurprisingly is a producer) and John C Reilly in Step Brothers. It was literal torture to listen to them. They say drama is hard to write but comedy is even harder and it shows that Wiig and Mumolo need to switch to drama for all our sakes.,Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
195,stephencwrenmil,WHY?,1,1 May 2021,Why would anybody produce this film. Is it a musical or a satire of Midwest women. I am not easily offended but this movie provoked me. Rarely if ever do I stop watching a film but could not take any longer.

A couple of the visual gags are good, but even for a spoof, this is poor. Comparisons with Bridesmaids and Austin Powers are way off - this is nowhere near the same league. I paid £12 to watch it, which is money I will never get back. So save your cash and if you are intrigued, watch it when it is free...",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

199,babilichpavel,The cutest movie of the year!,10,12 February 2021,"Today I watched this film and was very delighted. It is a comedy, a romantic film, a musical, an action movie, and a fantasy film. That's all you need on a cold winter evening. This is a very warm, kind, funny and incredibly colorful film. Wiig and Mamolo are annealing to the fullest! There are also some incredibly bizarre moments in the film (crazy talking crab !!!) that the two women didn't know how to guess. It could be a good candidate for this year's Golden Globes, especially due to Wiig's double performance, if it came out a little earlier or a little later. It is the best comedy released this year so far.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

It was just stupid and seemed like a sketch that over ran air time.The ridiculous storyline trying to incorporate nearly every genre of film - spy movie, comedy, spoof and romance - didn't work.It was painfully unfunny, cringeworthy and vacuous. Even the always-funny Kristen Wiig didn't work. What happened to her?Give it a miss. Watch Bridesmaids again because this film is no where near as funny or clever. What a disappointment.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
201,uxrmnydk,Funny Funny Funny,10,12 February 2021,It's almost like a new Austin Powers but with two ladies instead. Funny as hell which is brilliant. Right up my street and a right good laugh to cheer you up during these hard times.,Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
202,dmkay-63552,Don't bother watching,1,27 March 2021,"We were really looking forward to watching this based on previews, but honestly, after 17 minutes, we turned it off. It sucked big- time. It wasn't silly, it was stupid. The acting was awful, and the 2 of them babbling on was irritating. If you loved Bridesmaids, don't expect this to live up to it.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
203,kymess,Whole-heartedly funny!,10,13 February 2021,"When the Friday night pandemic doldrums need a solution, this crazy weird little movie from the hidden recesses of the minds of Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo - the gals who brought you Bridesmaids! - might just be it. Daughter found this title and thought it would be bad enough to while away 90 minutes while scrolling Reddit.
Well, the devices were soon put aside so we could concentrate on the screwball-comedy paced dialogue. You can get plot synopsis from other reviews, and spoilers if you're so inclined, but what I want to know is if something is watchable......or even re-watchable, and this movie is, in that road-accident-you-can't-take-your-eyes-off way - but so so so much better, and way more fun. This WAS a genuinely funny movie!
Yes, the plot that moved the story along was a basic formula to get from A-to-B, but the in-between stuff is where you didn't quite know if it would zig or zag. It often zigzaggled. Yes, I made that up, and I think Star & Barb would have totally agreed with my description. Some reviews mention there's some crude humour, but like beauty, that can be pretty subjective. We thought most of the crude stuff played more like satire, with a little Michael Boobie, crooning for the middle-aged set. If you see this movie you'll get it. A couple scenes in the beginning did feel a little like extended SNL-sketches, but with one of the best alumni of that show behind the script I can give them a pass. There are a lot of very funny lines, and we often had to pause just so we could catch our breath and calm down from laughing. Ok, maybe I was just super-tired, but I know already I will not ever forget some scenes, they will always make me chuckle. If Barb & Star ever go on another vacation, or just make another movie-adventure together, I definitely want to come along for the ride!",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

Those reviews were written by people who if they came across Santa Claus in their life, they would spit on him.A movie that is filled completely with absurdist humor.

208,emilydworkin73,Didn't need the B (A?) Plot,6,1 March 2021,"I was so excited for this movie. I love Kristen Wiig, and so this buddy vacation movie seemed like the perfect thing to help cure my sadness from not being able to vacation this past year.However, the plot with the villain wanting to blow up the town was just stupid. I get you need some antagonist to make a story, but it ruined the vibes of the movie and made it at times seem like 2 different movies. Frankly it made it seem like Barb and Star weren't the real stars of the show! It really detracted from what the movie could've been. This was like if ""Bridesmaids"" had had a random super villain in it- it wouldn't have worked. The magic of it was in the internal conflict. I think if this villain plot was scrapped and turned into a much lower-stakes conflict it could've been a fantastic film. More of a focus on the actors' wonderful comedic performances (who knew Jamie Dornan could be funny like that?) would've been nice to see.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

📽MOVIE REVIEW🍿

#BarbandStarGotoVistadelMar #ReelKidReview #movies #popcorn #Kuwait #cinema #film #review #moviereview
_____________________
Movie Info:
*Movie: Barb and Star Go to Vista del Mar
*Genre: Comedy
*Director: Josh Greenbaum
*Cast: Kristen Wiig, Annie Mumolo, Jamie Dornan
*Budget: N/A
_____________________
In my opinion, 'Barb and Star Go to Vista del Mar' would receive a C- because of the following:
_____________________
➕Positive:
The production design and world-building (in terms of creating the lush pastel summer environments in the film) was enjoyable.In addition, the film's bubbly tone was probably the only thing I enjoyed, although I did find it went overboard at times.The comedy was funny and occasionally well-done (although I personally never really laughed out loud).There's no doubt that Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo nail their chipper, infectious characters. You can see that as a good or bad thing, depending on how much you can handle of it.The musical sequences are also delightful, if mediocre and forgettable in hindsight._____________________
➖Negative:
Although some of the jokes work, the comedy and premise overall get old and stale very quickly and some jokes way overstay their welcome, making the viewing experience uncomfortable and awkward.The film is also gratingly annoying and hard to watch at times mainly due to the performances.The plot was cliché and way too convenient, and the villain was just way too over-the-top, even for the world of the film._____________________
*Best Actor/Character:
As I mentioned, Wiig and Mumolo are great in their roles, and it is quite clear they had a blast making the film, especially as two real-life best friends. Although, at least for me, it didn't necessarily translate as an enjoyable movie experience.
_____________________
*Should it get a sequel?:
Not really. I just want to see another reliable studio comedy from Kristen Wiig, specifically something that follows in the footsteps of 'Bridesmaids'.
_____________________
*How to Watch:
I honestly think seeing this in theaters would have helped it much more, both price-wise and due to the shock factor of how absurd it is for a studio comedy.
The $19.99 PVOD rental price is just insane for what I just watched.
_____________________
*Audience:
From the looks of the trailers, I thought this was just the type of film I'd enjoy (I usually enjoy such off-the-walls, weird comedies), but even I have to admit that it was just too much and was too inconsistent and weak story-wise for me to care. However, I do think that there is an audience for this film; it really has that weird cult classic feel. If you're looking for a weird quirky, and very silly film to get your mind off the pandemic, this could be it? Think of it as Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo's 'Anchorman' or 'Zoolander', both films which I've never really got.For more reviews and film coverage, make sure to check out @reel_kid on Instagram!",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
214,dsilverio,Fell flat,4,3 March 2021,I think women might find this movie slightly funnier than men. My wife thought it was hilarious. I didn't as much and I love every comedy. I thought they were going for an Austin Powers/ Napoleon Dynamite vibe but it kind of fell flat. I gave it the benefit of the doubt but just was expecting more as Bridesmaids was actually hilarious. Still a decent empty calories movie Overall.,Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
215,leandacarr,Romy and Michele Vibes,7,1 May 2021,"The movie is dumb, but funny enough that you willing sit through it and can't look away. Currently on Crave in Canada so if you want to ignore the pandemic going on for nearly 2hrs and remember what it was like to go on vacation; then give this movie a chance. If nothing else you can watch Jamie Dornan run weird on a beach and talk to a seagull...",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
216,kimlee-15246,I really wanted to like this movie,1,15 March 2021,"I saw a trailer for this movie in December and looked forward to it coming out.
I have much respect for Kirsten as an actress and she can really do much better than this.
The film is nonsensical and a waste of time. It isn't even funny.
Jamie also doesn't do himself any favours from exposing and relieving himself in the Fall with Gillian Anderson and doing his Fifty Gey Shades thing.
This film promised a lot but I left the cinema (in my house) disappointed and would have asked for my money back if I'd paid an entrance fee!",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
217,lindajanemann,Truly terrible,1,18 July 2021,"I really really wanted to love this movie, I could see what they were trying to achieve, bu oh boy did they miss. It is the biggest turkey I've e seen in a long while. What a shame.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
218,greta-reichel,Do not spend your money on this,1,22 February 2021,This was one of the worst comedies I have seen in a long time. I watched it with my partner and we both just sat there hating it and turned it off after an hour. What a shame as it's a great cast and what pulled me in was that it was from the makers of bridesmaids my all time favourite film! This is was such a wannabe funny letdown.,Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
219,finneypollard,Not funny. Not watchable.,1,21 February 2021,"Not at all what it looked like in the trailers. Absurd, idiotic, disjointed plot, not funny at all. It's really cringy that two wealthy middle-aged women would write a film insulting to middle-aged women of limited education and limited means. Kristin Wiig is usually clever and funny. I don't know what happened to her to cause this mess. Utterly unwatchable. This was included in a streaming service I subscribe to, so I didn't pay extra for it, just wasted precious time before I gave up and moved on a third of the way through.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
220,niquemarr,"If you like ""Old Greg"" you'll probably love this movie",10,14 February 2021,"I love stupid, random humor and I loved this movie. It is not meant to be taken seriously in any way, so if you can't get on board with that idea, don't waste your time on it. It's bizarreness should be fully embraced!

224,artistamibrown,Perfectly absurd and hilarious,10,11 July 2021,"If you like Zoolander-style comedies, you're gonna love this one. It's funny, witty and I'm sure if I watch it a second time, I'll see something I missed the first time. The 2 leads do a great job, comedic timing perfection. Jamie Dornan is actually hilarious in this role, his singing is crazy, his dance moves atrocious, but somehow he is still endearing. I'm not sure if it was just me, but I think he slipped in and out of several accents along the way as well. Lol. Kristin Wiig as the evil antagonist couldn't be any more funny. She is so good, it's hard to tell it's her. There are so many oddball references as well, make it entertaining and real treat to watch.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

Ludicrous plot but just take the film in all its glory of silliness. These characters have so much potential to do much more. I hope their next adventures are with more plot, more silliness and an even bigger soundtrack.I won't spoil the film just watch and it it your feet up and don't take life to seriously.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
227,mattawatt,All I can say is WTF,10,19 February 2021,"Would watch again 10/10

I laughed the whole time.,10,5 September 2021,I just watched this movie on a road trip and I have to say it has been years since I laughed out loud at a movie this much.

Well this one is one of the worst.

235,bxueky,Just not that funny,4,14 February 2021,Like a bad Austin Powers remake with two middle aged women instead of a British Spy. even had Kristen Wiig play the parts of Villain and Hero. I would have to say the 4 stars are for Culottes and Jamie Dornan's random music sequence. Pretty disappointed that Damon Wayans Jr didn't have a bigger part too. Just overall bleh.,Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
236,dangerous-person,Hysterical absurdist comedy!,8,13 February 2021,"Okay, I'm not going to lie. I was super drunk when I watched this. In fact, I'm still drunk. And I probably will be for several more hours.That being said, this was probably the funniest movie I've seen in a LONG time. Maybe it's the pandemic, or maybe it's Reba McEntire emerging from the ocean as an angel mermaid or whatever for absolutely no reason. Dude I don't know what the hell is going on, but I loved it.The vibe of this movie is basically Wet Hot American Summer meets Austin Powers. If you're not into absurdist humor, you aren't going to like it. If you're not into Kristen Wiig, you won't enjoy it. Simple enough? Maybe you need more convincing?Well that's too bad, because there are fried baby eagles on the menu and you're just a sad sack eating hot dog soup at talking club.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

241,whsreunion-82164,Don't waste your time or money,1,16 February 2021,"I wish I could get the time I wasted watching this movie back. There is nothing funny about this movie. I kept watching, thinking it has to get better soon. But it doesn't. The positive reviews you can tell are bots or paid reviewers because the language used is almost exactly the same. Just awful and a waste of talent",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
242,rachaeljones-26987,It's OK,3,16 February 2021,"From reading the reviews, I was kind of expecting more of an Austin Powers vibe but didn't really get that because some parts were just a bit too ridiculous. I get that you are not to take this movie too seriously but sometimes less is more. To each their own I guess.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
243,geg-74405,Silly but highly amusing,7,17 February 2021,"This movie needs to be watched after a couple of drinks, and when you are in a silly mood. The jokes are so ridiculous that you can't help but laugh and there are some very random cameos which add to the crazy vibe of this film.
I wasn't expecting, the very attractive, Jamie Dornan to be cast in this, and initially had reservations that he would not be a good fit in a comedy film, but he played the part perfectly. His heart-felt croon, 'Edgar's Prayer', was the highlight for me. A song worthy of Eurovision that gets stuck in your head for days on end. It is now on heavy rotation in my Spotify playlist.
If you are fan of Will Ferrel's 'Superstar' movie, I think you will enjoy this.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

246,debbiekc,Couldn't get through first 40 minutes,1,23 February 2021,"I tried to give it a chance based on the reviews I read, but, I'm sorry, it's terrible. I usually really enjoy mindless, dumb comedy, but this was the most annoying, waste of my time ever. Maybe it got better, but I honestly couldn't sit through another minute of it. Wait until it's free, then see if you can watch it.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
247,kristenbylsma,Laughed the entire way through,10,8 March 2021,"This comedy is hilarious. I have watched it twice so far and notice so many jokes the second time that i missed the first from laughing so hard.One of those movies made for adults but has so much comedy that kids can pick up on and enjoy while missing out on the more inappropriate lines.So good, a new favorite in line with waiting for guffman movies and the like.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
248,patculcam,STOP MAKING MOVIES!,10,14 March 2021,"We as a society should stop all movie productions from now on. Why do I say that you might ask? Well because Barb and Star go to Vista Del Mar is the greatest piece of cinema ever crafted by mortals. It is super funny, I was laughing so hard that I nearly choked to death while drinking my water. This movie has such classic characters such as Barb, Star, Edgar, Sadness from Inside Out, Beverly From The Goldberg's, Morgan Freeman Crab, Sharon, Yoyo, and of course Stuart Little. That's right this modern classic is a prequel to Stuart Little 1 and 2. Stuart appears as one of the mice in Sharon's evil lair, and I'm pretty sure that's definitely him just without any clothes on. But overall the characters are super hilarious and memorable. Each one of them hilarious in their own separate ways. You can also somewhat feel for some of them in a way which makes the movie a bit of a drama as well. Also this movie has a banger soundtrack. The song the hotel sings to greet Barb and Star is super catchy and memorable. But the song that really does it for me is Edgars Prayer where he sings his heart out about wether he loves Star or Sharon. It was so beautiful that I cried so much, I had to take a 10 minute break from the movie because the crying I was doing was getting a bit annoying and I had to let it all out. Overall this movie is a great final installment in the Stuart Little trilogy and is the perfect movie. They could cancel all movies at this point and I wouldn't care in the slightest. 10/10 Cinematic Masterpiece the whole way through.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
249,nprj-44246,Amazing Once You Understand,10,5 April 2021,"This movie is reminiscent of The Naked Gun franchise, Airplane, National Lampoon's. It's Spoof comedy. This movie also contains a lot of running jokes...that catch you at just the right time! If you know what you are in for and appreciate the particular kind of humor, you will split your ribs laughing! Thoroughly enjoyed this movie!!",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

251,rahtechniques,"If you don't get the references, you are too young to appreciate this.",10,5 November 2021,"My husband and I didn't know what to expect, I was able to watch the trailer, but my husband didn't. It started out strong and then I realized it reminds me of Naked Gun series, Airplane!, Austin Powers' series and so many other movies from the late 80s to early 00s. Once you realize each scene purposefully has remnants of those type of movies - it is funny as heck. Honestly thought it was going to be a passion project of theirs, but I love knowing the movies they referenced. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you gotta watch the said movies above. 10/10 recommend and would watch again.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
252,callmecity,Surprisingly hard to watch,1,17 April 2021,"What is this movie trying be? Musical comedy? Austin Powers style save the world? Two quaint friends leave home for the first time?None of it makes sense, and the jokes have no continuity with continual misses. My girlfriend and I shut it off after 53 minutes.Really a tedious task to try and stick this one through.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
253,itierney,"Had Potential, Didn't Deliver",5,26 July 2021,"I saw the teaser trailer for this way back in December of 2019 and was interested in it from the get go. Obviously 2020 was a disaster and delayed every movie, including this one. Finally, 2021 arrived and I was so excited to watch this.I started off with high hopes, ready for it to knock my socks off, but that feeling slowly faded throughout the movie. It just wasn't funny. :( There were plenty of times something was *supposed* to be funny, but the delivery was terrible. I'm not one to say ""I could've done it better,"" especially since I'm not an actor, but I can spot bad deliverance when I see it. I think I only laughed audibly once, and maybe smirked a couple other times, but that was it.To me, it seemed like a wannabe Austin Powers. From other reviews I've seen, I'm not the only one who thought that. I don't think I went into it with the wrong expectations either.If I had the chance to watch it again, I probably wouldn't. But I also wouldn't recommend someone else to skip it if they hadn't seen it. Clearly other people found it enjoyable!",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

256,david_vickers-38513,Most underrated movie,10,14 September 2021,"This is my first ever movie review because I think it is worth a first review. Reminds me of when I saw Austin Powers 1 or the Matrix, and they didn't do well on release. They then, through word of mouth became big successes. I hope that this ultimately gets the credit for it deserves when the pandemic is fully over. Very clever and funny. The first 20 minutes is somewhat comparable to most movies. But then, without giving things away, it gets very unique and funny.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
257,effiephd,Silly and funny and has depth...,10,14 March 2021,"If you can analyze enough of what is going on, this movie has depth. Bullied during childhood to grow up and have the leading man from Fifty Shades of Grey being in love with you because you are Dr. Lady. The fantastic two females who wrote this did well and delivered. Beautiful colorful scenery, a new in living color favorite of mine. I called my female bestie Diva from my Sound Factory days today after having watched this last night. Lessons about friendship and female power are evident. If a film moves you to take a positive action, it earns 10 stars and barbs.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
258,vbufler,Waste of time,1,11 August 2021,"Not only was this.movie a waste of time it was a waste of talent. The plot was so very stupid and I kept wondering is this science fiction, or what. I know is was suppose to be a comedy but for me the laughs never came. Oh , there was a musical number with Jamie Dorman ""singing"" and a crude lounge ""singer"". I suppose I was stupid for watching the entire thing...thinking it is going to get better...NOT. I thought poor Jamie Dorman your name will.always be attached to this movie.

263,johnabalash,Really funny!,8,16 February 2021,I thought this would be like an overly long SNL skit but I really loved it! It was goofy but genuinely funny. It's probably better suited for a girl's night out movie but I'm a guy and thought the humor hit.,Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar

Barb and Star are great and compelling characters, the movie is well thought, and the jokes are definitely over (over, over, over) the top.If you are still a child in the body of a grown-up, you should watch it and you will enjoy every second of it.This movie will become (it's probably already is) a camp classic.",Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar
