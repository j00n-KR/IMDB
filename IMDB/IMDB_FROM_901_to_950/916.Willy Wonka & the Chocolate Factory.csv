0,MartinHafer,A lovely little film,8,20 September 2006,"I have always liked this film. Despite the new film (which I like even more), I still enjoy the old fashioned aspects of this film. For 1971, it's pretty good children's fare--much better than crap from the same era (such as CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG and DR. DOOLITTLE). Some may find all the singing annoying or complain that the songs are not the ones Roald Dahl wrote in the book (which appear in the remake), I still found them catchy and cute. In fact, I have no major complaints other than the stupid sequence where they are on the boat. All the awful and pointless images projected across the screen look cheap and gratuitous--unlike the rest of the film.However, I think that the BEST thing to do is to watch this and the recent remake and think of them as totally different movies. The 1971 film is a bit saccharine and kitschy but is still fun and memorable. The new Johnny Depp version is much darker and full of modern special effects. And, as a result they are so different, it's worth watching them both and DON'T compare them--just enjoy.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Charming, and hugely enjoyable!",8,15 June 2009,"This is a hugely enjoyable film, based upon the book by Roald Dahl. The film does have a number of merits, especially the flawless performance of Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, a characterisation that is charming and funny at the same time. Another standout is Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe, his scenes with Charlie were lovingly realised, but in his song, he was just hilarious, and his singing voice was remarkably good. However, whereas Peter Ostrum is perfectly agreeable in terms of acting as Charlie, he is let down by his lack of any real singing ability. Though the film does look beautiful with excellent cinematography and colourful sets, and the supporting characters like the Oompa Loompas, the odiously spoilt Veruca Salt, television addict Mike Tevee and the rather disgusting Violet Bueragarde, are very well done, and the actors are further advantaged by a wonderful sparkling script. The songs are lovely, especially Oompa Loompa, Imagination and I want it Now, though I will say I felt Cheer Up Charlie was rather tedious and slowed the film down quite considerably. Overall, a beautiful film, and I do think it is underrated. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
2,bkoganbing,The Candy Man,7,2 August 2018,"Even with Johnny Depp's darker portrayal of Willy Wonka of more recent vintage
out there, what Gene Wilder did with the part stands out as the definitive Wonka
for our times. I'm willing to bet that more families rent this one than Johnny
Depp's.In Roald Dahl's children's fantasy the great candymaker Willy Wonka locked up
his candy factory because of industrial spying by his competitors. No one goes
in or out except the raw material and the candy. Now however it's worldwide
news that Wonka is opening his giant River Rouge GM like plant for five lucky
adolescent tourists. They will be determined by five lucky golden tickets found in Wonka Bars.That fifth one goes to Peter Ostrum who takes the tour with his grandfather
Jack Albertson. The other kids who are showing various degrees of spoiled also have adult companions. The four other kids, well they don't quite finish the trip. As they rather colorfully drop out Gene Wilder has some snarky comments. Accompanied by
the pygmy tribe of Oompa-Loompas who Willy Wonka moved from their
Pacific island home to work in his factory. This part I thought was truly
stretching it as these little guys look a whole lot like slaves working on the old
plantation.The film got an Oscar nomination for Best Musical Scoring and the song The
Candy Man became a big old hit for Sammy Davis, Jr.After almost 50 years the Candy Man can and is still doing it.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
3,Leofwine_draca,Uneasy blend of children's musical and macabre horror,8,4 December 2016,"At first glance Wonka is exactly the opposite of the films I usually watch and enjoy (i.e. action and horror), a string-pulling and cheerful kiddie's film blessed with a fine sense of visual style (the factory and its various areas are quite spectacular, and whilst some of the special effects are a little dodgy they more than hold up to today's blockbusters). It's a bright and colourful musical that screams twee throughout and has somewhat been superseded in the public's imagination by Tim Burton's ill-advised rehash, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY.However a little digging beneath the surface reveals a slightly disturbing and horrific yarn of infanticide, in which young children are led unsuspectingly to various terrifying fates (being squeezed, stretched, and ""juiced"" to name but three). It's a film in which subliminal images of millipedes crawling over people's faces and a chicken being beheaded are inserted into one darned scary boat-tunnel ride and the twinkly eyes of Gene Wilder may just be hiding a sinister madman behind them. As such this film can be enjoyed both as a family classic and as a subtle chilling horror story.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
4,SnoopyStyle,Pure movie magic,8,25 October 2014,Reclusive Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) is opening his factory after years of secrecy. It's been a long time since he has used people as workers. Nobody ever goes in and nobody ever comes out of his factory. Then he announces that five golden tickets found in Wonka bars will grant five lucky children and their guardians a tour of the factory. Charlie is a poor boy living in the shadows of the factory. He is lucky to enough to find the final ticket. He brings his grandpa along as each child succumbs to some mishap. They are introduce to wild candy magic and the Oompa-Loompas.This is one of the weirdest and yet mostly fun ride. Gene Wilder is pitch perfect as the outlandish master of ceremony of this unique three ring circus. It has one of the most unique vision. Nothing is crazier than the Oompa-Loompas. The funnier thing about them is that they're not necessary cute. There is something disturbing about them. That goes for the factory in general. There seems to be some danger and magical about everything. It is just pure movie magic.,Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
5,Hitchcoc,Roald Is Never Dull!,9,26 January 2015,"This is a delight for all ages. Gene Wilder will always be the definitive Willie Wonka (sorry Johnny Depp--not even in the game). This is the moralistic tale that tells us that the selfish undisciplined child will eventually pay a price for his or her transgressions and the good will win out. But like all of Roald Dahl's books, it has a hard edge filled with many surprises. Wilder plays the quirky Wonka as he moralizes and cruelly punishes the little brats for their negative attributes. Even Charlie begins to wonder if what has been promised him has so many conditions that it may not be worth the effort. While the special effects may seem a bit dated, they work well and the factory is a wonder. And then there are those Oompa Loompas, providing employment for the most little person actors since ""The Wizard of Oz."" I've watched this so many times and I never tire of it.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
6,mark.waltz,The Meek Will Inherit the Chocolate.,7,6 May 2014,"There's a message behind the darkness of Willy Wonka's wacky chocolate factory here, and that is if you are a glutton, a gum chewer with a massive ego, a spoiled brat or a television addict, you will not inherit the Kingdom of Willy. This is one of those strange stories that is probably not for infant children, maybe best for 10 years and up, and probably better for mature adults who can look back at this years after first seeing it to determine what Ronald Dahl was trying to say in his story of gooey goodness. There's no gooey feeling about the story. This is purely adult fare with visual treats for the kids, and a few scary moments as well. Willy Wonka in a sense appears to be a metaphor for some spiritual being utilizing a rather materialistic method in order to find out who will be the grand prize winner for his kingdom. In a sense, he's a bit like God, as some literary critics and movie historians have determined Frankenstein's monster and Edward Scissorhands to be a metaphor for Jesus.Peter Ostrum is Charlie Bucket, one of five lucky recipients of the golden ticket, and he is indeed a sweet, unselfish child. The four other winners range from horrid (Veruca Salt) to grossly obese (Augustus Gloop) to obnoxious (Mike Teevee) to somewhat of a braggart (the more likable Violet Beauregarde) and their parents are just as horrid. Charlie takes along his beloved grandpa Joe (a wonderful Jack Albertson) who was bedridden along with his wife and Charlie's other two grandparents (think of ""Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice"" meet ""Cocoon"" and Maude, as in ""Harold and...""). The visual of the four elderly in-laws in the same bed is probably enough of a nightmare in itself let alone what Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) has in store for them.The Wonka factory is a fun house in itself, with coat and hat racks that literally can grip what is being placed on it, an ""Alice in Wonderland"" like tiny door that opens to a world of pure imagination, a beautiful steamboat run by orange faced little people that goes into the tunnel of hell, a goose that lays golden chocolate eggs, a piece of gum that turns little girls into giant blueberries, a room filled of gas filled liquid that threatens to carve its drinkers into sliced cold cuts, and a television like machine that shrinks big things into little things, like bratty children. Of course, Wonka's garden is the most beautiful of these segments, and in each one, sin is dealt with as each nasty child prepares to get their come-uppance.Some critics may call Charlie too perfect to be real, but there are indeed children out there with his sweetness and love, and that is what Willy Wonka's God-like character is searching for. Each child is given the test because of a villain named Slugworth, and it is easy to see who will pass, who will fail. The Oompah Loompas are a ""Harry Potter"" like version of Oz's Munchkins, and after each child fails their test, these wisened little men sing the moral of what that child needed to learn. The music and lyrics of Leslie Bricusse features one of the top movie themes of all time, ""The Candy Man"" (made into a hit single by Sammy Davis Jr.; sung by a candy store clerk here), and ""Pure Imagination"" is equally as memorable.This takes on what some of the Disney musicals lack, and that is an appealing lesson for adults to pass on to their children. As Willy Wonka says, it is possible that some of these children will come out a bit better than they were before, although you can lay odds on the nasty Veruca Salt turning into a British version of either Leona Helmsley or Monica Lewinsky in her selfish quest for ""I Want It Now!"".",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
7,classicsoncall,"""Candy is dandy but liquor is quicker.""",7,9 July 2018,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie but I'm pretty sure it wasn't what I wound up viewing. I thought I would like the general feel of the thing but something about the movie felt off kilter. Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) seemed mean spirited at times, and almost indifferent at others, giving me the impression that the picture over all wasn't that kid friendly. I mean, four out of the five Golden Ticket winners wound up transported to some never never land never to be heard from again, while Charlie (Peter Ostrum) had to take it on the chin with his grandfather (Jack Albertson) for swiping some of the fizzy lifting drinks. That he wound up inheriting the Chocolate Factory seemed almost like a consolation prize given the tenor of the story.I did like the idea of the Golden Ticket contest, and have to wonder why more companies didn't follow up on the idea after this movie came out. It seemed like it would drive a lot of business and create excitement about a company's products. There's no denying the sets are colorful and imaginative, yet they seemed strangely surreal and fake at the same time. When I think back to the creativity on display in a film like ""The Wizard of Oz"" made three decades earlier, it's like this film didn't put the era's technology and artistry to any kind of use to look more polished. The thing is, the movie held out a lot of promise with the opening scenes of chocolate candy being made on a variety of assembly lines pumping out bars and candy kisses. And the scene in the candy shop took me back to the good old days of my youth when penny candy was the rule. I kind of feel sorry for today's youth who can't ever experience the thrill and/or frustration of making such a fateful decision with just a few available pennies in the sweaty palm of their hand. If you could pick up four of five pieces of penny candy today for under a buck you'd probably be lucky.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
8,lee_eisenberg,That stuff'll rot your teeth!,2,12 July 2005,"Everyone knows this movie, what with the endless supply of candy. It's hard to believe that Dr. Fronk-en-steen played Willy Wonka, or that ""The Man"" from ""Chico and the Man"" played the grandfather. I've read Roald Dahl's book, which didn't have a bunch of songs (except those from the Oompa Loompas).I will be eager to see what Tim Burton and Johnny Depp do with the remake, as they are both people whom I trust. Granted, Gene Wilder has always been good (especially when co-starring with Richard Pryor), but this version of ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" was pretty hokey. Still, the scene where the girl turns into a blueberry was kinda neat.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
9,jboothmillard,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,7,14 September 2005,"Changing the original title of the book, this is quite good for a classic musical with some memorable songs and a good leading actor. Basically, a chocolate factory in the town Charlie Bucket(introducing Peter Ostrum) lives is sending out millions of chocolate bars worldwide, five of them contain golden tickets for a trip to the factory, and a lifetime supply of chocolate. One by one the tickets are found, and eventually, Charlie gets his. This ticket takes them into the magical world of the highly imaginative and bizarre chocolate factory, with the great eccentric Willy Wonka (Golden Globe nominated Gene Wilder). Obviously all the nasty kids go one by one. Fat and greedy German Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner) up the chocolate tube, gum chewing Violet Beauregard (Denise Nickerson) turns into a blueberry, spoilt rich bitch Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole) falls down the bad golden egg shoot for being a bad (not the original idea in the book) and telly loving Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen) is shrunk by the Wonka Vision laser. A slightly more accurate (to the book) remake by Tim Burton was made in 2005, with the original title of course. This version was nominated for the Oscar for Best Music, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Music for Leslie Bricusse, Anthony Newley and Walter Scharf. It was number 16 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, and it was number 8 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Good!",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
10,Woodyanders,One of the most twisted and subversive children's fantasy musical films ever made,10,23 March 2018,"Five children from different walks of life win golden tickets that enable them to partake on a tour of an elaborate candy factory run by eccentric recluse Willy Wonka (superbly played to the creepy and quirky hilt by Gene Wilder). Director Mel Stuart and screenwriter Roald Dahl use the deceptively pleasant premise as a means to turn the concept of the breezy and innocuous escapist fantasy musical that's fun for the entire family completely on its ear by presenting four hideously obnoxious kids -- Julie Dawn Cole's petulant and pampered rich bitch Veruca Salt, Michael Bollner's gluttonous Augustus Gloop, Denise Nickerson's rude gow-chewing Violet Beauregarde, and Paris Themmen's addled boob tube addict Mike Teevee -- who are terrible toxic products of too lenient and/or indulgent parents and hence wholly deserving of the harsh fates that befall them. Mostly importantly, while protagonist Charlie Bucket (a fine and likeable performance by Peter Ostrom) is a basically decent and honest boy, he isn't bereft of a few flaws himself. Director Stuart deftly crafts a light, yet dark and sardonic tone as well as keeps the immensely entertaining story moving along at a brisk pace. Dahl's clever script not only provides lots of sparkling witty lines and sharply drawn characters, but also offers a potent and provocative central message concerning morality and responsibility. Moreover, it's acted with zest by an enthusiastic cast, with especially stand-out contributions from Jack Albertson as the doting Grandpa Joe, Roy Kinnear as the long-suffering Mr. Salt, Leonard Stone as the crass Mr. Beauregarde, and Gunter Meisner as the sinister Mr. Slugworth. Kudos are also in order for Arthur Ibbetson's vibrant cinematography and the marvelously catchy songs by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley. A sheer delight.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
11,ccthemovieman-1,A Good Message In Which Goodness Prevails,10,14 June 2006,"When I first saw this movie on VHS in the late '80s, I was shocked. A '70s movie with a GOOD message?? I couldn't believe it. The message: kids - be honest and be trustworthy and don't be obnoxious; parents - don't spoil your kids or they'll quickly turn out to be brats.Wow, no wonder liberal critics like Leonard Maltin trashed this film. It was not the normal message being delivered in movies, which usually trashes the good and glorifies the bad. That's what makes this story refreshing, and the same goes for the re-make that was released in 2005.Peter Ostrum plays the likable Charlie and is very good. He's one of the nicest kids ever put on screen and was a fine actor. It's kind of surprising this was the only film he ever did! Jack Albertson does a nice job of Charlie's loving grandpa and so do the bratty kids, especially the English girl who is so bad you have to laugh at her.The first part of the story was a good satire on how people sometimes make trivial things so important and how the news media gets carried way with stupid issues. (Wow, look at it now!) The second half of the story is intriguing because of the co-star of the film: Willy Wonka - a no-nonsense candy maker who doesn't put up with the brats - was fascinating to watch. (The critics thought he was too nasty.) Gene Wilder is excellent as Willy. Yes, he has a bit of a mean streak to him but his comments are fun to hear and on the money despite his lack of verbal tact. Most people prefer Wilder's version of ""Wonka,"" by the way, over the bizarre-but- talented Johnny Depp's.This was an entertaining film that should keep your interest. It's also an interesting comparison to the 2005 movie. Frankly, I enjoyed both.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

13,BA_Harrison,An enjoyable movie for the whole family.,7,3 September 2006,"Tim Burton's recent version of the classic Roald Dahl story may have been more faithful to its source material, but this 1971 musical adaptation of the much loved children's classic, directed by Mel Stuart, is still well worth watching as it manages to accurately capture the feel of the book and is a whole heap of fun.Gene Wilder plays eccentric sweet-maker Willy Wonka, who allows five children to tour his amazing factory after they find lucky golden tickets hidden in winning bars of Wonka chocolate. Of the five, only Charlie Bucket is truly deserving of such an honour and, as the tour progresses, the other children suffer from a series of bizarre mishaps.This movie is a colourful, candy coated treat with a deliciously dark comical centre. Wilder is excellent as the slightly sinister recluse who welcomes the (mostly) obnoxious children and their equally awful parents into his world. His factory is a brilliantly realised surreal wonderland and is a feast for the eyes (as well as the stomach!). The music, for the most part, is pretty memorable with standout tunes being 'I've got a golden ticket' and the Oompa Loompa songs.The wonderfully bizarre characters are all perfectly realised by the talented cast, from poor little Charlie (Peter Ostrum) to the spoilt kids (in particular, the brilliantly brattish Julie Dawn Cole as Veruca Salt) and their parents (including the great Roy Kinnear).My only gripe with the movie is when it strays too far from the original story. I'd have loved to have seen the squirrel room from the book, rather than the geese, but I guess that this was probably too hard to translate to the screen in 1971 (however, this scene does appear in the recent Burton movie). I also disliked the introduction of Slugworth and the whole everlasting gob-stopper 'test'. In the book, I always thought that the children were being tested as soon as they entered the factory, and that when they broke the rules, they had failed that test. In the book, Charlie abides by the rules and becomes the deserving winner, but in this telling, Grandpa Joe and Charlie also break Wonka's rules by stealing the lemonade. Why were they spared the kind of nasty fate suffered by the other rule-breakers? Had Wonka already made his mind up to choose Charlie at the start?If you haven't read the book (or as not as much of a purist as I am when it comes to adaptations), you will adore this film. Although not perfect, I think it is a very good movie which will appeal to adults and children alike.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
14,moonspinner55,"""What is this--a freak-out?!""",8,2 September 2001,"Roald Dahl's Grimm-like book ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" gets a careful, pointed musical treatment here, involving five Golden Ticket-winning tykes who get to tour a mysterious candy factory--at their own expense. Turns out the journey is a test of their personalities and upbringings, and the film is a little presumptuous to suggest that the poorest kid may be the most noble and honest (as if all rich kids were rotten). The opening moments and TV commentaries on the race to find the tickets are littered with smart satire and a particular kind of dry-ice British humor which may confound kids but should delight grown-ups. Once inside the factory, the film coasts happily along on Gene Wilder's coattails (he's incredibly nutty, occasionally a jerk, but always unpredictable). The screwy Wonkatania boat ride is a highlight, with gross-out flickers on a screen that really are a freak-out. Yes, some of the songs are a drag, but I loved Veruca Salt's number ""I Want It Now!"" (she really wants ten thousand tons of ice cream??); ""The Candy Man"" is a classic and, I may be in the minority here, I thought ""Cheer Up, Charlie"" was a sweet lament. The movie is uneven and a bit grotesque, but it sends kids out on a high and doesn't bore parents, and that's a plus for family films. Critics dismissed it in 1971 (Pauline Kael described it as ""Prussians at play,"" which I'm pretty sure is an insult) and Dahl himself publicly nixed it, but it has bratty kids getting what they deserve, a fabulous looking factory, and wild-eyed, frizzy-haired Wilder at his peak. His performance is like an Everlasting Gobstopper; it will live on and on. ***1/2 from ****",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
15,tavm,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is the filmed version of Roald Dahl's book I happen to prefer of the two versions,8,12 September 2016,"In tribute to Gene Wilder's passing, the theatre my friend works at showed two of his films-Blazing Saddles and this one. I didn't know about the former until we just watched the other one-my first time seeing it on the big screen while it was his second. It's just as funny and partly scary as I'd remembered it watching as a pre-teen on TV during the mid-'70s. Wilder himself was funny, a little scary, and warm enough that you couldn't help but love him despite all he was subjecting his visitors through at Wonka's candy factory. Of the child players, Julie Dawn Cole was the funniest as the bratty Veruca Salt especially when she was the only one to have a solo musical number just before her fate. No wonder she was the only one of them to continue acting as she grew up. And seeing this in the theatre, I finally watched the ""Cheer Up, Charlie"" number in its entirety after some of my siblings fast-forwarded through it when watching it on VHS tape. It's not a bad number but it did slow the film down somewhat. Still, despite that, I wouldn't change a thing as I definitely prefer this version to the later Tim Burton-Johnny Depp one from several years back. Then again, maybe the fact this was the version I grew up with that makes me like this one more...",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

The film goes to show you that kindness is ultimately rewarded and selfishness does not go unpunished.The ending in itself proves that chocolate factory owner was sly, but a real child himself at heart.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
17,Coventry,Sweet as chocolate!,8,24 July 2005,"With the brand-new version of Tim Burton coming up, I thought it would be appropriate to watch the very first film-adaptation of Roald Dahl's popular children-novella first. Over 30 years old already, but this charming and moralistic fairy-tale still is a joy for all senses, with its likable main characters, exhilarating songs and valuable life-lessons. The movie might start out a little slow and overly dramatic with the extended portrait of the poor Charlie Bucket who has to work in order to support his family and he can only secretly dream about winning a grand tour in the wonderful chocolate factory owned by the mysterious Willy Wonka. But, when the miracle than occurs and Charlie walks into the factory together with four greedy kids, the movie REALLY takes off! The children and their adult companions are guided through the colorful landscapes and ingenious techniques of Wonka-world, where chocolate flows in rivers and candy bars can be taken out of TV-screens. This is a very fun movie and Dahl's rich but bizarre imagination is wonderfully put to the screen by Mel Stuart. The set pieces are magnificent and they really have the true magical feel of fantasy. Typical for Roald Dahl's work also is the slightly sinister and horrific touch, which is perfectly illustrated here in the unsettling boat-ride-through-the-cavern sequence. This particular scene is perhaps the most memorable one of the entire movie because of it's great use of sound and lighting! New surprises and eccentric plot-twists are provided every couple of seconds and Gene Wilder's jolly (but tempered) performance as the extravagant factory-owner really makes this movie complete. I can only hope the 2005 version will be as fabulous as this but I'm quite sure it will be. After all, if there's one team able to re-tell this insanely great tale, it has got to be Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" is like a big bar of chocolate: delicious...and you're never too old to enjoy it!",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

While not truly faithful to the original source text this film is full of charm, heart and features some fun songs.At the centre of its success though is the fab performance given by Gene Wilder. He shows Johnny Depp how Wonka should be played, with just enough oddness and darkness to counter the 'candy man' persona.All five of the children give great performances and ultimately it is the combination of all these things that for me mean that this is the version I will remember.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

20,hitchcockthelegend,So shines a good deed in a weary world.,10,10 December 2010,"The world goes on chocolate overdrive when it's announced that famed candy maker, Willy Wonka, has put five golden tickets in his Wonka Bars. The lucky recipients of these tickets will be treated to a day out in the top secret Wonka factory, where they can see how the sweets are made, and if they are even luckier, they will get a lifetimes supply of free chocolate. Nobody wants a golden ticket more than Charlie Bucket, from a desperately poor family, Charlie has learned to accept his heritage with a grace and credibility not befitting most other children. So when a miracle upon miracles happens, and Charlie finds a golden ticket, it just may prove to be a turning point far beyond his wildest dreams.They say that true love lasts a lifetime, so shall it be the case with Willy Wonka and myself. As a child I was captivated by the colours, the dream of myself being able to visit a magical place where sweets and chocolate roll off the production line purely for my ingestion. Songs that I memorised back in my youth have never left me, and now as a considerably middle aged adult male, I can still embrace, and feel the magic, whilst enjoying the darkly knowing aspects of this fabulous and wondrous black comedy.Roald Dahl was quite a writer of note, and thankfully the makers here have brought his astute morality tale to vivid cinematic life. Director Mel Stuart, aided by his screenwriter David Seltzer, even manage to add to Dahl's wonderful story courtesy of a sinister outsider, who apparently in the guise of a rival corporation, will pay handsomely for a Wonka top secret, morality, greed and power all coming together in one big chocolate explosion. The greatest gift that Willy Wonka gives, tho, is that of the set designs and art direction, where in an almost hypnotically drug induced colourful world, Wonka's factory is a child's dream come true, however, peril is at every turn as life's lessons dolled out courtesy of the scarily cute Oompa Loompas.Songs are provided by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricuse, with the sumptuous art coming from Harper Goff. Gene Wilder takes the lead role of Willy Wonka, magnetic and bordering on clued in madness, Wilder takes his rightful place in the pantheon of memorable performances performed in fantasy pictures. But ultimately it's the story and the way it appeals to every age group that makes Willy Wonka a prize treasure, the kids love it, while the adults watching with them will be wryly nodding and trying to suppress the onset of a devilish grin.Pure magic is Willy Wonka, see it now in High Definition TV to fully realise the dream/nightmare on offer, oh oh I love it so. 10/10",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
21,Theo Robertson,Willy Wonka And The Communist Factory,7,27 May 2013,"Roald Dahl is one of the greatest writers of the 20th Century . He has an uncanny knack of tapping in to the dark misanthropic nature of humanity . People are cruel by nature and it's only the artificial veneer of civilization that stops them manifesting this cruelty in the worst way . Let's be honest here - the younger we are the more cruel we are since our social conditioning makes us more mellow in our older psychological state . Childhoods are a living nightmare of authoritarian adults and playground bullies and dreams are usually composed of fighting back against oppressors I read Dahl's original novelization of CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY as a child and my abiding memory of it is the domestic life of young Charlie whose family is oppressed by grinding poverty . What this film version of the book does very well is juxtapose the noble poverty stricken Charlie with the hateful bourgeois philistine brats who also win a trip to the chocolate factory . One's the daughter of a rival sweet company , ones the daughter of an American politician , one's a loud dumb American kid etc . If George Orwell and Leon Trotsky lived long enough to watch this movie they'd proclaim it as a masterpiece due to the subtext The problem is the film doesn't really live up to masterpiece status due to its commercial consideration . This isn't necessarily a criticism but as so many people have stated on this page the film does suffer from rather weak musical numbers which jar with the darker aspects of the movie . There's only two musical numbers that stick in the memory The Candy Man opening number and The Oompa Loompa song and one wonders if the film might have worked better without the musical numbers ? That said the songs are kept to a minimum . Also in the film's favour is the fact that it has a "" Neverwhere "" type of location that's neither Europe or America . Imagine if this film was made a few years earlier with an conservative American-centric view of the world . Now that would have been a disaster",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
22,Doylenf,Imaginative and whimsical cautionary tale with pleasant score...,7,30 June 2010,"I would think that children would be more apt to enjoy WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY more than parents or any adult viewer, but the Lesley Bricusse/Anthony Newley score is easy to like and Gene Wilder's central performance as the candy-maker is a pure delight. He obviously got into the spirit of the role and his interaction with the children (mostly obnoxious little brats) is commendable.The sets look luxurious although I suspect that today's use of CGI would even improve on this factor and the color photography in the WideScreen version is a rich palette of mouth watering colors.Somehow I missed seeing this film when it first opened and don't recall what the critical reception was--nor was I aware of all the hoopla regarding its status as a children's classic. Whatever, it seems to merit praise as a modestly successful musical fantasy that has enough wit and charm to make it diverting entertainment. I haven't seen the recent remake with Johnny Depp, so I'll make no comparison.Frank Albertson is especially good as Gramps and Peter Ostrum (as the only likable child in the cast) does a nice job in his only screen role. The antics of the other children are sufficiently objectionable to understand why Willy Wonka disposes of them (and their parents) the way he does. In many ways, the story serves as a cautionary tale for parents and children.The lyrics are clever and the music has a decidedly pleasant way of advancing the plot although I definitely wouldn't call it as memorable as some other children's classics I can think of.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

24,Boba_Fett1138,Still one of the ultimate kids movies out there.,8,25 August 2012,"After all these years, I feel that this movie still hasn't lost any of its charm or power. It's one that should really speak to every kid's imagination and to those who still have a little child hidden somewhere inside of them. And isn't that basically being everybody on this world? I absolutely still have some problems with this movie but I feel that none of this makes this movie any less of a great and fun experience. In essence it's being a very simple and straightforward movie, in which just a whole bunch of random insane and wonderful stuff happens, the moment they step into Willy Wonka's factory. This is a movie that doesn't need to explain anything. It can let things simply happen and it shows that fantasy has no limitations. You could wish whatever you want from and sometimes dreams come true, as happens to little Charlie in this movie.It's a wonderful, imaginative, fantasy movie, that besides is a great looking one. It has wonderful visuals and colors in it and most importantly, it doesn't look fake! It all looks as if it could be part of the real world and it looks as if every machine really works and all the candy is eatable and tastes wonderful as well.It really looks like Gene Wilder had a great time playing his role. He goes all out, without coming across as insane. It probably is a more subtle performance than most people give him credit for. He is a great comedy character, who besides is capable of placing himself in a kid's world and their fantasy. This doesn't feel like a movie written and made by adults for kids but more like one that in fact got made by kids.It's definitely thanks to Roald Dahl's writing, who of course also wrote the book this movie was based on, that this movie comes to life. He manages to put really a lot into the movie its characters and overall atmosphere. It besides provides the movie with some absolutely great dialog and at time it wants to make you rewind the movie, just to check if you really heard things right. But as I said before, it's being still far from a perfect movie, for me. I have always felt and thought that the beginning of the movie goes on for a bit too long and might be a bit too boring, for young kids especially. I also always thought it was strange that the movie never showed what happened to all of the other kids and what happened to Charlie and his family. The ending feels a bit too rushed and also comes far too sudden. There is no real good buildup to it and it might even be a bit confusing to those who aren't familiar with the book.But despite of all these minor issues, this movie remains a perfectly watchable and fun movie to watch for children and those who still are in touch with their inner child, or have a rich imagination.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

I don't like the way it looks - gangly and ugly - nor the liberties the screenwriters took with the book. I would borrow ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" from my little grade school library, read it, and as soon as I got to the end of the last page go right back to the beginning and read it over again. It was imprinted on my wee young brain, and I simply cannot accept any deviation from it.Gene Wilder at least has fun with this, though he reminds me way too much of my loser ex-brother-in-law for comfort.

Gene Wilder portrays the mysterious Willy Wonka whose chocolate factory concealed five gold tickets within billions of candy bars. Those lucky winners receive a tour of the factory. Peter Ostrum plays young and ambitious Charlie Bucket who has a great family life, particularly with Grandpa Joe, played by Jack Albertson. When all seems lost and hopeless Charlie ends up with the final ticket and offers Grandpa Joe to be his escort. The factory is an imaginary sight to one's mind. Rivers of chocolate, bubbles floating about, gummie bears hanging from trees. It is delicious until the rules are broken and that is where the lesson stems. Director Mel Stuart excites the imagination with this colorful presentation but perhaps it could be interpreted as a tad harsh. The four other children are naughty and are met with consequences when they disobey. One kid falls into the chocolate river. One girl chews forbidden gum and balloons up and turns blue. Julie Dawn Cole plays a demanding spoiled girl whose pursuit of a golden egg renders her a bad egg. Theme regards truth, heart and the sweet tooth of family and the generations to come.

Charlie(Peter Ostrum) and four other children(along with their selected family members) find the Golden wrappers, and get a tour that they never expected, and will never forget...Based on Roald Dahl's story, and directed by Mel Stuart, this children's favorite is an engaging(if uneven) fantasy/musical with good songs and an elaborate set of Wonkaland(complete with Oompa Loompas). Good performances by all, though has moments of cruelty and harshness(the fates of the other four children, and Wonka's ""tirade"" near the end) that are most jarring.

28,Aaron1375,Could be remade as a horror.,6,21 April 2003,"I enjoyed this movie as a child, but looking back on it today it is almost a step or two away from being a horror movie.  The strange red-faced people, children meeting with unfortunate accidents, and that boat scene...whoa!  In the end though this was a pretty good movie for kids even if it didn't really teach them very good lessons.  I mean come on; three of the kids weren't exactly that bad...only the spoiled brat deserved some punishment. In this movie though it is apparently evil to want to be a TV star, a fat kid, and someone who chews gum.  The story is about a contest to get into the chocolate factory and of course the kids above win a chance, and so does the poor kid Charlie.  Though considering how many kids have accidents in the factory they would have been better off in a knife warehouse.  The red-faced dudes are a bit annoying, but Gene Wilder turns in an excellent performance...but what the heck is up with that scene on the boat?

30,SimonJack,A set to delight young and old alike,7,4 September 2017,"Apparently, there is no category in the Academy Awards for unusual or extraordinary sets. If there were, ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" would have walked away with that Oscar in 1971. The set for this movie – once inside the chocolate factory, is exceptional, and at least half the draw and appeal of this movie. It is a delight to behold for young and old. This film is cause for one to marvel at the Hollywood designers, tradesmen and craft people for such splendid work. That said, the story is a nice fairy tale, but with live action all the way. Gene Wilder is very good as Willy Wonka, but this entire cast performed well, down to the most obnoxious child. One especially has to like Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe, and Peter Ostrum as Charlie. This was Ostrum's only movie. Not bad for a child star's single performance in a leading role. Ostrum was offered a three-film contract, but turned it down. He says that although he enjoyed acting and studied it for some time, his parents weren't stage people. Instead, he went on to earn a PhD in animal husbandry from Cornell University and practice veterinary medicine for large farm animals in outstate New York. I wonder if Paramount received any negative feedback for how it portrayed a couple of the children – namely the German boy, Augustus Gloop, and the French girl, Violet Beauregarde. I doubt that any Americans would have complained at the portrayal of the two sassy, snotty, spoiled and nasty kids. Most of us have seen a Mike Teevee and a Veruca Salt more than once. But the actors who played those parts, as well as those of their parents, were very good. One wonders, though, if it was much a stretch in a couple instances. It's interesting that none of the child actors in this film made acting their career. Only one had more than a few films. This is a fun film, although with some dark overtones for kids.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
31,Mr-Fusion,Goodness prevails,8,6 September 2016,"Watching this movie as a kid, ""Willy Wonka the Chocolate Factory"" works great on whimsy alone; the technicolor factory, eccentric candymaker, people merrily bursting into song. But as an adult, it's surprisingly creepy. And that's not just the Oompah Loompahs; there's a subtle malevolence to Wonka himself, and that really adds a new dimension to the movie. Clearly, I'm not the only one who wanted Veruca to suffer a miserable fate, right? The songs are good and the message of honesty still rings true today, but the movie really belongs to Gene Wilder. He was a real showman in the role, and his comic timing is a huge reason why the movie is so enjoyable after so many years. I don't usually watch a movie in memory of the deceased, and in this case, it just seemed like the right time to revisit this one. Even so, R.I.P.

It is a musical, which for me ruins all the fun in a movie, then it is so unintuitive that only somebody very passive could enjoy watching it. I mean, most movies about people in situations so weird that they can't even recognize, so forget about controlling them, are dramas or psycho movies. Their role is to feel you with hopelessness while watching them. This one, though, it's a slight comedy with a moral.

37,sddavis63,So Much Time And So Little To Do,6,27 March 2015,"This movie works. It's a fun family-oriented film that most who watch it will be able to relate to. How many children won't love a movie that transports them into a magical chocolate factory, and how many adults won't be able to relate to the spoiled rotten kids who are at the heart of the story. So, it works. It's an enjoyable watch. Surprisingly, it holds up pretty well against modern movies, and against the Tim Burton version of the story that came out a few years ago. Sure, it lacks the CGI effects that are now ubiquitous in movie-making, but that's kind of a relief. Let's be honest - who really needs CGI? And, it has Gene Wilder who catches the quirkiness of Willie Wonka well. And the character of Charlie is a likable character, unlike the other 4 obnoxious brats who win the trip to the chocolate factory. So, it works. It can't disappoint.That isn't to say that it's perfect by any means. The story seems a bit long; the opening especially. Let's be honest. All we really care about is the trip to the chocolate factory. Sure, it was nice to learn a bit about Charlie's family. That really makes the contrast with the other 4 kids more powerful. But the search for the golden tickets was too drawn out and went on for too long. One of Willie Wonka's repeated lines is ""there's so much time and so little to do."" That seemed appropriate, and the extended search for the ticket started to seem like filler after a while. Even the music was lacking. ""Candy Man"" is a great song, but the actor playing the shopkeeper didn't seem to put much feeling into it. It was a mechanical performance to me; not one that made an impact on me. None of the other songs or singers stood out to me, although I was surprised to see Jack Albertson, who played Charlie's Grampa Joe, singing and dancing. I also wasn't really taken with the Oopaloompas. I didn't find them very interesting.So, it's not perfect - but it's not bad either. It's fine as a family film. Enough to charm the children and enough to keep the adults interested, but it didn't have anything to really capture me and hold me riveted. It was a movie that allowed my mind to wander now and then without leaving me feeling as if I missed very much. (6/10)",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
38,llltdesq,"On adaptations, the creative process and individual tastes.",8,24 January 2004,"While there will be a discussion of the film, this will mostly cover other points that bear on the creative process in general and Roald Dahl in particular and related observations.  Abandon all hope ye who enter this comment.WWAtCF is a reasonably good film, with weak spots, to be sure, but Gene Wilder does a great job and delivers some rather acid lines.  The script is decent, even good in spots.  Not a great movie, but not future guitar picks either.  Has more than a few moments.  Enjoyable, but has somewhat sharp teeth in spots.  End of film review.Now as to film adaptations of work done in other mediums.  Gather 'round, children, as the next few points are moderately significant:  One: a film and a book are different critters.  They have different requirements, strengths and weaknesses and some of these are almost diametrically in opposition.  Thus, an adaptation (in either direction) HAS to be different. Both can be good, bad or mediocre.  But anyone expecting them to be the SAME is mistaken, as they can't be.Two: any work that is released into the wider world and is intended for an audience has two sensibilities involved-the creator(s) and the audience. Every person reading, hearing and/or viewing anything brings themselves to the table.  You bring your own viewpoint into the equation.  Who you are has a great deal to do with how you see things.  Bear this in mind when reading anyone's opinions (including mine).  Most commentary says as much (often more) about the commentator as it does the purported subject.  In other words, you see what you largely expect to see.Now, as to Roald Dahl:  from all reports, Dahl was less than enthralled with the adaptation.  I suspect that it's because Dahl's work had teeth to it, generally speaking, and the incisors here have been blunted and softened a bit.  I read an interview a good many years ago and came away with the impression that Mr. Dahl thought much more highly of children than he did most adults, whom he viewed as incompetent at best and malign at worst, particularly most parents or surrogate parents.  The core of this runs through his work.  The hardest job anyone can have is that of parent, the entrance exam to become one is all too easy, the effects (good and bad) are far-reaching and too many people botch it up in spades.  Watch Willie Wonka again or read Dahl's book.  One other thing: when viewing, hearing or reading something, think about your reactions.  Everyone has hot buttons. It might help if you can recognize what yours are.  After all, it's only a movie, isn't it, now?",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
39,Lejink,Light confection,5,6 March 2008,"Nice gentle family feature, back in the days when ""HR Pufnstuf"" on TV and ""Bedknobs and Broomsticks"" in the cinema were the heights of children's imagination. Roald Dahl's mild cautionary tale on the pitfalls of consumerism, greed (still relevant today in our mass - advertising, obesity-conscious society) is presented pleasantly for the cinema and has a winning turn at its heart by Gene Wilder. The children can't quite act their lines but the adults support well (with a fair smattering of British comedy staples like Roy Kinnear, Tim Brooke Taylor and others on board). The music is fair, certainly not up to ""Oliver"" standards, with the well-known ""Candy Man"" standing out in a less than brilliant vocal performance by the shopkeeper although, to be fair, none of the lead singers is particularly exceptional. The special effects are okay, fine for the time, a bit dated now especially considering the wonders of Tim Burton's big - budget remake, and not too much of the confectionery looks truly scrumptious, to borrow a phrase, but some of the shots (especially the process shot above the rooftops at the end) are embarrassingly processed. The Oompa Loompahs, I suppose, evoke the Munchkins of Oz but are less characterful and really just act as decoration only. I'm struggling to get away from words like nice, pleasant and I suppose bland - it seems to me, all in all, to be one of those films you remember better from your youth than when seeing it again as an adult.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
40,ElMaruecan82,Wilder as the Wonderful Wizard Wonka ...,8,7 June 2013,"Roald Dahl's classic ""Charlie and the Chocolate factory"" has always been one of my favorite readings. I discovered the book in my high school's library, and naturally, I couldn't resist to a story with such an evocative title. And on a yummy level, I wasn't disappointed, the descriptions of the many tastes, whether the Wonka bars or other candies, had the same effect than a Kinder ad.Another aspect of the novel captivated me: the characters, from the description of the Bucket family, with the four grandparents sharing the same bed, the whole suspense built upon the five golden tickets contests and the four little brats who found the first, a whole universe was immortalized in my mind, and I got to hand it to Dahl for having imagined so many colorful characters, much more with the guts to portray kids in such a negative and provocative light. Which leads me to the factory visit and its dark undertones through the fate that awaited the four participants: the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the competitive Violet Beauregard, the capricious Veruca Salt and the TV-addict Mike Teavee. We already knew kids could be cruel but I defy anyone to find a book where children get such cruel punishments.As a kid, I could easily relate to the story and it didn't bother me much that the kids would get their comeuppance, as an adult and while I enjoyed the reading three of four times more, I realized how subtly subversive the story was, and perhaps this is the greatest compliment you can give to a children's book: finding the perfect mixture between the joy and nastiness inherent to childhood, something kids can understand, and adults too. The Oompa-Loompas are a perfect example as they clearly reflect this ambivalence: while they are exotic and peculiar enough to appeal to children's imagination and their natural craving for adventures, they're also spooky and can easily pass as a miniature and collective version of the bogeyman. Still, the book cleverly focuses on an adorable kid who sets a positive example to better highlight the other kids' flaws, but he's not a one-dimensional character either, although the two films didn't give him much depth and substance.Indeed, the choice of Mel Stuart was to focus on Willy Wonka rather than Charlie. If the choice is debatable, it shouldn't overlook how a fantastic challenge adapting ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was, in the way it restored the magic and fairy-tale atmosphere of the chocolate factory. It was also a risky project, if ever the screenwriters were tempted, no pun intended, to sugarcoat the story. Tim Burton's adaptation probably suffered from the opposite criticism as it portrayed Wonka as a kind of creepy and too enigmatic character, but the recreation of the factory, but all the technology available in the 2000's redeemed these little imperfections. While I deplored the focus on Wonka's background and the Oedipal back-story that distracted us from the real character: Charlie or the real star: chocolate, I expected the original film to be more faithful to the book, and maybe, more politically correct.But the 1971 version was quite astonishing. Granted the effects are not as dazzling as the remake, they still work and even restore a magic that was only prevailing in Disney animated movies. But the film, in itself, is a glorious achievement in the same vein that the inevitable: ""Wizard of Oz"". The journey of Charlie and Grandpa Joe, played by a convincing Jack Albertson echoes Dorothy's adventure in Oz, the 30's had the Munchkins, the 70's the Oompa-Lommpas. The film is not flawless, the songs are not as memorable as the 1939 MGM classic, except for the unforgettable ""Candy Man"", Peter Ostrum is no Judy Garland, but ""Willy Wonka"" works a wonderful tribute to Hollywood Golden Age, surprisingly effective in 1971, at the peak of the more realistic and cynical Hollywood New wave  or maybe this 'cynicism' was already embodied by Wonka's eccentric and bizarre personality, as described in the book.Naturally, the casting of Wonka was the hit-or-miss element, any kid with innocent-looking eyes and rosy cheeks could have played Charlie, given the relatively small role he has in the film. It's a choice that was criticized by the author himself but since Wonka was the pillar of the film, the studios had to come up with the perfect actor. Personally, when I read the book, I imagined Wonka as an eccentric man, wearing bright colors and sophisticated, elegant, charming but very secret, hiding in his heart a much darker soul. When I saw Wilder, I thought in myself, now that was the Willy Wonka I imagined. Loony and funny enough to make a positive impression... soon to be contradicted during the factory tour, Depp gave away that impression from the very beginning, Wilder maintained the perfect level of mystery and carried the whole film thanks to his magnificent performance.I'm sorry to fill this review with references to the remake but it's only to highlight my appreciation of the 1971 version. I was perplex regarding some deviations from the book, the global craze surrounding the contest was an inspiration for hilarious gags, but I could have done without the floating, elevating and belching part. Speaking of that moment, there's no doubt that it's Gene Wilder's performance that elevates the film, as soon as he enters, the story truly picks up and we know we're into something that would be a delightful for our eyes, and our senses, and respecting our intelligence, as kids and adults.Now, which version I prefer? 2005 or 1971? Well, let's just say I still prefer the book.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

Charlie's life is a joke on ""Oliver Twist""--a childish notion of poverty, with Charlie being the literal bread winner, when he brings a loaf home to add a more substantial meal to their usual cabbage soup, for a family that includes four grandparents all bedridden to the same bed the past twenty years. The other golden-ticket winners, too, reflect a world controlled by children. Consequently, the most important things in life become candy, gum and TV, and success comes from wanting and demanding things more. Likewise, we see a chocolate factory as a child might imagine it. It's a world of confusion and nonsense, alternately whimsical and menacing, that revolves around sugar and the boob tube. And, I suggest the parody is duplicitous, because this very film is akin to a sugar high--a piece of appealing-looking confection that's ultimately quite saccharine and owes much of its success to appearances on television (or, nowadays, streaming, as I viewed this on Netflix, with the option to munch on snacks infused with corn syrup... boy, how things have hardly changed).Although quite amusing at times--the repetitive coverage by the news anchors is especially so methinks (as one of them states in between their obsession with the golden tickets, ""We must remember there are many more important things--many more important things. Offhand, I can't think of what they are, but I'm sure there must be something.), I don't think there's much more to it than that. None of it has the bite of satire. It isn't as clever as Lewis Carroll. Even the somewhat reflexive business with TV and ""Wonka-Vision"" or the tunnel sequence avoids a reading of any commentary even at level of ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939) on theatrically-released films such as this one. Moreover, while the film, fortunately, changed the book's original Pygmies to the fictional race of Oompa Loompas, an orange-faced cousin of Oz's Munchkins, it would seem, the film remains largely ethnocentric, including Western Europeans and Americans with their golden tickets that racial others may only hope to counterfeit. (At least, this version excised the episode--retained in Tim Burton's 2005 iteration--of the stereotypical Indian prince and his chocolate palace.) Indeed, some of the songs are catchy, it's quirky and fun, and Gene Wilder steals the show as the trickster Wizard to the Oz of his factory, despite not appearing until over 40 minutes in. In other words, it's candy: Wonka-Vision, which, in small doses at least, can be attractive and appealing.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

45,tomgillespie2002,A complete surprise,8,16 July 2013,"There have been many movie adaptations of the great Welsh children's author Roald Dahl, to various degrees of success. I used to love his books as a youth, relishing the dark twists and the playful, if somewhat dark, humour. Yet even the best adaptations didn't really capture the sinister themes behind the best of Dahl's works, but that was up until I saw this, Mel Stuart's adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, one of Dahl's most popular works. As well as being often psychedelic, it is Gene Wilder's wild yet subtle portrayal of the unpredictable and possibly quite evil Willy Wonka that truly captures Dahl's essence.Poverty-stricken Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) lives in a cramped house with his mother and the bed-ridden Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson). The news announces that the reclusive Willy Wonka of Wonka's chocolate company is offering a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for five lucky children to come and see his world-famous factory. Five golden tickets have been placed in Wonka Bars throughout the world, and Charlie, finding the fifth and final ticket, arrives with Grandpa Joe along with fellow winners Veruca Salt (Julie Dawn Cole), Violet Beauregarde (Denise Nickerson), Mike Teevee (Paris Themmen) and Augustus Gloop (Michael Bollner) to meet the eccentric inventor.This is one of those popular films that everyone had seemed to seen apart from me, so I was expecting a familiar family film full of catchy songs and annoying freckly kids. The songs, apart from the famous 'Pure Imagination', are somewhat forgettable, but I was surprised by the effective performance from the children, and the sheer darkness of the film. Apart from the various disappearances of the increasingly bratty, greedy and ungrateful children (who aren't actual seen again), the boat ride that Wonka takes his party on is particularly unnerving. There are bright, flashing lights, strange music, and various disturbing imagery (including a chicken being decapitated) that infest the screen, making me wonder if I was in fact watching a children's movie, or some f****d- up acid trip from the 70's.Gene Wilder has made many films that portray his energy and comedic ability that often borders on genius, but he blew me away as Wonka. From his entrance, shuffling along on his cane only to do a somersault in front of the awe-struck crowd, to his furious outburst at the climax, makes Wonka an almost threatening presence, never allowing us to feel completely comfortable when he's on screen. He's ultimately a misanthrope, with only a glimmer of hope that one of the children he's welcomed to his home is truly worthy of inheriting his life's work, using subtle glances or whispers of poetry to merely hint at his true personality. Along with the beautiful sets and solid supporting cast, Willy Wonka was a complete surprise, and surely the best Dahl adaptation that's yet to grace the screen.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
46,didi-5,Little purple men and lots of chocolate,5,4 January 2005,"'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory', about to be remade, seems ripe for reappraisal. Two schools of thought - one thinks this film is inventive, timeless, and worthy of a place in the best kids movies of all time; the other thinks it is embarrassing trash which didn't work and which should be ditched for a much better interpretation.For me, it falls somewhere between the two extremes of good and bad. There's no denying that Gene Wilder's performance is irritating, but isn't that what Willy Wonka was? The horrible kids are just that, and completely deserve their fates within the walls of his gloopy sugary factory. And Charlie is a cute little hero.Anthony Newley's songs may be an acquired taste but I bet you go away from this film humming 'The Candy Man' or the Oompa Loompa song. The story is a good one - a toffee treat with a lot of bite. Will the remake be any better? I doubt it.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
47,digitalbeachbum,"Classic, but filled with problems",6,8 June 2020,"This is one of my favorite movies, but it doesn't hold up overtime. There are continuity errors and character flaws through out the movie which as a nitpicker, I find it annoying to see them now. As a kid, I enjoyed the movie and it was fun, it still is fun too but in a different light.I find this movie better than the 2005 remake, because of Gene Wilder. I also find they have more beef to the script along with less CGFX which was needed in the 2005 script. My understanding is that this version was not supported by the family which is why it is called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory vs Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.I enjoy the effort of the production team to build the sets for this movie and I enjoyed the Oompa Loompas more. The 2005 version is sort of cool, but using the dwarf extras is far better than using the CG versions of just one actor.I also like how the movie feels more like a Roald Dahl book. The 2005 movie looses that in all the technology even though it is more details from the book.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
48,Anonymous_Maxine,Timeless.,10,30 September 2001,"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a truly magnificent piece of filmmaking and remains one of the most fascinating and wonderful adventure films ever made. One of the things that makes this film so intriguing is that it could have been made at any time. I mean, just from watching it, you can't really tell when it was made. It has been one of my favorite films for almost 20 years now, and it wasn't until today that I actually realized when it was made. Watching it again last night, I had convinced myself that it was made sometime in the early to mid 80s, and I was shocked to find out that this year is the movie's 30 year anniversary. Until now, pretty much the only movie I associate with 1971 is A Clockwork Orange, and it's just strange for some reason to find out that this classic movie was made so long ago.At any rate, Willy Wonka is a tremendously imaginative and inspiring film. It's a family film, but one of the most important aspects of a family film is that it has to be enjoyable for a variety of ages. This is what makes movies like Toy Story and Shrek such huge successes- the adults will love it just as much as the kids are sure to. Hence: `family' film. On the other hand, this is also the downfall of such other movies that are strictly for a much younger audience, like Cats & Dogs. The makers of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory understood this very well, and you can see that just by the way that the cast is divided. Here are all of these kids (funny how it was only kids who found those golden tickets) who were at this candy factory, and they had each elected to bring one of their parents with them as the one admissible member of their family who was allowed by Wonka to accompany them to the factory. One of the best elements of this film is the excellently written script and, even more, the songs. These are some of the best songs in any movie ever made, rivaling even the best of the songs from Disney's films (hey, some of them are really good). There are, of course, some exceptions, such as `Cheer up, Charlie,' which I have been fast-forwarding through for as long as I can remember, but for the most part, the songs are fun to listen to and they pertain to life outside the movie. They are not just songs about the candy-making genius of Willy Wonka or the excitement of being able to tour his mysterious factory, but they are about life in the real world. They're about believing in yourself and being motivated in life (`Anything you want to, do it. Want to change the world, there's nothing to it'), but there are also some that have to do mostly with the movie but are still just as enjoyable, such as the classic song that Wonka sings in the tunnel on board his boat (curiously named `Wonkatania'), which was creepily covered by Marilyn Manson a couple of decades later. The dialogue in the film contains some of the most interesting little tidbits in the entire movie. Wonka's lines, in particular, are wonderfully strange and amusing (`A little nonsense now and then is cherished by the wisest men.'). He is a truly eccentric and fascinating man, and Gene Wilder captures the character flawlessly, as he delivers the lines from the brilliantly written script. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is one of those rare movies that comes along and completely changes the way that fantasy films are made. It's all about having fun in life and being hopeful against all odds and, most of all, being able to have fun in life. There are times when you have to let things go for a while and just act like a kid. Eat candy, run around and play, steal fizzy lifting drinks and bump into the ceiling that now has to be washed and sterilized, it doesn't matter as long as no one's looking. That's such a trivial little quirk of Wonka's (who sterilizes their ceiling?) that it becomes obvious that the movie is trying to say that it's okay to break the rules every once in a while. Have fun in life. Besides being absolutely mouth-watering (to this day, I still fantasize about sinking my teeth into one of those gigantic gummy bears), the movie is an uplifting adventure that warms the heart and sends people of all ages away with fairy tale candies dancing in their heads and wonderful songs just behind their lips. It is an always-welcome vacation from reality for people of all ages, and it should always be remembered and loved for that. This movie will ALWAYS be a must-see.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

52,hellraiser7,Candy Land,10,23 December 2015,"Roald Dahl is one of my favorite fantasy writers because what I loved about his stories was how he brought fairy tales to our modern era and existence, which to me showed that fantasy stories don't have to just be confined to the medieval era but can be in our time frame. Which also further show that in the fantasy genre anything truly is possible and anything can go. This film is another one of my favorite fantasy films of all time and it's also another childhood relic, I've seen this film when I was about seven.I really love the production value, everything is practical they successfully create a great look of the factory, the factory is sort of like the Tardis in ""Doctor Who"" it's literally a hidden world where you see all sorts of things from the Candy Land which as a kid I wanted to go to because I wanted to chomp on most of that candy. Down to the machines that look like something out of Rub Goldburg cartoons, my favorite machine is that gum machine, which is strange from what it has like crushing tomatoes and a bee hive. The writing is excellent, the dialog is just clever and at times really funny, there are so many memorable lines that it would take more than one watch to hear and get them all.Though like in Brothers Grimm fashion the film can also be kinda dark and a bit scary. From each of the life and death situations the kids stupidly get themselves into. Down to that infamous boat ride from hell scene, that scene is one of the most bizarre and scariest scene I've ever seen really scared me when I was a kid. It's like some trippy experimental film that some doped up film student cooked up as you are just seeing random nasty images.The music is great as there are plenty of memorable songs. Two of my favorites are of course Pure Imagination sung beautifully by Gene Wilder. And my second one is ""I Want it Now"", that song is just fun and really hilarious as the song is the expression of the epitome of Veruka's greed and vanity.The characters are great, really like protagonist Charlie whom is the everyday kid you've probably passed by or were. He's good natured, never selfish he's selfless as he loves his family and does his best to help them out. He's sympathetic as he really has not much to anything going for his life. I wouldn't say he's so much a kid with dreams but more like a kid whom is looking for something great in life, a chance to taste it may'be be part of it.I really like how you see a parallel contrast between him and the rest of the kids in the group. All of the other kids have been in rich or high class existences which means they had practically every advantage in life but as we see have turned out kinda rotten. Where we see Charlie he's lived on the low end of things but he turned out to be alright as he's smart and kind. It just shows that just because you grew up on the wrong side of the tracks doesn't mean a person will turn out bad; and just because someone grew up on the right side doesn't always mean they'll be good.Veruka Salt she is a kid you just love to dislike. To me she is just the absolute worst of the bunch because she is just spoiled rotten to the core. Her constant bad case of the gimmies can make you both laugh and grown at the same time. But seeing her just goes to show that giving your kid everything he or she asks for is bad parenting at best because your teaching your kid a bad lesson that they get everything handed to them. As Lincoln Hawk once said ""Life don't go one way for nobody"", Veruka is going to learn that saying the hard way.And of course my favorite character is Willy Wonka played by one of my favorite comedic actors Gene Wilder. This is my favorite role from him, he has some of the best lines ever but he just has just this great amount of energy both physically and comedically, to me Gene really is Willy Wonka. In a way he's kinda like ""Doctor Who"" as his character has this three dimensional enigmatic quality to him. At times he can be truthful but then he's not, he can also flip on his persona. There's a bit of a good back and forth between both Charlie and him, it's almost a father and son like dynamic as Willy fills in that father figure role that Charlie is sorely missing.One of my favorite moments with Willy is the cream room where it's literally both verbal and visual humor at work. As he is just saying something and then putting his play on words to practice, when he puts some random things in each cream mixture. I always wonder what else does he put into the mixtures.And of course like with most fairy tales this film has a sense of morality, there are a lot of underlying messages without being preachy or heavy handed. Like how it's OK for kids to indulge in the sweets of life but it's more important they get what they need in order to grow healthy and happy. But also about bad parenting, why we need to be better teachers for kids, teach them and give them what's more important in life, to not spoil and indulge them all the time which is practically the equivalent of giving them nothing.This fantasy is full of rich goodness.Rating: 4 stars",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
53,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,17 February 2020,"Yeah, it's a lot better than the Johnny Depp version isn't it? Probably because this one is fun and entertaining and the Depp one was was a Tim Burton film and felt kind of pretentious didn't it?Clearly this version doesn't look as visually pleasing, but it makes up for that in earnest heart, a few good tunes, and a titular character that is always delightfully entertaining to watch.Gene Wilder really sells it without being creepy doesn't he? And the first time you watch it you don't think about it... but it's a really thin line he had to walk to come across as not creepy and still be eccentric and fun and he pulled it off in spades.I didn't really think about it as a kid, but as an adult (especially with Burton's) it's one of those things where Wilder should have won an Oscar. It was Academy Award worthy and the film was made in '71 where the Academy Awards still meant something.Gene's devastatingly on target performance aside, this is just a fun film that the family deserves to see and it certainly needs to be lauded over the remake.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
54,freemantle_uk,Fun Family Film,8,19 July 2008,"Looking for a fun film for all the family with nice song? Then this is a good choice. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is based on the Roald Dahl children's story Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The basic story is Willy Wonka has placed five Golden Ticket in his chocolate bars and five lucky children will get a free tour and a life time's supply of chocolate. Charlie is a poor English boy who lived in a small house with his mum and grandparents. He is also a very unselfish child who works as a paper boy and uses his money to help his family. Charlie also wants to be one of the children who get one of the golden tickets. Charlie gets lucky and finds one of the tickets and get to go to the factory. The four other children who find tickets are Augustus Gloop, a very greedy German child, Veruca Salt, a very solid English child, Violet Beauregarde, a self-obsessed American and Mike Teavee a TV-obsessed American child. When all the characters get to the Chocolate factory they find a surreal place which offers the children everything they could want, but one by one all of them get weeded out because of their selfishness. The whole point of Willy Wonka is that it's a morality tale about being good and avoid being selfish.This film has some nice little songs; the ones that I think our best are 'A World of Pure Imagination' and 'I Want it Now'. I feel that the mood is just right and go for children of all ages. It is more lighter then the Tim Burton version which I think is better. The Oompa-Loompa are also great in the film and you can't help by like them. They have been parodied in a number of times, including in the Simpsons, Futurama and Family Guy. I think that they are a lot better in this version then the Burton version. Gene Wilder was also perfectly casted as Willy Wonka, getting the role just right and I think his version is better then Johnny Deep's.All in all Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a nice little film for all the family which shows it classes by being parodied.

56,ackstasis,"""There is no life I know to compare with pure imagination.""",8,10 November 2007,"In my younger years, I was one of the millions of children who would settle down in front of the television on a quiet Saturday evening and descend into the magical world of Willy Wonka and his chocolate factory. Not since 'The Wizard of Oz (1939)' has a film so perfectly captured the imaginations of adults and children alike, and I know I'm not the only one to have dreamed of visiting this world of edible landscapes, wacky contraptions and surprises around every corner. Tonight I watched 'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (1971)' for the first time in a number of years, and I found it even better than I had remembered. Despite having seen the film more than a few times, I was once again drawn into its colourful world of sugary imagination; it was as though I was seeing it again for the first time. This is the mark of a true family classic.Young Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) is the film's main protagonist, an honest and hand-working boy from a poverty-stricken family. Whereas other children are waste their money buying chocolates, Charlie dedicates his meager newspaper-delivery wages towards providing bread for his overworked mother (Diana Sowle) and four bed-ridden grandparents. However, one day there is an announcement that sends the world population into a frenzy: the reclusive but brilliant chocolate-maker Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) has hidden golden tickets in five bars of his product, and the lucky winners will be treated to a tour of his magical factory, as well as the grand prize of a lifetime's supply of chocolate! One by one, the tickets are discovered by a selection of disagreeable children, but the fifth winner may well be the most deserving young boy of all. The film was adapted from the story ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" by British author Roald Dahl, who was famously furious about the alterations made by screenwriter David Seltzer.When Charlie and his Grandpa Joe (played with warmth by Jack Albertson) arrive at the chocolate factory to attend their tour, the real fun starts. Willy Wonka is the most fascinating of film characters, completely unpredictable from the outset. Emerging for the first time, cane in hand, the seemingly frail Wonka limps painfully towards the waiting crowd before tumbling into a lively somersault. Once inside the factory, the eccentric genius can be funny, musical, sarcastic, rude and even a little sadistic, spouting off quotes from Shakespeare, O'Shaughnessy and Allingham as the naughty children around him systematically receive their comeuppance. The chocolate factory is operated by a race of little people known as Oompa Loompas, who celebrate the departure of each disobedient child by singing of the evils of being gluttonous, greedy, spoiled, or ill-behaved {these particular sequences are the only ones, I think, that have aged poorly over the last 35 years}.Despite a generally-positive critical reaction upon its release, 'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory' was a box-office failure, though time has allowed subsequent generations to discover the incalculable magic that the film holds. The musical numbers  ranging from ""The Candy Man"" to ""(I've Got a) Golden Ticket"" to ""Pure Imagination""  are all touching and joyous, and there is even a peculiar psychedelic boat ride that slips into the realm of surrealism. The visual effects are decidedly remarkable for the era, and I was particularly impressed with the Fizzy Lifting Drinks sequence, in which Charlie and Grandpa Joe become weightless and float perilously towards the fan spinning high above them; there is not a supporting wire to be seen. The film was nominated for a single Academy Award, for Best Music, but it's almost criminal that Harper Goff's art direction went unrewarded, despite Willy Wonka's chocolate factory being one of the most amazing film sets I've ever seen.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

Very much its own thing rather than a straight translation from page to screen but filled to the brim with neat images, whimsical humour, superb sets, awesome songs, pathos and a lot of disquieting moments.Seriously, a lot of people forget what nightmare fuel this is, not just for all the kids becoming unwittingly disfigured while the non-liable Wonka just looks on thoughtfully but for the lesson on morality never far beneath the surface, illustrated in song and dance.Charlie is a cherubic characters which things happen too rather than really doing much of his own volition but he is nonetheless a superb embodiment of goodness without making me hate him (which is hard to do). Which I guess plays into the movie's desperate moralizing.Of course it has the same story flaws as the book: too many coincidences and meaningful conflict ends really early in the picture.

If you're looking for something that echoes the dark wit of Roald Dahl's book, you should watch Tim Burton's ""remake"" of this film. If, on the other hand, are curious to find out why this 1971 outing is considered a cult movie, give it a try.The story is well known:five kids,including Charlie Bucket(Peter Ostrum) find the Golden Tickets and get to visit the local chocolate factory,where they will see weird inventions,the charming Oompa Loompas and,most of all,the man behind the whole thing,Willy Wonka(Gene Wilder).There are only two things both versions (Mel Stuart and Tim Burton's, that is) have in common:the Oompa Loompas singing after the bad kids are ""punished"",and,in a certain way,the opening sequence.Charlie's relationship with Grandpa Joe gets more attention than in the remake,while on the other hand there are more musical numbers,which actually are the one thing I don't like about the movie(people complained about them in Burton's version as well, but at least Danny Elfman's work had some appeal).They're beautifully choreographed,that's true,but the dull, obnoxious songs aren't exactly like in Disney films. In fact, they make the film more childish and less Dahl-likeWilder's Wonka, the best thing in the film, is sweet, funny, unpredictable, but still human, the exact opposite of Johnny Depp's crazy lone wolf.This movie is suitable for everybody, no matter the age(Burton's version isn't something 4-year olds should watch), and, despite a few differences between film and book, and the musical numbers,quite enjoyable.If,however,you're a purist,stick with Johnny Depp, but you have to admit Gene Wilder is great too.Sweet viewing,children (and grown-ups)...",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

Nevertheless, my objective opinion is that the first half (prior to Wonker's appearance) is the better piece of film making, but the second half contains the major star turn from the great Gene Wilder.Even though the first half is essentially one joke that keeps getting bigger and bigger with every scene, it made me want to see if Charlie's wish came true and also intrigued me to see the factory. The build up it gives to the long awaited first appearance of the title character is quite effective.The scenes in the factory are all about Wilder, who gives a typical wild-eyed, surreal performance. He has countless memorable lines that other reviewers quote off the top of their heads and he delivers them in a way that only he can. If you haven't seen it before, simply look at his eyes and the expressions on his face as he speaks. He has a rather calm madness that lurks beneath the surface and you feel it about to burst out at any moment.It all ends with an excellent reveal and a superb exchange between Wilder and Jack Albertson that for me was worth the wait.Call me a killjoy if you like, but I thought some of the child actors were quite poor by Hollywood standards. I personally found the musical numbers to be hit and miss. Some of the production design could have been a lot better when you consider how imaginative something like Wizard of Oz was back in 1939. The tunnel sequence in the chocolate river boat has aged badly. It's really a shame I never saw it as a child because I probably would have disregarded many of the above wearing nostalgic, rose tinted glasses and given it 10/10.Overall though I imagine when it was released it probably captured the imagination of children. My four year old daughter sat through it recently looking pretty captivated by it all, so that is definite plus point for me.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
62,yusufpiskin,I Miss Gene Wilder.,10,15 November 2020,"A childhood favorite. I'll never forgive Johnny Depp and all involved in that war crime of a remake.This is the first time I've rewatched this movie in nearly a decade, maybe more (and even longer since I've read the book). I had completely forgotten about most of the scenes prior to Charlie finding the ticket. I'm sure as a kid, I probably found these scenes really boring, but now as an adult I have a whole new appreciation for them. So many clever and funny moments that went over my head as a child.Everything else that I do remember is just as good if not better, including the Pure Imagination scene, which (as a fat kid) is one of my favorite of all time.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
63,barnabyrudge,One of my all-time favourites.,10,25 March 2004,"Surprisingly, Roald Dahl (author of Charlie & The Chocolate Factory, on which this film is based) reportedly hated this big screen version of his book. There's no denying that the book is sheer genius, but in all honesty this film adaptation is exceptionally well made too. In fact, it comes high up on my list of all-time movie favourites.The Wonka Chocolate Factory is an amazing building from which some of the most scrumdiddlyumptious sweets are delivered to the world's candy stores. Wonka-mania hits the world when five golden tickets are hidden inside packs of Wonka bars - for the winners will be granted a tour of the top-secret factory. Young Charlie Bucket, a poor boy whose family cottage lies within sight of Wonka's factory, dreams of becoming a winner - but with barely a penny to his name, does he have a chance?What makes Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory such a success is the way it skillfully blends entertainment and a serious underlying moral. Each winning child is exposed as being rotten-to-the-core, then dealt with harshly and dismissively by Wonka. Seeing these awful brats get their come-uppance is hilarious, enjoyable and - on a serious level - quite eye-opening (it's as if parents in the audience are being told how to prevent their children from turning bad). Gene Wilder was simply born to play Wonka (every eccentric phrase, every bemused expression, and every mischievous glance is judged to perfection). The film's set design is fabulous, with particular high-spots including the chocolate room, the egg room and the wacky corridor which gets smaller and narrower the closer you get to the end. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is simply magic - a film that everyone must see, especially parents whose kids are just becoming that bit too big for their boots!",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
64,rooprect,"Cerebral, cynical, INSANE!",9,5 February 2006,"This movie is about as good as it gets, barring the tedious first 30 minutes before Gene Wilder comes on screen. But all the better, his entrance is perhaps the most memorable one in cinematic history (yes, better than Orson Welles in ""The Third Man"").Willie Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is NOT a kid's movie. It is saturated with literary allusions (Shakespeare galore), musical references (that was Mozart, not Rachmaninoff!) and a quirky sense of humour that only a mature audience will truly get. For that reason, I can understand why many of the kids today disparage this classic in light of the 2005 version with its CGI special effects and Johnny-the-hottie Depp. But for the purists who enjoy a good, powerful performance without the fluff, this is the film for you.What amazes me about this film is that it is really quite dark and cynical, despite its colorful and upbeat appearance. The candy man Willie Wonka is at times a malevolent and frightening presence with a jaded, almost hopeless view of life. But despite it all, he makes us laugh uncontrollably and sing along and revisit our childhood as only an madman can. Whether this was in the original screenplay or whether it was Gene Wilder's own tinting I don't know, although I suspect the latter. For that reason I'm sure it deviates significantly from the theme of the original children's book. But I wouldn't have it any other way.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
65,Kdosda_Hegen,A very heartwarming film.,8,3 July 2021,"I have seen the remake ages before, and I must say that I do think that the remake does a few things better than this. As for the things that the remake did better, I like the scene in which Charlie insists to share the chocolate because it's his birthday so he can do whatever he wants to, I like the grandpa dance scene better, I like the family backstory with dad losing his job and grandpa being an ex-worker in the factory, I like the dark backstory of Willy Wonka and I guess I like the spoiled kids a lot more in the remake as they felt a bit more realistic and not over-the-top overly-stereotypical as in the original. But even with all these things, the original is still highly superior.I must say that I have a few problems with this film, one being that what the hell was wrong with the beginning. The family barely has any money and the old man wants to quit smoking to save money and lead a healthier lifestyle, yet the family insists on him to keep smoking... Also, I can't believe that Charlie and his grandpa broke the rules during one part of the film especially when before they despited others breaking the rules. Also, the fat kid is not fat enough haha. But that's all I have for the flaws of this otherwise magical film.But now to the good parts. This film has some of the most charming and heartwarming sets I've ever seen, so much colour and so cute. The songs are very good, they're memorable and iconic. Most of the dialogues are very smart, two-sided and meaningful. Humor is truly ahead of its time, still holds up as if the jokes were made today. Acting is phenomenal, especially by Gene Wilder. But most importantly watching it with the theory of Willy Wonka being a serial killer makes this truly an original and thought-provoking film and it seems that all checks out perfectly. All in all I truly enjoyed this magical film.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

67,gcd70,Delight for children and the young at heart,7,1 January 2008,"Roald Dahl's magical children's book ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is brought wonderfully to life here in Mel Stuart's 1971 comedy-musical. The production wisely makes use of a screenplay adaptation from the author himself, ensuring the tale loses very little of its enchantment in transferring to the silver screen. Casting is indeed very astute, with all the players impressing, especially a young looking Gene Wilder as Wonka.Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley have written some very catchy tunes for the film's musical numbers, ""Candy Man"" and ""Imagination"" being two of the highlights, and Art Director Harper Goff gives the film an extravagant look.A most enjoyable fantasy about a young boy's dream come true, with some telling messages about gluttony, television, spoiled children and chewing gum, all delightfully delivered by the midget like Oompa Lumpas.

69,vertigo_14,"If this movie sucks, then I'm a vernicious canid. (spoilers)",10,3 April 2005,"'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory' has withstood the test of time. And though quite dated, it is still a widely enjoyed film (with good reason!). This movie had a magnificent performance by Gene Wilder as Wonka, a wonderful story and great art direction for its day as they brought all of the awesome things at the Wonka factory to life (how cool it would be if you could actually go to a place like that), to being a superb musical.The story is that of a famed chocolate manufacturer, Willy Wonka, who's factory is a magical secret that was shut down when competing candy companies kept trying to infiltrate the factory with their spies who wanted hold of the ingredients that made Wonka's candy the most novel and ultimately, the most novel. Of course, Wonka has a change of heart, and decides to hold a contest whereby the people who can find one of the five golden tickets randomly (maybe, all of the winners were conveniently children, four of which had horrible manners) in Wonka candy. It could be anywhere. One by one, it seems that the tickets are being found, particularly by obnoxious kids who are all about the same age. (Veruca Salt, the most horrid and funniest of them all, would later inspire a late 90s alternative band). The selfish British brat, the slothy German boy, the record gumchewer with the sleazy car salesman father, and the boy who lives in front of the television. And there's only one ticket left. Meanwhile, a pathetic, depressed little boy named Charlie Bucket wants nothing more than to get hold of one of those tickets and witness the magic of the Wonka factory. Well, cheer up Charlie, because its about to happen.The trip in Wonka is more than just an invitation for unrivaled fun, however. It is a test. One of Wonka's rivals known as Slugworth, has promised a valuable sum to each of the children who steal from Wonka one of his newest inventions -- an Everlasting Gobstopper-- so that his company might steal the ingredients. Will all remain loyal to Slugworth? This is one of Gene Wilder's best performances, perfectly making the Wonka character his own. This was also the movie that introduced to the world the cautionary cult favorite midgets known as the Oompa Loompas, slaves who were rescued by Wonka to...well serve as his slaves. And, serving as a brief psychedelic inject into the events in the factory, make the lessons learned more obvious than they could have already been. Charlie Bucket's character, however, could not be written to be more pathetic, as though the filmmakers were absolutely sure that this was the kid you had the most sympathy for. From the mother working in the laundry hand-washing clothes, to the bare one room house and the enormous bed shared by all of the grandparents with counterpart names, to Charlie's constantly furrowed brow and curled lip. But, aside from this minor flaw, the movie has so many memorable things about it. I particularly like the Dr. Suess-esque setting. I can see why Tim Burton might be asked to be the next to recreate the story of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, as the original looked like his style to begin with (like the foamy float machine or the bizarre sequence where Wonka appears to go momentarily mad). Nonetheless, may the legacy of the first live on for years to come. It is still one of the greatest family films ever made.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
70,Spleen,"Good dark chocolate, but no Lindt",6,25 June 2001,"This is not a musical.  Every so often a character will start singing, but this is because (a) the film falsely believes that it's a musical, and (b) it's worried that its musical guild membership will lapse if too many consecutive minutes pass without a song.  Admittedly, the Oompa-Loompa song isn't, and arguably contributes something; it would contribute more if it were the ONLY song, and thus evidence of how unusual and surreal the chocolate factory is, but since so many people sing such weak songs elsewhere in the film the effect is lost.  (And isn't ""Cheer Up, Charlie"" DIRE?)I can't believe that there are people who think this enjoyable concoction is too dark.  Too dark for children to enjoy?  Who cares.  Too dark to be any good?  You can't be serious.  It's several tones lighter than ""Citizen Kane"", itself not a particularly grim movie, so stop complaining.  We're even told that the four nasty children emerged from their ordeal unscathed, which was an aesthetic mistake - we ought to have been left in doubt, with a strong reason to believe that one or two of them had perished or at least been permanently injured.  What's the point of introducing us to the perilous side of the chocolate factory if all the perils turn out to be harmless?  When Veruca was sent down the garbage chute, we took pleasure in this because we thought there was a very real chance she would be killed - and then we felt guilty about our pleasure, so Willy Wonka tells us at the end that nothing really happened, which enables us, so the theory goes, to have our cake and eat it.One more complaint: there's a failure of surrealist imagination inside the chocolate factory.  It isn't THAT marvellous a place, and we don't really see how Willy Wonka manages to produce the best chocolate in the world - in fact, between you and me, I don't believe he does.  But this is a letdown largely because the long lead-up is so good.  It's hard to know what to make of a film so uneven.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

72,screenman,Sorry Spanner In The Saccharine Works,5,5 April 2011,"Well, I'm clearly out of kilter with the public mood on this one.I thought WWATCC was the most boring kids' movie I've ever seen. It was slow, patronising and contrived from the outset. Unfortunately; if you'd read the book, you knew pretty well what was coming next. And the trouble then was that the sets and props never lived up to the imagination.Tempo inside the choc-works didn't improve. The 'Oompa Loompa' song just about saw me dozing off. As to Gene Wilder's Wonka; I couldn't mesh with him at all, not even as a fantasy character. His mood-swings were actually a wee bit scary. And when he was being meaningfully nice, it really made me rather cringe. Much too sweet for my tastes. The sets were as colourful as a kids' fantasy movie could be, but they never stopped looking cheap and stagy. The dialogue was trite, the surprises unsurprising. Frankly; I think 5 stars is a generous award.The ancient 'Wizard Of Oz' could kick this into a sweet-vat with a glass slipper. It is superior by any evaluation. At first, I thought this was because I'm not a Wilder fan, but there's been a recent remake employing Johnny Depp in the Willy Wonka role. Sadly, that one didn't do anything for me either.I dunno; everyone seems to love it but me. I'm an outcast and a pariah.

74,mike48128,A children's classic with a few strange and scary twists,10,17 August 2012,"It started out as an infomercial, as Quaker Oats wanted to launch a new ""Willy Wonka"" chocolate bar, which ironically failed. It melted too easily when shipping it to stores! It was produced by a man better known for his low-budget documentaries than movies (David Wolper). That being said, there is very much to like and dislike about this ""children's classic movie."" It is badly edited for pacing as the first half of it (finding the Golden Tickets) drags on forever. It is not until half-way through that we finally get to the wondrous factory where the second-half is almost ""golden""--with a few flaws. The movie was obviously filmed in a foreign country. I always thought it was England, but I believe it was Germany! Flaws: 1. The ""chopped chicken head"" doesn't belong here even though it is in a nightmarish tunnel scene, along with snakes. Luckily, my kids never ever noticed it, but I always knew it was there. 2. There is a cruel-edge to what becomes of the gum-chewing, TV watching, gluttonous and spoiled children-but no one actually dies. (Whew!) The indoor candy factory sets are wonderful and the glass ""Wonkavator"" flight ultimately saves the film. 3. Not at all true to Roald Dahl's book, but most adaptations are not, even The Wizard of Oz! 4. Gene Wilder plays Willy Wonka in a rather strange and peculiar way. He shouts too much at Charley while telling him that he loses the contest after tasting ""fizzy-lifting"" drinks, as the bubble chamber needs to be re-sterilized. Most of the songs are pretty good. I actually like ""Come with Me to a World of Pure Imagination"" better than ""Candy Man"". Brilliant songs co-written by Leslie Bricusse (""Oliver"").

75,LeonardKniffel,Thoroughly Entertaining without Sentimentality,9,29 April 2020,"What I've always loved about Roald Dahl's children's books is that he has no patience with brats; they always get their comeuppance. Dahl wrote the screenplay for the film, the title of which was changed from ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" to satisfy an ill-fated marketing campaign for a new chocolate bar. At any rate, the music and dancing all revolve around one poor little Charlie Bucket (played by Peter Ostrum, who appeared in one movie and went on to become a veterinarian), who wins an opportunity to tour the most eccentric and wonderful candy factory of all, led by Gene Wilder in one of his best film roles. Memorable songs to listen for include ""The Candy Man,"" ""Pure Imagination,"" ""Oompa-Loompa-Doompa-De-Do,"" and ""I Want It Now!"" sung with unabashed brattiness by Julie Dawn Cole. The film was remade in 2005 with Johnny Depp in the lead and retitled ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" like the original book. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
76,MartianOctocretr5,One of the best children's movies ever,9,6 May 2006,"Roald Dahl's classic children's book translates well to the screen, due to a strong cast and clever screenplay adaptation.Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) is the greatest candy maker of all time, but he and his candy making operations are shrouded in mystery. Legends about what happens behind the always-locked gates of his factory abound. One day, to everyone's delight, he issues five tickets, hidden in candy wrappers, for a personally guided tour of the factory and ""a lifetime supply of chocolate."" The early part of the movie, dealing with the world wide scramble for the tickets, is inspired and hilarious. The main characters, a group of children, are introduced one at a time this way. Charly Bucket (Peter Ostrum) is a poor kid who desperately wants to meet Wonka, but despairs more with the news of each found ticket. He's the underdog for the audience to identify with and root for, and you do.The tour of the factory takes up the second half of the story, and provides plenty of laughs and surprise action. Wilder's performance as the colorful and eccentric Wonka is brilliant. He formulates the character to be both scary and funny. The movie benefits from a great assembly of child actors also; each one brought out the spirit and flaws of their characters well. There were also some recognizable faces among the parents who escorted them; notably Nora Denney and Jack Albertson who were great in their supporting roles. You can see why the kids act as they do, as the adults' personalities mirror the children's.You will also meet Wonka's helpers: the Oompa Loompas. They were a great addition, and served a variety of purposes in the story. Their songs were clever, fit the plot, great to sing along to, and just plain fun.It's one of the great children's' movies ever, that has enough going on to engage the interest of adults which makes for fun family viewing. It provides some clever insights about child/parent relationships as well, without bashing you over the head. A true must-see.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
77,sme_no_densetsu,"""A little nonsense now and then is relished by the wisest men.""",8,21 March 2010,"""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" was only a modest success at the time of its release but it has since gained cult status through years of TV broadcasts and home video sales. Tim Burton's 2005 remake (titled ""Charlie & the Chocolate Factory"", like the book) revisited the source material but I feel that the 1971 adaptation is still the best.Roald Dahl adapted his own novel here and the script also received uncredited work by David Seltzer (best known for ""The Omen""). The resulting product is highly imaginative and also shows a slight touch of the darker side of the screenwriters. As a result, the story has the distinct feel of a cautionary tale.The acting is generally good. Gene Wilder gave what is by far the film's best performance in his role as eccentric candy-maker Willy Wonka. Past Oscar winner Jack Albertson lent the film some further credibility. The children's performances are generally good, with some better than others. The remainder of the supporting cast is made up of unfamiliar faces who nevertheless perform admirably.The direction by Mel Stuart isn't particularly impressive but the colourful production design makes up for any deficiencies there. Some of the special effects are a bit crude by today's standards but they get the job done. The film's original songs are all memorable, save for ""Cheer Up, Charlie"", which I suspect few would miss. The film's score was deservedly nominated for an Oscar (the film's only nomination).In my opinion, ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" is a family film that holds appeal for old and young alike. Wilder's Wonka is iconic and the story's deft use of 'pure imagination' makes for an enjoyable ride.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
78,pyrocitor,Confection perfection,9,2 September 2016,"Gaging audience and critical reactions to cinematic adaptations by beloved children's author Roald Dahl feels somewhat like running a Goldilocks gauntlet: too sweet (The BFG), too sour (The Witches), or too Wes Anderson* (Fantastic Mr. Fox)? That said, if there's any offering that feels 'just right,' it's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Contrary to Dahl's own vitriol towards the film for its plot tweaking, it's impossible to envision a film which better captures his whimsical, contradictory, heart-melting madness. Rightly heralded as one of the most beloved kids' films of all time, Wonka proves as timeless as it is lovely, and a surprisingly tender celebration of whimsy and appreciating magnificent things. All of the best Dahl sort into either scathing satire of the misdeeds of awful adults, or dreamy love-letters to the powers of fantasy and imagination. Wonka brings the best of both in spades. Cheerfully echoing The Wizard of Oz's 'real world/fantasy escape' divide, director Mel Stuart opts for stylized zaniness in his depiction of protagonist Charlie's pre-factory life, but only to draw out the oppressive nonsensical iniquities and dullness therein. Charlie's 'real life' is beset by gawking, bedridden grandparents with matching names, or jeering, power-tripping buffoons like his science teacher. Here, the only breaks seem to come to the most atrocious Veruca Salts of the world, who belligerently bludgeon the system into working for them. Stuart's East German village setting feels perfectly stuffy and quaint but subtly picturesque throughout. Even the sole bright spot, Charlie's mother singing ""Cheer Up, Charlie,"" is muted by her quaver of deep-seated hopelessness throughout.Which, as you'd imagine, only makes Charlie's miraculous discovery of a Wonka ticket all the more infectiously rousing. Dahl's central theme here - ""If you're very, very good, good things will come to you"" - may verge on misleadingly naïve populism, but it's quintessential children's movie moralism, and Peter Ostrum's Charlie is so gosh- darn adorable that you practically draw blood clenching your fists willing him to find his ticket. He's perfect casting: bright-eyed, soft-spoken, and practically vibrating with shy excitement, and even his occasionally flat acting feeds into his bashful earnestness. More importantly, rather than caving to the kind of saccharine sanctimoniousness that drenches most comparable 'good boy' performances, Ostrum plays Charlie with temperamentality and sometimes fickleness of a kid. It makes sharing his journey into the Chocolate Factory all the more intoxicating when we're able to drink in just how important it is for this adorable fellow. Wonka's eponymous factory is a key example of the film showing its age in the best possible sense. Come 2005, in the hands of Tim Burton's deliriously redundant remake, Wonka's workplace became a squelch of muddy CGI, like an overturned paint easel onto a sand castle. Here, the factory, built entirely with practical sets and props, feels euphorically tangible - half the magic of the peerless ""Pure Imagination"" sequence is watching the kids let loose on a field of tactile confections, smashing and chewing and slurping away in the most gleefully vicarious way. It's still a masterclass of set design - a kaleidoscope of colourful, almost Seussian calibre of zany inventiveness, yet uncluttered enough to drink in the richness of detail (even if the chocolate river itself looks more sickly than delicious). If anything, the only complaints are that the episodic string of wonders can start to dry up somewhat after starting with the mesmerizing spectacle of the chocolate room (by the time we arrive at the Wonkavision room, we've indisputably lost some momentum), and the surreal, curiously extraneous interlude of the psychedelic river ride is the stuff of immediate nightmares in an otherwise thoroughly kids-friendly film. Otherwise, Dahl's vicious sense of humour slathering on a vicious moral code by systematically pushing the delightfully awful kids for their transgressions, punctuated by delightfully admonishing Oompa Loompa musical numbers, sustains the magic, but perfectly grounds it from becoming too frilly. And fear not - there's always the subtlest of details - a musical lock here, an edible teacup there - to keep the imagination pure. Still, there's no denying that Gene Wilder is the almost singlehanded reason the movie has reached such timeless, beloved status. From his unforgettable hobbling-turned- tumbling entrance onwards, Wilder's Wonka is such a painstakingly realized rendition of an eccentric genius, that it's almost palpable how engrossing it is watching him, knowing how quickly he can turn on a dime from dreamy to apoplectic. Lilting, light- as-a-feather physicality aside, Wilder does more with a twitch of his eyes and slight break in his voice when reciting any number of calculatedly nonsensical magpied quotations than other actors could do with a soliloquy. Watching him nearly tear up as he shyly fawns over how much he hopes the children enjoy the factory, to later murmuring ""No. Please. Stop."" with side-splitting indifference as the children successively succumb to temptation and horrible consequences, Wilder's perfect cocktail of offbeat hilarity has never been put to better use, while the subtle touches of mad genius he sprinkles in throughout make it the performance of a lifetime. Supporting him, Jack Albertson's Grandpa Joe heralds the perfect dose of rustic belligerence and galvanizing gumption, while Julie Dawn Cole, Denise Nickerson, Paris Themmen, and Michael Bollner are all deliciously awful, and one of the strongest ensembles of child actors ever seen. The occasional pacing flub and a somewhat jarringly jubilant resolution are but the slightest drops, but they do little to affect the overall scrumdiddlyumptious aftertaste. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is beautiful, wistful, wacky, snarky, one of the best escapist children's parables outside of Harry Potter, and debatably the best cinematic Dahl to date. Want to change your world? As Wonka croons, ""there's nothing to it."" RIP Mr. Wilder, and thanks for the smiles. -9.5/10 *I lied. Obviously, I love Wes Anderson and Fantastic Mr. Fox.

It's unfortunate that what precipitated this was the passing of its star, Gene Wilder, but it was certainly worth the time and money. He exudes charisma and charm seasoned with humor in every scene that he appears. The songs were wonderful, and I found myself tearing up during 'Pure Imagination,' which becomes a sort of leitmotif for the film as a whole. Aside from Wilder, the performances from the rest of the cast were generally good, especially the children who felt like they leapt off the pages of the book. The visuals are bright, colorful and optimistic, occasionally trippy and surreal, befitting the source material. It was such a pleasure to take in. Although this was a spur-of-the-moment rental, this is one that will definitely find its way into my personal collection. WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY is a bonafide classic that I will be returning to again and again.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
83,jeremycrimsonfox,Beloved Classic Film,10,26 January 2020,"This is another classic film from my childhood. Adapted from the book ""Charlie & The Chocolate Factory"" by Ronald Dahl, this is a nice musical for its time, as it tells the tale of Charlie Bucket, who finds a golden ticket which invites him to tour the factory of Willy Wonka. Taking his Grandpa Joe, he is in for the adventure of a lifetime as the tour takes him and four other kids to some wacky and imaginative areas.Yeah, it is weird, but it a legendary film. However, Ronald Dahl would disown this due to the changes Warner Bros. would make to the story (resulting in the studio being banned from making a sequel). including making Slugworth a villain, and the many songs added in. IMHO, I prefer this over the 2005 remake (which was more accurate). The songs (especially the Oompa Loompa songs) are memorable, Gene Wilder does a good job as Willy Wonka, and when we get to the chocolate factory tour that makes up the second half of the film, a lot of the sets are well done (especially the chocolate room), proving that movies can be creative in a time without computer animation. I recommend this in anyone's film library.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
84,sharky_55,"Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker",7,19 July 2016,"The original children's novel by Roald Dahl was a story with good values and intentions; Charlie is the only one to not succumb to greed or vanity or disobedience like the rest of the bratty visitors, so at the end he is declared the winner of the competition and reaps the rewards. Simple enough. There is a different twist here - Charlie and his grandpa also disobey Wonka by taking a sip of Fizzy Lifting Drinks and very nearly meet their grisly fate too, and it is only by sheer luck that they escape this fact. This seems entirely unnecessary to me; it muddles Charlie and Grandpa Joe's characterisation to scold and disapprove of fat Augustus Gloop for not the following the rules and then hypocritically do so themselves. And better for Charlie to remain wholesome and pure because of his upbringing than to force a decision which does not seem fair for him to make. We do not know that Slugworth's offer is just a test, so it does not seem so dastardly to take the money and improve their lives.The film has its fair share of musical segments, some of which are more effective than others. It is a little too much to ask the elderly and youthful actors of the Bucket family to pour out their emotions in song; none of them are particularly good singers and lack the ability or charisma to fully emote through them. Gene Wilder does not have the same problem, and makes everything he touches a delight, from the whimsy and wonder of Pure Imagination, to his very first appearance, where he takes an eternity to hobble to the gate only to stumble with sleight of hand and pop up with a flourish. This was apparently Wilder's own idea; the effect has us questioning each part of Wonka's calculated performance, each absurd fact of his chocolate production, each half sinister joke of the children's demise and held syllable. The Oompa Loompa's bizarre accompaniment further muddle his intentions. What Mel Stuart does add from the novel is actually quite brilliant. He envisions a world so dominated by the quest for the golden tickets that the mania seeps everywhere into daily lives, with hilarious consequences. This is illustrated through several scenes in the guise of comedy sketches; professional psychiatry offices heeding the worlds of insanity, the media blustering all about, the British queen overbidding an auction for precious remaining Wonka bars, even a wife reconsidering the kidnapping of her husband. And there is the presence of Slugworth, like the grim reaper, instantly appearing behind the ears of each winner, tall and dressed in black. He beckons the eerie gates and estate of Wonka himself. And what is within is truly a marvel to behold. There would later be another flashy, garish remake of the same novel from none other than Tim Burton, and a freakishly impeccable Johnny Depp. But it does not match the charm of this.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
85,Beta_Gallinger,A superb family movie that's bound to leave viewers in a good mood!,9,18 April 2010,"This is the first of two big motion picture adaptations of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", one of Roald Dahl's popular children's books. I first saw it during my later childhood years in the late 90's, which was also when I read the book. This was before the second adaptation was made. I went to see that version on the big screen, and by then, it had been years since I had last seen this one, so I didn't know how they compared. It's been a few years since the release of that remake, and I don't think I've seen it since 2006, the year after its theatrical run, but I have finally seen the original ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" for the first time in probably over a decade. I still remembered it clearly, and was well aware of its reputation as a classic family movie, so I was expecting it to be great, and was not disappointed! Charlie Bucket is a poor young boy who lives in a shabby old house with his mother and four bedridden grandparents. His father has passed away. Charlie loves chocolate, but since his family is so poor, he doesn't get to eat it very often. There is a mysterious chocolate factory nearby, owned by a mysterious man named Willy Wonka, where very popular candy comes from. One day, it is announced that the factory owner has sent out five golden tickets, each of which could be found inside any Wonka bar wrapper anywhere in the world! Anyone who gets one of these tickets will win a tour of his factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate! The first four ticket finders are a German glutton named Augustus Gloop, a dreadfully spoiled English girl named Veruca Salt, an obsessive American gum chewer named Violet Beauregarde, and an American television addict named Mike Teevee. It seems all hope for Charlie getting one of these tickets is lost when news spreads that the fifth one has been found in Paraguay, but this turns out to be a fraud, and just after the boy learns that, he opens the wrapper of a Wonka bar he has purchased with money he found, and inside, finds the last golden ticket! However, on his way home to tell his family the good news, he is stopped by a sinister-looking man who says his name is Arthur Slugworth, the owner of a rival candy company who wants Charlie to bring him a sample of Wonka's Everlasting Gobstopper!I wasn't sure how entertaining it looked like this film was going to turn out to be right at the beginning, with the opening credits showing the process of chocolate making, and then showing a shopkeeper singing ""The Candy Man Can"" to kids in his candy shop, though this part certainly isn't bad. However, it quickly became very intriguing to me as we see Charlie's loving family for the first time, and basically stayed this way for the rest of the film! Maybe not every scene is that great, but most of them are, and it's a great story with well-crafted characters, including Charlie. They found a good child actor to play him, even though Peter Ostrum never appeared in any other films. Grandpa Joe is another one of these characters, played wonderfully here by Jack Albertson. These are both very likable characters, and their bond helps keep the film steady. The other four main child actors all do a good job as well, playing the poorly behaved kids. Gene Wilder's charming and often humorous portrayal of Willy Wonka is another highlight, and I think it's easy to agree with that! The filming locations in Munich, Germany and the sets made for the chocolate factory scenes are also elements that help make the movie so good. As a musical, the film doesn't overdo it with the songs, which are generally very good songs, even if they're not all equally great.Next year will mark forty years since the original release of this very famous ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" adaptation. And yet, it's still a very popular family movie now, which it certainly deserves to be! Many describe ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" as timeless, and I have to agree with that. Roald Dahl wrote the classic 1964 children's novel AND wrote the screenplay for this 1971 film adaptation, and he certainly did a great job helping to bring one of his imaginative stories to the screen! Director Mel Stuart, the very talented cast, and the rest of the crew obviously helped as well. There's really not much else I can say about this classic family film, and there's probably not a lot I've said about it which nobody else has at some point during the past 39 years. That would likely be the case with any classic movie like this. It's one of those films that can appeal to kids and adults alike, generation after generation!",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
86,Hollywood_Yoda,Great Family Film,9,29 September 2018,"After nearly fifty years, Willy Wonka still holds up as one of the most charming musical comedies. Released during a period of Disney musicals and an era of the Vietnam War (hence the title change, originally Charlie and the Chocolate Factory).Gene Wilder made it even more special. His portayal of choclatier Willy Wonka is one of his more memorable roles outside of a Mel Brooks film. Wilder was the best choice as Wonka, as I don't believe anyone could have played the part better (not even Johnny Depp). Wilder is probably the only person that audiences can name from the cast nowadays. The music was entertaining, and the Oompa Loompas were pretty funny. Willy Wonka is reminiscent of the days of The Wizard of Oz, the same sort of magic.As weird as some sequences we're at the time, it's definitely a better version than Tim Burton created. This version has been parodied so many times in other mediums, including cartoons, it will always be popular.The songs are especially great, and somewhat memorable. Especially the Oompa Loompa song. Even Wilder sings a song. It's great fun for the whole family.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
87,The_Movie_Cat,"""You look like you were born to be a Wonkarer""",7,25 July 2000,"So says Aubrey Woods as the world's most psychologically disturbing sweet shop owner.While Roald Dahl is renowned as a fine children's book writer, his screenplay abilities are often overlooked. Possibly the best - certainly one of the most underrated - James Bond films has his name as screenwriter, (You Only Live Twice) and this movie is equally delightful and grand in scale.
The first half of the film is a curiously old-fashioned, child-centred piece, where a whole nation of adults alter their lifestyles for a chance to win a ""Golden Ticket"". ""Class dismissed"" calls one teacher as he rushes out to buy a potentially winning chocolate bar. Another scene sees a bed-ridden cripple, perhaps slightly offensively, get out of bed and dance after winning a ticket. Good-natured yet packed with racial stereotypes (including greedy Germans, arrogant Americans and Charlie's grandparents who are, for some reason, Jewish) the film can be saccharine-coated but that is all saved by one man: Gene Wilder.Charlie, meanwhile, is the kind of selfless martyr that really deserves a slap, if only to dislodge his halo. (And he's a litter-dropper, too: look at the scene where he inevitably finds the final ticket. Come to that, he's a thief: he finds money yet doesn't hand it in to the police). Things notably improve in the second half, if only the quality of the songs. This is the half where we go from drab to ultra-imaginative, with Wilder's enigmatic  if disturbingly tactile  Wonka steals the film. His total sense of disattachment at the various downfalls of the children adds an interesting depth to the character; and a refreshing counterpoint to the somewhat self-righteous attitudes of Charlie, his grandfather and the Oompa-Loompas.Highlights of Wonka's chocolate factory include the ""Repulsion"" style coathangers, candy packed with gelagnite and a man-sized teleporting chocolate bar. For a film that's reaching its thirtieth anniversary these effects still stand up remarkably well. Best though is the social conscience. There's the odd nod towards war and ecology, but what about the Oompa-Loompa song  the best of six in the film  where they philosophise over what causes deviant behaviour in children? ""You know who's exactly to blame,"" they conclude, ""the mother and the father"".As with all works of Dahl, what really makes the film is his wonderful sense of almost malicious perversity. A dark, almost sadistic, air echoes just beneath the surface. Just one question though: has anyone ever got round to reading the sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator?",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
88,Ruskington,Epic performance from Gene Wilder,7,14 April 2020,"Despite being disowned by Roald Dahl, I would consider this movie a considerable success. This was an adaptation that would live or die on the casting of the lead role, and in Gene Wilder they couldn't have done much better. Wilder's perfect balance of eccentricity, humour and mystery elevates the film above and beyond gentle fiction and provides a very fitting dose of darkness.The rest of the cast is also pretty strong, particularly Julie Dawn Cole as the bratty Veruca Salt. Peter Ostrum looks and sounds just right as Charlie, although the character is somewhat overshadowed by Wilder's mesmerising Wonka. Paris Themman is quite poor as Mike Teevee but I would largely put that down to the character being so badly written by Dahl. I would have been perfectly happy for them to write Teevee out of the script completely.The music is a huge success, containing some iconic songs that are still fresh almost 50 years later. Leslie Bricusse deserves an awful lot of credit for what he did with this soundtrack. Pure Imagination is particularly beautiful and is probably my enduring memory of this movie.The major weak point of the film is how cheap some of it looks. The factory looks like just that- a factory. It has no magic, no beauty and no charm. The chocolate river looks like contaminated water and the 'TV particles' effect stands as one of the laziest pieces of CGI I've ever seen.There are also plenty of flaws in the story that bother me. It seems perfectly reasonable for the destitute Charlie to sell the everlasting gobstopper to Slugworth, and had he done so I don't think it would tarnish his character. On the flip side, the wealthy Veruca could have turned down the offer merely because the money wasn't meaningful enough for it to be worth effort. She'd still be a bad person either way. Wonka really should have considered this financial relativism before devising his bizarre inheritance plan. Also, what if only adults had won tickets? Or if all the children were non-English speaking? Besides this, most of the logistical flaws are Dahl's doing (seriously, a kid who lives a few hundred yards from the factory finds a Golden Ticket at the local shop?) and the writers can't do much about it.Despite a few flaws, this is a great family film with a captivating lead performance from Gene Wilder. It is certainly not as polished as Tim Burton's remake but it has an awful lot more charm and character.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

I have read several people critique this movie for being scary and showing kids getting hurt, but don't forget, those were nasty little monsters who got their ""just desserts."" Did you ever notice that Wonka knew specifically where to find traps for these kids. I especially got to feel for Veruca Salt [more the actress Julie Dawn Cole than the role]; I had such a crush on her when I was a kid because she was so cute. Today, I bet she's got to look like Emma Samms. Nowadays, the movie is less of a kid's flick to me and more of a satire on commercialism and consumerism. There are several other idiosyncrasies in this plot: How did Slugworth know where to find the kids that would get the tickets ahead of time ? He's already on the scene just as Charlie and Veruca get theirs, did he set them up? If Mike Teavee watches as much TV as he seems, how did he manage to get a ticket in the first place ? Why didn't at least one adult not get one ticket when they could have refused to give their kids their allowances ?How did the computer programmer program his computer by just punching the same two buttons over and over ad infinitum ? And why are several of the back characters and the Oompahs not identified in the credits ?  Still, this is one chocolate factory I'd love to visit, but for a chance to enter the candyland room.

It's very enjoyable and amusing, while Willy's character is playing a great part in this unique atmosphere. In the end, we'll find Wonka's true intentions regarding his unexpected and special tour, a happy ending being mandatory here.

92,TheNorthernMonkee,"dated, but Wilder is just impeccable",8,10 August 2005,"SPOILERS Roald Dahl is perhaps one of the most famous names in children's entertainment. Author of stories like 'The BFG', 'The Witches' and 'Matilda', Dahl's stories have given joy to children for a long time now. With so many of his stories being made into films, it's not difficult to see that Hollywood loves him too. In 1971, one of his finest stories was made into a musical starring Gene Wilder. Magnificantly 'odd', Wilder's Willy Wonka is a genuinely surreal performance. Twenty years on, and an inferior sequel later, and Wilder is still the way to go. The film might be dated, but with a Wonka like this, it's impossible not to fall in love with the film again.Charlie Bucket's (Peter Ostrum) family are incredibly poor. Living with his mum and four grandparents, Charlie dreams of better things. When the mysterious Willy Wonka (Wilder) announces that five lucky children will be allowed to tour his chocolate factory, Charlie has a dream. Receiving one chocolate bar on his birthday however, the odds are stacked against him. Still, this is a fairy tale, so you can imagine what's coming next.Filmed in Eastern Europe and with five children paid on the cheap, 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' is full of legends on screen and off. Colourful and beautiful throughout, it possesses many amazing scenes.As far as children performers go, the three kids do an alright job. Ostrum and Julie Dawn Cole (playing the greedy Veruca Salt) in particular are singled out for praise as they jump, run, sing and perform for the camera at every possibility. Ultimately though, the children will always be overshadowed by Gene Wilder.Wilder takes insanity to a new level. One moment seeming totally normal, and the next randomly talking and singing to himself, Wilder's Wonka is a man on the edge. You watch him and you just know that he could win your heart whilst simultaneously scare you senseless. You certainly have to wonder what Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson) is thinking when Wonka hugs Charlie towards the end. Ultimately though, however nuts Wilder is in this film, it is him who makes it watchable so many years later.Well, Wilder mostly, but let's be honest, another reason for always enjoying this film is the regular song and dance of the Oompa Loompas. 'vertically challenged' (or whatever the PC description is now) individuals painted orange with green hair could just look incredibly offensive and weird. Dress them in weird outfits and have them sing catchy tunes though and automatically they become figures of fun. Yes there are definite indications towards the slave trade, but for family films, the Oompa Loompas are people that children never forget.'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' is a film many of us grew up with and love. Beautiful and bright, it is always a joy to watch. Led by an amazing performance by Gene Wilder and the songs of the Oompa Loompas, the film has many treasured moments that you can't help but fall for. By modern standards, the film does look slightly dated, but with so many magic moments, this is easily forgivable. Pure family fun.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
93,FilmOtaku,What a difference two decades make!,8,22 September 2003,"The last time I saw this movie, it was as a nine year old and I remember being absolutely delighted.  When an independent theater offered it as a midnight movie, I jumped at the chance to see it again, as did half the population of Milwaukee apparently, based on the crowd.  What resulted was an unbelievably delightful experience that was three parts film, one part audience.  To experience this film as an adult is amazing  it is one of the oddest, darkly humorous and surreal films that I can remember outside of the Jon Waters genre.  Gene Wilder is nothing short of brilliant as Willy Wonka and garnered many laughs from the audience with his partly over the top and partly wry performance.  The entire production is completely surreal from the Oompa Loompas to the unreal boat ride through the horrific tunnel. (This was a children's movie??)  I sense that this film is a `children's film' in the same sense that The Simpsons is a `children's show'.  Both have elements that would make them appealing to kids, but the reality is that adults will have more understanding of them and therefore are the target audience.  Seeing this film again really makes me excited to see what Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are going to do with their remake  I think it is going to be extremely positive.--Shelly",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
94,afonsobritofalves,Better than Remake,8,13 September 2018,"One of the best classics of the 70's. It has good special effects, good actors, a good story and I think it even got better than the book (and so much adaptation).",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
95,Atreyu_II,"Better than the 2005 version, but not that much",7,29 June 2008,"Finally I had a chance to watch this movie, which is a popular and beloved fantasy/musical among children. Because this is the original film, naturally I had big expectations that it would be much better than the 2005 ""remake"". It is certainly superior to the 2005 ""remake"", but not as much as I imagined. While it certainly isn't a tremendous film, it is perfectly watchable, entertaining and without much bad stuff. But I found it just okay. I didn't find it good enough to consider it a true classic or good enough to add to my movie collection.Now, seriously. The movie is for sure much more elaborate and appealing than the 2005 ""remake"". The sceneries are much more natural-looking and way more pleasant to look at (for example, the factory looks beautiful outside, especially with that church-like tower with a clock, and the factory itself is so much nicer inside than in the 2005 version). Frankly, Gene Wilder makes a much better and more likable Willy Wonka. Gene Wilder is exactly what Willy Wonka is supposed to be: eccentric and enigmatic, but without being a weirdo and also without that horrible haircut and without a dark sense of humor. Johnny Depp, on the other, makes a too weird and eccentric Willy Wonka with a dark sense of humor and an awful haircut, in a controversial combination that resembles Michael Jackson. The ending of this movie is very different (and better) either.In this movie, even the ""bratty"" kids aren't that annoying. Except for Veruca (the spoiled and selfish girl), the others aren't excessive. Violet, for example, isn't as irritating as the same character in the 2005 version and the same happens with Mike Teavee. In fact, only in one or two brief scenes Mike Teavee proves to be rude. Otherwise, he's funny for his cowboy-like clothes and attitudes. Charlie Bucket is, naturally, the nicest kid.Like I said, Gene Wilder is great as Willy Wonka. Peter Ostrum was great as Charlie Bucket (his only movie role ever), Paris Themmen is pretty cool as the TV-obsessed Mike Teavee and Jack Albertson is good as Grandpa Joe. Mel Stuart made a much better job by directing this movie than Tim Burton in the ""remake"".Another attribute here is the soundtrack. The songs are charming. Besides, the movie is made in an old-fashioned style, another reason why it is superior to the modern version.I like the scene when Grandpa Joe and Charlie are floating in the air between balls of soap, but I think it is too much what happens to Violet when she tastes something she shouldn't. Besides, those Oompa-Loompas bug me for some reason - I don't like them any better than those from the 2005 version, but at least here they always wear the same clothes, unlike that balderdash we see in the recent film. Looking at this movie, almost everything seems so fake and artificial in the ""remake"".",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
96,AhmedSpielberg99,Gene Wilder!,8,4 June 2018,"It's Gene Wilder, at the top of his form, who made this unique imaginative adventure more vibrant and gleeful. His energetic performance is by no means different from Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins. He absolutely deserved ,at least, an Oscar nomination. The movie lost some of its sharpness and suffered from some monotony after some time from reaching the factory. But besides the gorgeous production design and cool visuals, there was Wilder's charisma that helped to elevate the movie. The first half of the movie has great emotional value, and established the characters very well. Also, it feature some of the most beautiful songs of the movie. But due to the fast pacing, there was an action in the first half that felt forced, if it was necessary to serve a turning point of the story.There are many powerful and very important messages in the movie. But the greatest thing about them is not actually the messages themselves, as we witnessed them delivered in a lot of movies before, but it's how genuine these messages seem as they are delivered in this particular story. Peter Ostrum is great in his first and ,unfortunately, his last role. There are many dramatic scenes that required a very good actor and he is. Actually, I didn't feel for even a moment that this is his acting debut. Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is a total blast from start to finish.

A lot of creativity went into the production. The acting is great, and the caricatured characters and ""moral lessons"" very amusing. The use of vibrant colors within the Wonka factory creates a true fantasy land contrasting with the drab surrounding city. And of course there's the nice Dickensian Charlie character...Not sure what to say about the Oompa Loompas. One might consider the use of them in the factory as morally dubious. Are they not slaves? Willy Wonka explains that he has saved them from the depredation rampant in their homeland, where they are in constant danger by wild animals (or something along those lines). So it's supposed to be okay for them to live 24/7 at the factory and work day in and and day out. Question: couldn't they also lead normal lives in the city itself, where none of their natural predators live? At least I did not see any of them running around... For heaven's sake, self-styled moral sage Wonka does not need to keep them trapped at the factory! How would these orange-skinned dwarfs fare amidst ordinary human beings? Unclear.Given the undeniable quality of this movie, I have to ask: why was it remade, when the original version was so good and seems just as modern today?

102,RossRivero99,A wonderful movie for the whole family to watch again and again,10,26 December 2014,"Mel Stuart's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (in which the novel was really called Charlie and the chocolate factory) is arguably one of the greatest family movies ever made along with the Harry Potter franchise, Lord of the Rings trilogy, Bedtime Stories (2008),Home Alone, (1990), A Christmas Story, It's a Wonderful Life, and some of John Hughes' greatest films, as well as Matilda (which was based on a Roald Dahl novel). Some people who may have seen at least one of the film adaptations of Roald Dahl's novels do not get why he treasured children's stories very much, and I was very curious myself without even thinking about it until I saw the film adaptation of Matilda (1996) which was directed by Danny DeVito got my questions answered, and that answer was that not only children can be entertained by his work but teenagers and adults as well. But while I was watching this film which also happened to be based on a Roald Dahl novel made me love the magic of kids movies a lot more than I have before, the film tells the story of an poor boy named Charlie (played by Peter Ostrum) who after school works as a paperboy in order to support his family mortgage, and gets involved in a golden ticket contest for five people and each of the winners gets to bring one family member as well as Willy Wonka (played by Gene Wilder)himself. After everyone around the globe finds out about the contest it ends up to be a race against time to see who five people really are going to be and we find out about each one approximately a few minutes apart from one another (though I won't get too in depth with the film's story). the film is also an excellent way of getting to know Charlie who was the last of the 5 winners in the contest and after all of the five winners were confirmed Charlie brings his grandfather (played by Academy Award winner Jack Albertson), the film also has an excellent supporting cast which includes Julie Dawn Cole as the spoiled brat Veruca Salt, Roy Kinnear as Veruca's Alfred Pennyworth type father who follows every father's philosophy in order to make their own lives as well as their children's lives a whole lot easier is to be happier all the time and he does in the most feminine type of way, Denise Nickerson as Violet who is a huge gum chewer and ironically ends up being one of the contest winners even though she doesn't really eat chocolate, Leonard Stone in a great father like performance as Violet's father (and obviously he is much more manly than Veruca's father), Michael Ollner as the very disobedient and overweight Augustus Gloop, and Ursula Reit as Augustus's mother. Another thing that I noticed while watching this film was that it blends the two genres of both comedy and musical together of which that to me was really neat. This movie is a film that is committed to it's story, characters, and humor that Roald Dahl put into his 1964 novel, this is one of the best movies of 1971 as well as one of the best movies of the 1970s.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
103,OriginalMovieBuff21,A classic,9,22 June 2005,"""If you want to view paradise, simply look around and view it."" Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory is one of the best children films of all-time. The characters, you all have to adore, even if their annoying or not. The film is about a boy who finds a golden ticket in a Willy Wonka chocolate bar and heads off to see the Willy Wonka factory with his grandpa and other people. Gene Wilder was great as Willy Wonka and his performance was quite funny and actually kind of weird. The kids were all great especially Augustus Gloop, he was hilarious. Overall, Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory is a classic and should be viewed by everyone.Hedeen's Oulook: 9/10 ***+ A-",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
104,Horror-yo,Iconic classic for the ages,9,18 May 2016,"The author, Roald Dahl, has served as a pool of stories filled with fantasy, wacky but likable characters, and morals fit for children. This is the movie adaptation of one of his stories, very much in the mold of an ""Alice in Wonderland"", the protagonist being a child and all the candor he manifests, and this film is further testament to the 'Peter Pan' myth that within us lives forever a child, full of a purity and enthusiasm that never die. Willy Wonka is superbly interpreted by Gene Wilder here, and it should be said all the children actors play their roles very well too. Especially, I thought, the little Veruca Salt. The song scenes are very good, the Oompa Loompa song being an absolute cinema classic that'll ring in people's heads til they die. The dialog is excellent, every Wonka line being somehow symbolic or having double meaning. Overall this film is an ode to humanity, principle, but also to the strange: don't be afraid to show your difference, even if it scares some. The boat scene for example, a metaphor of the stranger dimension of eccentric experimentation. Excellent watch.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
105,oOoBarracuda,"""Time is a precious thing, never waste it.""",9,6 June 2016,"Mel Stuart took viewers to a world of pure imagination in his 1971 feature Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. In perhaps his most well-known role, Gene Wilder as the eccentric candy man looking to pass on his chocolate legacy created a brilliant film adaptation of the book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl. Wilder's exquisite performance proved he could command an entire film, despite him only being in the film's second half. A fun family experience, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory spans generations to bring pure imagination to all ages.Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder), candy extraordinaire is well known for being a recluse in his chocolate factory. Fearing intrusion, he has locked himself in his factory free to invent and produce the best chocolate the world has known without threat. When word breaks that Willy Wonka will open his factory to 5 winners of golden tickets hidden in his chocolate bars, the world is stunned as they all scatter, ravishing his bars to gain entry into his elusive chocolate paradise. Young Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) of meager means, believes that he has to win a golden ticket because he wants the prize more than anyone else does. After all 5 of the golden tickets are discovered, Charlie cries in his room devastated to have missed out on meeting the man his grandfather always told him stories about. To console himself, Charlie treats himself to a Wonka bar after he finds some money in the street. To his surprise, just after he buys the bar, the news breaks that the fifth golden ticket was a fake. With the last shred of hope in him, Charlie opens his bar to find a glimmer of gold around his candy bar. After racing home to tell his family the good news, Charlie, and Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson) prepare for their trip to the chocolate factory the next day. Wearing a purple velvet coat, Willy Wonka greets the guests to his factory walking with a cane, that he gets stuck in a brick and falls forward in a fantastic somersault. From this point on, Willy Wonka's credibility is questioned as he leads the children and their families through his factory where there are ""little surprises around every turn"". Some of those surprises result in removal of the children from the factory until only Charlie is left to discover Willy Wonka's motives for opening his chocolate paradise. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a sincere treat for children and parents alike. A fun moral movie that is never too overt with its message, Willy Wonka is an experience to have as often as possible. The worst part of this movie is waiting the 47 minutes of well-done build-up before we actually get to see Willy Wonka. Gene Wilder is fantastic in the role of the mysterious peculiar owner of the candy empire. He has his perfect moments of emotion, which he is often accused of overdoing the yelling--a criticism I find unfounded. I read that he had to fight to have his opening scene filmed the way that made it into the movie, with his walking being aided by a cane. It was a good decision on behalf of Mel Stuart to relent and film it this way, because, from that moment on, you never knew what Mr. Wonka was capable of, nor did you understand his motives. This mystery was necessary to the story, and a bit of the premise the film depends on upon would have been lost without it. This bit of trivia just further goes to support what an acting genius Gene Wilder is.Always do as your told, follow rules and authority, adults are looking out for your best interests are the easy messages to take away from this film. Upon closer inspection, however, one can see that the adults are no better equipped to look after themselves than their children are. It is an adult that is trying to steal from Mr. Wonka, and get the kids to steal his secrets, it is the adults that are encouraging their kids to do Slugworth's bidding, and it is the adults who find it difficult to resist the temptations around them. Maybe the bigger message is that there's a little childlike wonder left in all of us, as long as we don't try to hard to extinguish it. The adults become just as enchanted as the children when they first enter Mr. Wonka's brilliant candy-filled world. Maybe, just maybe, the underlying message is that we all advance in age as we make it through life, but if we are careful, we never have to grow up. I stick with that message, Willy Wonka doesn't live too bad of a life, after all.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
106,frosty-44431,A world of pure imagination,8,11 February 2021,"A magical, inventive, sweet-filled and childhood film. Many generation have watched this. The second one they made I have erased from my memory.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
107,nickenchuggets,"""There is no life I know to compare with pure imagination""",10,15 May 2021,"This entire movie is just so magical. Roald Dahl, the author of the book on which the film is based, is known the world over for being one of the most prolific children's book writers, but many don't realize that the books aren't just appealing to children. James and The Giant Peach, Danny the Champion of the World, The Witches, and Willy Wonka are all well written stories for the most part, and so movie adaptations feeding off their success started to predictably appear. Out of all of Dahl's books to be turned into movies, this one is without a doubt the most famous, and it's not hard to see why. The movie's plot is about the titular Willy Wonka who owns a mysterious chocolate factory that nobody can have access to. Soon, Wonka announces that there is a contest that involves people buying his chocolate bars and finding golden tickets hidden inside. The winner receives a tour of his strange factory, but since there are only 5 tickets in the entire world, it's way easier said than done. A modest boy named Charlie is the story's unlikely protagonist, he is humble enough to not let the temptation of finding a golden ticket control his life. He doesn't expect to find one, and his family is much more important to him than a bunch of candy. As time goes by, the golden tickets start getting discovered by lucky children from various locations around the world, but the kids who win are all spoiled and don't really deserve them. A gluttonous German kid named Augustus is the first winner, followed by Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregarde, and Mike Teevee. Finally, Charlie manages by pure luck to find a ticket after the original fifth winner is proved to be a fake. Out of all the children who win, Charlie is the only decent one that doesn't have a snarky, in-your-face attitude, and it makes the audience sympathize with him. The rest of the movie involves Charlie being taken on a tour (along with the other children) of Wonka's factory while he is chaperoned by his formerly bedridden grandfather. Wonka shows them all kinds of strange candy related things, from waterfalls made of melted chocolate to drinks that allow the consumer to float. There's a shocking false ending where Charlie, as the only remaining member of the tour after all the other kids have been eliminated, asks Wonka about the promised lifetime supply of chocolate, and Wonka tells him he's not getting any as he ""broke the rules"" by stealing the lifting drinks. Charlie's grandfather suggests to Charlie he should get even with Wonka by giving the recipes for some of his secret Candy to his adversary Slugworth, but Charlie returns the gobstopper to Wonka instead. As it turns out, this whole part was just a test of morals that only Charlie was decent enough to pass, and Wonka tells Charlie that his family now has legal ownership over his factory. The performances in this movie are all amazing, especially Wilder's, and he was without a doubt the best Willy Wonka ever. Also an interesting note about this movie, the part at the end where Wonka yells at Charlie for violating the rules is actually non-rehearsed, and Charlie didn't know Gene was going to yell at him. This allowed the filmmakers to get his real reaction.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
108,markovd111,Held from perfection by changes from the source material...,8,18 June 2021,"I would lie if I told you I didn't enjoy watching this movie. It has wonderful music, acting and a lot of charm! However, I had some criticism and later I compared it to stuff that critics at the time said and I must say I agree with them. There is no overly memorable songs, Gene Wilder completely steals the show (which is good because his performance is fantastic, but bad because Charlie is not in the focus, hence the changed name of the movie compared to the book) and stuff is added/changed for no reason. That doesn't mean this is a bad movie and it is most certainly better than Burton's version in which Wonka acts like a schizophrenic, but it pales when being compared to the masterpiece like ""The Wizard of Oz"" (some stuff are added/changed here too, but the dynamic of the movie remains stable throughout the whole deal) which is also a musical based on a book for children. All in all, I give the movie 8/10! It's still a wonderful movie, but the fans of the book will notice the difference and will probably be somewhat displeased, while the rest won't even notice, and for them I say 10/10! :)",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
109,DavidSim240183,A fantastical children's classic!,10,22 August 2006,"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory was the first feature length film adapted from one of Roald Dahl's books. Since it's release in 1971, it's become a cult classic, and is widely appreciated by children and adults alike.It is also a film I've studied in great detail. Observed from every angle. I'm not really sure why. It's almost as if there' a mystery at the heart of it I want to crack. Why is it so popular? Why does it seem so effortlessly enjoyable? Roald Dahl officially hated the film when it was finished. He thought it strayed too far from the book and was not menacing enough. Personally I disagree. I think it recaptures perfectly what made the book so engaging. Granted it didn't need to alter the title, but it's still a fantastic yarn and continues to entertain even today.The film made the wise choice of properly introducing the character of Willy Wonka at least 40 minutes in. Which is also when we see the Chocolate Factory itself. It builds the anticipation steadily. Beforehand, we meet the plucky young Charlie (Peter Ostrum), and the rest of his obnoxious companions who all gradually find the five Golden Tickets.There are quite a few people who think Willy Wonka is slow to start. I've never felt that way. I enjoy every scene before we get to the factory. There are some marvellously funny sequences, such as Charlie's pompous schoolteacher, Veruca's hilarious petulance, and the reactions of people going mad searching for the Golden Tickets. There is a hidden subtext here about the greed that overwhelms people, and Charlie gets a Ticket without really looking. Because he truly deserves one, where these other people don't.The film also benefits from excellent direction from Mel Stuart. We meet each one of the horrible children in brief vignettes, and we already learn enough about them to side with Charlie, and pray they'll get what they deserve. The one major difference between the film and the book is an added subplot concerning the Everlasting Gobstopper. A rival of Wonka's, Slugworth, approaches each one of the children, and offers large sums of money in exchange for the secret recipe. I thought this was a nice touch because it adds a little ambiguity to Charlie's character, and is a departure from his squeaky clean image in the book.It's at this point we meet the person everyone has been dying to see. Willy Wonka. Gene Wilder was an interesting choice, and proves to be a total revelation. Wilder is not always one of the easiest actors in the world to watch, because of his annoying habit of screaming things out endlessly. But from his memorable first appearance walking slowly with a limp to doing a somersault, his dynamic energy is instantly engaging because it's so carefully precise. And when he does go over the top, it's entirely in character. Willy Wonka still remains Gene Wilder's finest hour.In regards to the chocolate factory, I still believe it's an astonishing array of colourful dimensions, bizarre confections and beautiful sights. There's everything here from chocolate waterfalls, candy striped meadows and sweet inventing rooms. All populated by the Oompa-Loopas, little dwarfs who carefully maintain the factory.Underneath the sugary sweet veneer, there is an undeniably sinister aftertaste. Each one of the kids disappears through their own selfishness and greed, and in another departure from the book, where we saw them at the end, here we don't. We never do find out what happens to them, especially with oblique references from Wonka such as boilers, furnaces, taffy pullers and juicers. Wonka is hilariously unconcerned with their dilemmas, which gives the film considerable kick as a cautionary tale without ever becoming too preachy.Despite the bizarre fates that befall them, this is undeniably Wonka's show all the way. He is completely in control, and it's always a wonder listening to him come out with philosophies, tactics for boosting his products, and half-hearted warnings. With a chocolate coloured hat, chocolate wrapper coloured coat, a twinkle in his eye and a spring in his step, Wilder turns Wonka into a fully rounded character who keeps the audience captive. He's also got a fine singing voice to boot.As events draw to a close, it's quite shocking when Charlie nearly loses out on the grand prize through a careless mistake. Naturally he convinces Wonka of his worth, but the fact that he nearly didn't only shows how ambiguous Wonka is. It all ends nicely in the Wonkavator, with Charlie inheriting the empire, and ensuring a new life for his poverty-stricken family.Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory still remains the best of the Roald Dahl screen interpretations, and is a template of the perfect children's film. One that appeals to the child in all of us, but still touches base with the adult so it never becomes patronising. Tim Burton's remake was a respectful incarnation, and succeeds on it's own merits, but the original still resonates with audiences as the classic it has become, and deserves to be.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

It's a really enjoyable family comedy and there's not a doubt in my mind that it will hold up for many years to come. Another good thing about it is that there's comedy for children and for adults.

I love this movie, I love it, this is one of the films I watched all the time as a kid. It was great when I was a kid, and it's still great now. However, this movie could be one of the weakest book to film adaptations ever made. Granted I haven't read every book and read every movie, but I have read the book ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" and yes it does have the same plot and moral, but there are so many changes made.OK, the reason I love this film is because of a few things. The actors are great, every child fits the role perfectly. And Gene Wilder IS Willy Wonka. The songs are super catchy, and the special effects are outstanding. This film is over forty years old, and it still looks good. And it has a great sense of imagination, always being creative with the names of the candies.However it doesn't work well as an adaptation, they were squirrels in the book, the Slugworth guy was only in a short sentence, they used a glass elevator right after veruca. The Wonka Wash didn't exist. They were allowed to bring two guests. Charlie's dad wasn't dead. And they added songs for no reason.Remember, I love this movie, it's one of my most nostalgic movies, but it isn't that great of an adaptation.

When he issues golden tickets to visit his factory, poor but dreamy boy Charlie is among the winners, and visits Wonka's magical world...Dahl apparently hated this version of his generation-transcending tale of greed and gluttony in a magical candy land. Viewers need not be alarmed however: a book is a book and a film is a film and each should be its own beast, and authors are often the least people who should tell how the film version should be (to note: every Stephen King novel adapted by King has been an artistic failure, when the adaptations he disliked - mainly Shinning - were great), and this is a case study of the phenomenon.Who better than Gene Wilder to play the manic, reclusive and unhinged Willie Wonka? He bravely carries the whole film on his shoulders and is assisted by a very competent young cast. The general tone is just as wonderful, as, unlike the newer version, things aren't spelled out for us (the factory's logic, Wonka's origins), because the film trust children to understand its internal logic, a brave and fulfilling move that is too rarely seen in today's film output (and probably earned the film some scorn from bewildered parents, which would explain its initial box-office failure).This version is the one to see, and Gene Wilder's ambivalent psychopath soars beyond Johnny Depp's gloomy creation. Unlike Tim Burton's mismatched mess, this world brims with colors, the Umpalumpas are a touch sinister and there is that touch of underlying darkness (the demented boat ride). That this gem's ratings have gone up since Burton's misguided version was released only attest further to its staying power and greatness.So, in fewer words, let go of your adult arrogance, allow yourself to be a child again, and dive into Willie Wonka's magical world.

118,TheHonestCritic,"When you watch this film creation, you will find yourself in a world of pure imagination!",10,1 August 2020,"""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" (1971), I remember the very first time I saw this movie as a child. To this day, I'm still blown away with how great this film is. It has found a spot on my list of my top 10 all-time favorite family films. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The storyline is based off the book ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", written by Roald Dahl. Originally, the film script was going to be written entirely by Roald Dahl himself, along with David Seltzer. However, since Roald Dahl failed to meet deadlines, David Seltzer did some rewrites to the script and the story was changed. Now, in most cases, changing an original story from a book for cinema standards can make or break it. However, in the case of this movie, the changes made the plot line in the movie are a good thing. It made the film that much more entertaining than the original novel. Don't get me wrong, I still love the original book. It's a lot of fun to read! Here's something that might shock you, Roald Dahl hated this movie adaptation of his book so much that he disowned it! I can understand his anger of his book being changed. If you were in his shoes, you would probably feel upset too! But, for our benefit, the movie came out fantastic and the storyline keeps you hooked from beginning to end. Sorry, Roald Dahl..... I really love this film! As for the acting, it is stellar from all of the actors and actresses. The top three standout performances come from the one and only Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, Peter Ostrum as Charlie Bucket and Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe. They really make this movie! Gene Wilder is legendary and iconic as Willy Wonka. Peter Ostrum is absolutely phenomenal and charming as Charlie Bucket and Jack Albertson is funny and heartwarming as Grandpa Joe. Here's an interesting bit of history for you. This was the only role that Peter Ostrum played in his acting career. Isn't that something? This was the only time that Peter Ostrum acted in a motion picture. But, what a great performance it was! It's a shame that he didn't pursue acting any further, he had great potential. He is currently a veterinarian, which is still cool. It's what he wants to be, and who are we to deny him? As for the rest of the actors and actresses in this movie, they fire on all cylinders as well and definitely help bring this film to life! All of the sets/locations are perfect and give this film an amazing atmosphere. Of course, my favorite set in this movie has to be the Chocolate Room. Whenever I see a screenshot, or film clip of that room I can immediately pinpoint it to this movie. Talk about an iconic set! All of the rest of the rooms in the factory are just as breathtaking. As for the special effects, they are all very well-done. Some of them can get a bit cheesy at times, but that's what helps to give this movie it's special charm! Finally, the soundtrack written by: Leslie Bricusse, Anthony Newley and Walter Scharf is amazing and helps to tie the whole film together. I could hear any random part of this film score, and know right away that it's from this movie. That's the mark of a phenomenal film score! ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" is nothing but cinematic gold for people of all ages. I can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen this film, go watch it, especially if you have kids. You'll make them very happy! I guarantee that they'll love this movie, and you will too. Grab your golden ticket, and prepare for an adventure!",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
119,gpeevers,Sweeter than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,8,16 June 2009,"While some may argue that this version of the story is not as faithful to the Roald Dahl book as Tim Burton's recent remake Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, it is still a far better movie.The story of an eccentric candy maker named Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) who has offered a tour of his very secretive factory along with a life time supply of chocolate to anyone that finds one of the 5 golden tickets hidden inside Wonka Chocolate bars.One young boy Charlie Bucket can hardly afford to buy a single bar but dreams of finding one of the tickets and taking his Grampa Joe (Jack Albertson) with him on the tour.The interior of the candy factory though done on a limited budget and without the benefit of modern CGI was and is awe inspiring, particularly for children. Apparently to achieve the look of wonder on the faces of the children they were not shown this set until filming began.One standout aspect of this film was certainly the music, to this day the songs from the film remain captivating. The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Music, Scoring Adaptation and Original Song Score. One of songs written for the film was The Candy Man which would become a standard for Sammy Davis Jr.As good as Johnny Depp is as an actor; the role of Willy Wonka was handled more effectively by the very talented Gene Wilder. Unfortunately the Depp portrayal comes across as a bit too creepy.Another aspect of the film where it exceeds the remake is the portrayal of the Oompa Loompa's. Instead of eerie miniature digital recreations of a single actor we have a group of little people including at least one female, and most of whom could not speak English.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
120,culwin,Totally demented,4,28 February 2000,"For some strang reason, many people like this movie and call it ""delightful family fun""... Which part is your favorite, the part where they chop a chicken's head off, or the parts where the children are killed in various ways like you might see in ""Nightmare on Elm Street""?  Let us not forget the impish Oompa-loompas, who are forced into slave labor by the totally creepy Willy Wonka, who also makes everyone sign away their souls in a deal-with-the-devil contract at the beginning of the movie.  Someone else compared this movie to ""Seven"", which is exactly what I was thinking when I watched this movie the other day.  A bunch of bad kids are killed by their ""sins"".  If this is the kind of movie you consider to be ""fun"" for kids, you might as well make it a double feature with ""A Clockwork Orange"".",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
121,GeorgeRoots,"Up There With ""The Wizard of Oz"", And Many Other Children Classics.",10,8 August 2014,"Pretty much the definitive movie you could watch as a child, and remember fondly as an adult. Roald Dahl's classic book and adaptation is pure gold from beginning to end.Charlie Bucket is a poor kid, who soon competes with every other child in the world to obtain one of five golden tickets into the famous chocolate factory run by the apparently eccentric, but public recluse Willy Wonka. By miraculous odds Charlie gets a ticket, along with four other children who finally enter the factory. From there on, the movie takes on the presence of a proverbial slasher movie, as each child is disposed of through their own greedy faults. Incorporate one of the weirdest tunnels scenes ever committed to film and in all seriousness, it's actually one of the most charming movies ever made.Gene Wilder is the definitive Willy Wonka. Obviously he's still a few years away from Mel Brooks's comedy goldmine, but no one can do what he does in this movie and sell a performance like he can. ""Pure Imagination"" is one of the all time greatest songs from this musical, and the Oompa Loompa's are parodied to death nowadays because they're so darn good.Out of all his stories, this remains my favourite of Roald Dahl's work. Though it may shy away a little from it's source material, this movie blends fantasy, adventure and dark humour perfectly. The factory is so incredibly detailed, and I heard that the chocolate river was two feet deep and became stagnant almost immediately (Poor Augustus).Final Verdict: Another children's timeless classic. 10/10.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
122,I_Am_The_Taylrus,Great Musical(SPOILERS),8,12 December 2006,"SPOILERSLike I said before, I liked Charlie and the Chocolate Factory a little bit better, but this is still a great musical film. It has very memorable songs that everyone loves, well, except for the Oompa-Loompa songs. Speaking of Oompa-Loompas, they are positively creepy. They are orange with white eyebrows. They are just plain disturbing. Anyway, this is a good film. I can't believe Gene Wilder was Willy Wonka. He was great as him, but he normally does Mel Brooks films.I told you the plot in my comment for Charlie. A kid wins a Golden Ticket to go to Willy Wonka's factory and all the other kids are punished. However, the ending is just a bit different. Willy Wonka goes into his office and Charlie gives back his Ever-Lasting Gobstopper. Wonka is delighted and the film ends in the Great-Glass Elevator, which is pretty abrupt. This is also the soda room. Charlie and his grandfather are levitated off the ground until they hit a fan, but they belch to get down.Overall, this is a very fun film to watch. It has great songs, catchy tunes, good acting, and more. Although it may not be very faithful to the novel, it is still great. In the novel it ends with the Great-Glass Elevator crashing into Charlie's house, but int this it ends in the Great-Glass Elevator. Anyway, a lot of people can and will enjoy this 1971 flick. There is one thing I'd like to mention, the boat ride is really bizarre. Anyway, this is a nice film.8/10Recommended Films: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

124,Greatornot,The only version that matters,9,24 March 2009,"With all due respect to the great Johnny Depp. Chocolate Factory was a dud and Johnny Depp is nothing more than Michael Jackson in that film. Sorry Johnny I love you in most of your other movies. In a nutshell, Gene Wilder is the only Willy Wonka that matters. A strong person with vulnerabilities that are better left unrevealed. This film is about virtue, fantasy, and life ... Not necessarily in that order. While it is unfair for me to judge Depp. For hes just following bosses orders. The criticism must stick. Willy Wonka is a movie that disperses lessons as much if not more so than a candyman disperses sweets. The ensemble of music is just so magical. Learning new lessons from the Oompahs with no computer generated oompahs I might add. Yes at times the lessons are corny...but so what. This is a fine movie that makes us realize that riches come from within . Fantasy has never been better. I cringe every time Wilder does that somersault. Despite the fact the Wonka Factory looks eerily like the building used in Hostel , as its torturing headquarters... I still love this movie.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
125,aramis-112-804880,Pretty Good for Kids,6,13 June 2016,"I saw this at ten when it first came out and enjoyed it. I have squeezed some nostalgia value out of it since. Gene Wilder is wonderful as Willy Wonka (if perhaps too young to have had all the life experiences discussed early on in the film). Still, to kids, everyone who is not a kid is old.The problem with the movie is the cutting of corners. The movie was originally sponsored by a food company who meant to make a mint marketing various Wonka bars, but that never got off the ground. In other words, it was a big commercial for a product that never came off (though some Wonka products do exist to this day).The story of the movie is a tale of producer David Wolper cutting costs however he can to streamline a budget. Two big stars of the period, Sammy David Jr. and Anthony Newly (who co-wrote the songs) showed interest in playing the candy man at the beginning, and being able to sing ""The Candy Man."" Both were nixed. Wolper suggested having a big star might interfere with the fantasy--but it also meant paying a star's salary. He might have gotten either for a cut rate, but foolishly rejected them, perhaps damaging the box office and certainly ruining the song, which became a big hit for Sammy Davis, Jr. anyway.Then, according to the book PURE IMAGINATION, some wanted the ""Golden Ticket"" song turned into a huge production number (see ""Consider Yourself"" in OLIVER or ""Every Sperm is Sacred"" in THE MEANING OF LIFE). It's a good song that seems to call for a big production number. But Wolper, no doubt with an eye on expenses, decided it would work better in a more intimate (and more boring) setting.My final criticism is Roald Dahl's fault. His original CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY had the oompa-loompas singing terribly moralistic songs that go on even longer than the truncated versions in the films! After they enter the chocolate factory, apart from one song from Veruca Salt, all they have are the repetition of the oompa-loompa's moralistic ditties against gum, television, etc. What a bunch of (if you pardon the term) blue-nosed bores.The film desperately needs an ""eleven o'clocker."" These are songs near the end of shows (usually half an hour before Broadway shows used to let out at 11:30, and the audience may be tired) that are either comic (""Sit Down, You're Rocking the Boat"" from GUYS AND DOLLS; stirring (""Oklahoma"" from OKLAHOMA!; or perhaps martial, with a neat military cadence. Instead, ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" just sort of trickles out to the end, in the Great Glass Elevator.Some scenes do work, but even they have flaws. The ""Chocolate Room"" takes the breath away on an initial viewing (esp. in the theaters) and the song ""Pure Imagination"" is arguably the best in the show. But then one wonders--why didn't they decorate the posts holding up the roofs, perhaps to look like candy canes? Was that more cost-cutting? And the chocolate river never looked anything to me but repulsive, even when I was ten and willing to believe.Some of the effects look cheesy in the twenty-first century. Overall, this is a better version than the twisted vision of Tim Burton that came out later, with the androgenous Willy Wonka and the unnecessary backstory that Dahl, for all his faults, never included. In fact, his Wonka is a jolly little chap rather than bizarre as in Burton's tale, or perhaps bipolar in this version.Gene Wilder is mostly restrained for a pretty good performance to follow up his brilliant breakthrough in Mel Brooks' ""The Producers."" The kids are mostly surprisingly good actors, especially the bickering girls. Three good songs (including ""Pure Imagination"" and the all but ruined ""Candy Man""). The boy playing Charlie is good but his hair is right out of the 1970s and it clashes with the timeless, nameless, old-world village where he lives.Also, keep an eye out for David Battley as the annoyingly hilarious Mr. Turkentine. Tim Brooke-Taylor from ""The Goodies"" has an amusing bit as a computer operation. And some welcome dark-comedic vignettes during the hunt for the golden ticket should please adults who are trying to persuade their kids a half-century-old movie with shoddy effects is worth the waste of a dull afternoon.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
126,Stompgal_87,A childhood favourite if somewhat unfaithful to the book,8,1 October 2013,"When I was 9 and 10, my favourite author was Roald Dahl and my favourite book of his was 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', which was a good enough reason to see this film. My sister and I watched this film at a male friend's house when we were children, which his parents had taped, and we enjoyed it, albeit having parts from the book that were missing (I slightly prefer the 2005 remake because it is more faithful to the book and is more substantial if darker). I still remember calling out, ""Come on Charlie! Will he get the last golden ticket?' just before he finds it when I first saw this film. Fairly recently I picked up the DVD of this Film from B&M Bargains in Newport, South Wales, for £2.99 while I stayed with my family since it was the only bargain DVD in the shop that appealed to me.The best aspects of this film are the charming and nostalgic musical score, most of the songs being memorable apart from 'Imagination,' despite the end credits rendition of it being harmonious and the dialogue that sticks in my mind and had wit and intelligence in certain parts. Most of the factory's interior is vibrantly coloured but a couple of its visuals are odd such as the chocolate river looking more like muddy water and the everlasting gobstoppers not being round (even the Nostalgia Critic pointed out similar flaws to these when comparing this version to the remake). Further to the songs, the best ones are the jolly 'Candyman,' the beautiful 'Cheer Up, Charlie,' the triumphant, 'I've Got a Golden Ticket,' the weird song Wonka sings during the darkest part of the film (the infamous boat ride), the repetitive yet catchy Oompa Loompa songs and the mesmerising 'I Want It Now!' I also liked the uses of scanimation, possibly during the boat ride scene and the lyrics on screen to the third Oompa Loompa number about spoilt brat Veruca Salt. Like the book, the five golden ticket winners have distinct personalities. Augustus Gloop is greedy, Violet is a talkative show-off, Mike is a comically insulting telly addict and Charlie is ambitious. As for the pace, it was rather swift in spite of a couple of the scenes before the factory being a bit boring and I found the ending a tad rushed and felt that there could have been more to it. Another reason I prefer the remake is because you see the children again after their factory disasters as per the book but here once Augustus got sucked up a pipe, Violet turned into a giant blueberry, Veruca fell down the garbage chute and Mike shrunk, you never see them again once the Oompa Loompas attend to them for treatment. I must say that this film has the better Wonka and Oompa Loompas than the remake, whereas the remake has better visuals and the best story due to its faithfulness to the book.Overall this is a delightful trip down memory lane in spite of certain parts being different from the book. 8/10.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
127,The_Core,A Perfect Fantasy...,10,21 September 1999,"I'm very amused by the comments about how this movie is too dark/sadistic for kids, and saddened (as another person was) that a movie like this would not be made these days (and would certainly not receive a G rating, if it was).  Nowadays, kids have to be shielded from this evil, dark, horrible world... at least until they reach elementary school age and find out where their parents hide their gun, so they can bring it along to school with them to make sure the drug deals go down the way they're supposed to, or that another kid with a bigger gun doesn't kill them first.  Oh, and these poor, poor kids that were ""traumatized"" by this wonderful movie as a child... I'm literally rolling on the floor laughing with amusement.  This movie illustrates just how much society has deteriorated since the early 1970's, how people are all too ready to run, to hide, to shield their children from the real world and instill their own fears into their kids, fears of reality.  And the moral lessons... oh, the horror!  HOW could such a horrible movie like this exist?  After all, everyone knows that morality is relative, right?  What a destructive film!  Better to send Junior to his/her room, where they can take some bong tokes and get on the Internet and get to the sex sites fast!Suffice it to say, I've loved this movie since childhood, and everything in it brings back my childhood like it never left (some of the songs even bring tears to my eyes).  I really have to wonder, will seeing ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" again do the same thing for our kids 30 years from now?Tim, born in 1964 and feeling lucky he was...",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
128,The_Core,One of those films...,10,4 December 2002,"... that (like the Wizard of Oz) touches on universal themes for all ages and has something that almost anyone can relate to emotionally on some level.  A delicious touch of early 70's psychedelia adds a lot to the film (especially for adults) and there is a strange emotional depth to it all that can really frighten, astound or delight.  ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" is one of those film rarities that comes along only about every 25 years or so, maybe less often -- with something for literally everyone, yet manages not to lose the magic.  And now it can be enjoyed on DVD with a truly wonderful (in fact astoundingly good) restoration.Now, everything else has already been said by someone, except this:  *Why* do so many people hate and/or skip over the ""Cheer Up Charlie"" song?  I think it's as good a song as any other in the film, and I really like the melody especially (needless to say, I don't skip it over). Any psychologists out there who can answer?10/10",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
129,TheCorniestLemur,Lovely bit of child murder,8,19 November 2020,"I dare you to try convincing me that Wonka wasn't planning their deaths (and yes they are all dead) all along.Even though it is really fun to examine the darker undertone of this film (workplace violations, children dying left and right, Wonka being suicidal and impotent), it is equally fun just watching the film, because it does perhaps the best thing a film like this can do for an adult, make them feel like a child again.What I mean by this is that the entire film just gives off such a child-like sense of wonder, but not in a bad way, or even a way that feels cringey. The sets, the songs, the acting, it all comes together in such a delightful way even though Grandpa Joe is letting his family starve because he's too lazy to get out of bed.And every single character is so memorable, and every single one has at least one hilarious moment, like Charlie's teacher. He might only be in two scenes, but damn it he does not get enough credit. Gene Wilder definitely gets enough credit, but I'll give him a little more because he's funny, he's crazy, he's a little bit creepy, and he's everything Willy Wonka should be. And even the kids didn't set my teeth on edge unless they were supposed to.I did think the first half lacked a certain energy that a musical like this should have, and there are some bizarre tonal shifts in this portion too, but watching this film is like having a big gulp of a fizzy lifting drink, it fills you up and makes you feel warm and cosy, without the imminent threat of death at the merciless rotors of a giant fan. And I could never complain about that.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

Wonka shrugs it off with enigmatic one-liners and equally enigmatic grins. This isn't just a story about dumb adults in a kid paradise, though; Wonka gives four of the children on the tour much the same treatment in response to their petulant demands and self-centered behavior. The ""bad eggs"" drop off the tour two by two one until only a pair remains. Out of all the world, just the smallest percentage of people might have enough basic goodness to pass Wonka's test. Charlie's odds of winning the contest had been equally tiny, so small that even his mathematics teacher couldn't calculate it. With Wonka's secrets so carefully guarded, no wonder all the world went so crazy trying to win a glimpse.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
131,HenryHextonEsq,Very successful film of Dahl.,8,8 January 2003,"Quite the cult film these days, ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" deserves its plaudits, as a well-judged translation of Roald Dahl to film. Dahl's books for children are phenomenally successful in this country; a kind of dry, larger-than-life misanthropy comes through in most of books, along with some moralizing, that tends to exclusively take the child's side. He is a very skilled writer, and adapts his book with pretty much all of the black humour and colourful anarchy intact.Yes, some musical sequences are a trifle stilted; ""Cheer Up Charlie"" just doesn't work in any satisfactory way. In very much a 60s-early 70s musical way, Bricusse and Newley's ""Candy Man"" and ""Imagination"" work, but are not especially brilliant, or enhancing. The Oompa Lumpas' songs and Veruca Salt's precocious, petulant number are pretty good, mind, and really develop the film's moral basis.Set design is truly the strength of the film, appealingly and at times surreally visualizing the Chocolate Factory. Of course, Gene Wilder is the other coup d'etat of the production; coming over as a maniacal, wondrous and deadpan presence. Much of the appeal this film holds for older viewers has to go down to Wilder's wonderfully pitched Wonka: he really defines the part and defies one to think of anyone else in it. Julie Dawn Cole is the most impressive of the juvenile actors; coming over as the ultimate petulant, nigh-on demonic brat of a child. Her comeuppance is lovingly signposted in her musical sequence and then the dispatching. Each child who fails the test is amusingly and quite disturbingly dispatched by a diffident, sardonic Wonka, and then we are given quite sublime little epigrammatic songs by the Oompa Lumpas stating the moral. Some heady stuff for a children's film - ""Who's to blame?""/""It's the MOTHER AND THE FATHER!""
Some eccentric aspects of the book become a little odd on film, like the whole family set-up of the Buckets. Grandpa Joe, as enacted in the flesh, comes across as an increasingly questionable figure - his past laziness seems incorrigibly absurd, and he's seen to touch up some other female attendant of one of the children, when they are in a lift - ""What are you doing?!"" she says. Very curious stuff! Charlie is a simpering bland child who I suppose will do; really it's what you'd expect in a story which has to portray a quite simple idea of virtue and goodness. His being a blue-eyed Aryan child and Grandpa Joe and the rest of the lethargic family being quite obvious American Jews is slightly singular. The setting of the film is another thing; where is Wonka's factory and where does this American Bucket family live? The direction, by Mel Stuart, is maybe at times pedestrian... this is an area where maybe things could have been furthered, but it's an inoffensive, acceptable direction of the film really.As sure as Alastair Cooke being on the BBC, I liked this film. I can find few flaws as to its achieving what it sets out to do. The original book and concept maybe has its flaws to an older viewer, but it's damn well delicious stuff for any child, and there are too few films of which you can say that. The set designers and Gene Wilder really deserve bounteous praise for great efforts which lift the whole thing to its quality.Rating:- ****/*****",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

I love how creative they got, the surprises that came around every corner, and the imagination that almost forced you to use.The musicals weren't cheesy or dumb like many movies, and they fit in with the story plot, so instead of just having some people walking and singing with nothing happening, the movie 'played' in the background with the actors singing.I wasn't scared during the tunnel scene though, even though it's apparently very disturbing.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

Willy Wonka in this film is an unknown man who makes the worlds best candy and of course chocolate. Nobody knows how he makes such wonder candy. As Grandpa Joe tells Charlie: Nobody comes in and nobody comes out. Then one day there is a worldwide announcement. Willy Wonka is having a contest and 5 lucky people will get to tour the factory if they land a golden ticket which is inside his candy bars! Charlie is very curios about the factory and would love to go but his family is very poor and can afford to buy many candy bars but luck seems to be on Charlie's side.

I loved the book as well, but I enjoyed this film even more. No one element of this film makes it great; it is everything about the movie that makes it so lovable. Gene Wilder is perfectly cast as Willy Wonka, going from calm to outraged as well as he later did in ""Young Frankenstein."" Most of the kids manage to fit their roles well, though some come off as a bit too put on, but that doesn't bother me much here. The original songs are a great idea, especially ""Pure Imagination,"" ""The Candy Man,"" and ""Golden Ticket."" It was an ingenious idea to turn this great story into a musical. The chocolate room is still an enchanting scene, even though I am grown up now. The scene still makes me want to try all the kinds of candy in the room. Above all, I think it is the lovable, moral story that makes this film so great. This film can teach kids good lessons about selflessness and thinking of others. The ending is perfect and touching.

Gene Wilder was perfectly cast as the candy man and is the main reason that this film is regarded as a classic. Watching it back, I was surprised at how long it took to finally meet Wonka and enter his factory - nearly 45 minutes! While the moments leading up to October 1st at 10:00am added character depth and motivation, I found myself impatiently waiting for the real adventure to begin.Once in the factory, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. As the guests meandered through the marvelous world of Wonka's chocolate factory, the absurdities became marvels and I instantly trusted in Wonka's all-knowing behavior. Even when child after child fell by the wayside, it's Wonka's careless, yet confident control of each situation that makes you forget the severity of the situation. With a strong message of the consequences of misbehaving, the real essence of this film is in the limitless possibilities of imagination.

138,Ginger87,Alright but Sought of Disturbing,6,12 August 2004,"*SPOILERS*The first time I saw this movie I was six years old. I remember watching it with my babysitter and I was very scared during parts of this movie. What happened to those children scared me and grossed me out. None of the children deserved what happened to them. Big deal they were greedy when it came to candy, like all children. They DID NOT deserve to blow up or get stuck in a pipe full of chocolate. That's just gross. It took me many years till I would watch this movie again. Last week I watched this movie for the second time on HBO. It wasn't as bad as I remembered but I still believe Willy Wonka hates children. The Oompa Loompas are another story. They're just plain scary looking. They belong in a horror film or as Halloween decorations or something.The only thing I liked about this movie were: the big candy (that was cool), the songs, the chocolate river, and little Mike (because he was really cute). I'm glad Charlie won the factory because he was poor.I give this movie 6/10 stars.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
139,Idiot-Deluxe,Frustrating. This movie could have been and should have been so much better.,6,25 May 2017,"Well the first thing you should notice about this film is that the life of Charlie Bucket seems to be nothing more than a cruel, endless cycle of crushing poverty and cabbage water. That is until...I've seen this film a number of times over the years and sadly with all it's great potential it never does completely deliver. Which is a shame, because the film has a terrifically quirky and unusual premise. But I refuse to lie to myself, because I can readily see and hear the many flaws in this film, especially in it's first half, which alternates from being drab and boring, to shrill and irritating. All the while very little of it's humor gels together, making for some very tedious viewing, worse yet are those lame, go-nowhere songs that occur early in the movie. It's only when they get to the Wonka factory that things pick up and the films eccentricities immediately increase ten-fold. However half of this movie IS boring. Gene Wilder (RIP) is simply fantastic as Willy Wonka, the eccentric King of Candy and his performance is, unquestionably, the best thing about the movie; he injects the film with some desperately needed energy, excitement and purpose - which partly makes up for the films painfully slow start.Not surprisingly the second half of the movie is much better, as we the audience are treated to a walking tour of Mr. Wonka's one-of-a-kind chocolate factory, where there is a surprise around every corner. With that being said I think Warner Brothers could have definitely splashed more cash on this film, as I find Wonka's factory, on a visual basis, to be small in scale and a bit underwhelming in it's design; starting with the factory's front gate, in fact from an exterior standpoint, there isn't a single thing that catches your eye, it's completely plain Jane on the outside. The interior sets fare better, but still this film will never win any Oscar's for Art Direction or Set Design, yet had this film been made to the caliber that it should have been, it would have easily won in both those categories. But sadly I find Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory to be a rather ponderous and distinctly underwhelming experience and 46 years after it's release the whole film looks very, very dated. It looks ugly. And while on that note, of all the movies I've ever seen, this film must have one of the ugliest casts of all time; who are made even uglier by their bad clothes and worse hair-cuts and/or comb-overs - particularly the parents of the contest winners. And surely I'm not alone with my hatred for that loud-mouthed, spoiled-rotten, bratty little bitch, Veruca ""I WANT IT NOW!"" Salt! SHE SUCKS! As does her repulsively irritating pappy; these two characters are more a detriment to the film then they are an asset, curiously enough I do like her song though, which is the only one of the movies numerous songs that catches my ear. On her singing number you could say that her bitchiness finally paid off in her final scene, right before Wonka's ""Eggdicator"" determines her, correctly, to be a bad egg.Throughout the tour Willy Wonka keeps things going in a very lively and quirky direction, his factory is indeed loaded with many gimmicks and surprises. Including the fact that in every other room of his factory it looks like there are numerous health code violations being committed, as things often look unsanitary. And is anyone going to object when I mention the fact that machine/set that makes Wonka's ""Everlasting Gobstopper's"" looks as lame, as it does cheap. They clearly didn't try too hard on that one. Once again the Wonka factory should have been a supreme showpiece, a marvel of set design, but unfortunately that's not what we get and that's another missed opportunity, in fact you can say that about nearly every aspect of this film. I have this theory that had it been made 15 years later, in the mid-80's, it would have been so much better, that would have been the perfect time for this movie (for multiple reasons) - not 1971. For instance when this was made Gene Wilder was only in his late-30's, yet at the end of the movie he's all ready to give his factory away to Charlie. What sense does that make??? Early retirement? Then there's the aforementioned dated appearance of the film. The way I see it it's a shame that this project wasn't shelved for a decade-and-a-half. With all that being said Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is still a much better than Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's hideous remake ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", which has the same problems as the first film, only in reverse; the factory looks spectacular, however, the film is utterly ruined by Johnny Depp's hideous performance. Depp made for a VERY weak and effeminate Willy Wonka, a real dandy - Wilder was infinitely better in the role.Ultimately for the reasons given I find Willy Wonka and the Chocholate Factory to be a frustrating and disappointing movie, which had the potential to be a lot better than it ultimately is. This film stands as one of the best examples of Hollywood failing to seize upon and capitalize on what should have been a golden screen epic. Instead it's a botched and somewhat lazily executed film.... but still much better then Burton's Blunder.On a lighter note, whose with me on thinking that ""the most perfect high in existence"" could be achieved through the lighter-than-air combination of Willy Wonka's Fizzy Lifting Drink and (if I were a druggie) a giant, slow-burning, reefer one that's over-flowing with the worlds most potent pot. Tell me that wouldn't be quite a marvelous combination... made better yet if Wonka himself were to make clouds of cotton-candy, as they float low and lazily, that would only further the experience as you're on your way up-up-up to ethereal ecstasy.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
140,schroeder-gustavo,A Film like no other!,10,1 July 2015,"I'm gonna be 100% honest. I usually only a give 10/10 rating when a movie is close to being perfect, when it does everything right. This is not the case with Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, a movie that is flawed, indeed. But the movie is incredibly original, it has a magical feel that I'm not sure many other movies have and has become a part of film and culture in general, that the movie deserves a 10/10 rating.Let's talk about the flaws of the movie first. I understand the film is based on a children's book, but the characters in the film, particularly the parents of the children feel incredibly clichéd and extreme in their way of being. Veruca's father, for example: he's a rich guy who gives his daughter absolutely anything she wants. And by anything I mean anything. He's at an extreme with his personality and so are all the other parents and their children. I get that this helps transmit an important message the film tries to send out: that some children are spoiled little brats, but the reality is that they are only a reflection of their own parents, I get it. But I think they could have made it more subtle and not so much ""in your face"" like in this movie. But that's pretty much it as a movie ""flaw"", but it takes a great part in the movie.Flaws aside, this movie is wonderful. It still looks amazing after nearly 45 years, the humor still holds up and it's just original as hell. Gene Wilder gives an iconic, hilarious performance that will NEVER be topped. Everything from the chocolate room with the chocolate river to the amazing songs in the movie feel magical. Another thing I love about this movie is the themes it handles. Like I mentioned earlier one of them is the raising kids to be spoiled brats theme and also what it means to be humble, like Charlie. The movie is so bizarre and even really scary at times, it is great.An amazing film, even if it has its flaws, they do not hide the fact that Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a film like no other and is, without a doubt, a classic.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
141,highwaytourist,"Great sets and songs, but too mean-spirited",6,25 December 2008,"I was a child when this film was made and I know it's considered a classic. And there's no denying that the sets and the props are outstanding. They truly created a dream world, a child's image of what a chocolate factory would be like. And there are important lessons about how to behave. But the unrelenting meanness of this film was too much. With the exception of the hero, the children are overly obnoxious. What are the odds that of all the winners of the contest, all but one would be among the worst a parent could raise? Julie Dawn Cole is absolutely brilliant in her role as an obnoxious debutante and the other actors do well. Also, the musical numbers are well-written and performed. But it seems as if the naughty are being set up to do bad things so that Wonka can have an excuse to see them suffer. Willie Wonka at times seems to lure the children into misbehaving so he can enjoy watching them get punished. The unrelenting nastiness permeates the entire movie and as a result, I never enjoyed it as much as I wanted to.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

For a 70s children-grownup fairytale morality flick, this was pretty amusing: I was as curious as the kids when we as the audience entered with them the factory! Paradise awaits!I really enjoyed the simplicity (not too many different sets, well chosen on-location settings (Munich has some great places!) and - from today's view' -seemingly 'low budget' ideas... that pretty much convey the message.I felt right in 'Alice in Wonderland' and believe many other artists adapted pieces of the set (and sweets design)... how about the Weasley Brothers from Harry Potter? And (earlier and recent) costumes of DC's Joker had some significant similarities, wether by accident or not.I really do enjoy the way it skillfully blends entertainment and a serious underlying moral, even if Roald Dahl did not love the movie adaptation of his (very genius!) story... This movie is for kids and grown-ups and conveys still the same things to both of them. Don't get greedy or all the other things and good things will be handed to you!

Watching it as an adult was a refreshing experience and here's the takeaways:* Gene Wilder plays every scene with a delicious naughtiness. Quoting classic literature and delivering every line with perfect comic timing and deadpan delivery. Can you imagine Roald Dahl's preferred choice of Spike Milligan playing Willy Wonka?* The film has a lot of dark comedy. I was a huge fan of Roald Dahl when I was a child and there was often a dark streak to his children's novels.* There is some great photography in places.* Every song is great in my opinion. Most musicals rarely have more than two good songs.The bad bits:
* Some of the set design is very cheap looking. The giant sweets that look like painted beach balls, the fibreglass mushrooms, the chocolate river that looks more like mud.* With it being a 70s film, the boat scene is bit psychedelic, man. Very much of its time.* Unfortunately, it inspired Tim Burton to create an insipid and camp, but not very sincere remake.Overall, it is a bit creepy, I can't deny it. It's also possibly a bit too scary for very young children. All that said it is a fun romp and has left a cultural legacy which clearly visible by the number of songs that sample audio from the film.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

Jack Ablertson is very good at Grandpa Joe. Peter Ostrum did a wonderful job as Charlie Bucket. The end of the movie was perfect. This movie is about Charlie Bucket was looking for Wonka's Golden Ticket so that he wins and gets to see the Wonka's Factory. Finding the Golden Ticket is to look for any Wonka Bars. There are about 5 Golden Tickets to allow five children to his factory to win. Charlie Bucket won the Golden Ticket. So he runs home and tells the family that Charlie won the golden ticket.

147,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 100,10,30 September 2016,"I feel like I'm dreaming each time I watch this movie. It's one of my favorites and has meant a lot to me in my life.Definitely one of a kind, due to it's adamant surrealism, it appeals to both kids and adults.The elusive Wonka chocolate factory is holding a worldwide contest so that 5 lucky winners can finally get a glimpse inside the factory walls and win a lifetime supply of chocolate.It's supposed to take place in America, but maintains an industrial European feel. Charlie Bucket, our protagonist, lives with his mother and 4 grandparents. They're very poor, and rely on Charlie's paper route money to get by. Which is why Charlie wants, more than anything, to win this contest.Anyone who's ever known they wanted something more than anyone else in the world can relate to Charlie's childlike desire to win Wonka's contest. It may seem frivolous, but that only highlights Charlie's desperation. He can only imagine luxurious things. And that ingenuous mindset is what just may give him what he needs.The film enraptures you within the first 35 minutes, before we even get inside the magical factory. And once we're in, the film ascends to a whole new level. So full of unique ideas and concepts. Set pieces that made people depressed about the movie's fictionality long before Avatar's ever did.And Willy Wonka, himself, portrayed by Gene Wilder, is a marvel. No other man could have given us such a brilliant performance. He's sweet, he's creepy, he's sincere, and he's mischievous. Roald Dahl's original 1964 novel could be adapted for film one thousand times over, yet Wilder will always remain exclusively synonymous with the role.Oh yeah, and the music is phenomenally perfect.For being a ""flop"" from 1971, this film holds up better than most, if not all, of its contemporaries.Twizard Rating: 100",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

But I decided to review it now since there is nothing else to do. I have finally decided my favorite movie I have seen so far in my lifetime and that would not be this movie but the movie I reviewed before this and that movie is ""The Untouchables"" and I realize that ""The Untouchables"" is R rated and is very violent but who cares? I liked it anyway and that's that. Going on this movie is another spectacular film of its time and it is starring Charlie (Peter Ostrum), his grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson), and Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder)! Let me define this movie and I know almost all the lines by heart since I've seen it about a thousand times. Okay, Charlie hears about golden tickets (5) being put into (obviously) 5 Wonka bars being shipped all over the world. Charlie does not have confidence that he is going to win but yet he (You know the story). He discovers an amazing chocolate factory from a chocolate waterfall, to a dark tunnel, to an inventing room, to an Oompa Loompa, to a HSAWAKNOW (which is WONKAWASH spelled backwards), to a Wonkavision room, to another Oompa Loompa, and so on I did not list all of the things Charlie and the other brats saw because I'm too lazy. Going on Charlie (according to Willy Wonka) is the best most docile person inside the factory but Charlie doesn't know that. Then Charlie seems to have more confidence in himself because all the other brats are all gone except for him at the end of the movie. You find out the ending and by now you should know that without me telling you. This film was remade with the same people except Charlie's dad was in the remake. The dad was dead in the original film ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"". The very quirky Tim Burton directed ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I'm a fan of him but when it came to seeing that movie, I was not too fond of him. Later I went to see ""Tim Burton's Corpse Bride"" and that was a great movie so I changed my mind again about Tim Burton. Okay?! Got it?! Why did I like ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory""? Because I thought the story was very unique (duh Roald Dahl) and because it had good acting esp. by Gene Wilder and it was overall entertaining.

But he wasn't in the movie at all. What's up with that? I haven't seen the remake yet. I'm sure it's just as good, if not better, than this film. But I know it's not a musical like the original. (At least I hope it isn't.)My only other problem is how it ended. Mr. Wonka, Charlie, and Grandpa Joe were in the Great Glass Elevator; (although Mr. Wonka calls it a ""Wonkavator"") the last part was them flying through the sky.In the book, they actually go back to Charlie's house and pick up the rest of the family.

The plot is rather good too. Sure, like I said, it strays from the book in some ways, but the characters seem to be more faithful to the book. Charlie is a normal human boy with flaws like everyone else. Violet isn't a tomboy and has a feminazi mother, Veruca throws tantrums and screams and the TV addict boy is smart as well as smart allecky.

155,byson5186,Looks More Realistic Than The 2005 Version,9,18 September 2014,"I used to really love Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory as a kid. This movie is a timeless movie that you can frequently find on TV, like ABC Family. It's interesting how a movie where the kids are from the Post World War 2 Baby Boom Generation, can appeal to the kids of the next generations. Comparing this film to the 2005 version, I only saw the 2005 version once. While the 2005 version seems to add more to the book, I liked this one better. I liked the kids better in the 2005 version as they're kids from my generation. However, while watching the 2005 version I felt like it looked less realistic, the chocolate and scenery being from special effects, and the factory in the 2005 version looked so unrealistically huge. Watching this 1971 one, the way they show the factory looks more like a realistic Willy Wonka's factory than the 2005 one, even the scenery around the factory and gadgets. The 2005 one seemed more like entering a fictional virtual world from how I remember it. Also, I think Gene Wilder plays a more realistic version of Willy Wonka than Johnny Depp. The characters in this one also seem more realistic than the characters in the 2005 version. This movie often times frequently has references from it, like I frequently see pictures online of Willy Wonka during the Everlasting Gobstopper scene with some message. So, this movie has stood the test of time. While it's been awhile since I've seen it, I still think of it as an enjoyable movie to watch and I feel like everybody deserves to see Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory at least once.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

157,DeanNYC,The Best Film Ever - With Only One Redeeming Character and the Villain's Name in the Title!,8,25 August 2021,"""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" is a beloved children's classic movie with lots of nods to adult viewers, throughout. It certainly earns the eight stars I gave it, thanks in great part to the endearing musical score, composed by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse. However, if we are going to be honest, and I think we should be, we need to see what's actually happening in this screenplay.My first assertion is that there is only one redeeming character in this film: Charlie Bucket, as played by young towhead, Peter Ostrum. Literally every other character with a speaking part does something that proves they are selfish, thoughtless, manipulative (or manipulatable, which might be worse), greedy or just plain rotten. You wouldn't want to be around ANY of these people for any length of time. Seriously. That's extremely rare for a film that people generally like!A quick aside. Some might argue that the Oompa-Loompas should be considered ""redeeming characters."" The reason why they are not is because they are, essentially, a ""Greek Chorus."" They are commenting on the actions of the characters, mostly without ever interacting with them at all.But the more crucial thing to note about this film is that the main antagonist, the ""bad guy"" of the movie is Willy Wonka, himself! I've seen commentary that has suggested the other four Golden Ticket winners, or their parents or the obvious target, Jack Albertson's Grandpa Joe deserve to share the infamy. I get it, and Grandpa Joe is, in nearly every way, the most despicable parental figure in the film for many reasons (like, laying in bed for twenty years, then suddenly being capable of a song and dance production number to the tune, ""I've Got a Golden Ticket"" -- No, Joe, YOU don't have anything! That's Charlie's ticket!) so, let me briefly explain why this dishonor belongs completely to Willy Wonka.First, Wonka has placed five Golden Tickets into his standard candy bars, offering the winners a tour of his factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate. Therefore, he is making all of this happen (at an incredible profit). Second, he is a saboteur. He hired a guy to pretend to be his rival, asking the winners to steal an Everlasting Gobstopper! Third, he pretends to be disabled, just for a sight gag. Fourth, he gets everyone inside of his factory and THEN shows them an enormous contract they must sign to continue. Additionally, much of the fine print is illegible. That leads to fifth, disqualifying each winner from receiving the prize, for breaking Wonka's unreadable rules.Along the way, Wonka tempts the winners with things he knows they find irresistible (a piece of gum for Violet, a chance to be on television for Mike, etc.), never fully disclosing his intentions or goals. He used the ticket winners' interests to make them Guinea Pigs for his beta test level products, then punishes them when it all goes wrong. And he has a demonic boat!Finally, the most atrocious element is why Wonka did all of this: he was looking for a protégé, a person whom he could train to do everything HIS way, so he could retire, knowing his replacement would robotically follow his instructions. Also Wonka was clearly not more than forty years old, and was doing a job he presumably loved. Why would or should he retire?BUT, the reason why we forgive EVERYTHING can be summed up in two words: Gene Wilder.Mr. Wilder's portrayal of the title character not only makes Wonka palatable, it makes all of his bad deeds so obscure, he's charming and loveable! That is an amazing testament to the actor and his genuine goodness and talent. Without Wilder, this movie would likely have been forgotten and certainly never would have had a real candy company founded, a film reboot, a Broadway musical and a prequel!All hail Willy Wonka. All hail the amazing Gene Wilder.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
158,irishm,Not as bad as I thought it would be,4,30 December 2014,"This is a pretty insulting title for a review, I know. But I don't like fantasy as a rule, and Roald Dahl's imagination tends to creep me out severely, so there was no point in my seeing this film at any point over the past 40+ years, even though I was the target age when it first came out in theaters. But, it finally came up free on streaming and I figured what the heck, I could always turn it off.I haven't read the book or seen the Johnny Depp re-make (there's another guy who creeps me out severely), but I do like Gene Wilder, he turned in a good performance here, and he was reason enough for me to finish the whole thing. I kept forgetting it was a musical just a handful of mostly lame, forgettable, awkwardly-inserted songs. To show you how little I knew about this film going in, I was actually surprised to find that the song ""The Candyman"" originated here. (Back to severely creepy for a moment: whoa, that Candyman guy needs to be closely watched by local law enforcement; he just oozed 'predator'!) The four grandparents in the same bed together all those years was disturbing thanks, Mr. Dahl, for yet another grotesque image. I can only imagine what some small children might think of the chubby kid getting stuck in the chocolate pipe, the ""funhouse"" boat ride, etc., not to mention the scary-looking Oompa Loompas heck, I'm twice their size and I wouldn't mess with 'em! Of course, any tour that starts with the signing of a waiver immediately indicates how dangerous this tour is going to be, so viewers (not to mention the characters) have been fairly warned. Who even *thought* about waivers in 1971? Almost nobody, right? And was I the only one wondering why minor children were allowed to sign this supposedly legal contract instead of their guardians?(Okay, I'm over-thinking this part, but still that looked ridiculous.) To those who complain that it didn't follow the book: as I said, I haven't read it, so I can't agree or disagree. But I would point out that the ""Wizard of Oz"" movie wasn't especially faithful to the book either. (Thank goodness I couldn't stand the book!) Watchable. Not lousy, not good, but watchable(particularly for Gene Wilder fans).",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
159,daveisit,Thanks Roald,8,7 November 2000,"A reason that is often overlooked on the brilliance of ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" is the author of the original book. Roald Dahl not only creates wonderful characters, he has the ability to perfectly capture children's imagination. Aside from Dahl's writing, there are strong performances throughout the movie especially Gene Wilder as ""Willy Wonka"" who is perfect. Germany's Michael Bollner as ""Augustus Gloop"" should also be applauded for the delivery of his lines which for him were in a foreign language, although not entirely convincing.Even if this movie was butchered by the director, which it certainly wasn't, it would have been good.

It told me you can be a man and be fun, serious, creative, silly, witty, magical. Gene Wilder portrays all the masculine archetypes of warrior, lover, magician and king in this role perfectly. Perfect casting. Peter Ostrum would become a veterinarian and his only role but he was brilliant. If you are a fan of The Andy Griffith Show you will note a song in the movie which is a theme used on the show. It is a beautiful musical passage used when Andy and Opie connected after some misunderstanding written by Earle Hagen. This can be heard when Charlie and Grandpa almost get booted from the factory in Willy's office. Very emotional scene. It is almost a note for note comparison and easily missed if you're a fan of TAGS.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

Which is probably why I can still confess to loving this film now I've reached adulthood. Catchy tunes, colourful scenarios, Gene Wilder as the irrepressible Willy Wonker... This film has everything and demands nothing except that you suspend disbelief for an hour and half whilst it takes you on a wild and imaginative ride. All the film wants to do is entertain and that's just what it does (and more) - truly a good film in a weary world.9/10",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

My father spent most of the time outside the car with a friend of his drinking beer having never been a fan of fantasy and subsequently reported to my mother that the film was stupid.I, of course, did not find it so. It is one of my most wonderful memories from childhood, and the sheer delight that I get from watching it remains when I watch it even today.I read the ""Charlie"" books after this, but I have to confess it is the movie that sticks in my head. I will always see Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka and Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe. I loved the song ""Pure Imagination"" and have used it to inspire myself from time to time through out my life. I think this film to a pleasant diversion that everyone should take.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

A timeless classic that transcends generations.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
167,elisereid-29666,My all-time favorite movie-and one of the few from my childhood to *truly* hold up!,10,13 January 2020,"This film-along with the book, and the others also by Roald Dahl-was my obsession when I was in second grade. Dahl himself described his success as a children's storyteller by saying he ""sided with children against adults"", and perhaps that is why I loved it so much at an age when I was very angry at most of the adults in my life. (Though in retrospect, perhaps reading comprehension wasn't my strength-I embodied all the negative characteristics of the four ""bad"" kids in one package!).The film's story is directed and told with simplicity, which is how it should be. Even the ending that differs from the book suits the material in a way that is unique to cinema. Unlike modern-day films, the special effects necessary to create the illusions in the film are kept at a minimum, which leads us to view them not as special effects, but as ""real"" events, no matter how fantastic (compare the famous ""big blueberry"" scene in this film with its counterpart in the Tim Burton version, and you'll see what I mean).The protagonist, Charlie (Peter Ostrum) is not given a whole lot to do in any version of this story, especially when compared with Wonka himself (the late, great Gene Wilder in his best performance) and the other kids, but this allows us to project and imagine ourselves as Charlie, and thus the story is stronger for it. Among the kids, the standout character in both the book and the film is Veruca Salt, played by Julie Dawn Cole, and she is a certifiable scene thief indeed. Now, I have had this film memorized for close to twenty-five years, but every time she makes demands of her ""daddy"" (Roy Kinnear), I can't stop cracking up, just as I did when I was eight.The music is also wonderful, though not entirely true to the tone of Dahl's book-however, the film compensates for it. ""Pure Imagination"" in particular is beautiful, especially in how the scene is staged. In a more typical musical, the song would've been treated as a bravura show-stopper that would've detracted from whatever sense of reality the film would've conveyed up to that point. Instead, the scene is underplayed, allowing the melody to set the stage for the scene without overpowering it. The pauses between lines allow for some delicious character details for both Wonka and the kids, not interrupting the momentum at all as it might seem. The slow pace of the song floods us with the mood intended. (I understand Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley, the authors of the music, were opposed to this interpretation of the song-ironic, given how this turned out to be one of the most memorable scenes in the film).Most films from my childhood, I can look back on with some distance and say ""Yeah, the film itself isn't that great, but the memories of watching it color it for me so that I can still kinda see it as I did then"". Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is an exception-when I reviewed it last night for the purpose of writing about it, it had the same power on me that it did when I first saw it in 1994.I'll end on an unusual sidenote of the dual nature of the screenplay. The first time I heard the opera ""The Marriage of Figaro"" by Mozart, the very first thing I noticed was that the opening notes of the overture were, in fact, the notes played by Wonka to open the ""musical lock"" on the Chocolate Room door in this film, and I couldn't help but giggle. ""Rachmaninoff,"" says Mrs. Teavee in the scene, incorrectly. The film assumes that we know she is wrong, thus assuming the best about the viewer-much more than it would've had a more familiar melody been used. And that, truly, is the most valuable thing about the film-it approaches the audience as if it is intelligent, perhaps more than it should...",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

It's one of her favorites. I liked it well enough back then, but it's only now that I'm older that I can appreciate the true sinister glory of this movie. It's so deliciously creepy! For those who have to whine about how messed up it is, consider the original ""Cinderella."" Now that was awful. Willy Wonka is the stranger with a bag of chocolate that parents are always warning their kids about, but what he's really offering is a seductive nightmare in a kaleidescope of candy colors, a cautionary tale told with fairy story whimsy. I got it when I was 5, but the thrill didn't register. ""A dirty trick on innocent children?"" Some people out there obviously don't remember what it's really like to be a kid. Childhood is full of booby traps and the allure of the forbidden, and that which is evil frequently looks divine. ""Willy Wonka"" is about giving in and seeing the horrors and delights, the choices and pratfalls  on the other side. It's disturbing because it strikes a certain primal chord: freedom and danger are entwined, and people have never wanted to associate children with either.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

Hallucinogenic tunnels and candy store managers who are way too liberal with their samples are not the only wacky factors in this movie.
When the Wonka announces the golden tickets, the world goes coocoo for cocoa.
Germany goes down first as Augluttonous Goop gets sucked into a choco pipe. Yeah, I know it sounds like a slang word for rectum. This isn't funny people! The kid gets sucked straight into the fudge room. Little Girl Blue discovers the perils of instant obesity, Veruca gets extra salty and then it's Honey, I Shrunk the Brat!
Meanwhile Charlie asks his grandpa question after stupid question.
At the end of the film, Wonksy asks Charlie how he liked the Chocolate factory and Charlie says, ""I think it's the most wonderful place in the whole world.""Really, Charlie?You and your gramps almost got decapitated by a ceiling fan for crying out loud! For all you know, Veruca was incinerated with the rest of the garbage, Violet exploded behind closed doors like a boomberry and August O'Wind is still clogging the pipes.Truth be told, Michael Crichton ripped off this gooey masterpiece when he wrote Jurassic Park. Think about it. Just like Wonka, Mr. Hammond is so enamored with his creations, he is completely oblivious to the risks they pose to his guests. His enthusiasm for showing off his dreamland is so dense that when people start dying, he explains that, ""it's just a delay.""

If I were 10 years old and I encountered Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka, I would run screaming from his presence as fast as my terrified little legs would carry me.  I certainly wouldn't accept an invitation to visit his hellish chocolate factory where small children are slurped to their demise in giant vats of confection.

So many leftovers from when your parents were your age to explore. My grandmother had two videos from that time I would watch over and over with my sister whenever we came to visit- Willy Wonka was one. Everything about the movie oozes, pops, and dazzles with charm. And the greatest thing is, it only gets more hilarious as I get older.I remember how incredibly bad I wanted to win a golden ticket and make my way into that goodie-filled candy factory. Each scene was decadent and filled with as much eye-candy as real candy in a way only the 60's and 70's could do it. I loved the songs because they weren't sung by singers. Yes, they weren't all that great, but that's what was so amazing. Real human voices that didn't come out of the synthetic can. Plus, they didn't make me sound like crap when I joined in. I also like that none of these people (excluding Gene Wilder) are very well known. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen any of them outside this film. It helps make the characters all the more real.The humor is amazing in the film, and it works on so many levels! I used to think this movie was hilarious because of all the silly situations, but now I listen to what Willy Wonka is actually saying, and I can hardly stop laughing. Its genius.As I said earlier, the cast was really genuine and great, but the absolute gem of the film is without a doubt Gene Wilder. He IS Willy Wonka. Wild, fun, just a tinge of darkness, and INSANE. No matter what film I see him in, I always first think Willy Wonka. His every nuance is perfection.

(It is now 2005 and I have the DVD) Gene Wilder really makes this so delightful. I remember as a kid that at times I really liked him, and in others I was almost scared.

Although this is a family film this movie is not just an entertaining comedy but an intellectual and meaningful tale on imagination. Willy Wanka is a film filled with important life lessons to teach kids as well as parents.
Gene Wilder's classic performance gives this movie so much charm, so much entertainment and the importance of using your imagination.I also love the dry humor that Gene Wilder provides in his role. The soundtrack is timeless and completely unforgettable. From the classic loompa songs that go over important values like gluttony, greed, pride, ego and in the case of Mike TV the importance of reading, learning and being imaginative, to the songs sung by the characters this score adds so much to the film.

And those Umpa-Loompas give me the creeps. The whole movie gives me nightmares. The acting was so-so as was the directing. It is on my top of list of worst movies ever made. It is unbelievably unbelievable. The only thing really believable was the spoiled brat girl who turned into a blueberry. I'm unsure that I can say enough bad things about the movie fit the guidelines. This is most certiantly a movie I will never own.

Gene Wilder is perfect as Wonka, and his one liners are still side-splittingly funny. Some parents get concerned about the message this film sends out to youngsters, but my daughter certainly gets it. Charlie doesn't get away with stealing fizzy lifting drinks, as was suggested by another user, but rather makes up for it by returning the Everlasting Gobstopper, and that's why he gets the factory in the end. The Oompa-Loompa songs still get stuck in your head for days after, and the kids do a very good job of playing kids, who can be, to quote Hobbes, ""nasty, brutish, and short."" Do yourself a favour and see this movie. I hear a remake is in the pipeline with Nicolas Cage as Wonka. Somebody'd better hurry up and correct this error before principal photography begins; it's not that I have anything against Cage, but he's totally wrong for the part. Better to do a remake that hews more closely to the book and cast someone like Rowan Atkinson as Wonka. He's supposed to be an odd little man, not a brooding action hero. The other frightening possibility is Will Smith, who again is totally wrong for almost the same reason. Unless you're going to do it right, don't bother.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

I wouldn't of choice no one better for the role! I'm glad that Mel Stuart cast him in that role! I also liked Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe.

The film deals with a few children who are given golden tickets to visit Wonka's factory to find the heir to Wonka. The children are all stereotypes which is really funny and you could almost translate that into today(wait they did, in a bad remake). I love Gene Wilder's performance as Wonka. The songs are memorable, almost like Disney songs. Just those songs that everybody knows. The remake took a stake and jabbed it into my childhood. The sets are dated, but that makes them even cooler. The film has a pretty good supporting cast and added to the film, unlike the Buton version.

That's how good it is to me.Gene Wilder, who plays Wonka, is a very believable character here. I admire the way he portrayed his role as being one of ""pure imagination"", just as the storyline goes. The same goes for the entire cast. I had read Roald Dahl's ""Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator', and this is so much like it.But...why my guilty pleasure? I have to snicker when I told her that both Julie Dawn Cole (Veruca Salt) and Denise Nickerson (Violet Beauregard) were my very first childhood crushes.

186,pirate1_power,Exploring the Chocolate Factory,7,7 July 2005,"With the release of Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory looming upon us, I think it's time we explored the original one more time.One commentator whose review of this film was totally hostile got a lot of the elements of the production's backstory utterly incorrect. Thank goodness that Mel Stuart, the film's director, set everyone straight with his recently published book, ""Pure Imagination: The Making of 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'."" According to Mel, his then 12-year-old daughter, who had read the Roald Dahl book, was the person who first suggested the idea for the film, and that her father take the idea to his then boss, producer/presenter David L. Wolper. After Mel did exactly that, Wolper in turn took the idea to executives at the Quaker Oats Company.""Quaker Oats? That's not a studio, that's a food company,"" Mel told Dave. But that, oddly, was exactly why Quaker wanted to get into the movies to begin with: to promote a candy bar to be made by its then confectionery division. The irony: even when the Wonka movie was completed, Quaker never got around to manufacturing its proposed candy bar, let alone promoting it.Yes, the film was released in its original theatrical run by Pararmount, but the initial deal called for that studio to hold onto the U.S. distribution rights for seven years, at the end of which time said rights would revert back to Wolper Pictures, Limited and the Quaker Oats Company, who, after all, were the joint copyright holders of the film. Paramount was anxious to relieve itself of that 7-year deal anyway, and was therefore not willing to renew the terms of the deal. In 1977, David L. Wolper sold his namesake Organization to Warner Bros., at which point he then joined WB's Board of Directors, ultimately selling to Warners his own and Quaker Oats' 50% shares in the Wonka movie.The Stuart book explores the terms of the deal in greater detail than can be shared here; suffice to say, the incident shows us just how unwilling we sometimes are to get all the behind-the-scenes facts straight. It seems to me, friends, that Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory in its 1971 version was a film reeking of sweetness and magic, yet created specifically as an infomercial for a candy bar that in the end was neither manufactured, marketed or distributed. Today, any movie with a candy bar as its centerpiece would not be burdened with such problems; movie dealmaking today is more covering every base than skipping certain loopholes.Besides, I think the Burton remake represents a perfect opportunity to celebrate and re-examine the Wonka legacy.

187,hokiemo,A movie for those with an imagination and dreams of riches.,8,21 January 2003,"Overall, a terrific children's movie with an original plot.  Back when the movie came out, the set looked fine enough for kids to enjoy, but with today's technology some of it does look sort of cheesy and cheap.  Gene Wilder is perfectly cast as Willy Wonka, the holed up genius responsible for the factory's success.  Wonka has personality and charm, but also backbiting humor.  He is looking for an unselfish child to run his factory one day. He puts every winning ticket child to the test by inviting them to visit his factory so he can see their true character and motives.  He sees right through people's selfish motives and the accidents they cause in his factory are all the children's doings (or undoings).As a child, I didn't pay a lot of attention to the message of the oompa lumpahs and spoiled bratty kids.  I wasn't allowed to watch much TV and we didn't have much money so that's probably why I didn't think they were singing to me.  Adults will get the message and appreciate it.  A movie about good kids finishing first is always uplifting.  Many baby boomers and generation x-ers look fondly back on the movie and the effects the fantasy had on their childhood.  My boyfriend never saw the movie and I know he wouldn't enjoy it as an adult (he particularly loves car chase movies).

The film became an instant favorite with me and I have never gotten tired of it. This is a movie that can easily captivate both children and adults with its wonder, excitement, and magical elements. The most mesmerizing moment in this movie gem is the chocolate room sequence where the children, and their guardians, eat almost everything in sight. Ever since I first saw this picture, I have had the dream of being in such a wondrous, colorful atmosphere where the sweets are dominant. I love to eat sweets so its no wonder that this movie is such a favorite with me.This family film is vastly amusing and will want to be viewed over and over again by children who practically live for candy and other sweets.

I do know that my sister and I watched this so many times as kids that we must've worn out the VHS tape we had of it. There are just so many funny moments in this. The scenes with Mr. Turkentine are some of my favorites. This was a particularly good piece of writing. The scenes where the rush is on to get Wonka Bars are great too. Especially where the lady has to think about whether or not to give up a case of Wonka Bars to save her husband's life. The kids were all good in this, the parents were all good in this but the real shining star would have to be Gene Wilder. I'm a fan of all his movies but this performance was exquisite. His sarcasm humor, his wacky behavior and his one-liners are funny even by today's standards. Having seen the 2005 remake, there is absolutely no comparison. This is a clear case where the original is FAR superior to the remake. Favorite lines would have to be ""Speak a little louder, I'm a trifle deaf in one ear"" and of course (the rebuttal to spitting being a dirty habit) ""I can think of a worse one"". Combine that to all of the scenes (no exception) where the kids do something stupid in the factory that results in the consequences we all remember. ""Don't, Stop, Come Back!"" ""Always when they get to the desert"" That's Funny! This holds up today as a good one. The Oompa Loompas were good too. I'm amazed at how well they were able to coordinate seeing as how many of them spoke different languages, very impressive!Like everything that Gene Wilder plays a leading character in, he really embodies this one. You can watch this one over and over and you have to admit that he really nailed that one. Perfect 10 out of 10",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
191,Don Muvo,Simply indispensable,9,25 December 2004,"All the ideas that Rould Dahl puts into his book ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" are here in an imaginative visual form appropriate to the time it was made. A lot of attention was paid to the sets and visual effects, clever special effects such as a trap door and miniturization testify to the care that the producers put into making this movie. The theme of the movie is difficult for adults. There are bad children in the world. They come from bad parents, they're not created by emulation, but rather the parents ""produce them"", much like chocolate is produced in a factory. The factory is populated by miniature people named oomphaloopas that remind the listener at intervals of Dahl's moral points: Too much TV is bad for children, books should be read instead, and children need to adhere to an ethical code of some sort in order to grow up strong. And who knew Gene Wilder had such a beautiful singing voice! The music is some of the best show music of it's time, including ""The Candy Man"".",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
192,usersince03,Great film better than the 2005 remake,10,13 September 2010,"The first time I saw this film was about 15 years ago when I was at school. This is about Charlie Bucket winning a ticket to go to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory with 4 other children. As a kid I found it frightening when Violet turned blue when she had that gum that wasn't meant to be chewed. I liked the songs in the film, I used to find the song Cheer Up Charlie boring but I like it better now I'm older. As much as I love Johnny Depp I thought this version was better than the 2005 remake. Roald Dahl may of disapproved of the film but I thought it was great. I think the all the cast members did a great performance. The one scene that I found boring was when Charlie and his Grandad stole fizzy lifting drink and was floating in the air.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
193,Zorro-3,This was Gene Wilder's movie.,8,3 February 2001,"Like the great Jack Nicholson lent a bit of his soul to that hack Stephen King in the ""Shining,"" the wondrous Gene Wilder made a relatively stupid book a damn fine film. As a child, I read most of Dahl's fare and found most of it pretty lame (PARTICULARLY his really stupid sequel to ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" what was it called, ""The Great Glass Elevator,"" or something like that?) The only thing he ever wrote that even remotely creeped me out was ""The Magic Finger."" He should have written that and only that and then gotten a day job. One of the big laughable things about ""Willie Wonka"" is the Dickensian thing. When not at home Charlie appears to live in the prosperous 1960's USA. But at home, he appears to live the life of Oliver Twist. His ma took in laundry and stirred it in a large cauldron. They hurt for every penny, ate cabbage soup. Where was DFACS? Did they not get food stamps?
And Jack Albertson's character should have been really ashamed of himself. He hadn't been out of bed for twenty years? Once up and about, he seemed quite robust to me. The only thing that makes this movie worth a damn is Gene Wilder. He is a dark master. SPOLIER ALERT!The ending was different also. In the book, Charlie did no wrong. In the movie, he stole Fizzy Lifting Drinks. In the book, Willie Wonka (who had no dark side) suddenly noticed that Charlie was the only one left and declared him the winner. In the movie, he had to pass the final test. (Making the movie superior.)In the movie, the Oompa-Loopmas were orange. In the book they were black. (Making the book racist, but not the movie.) The movie improved upon the book. Roald Dahl was a hack. But at least he had the sense to marry Patricia Neal. As a child, I had a crush on Julie Dawn Cole.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

When we have a much better remake out there I know what film of the Roald Dahl story I much prefer to Watch. I know how people love this version and hate the 2005 remake with Johnny Depp, But I love Johnny Depp he is the definitive Willy Wonka. Kids get Bored at this film because there is no joy in it and no sense of imagination to it although Gene Wilder keeps singing his chocolate factory is a world of pure imagination, Johnny Depp's chocolate factory is a world of pure imagination. I just hate this movie because it is boring and it drags on far too long at 100 minutes but it feels longer. Boring Boring Boring!

Though Willy Wonka is obviously crazy, he's crazy in a good way, and he sings two of my favorite songs. (One is about springtime being the ring-a-ling-a-ling time. The other is ""Pure Imagination."") The oompah-loompahs also sing songs with real meaning about the behavior of children which most parents should take a lesson from. It's an educational farce about the problems of our modern world coming from the permissiveness of parents who allow their children to indulge in all sorts of selfish gratification. Chewing gum, overeating, watching too much television, and general greed and covetousness are all condemned, and finally, integrity is praised. This is a movie all children should see, and parents who haven't seen it should see it as well, though they might want to fast-forward through the first half-hour.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

Seeing it as an adult I'm taken back to where I was as a kid watching it. The magic, the settings, the characters, the music, even the effects are still enchanting. It's a marvelous little flick about hope, earnestness, kindness, honesty, with the lovely darkness that Roald Dahl always brings.

199,Crystal_Hansen,This is the stuff I grew up with,10,20 February 2019,"I grew up watching this version. I've never read the book by Roald Dahl, but i liked this movie. I'm not a huge fan of the new version because Johnny Depp isn't one of my favorite actors and the way Wonka is portrayed drives me crazy. I always felt like Wonka should be the person that he's portrayed as in this version.He's a nice candy maker that hides in his candy shoppe. Then he invites five people to go into the shoppe only if they find the golden tickets hidden in his candy bars. When Charlie finds a golden ticket, he decides to take his grandfather with him as the only guest he's allowed to bring. They have the tour of the candy shoppe and are the last ones left at the end. At some point Wonka promises one of the five the candy factory, but refuses to give it to Charlie because of the fizzy lifting drink scene that he doesn't reveal that he knew about the incident until the very end of the film. Charlie feels guilty and returns the everlasting gobstopper which was all part of the plan. Wonka was waiting for one of the children to return the gobstopper and Charlie was the only one left at this point. Wonka gets super excited and exclaims his congratulations. At this point Charlie is super confused by this and when Slugworth comes through a door. Slugworth had asked Charlie to give him the gobstopper at the end so he could figure out how it was made. Charlie learns that Slugworth really works for Wonka and it was designed as a character test. Charlie gets the factory and the movie ends with the famous glass elevator scene.Having grown up with this version, I was quite disgusted by the way the film was redone with Johnny Depp. I've heard that the new version was closer to the book, but I really don't care. I like the old version a lot better. But it's all a matter of opinion.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

I've seen this film many times and am always disappointed.

202,gracegibson,"Better than the book, but still not that good...",6,25 August 2005,"I think most of America, at least, has seen this movie. It's considered a classic in our society and a rite of passage for every American kid. I obviously have seen this movie but I thought it was only just OK. I thought the book was worse but the movie is far from great. The scenes with the Wonka-obsessed adults I thought were presented in a way that was hard for children to understand. I felt like I was watching an adult movie. I have to say this for the book: it did a better job in that department. If anything, this movie wasn't a very good adaptation. Plus, I thought it was a little out-of-character when Wonka blew up at Charlie and his grandpa. That was another element I thought was too grown-up. However, this movie has its winning points. I'm glad that unlike the book, the kids brought one parent each instead of both of them. That makes for less crowding. I also like how they added in Slugworth and his everlasting gobstopper test. All in all, this is just an OK movie. Its atmosphere was just a little too bizarre for my taste. It's still better than the book and mildly enjoyable to watch.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
203,Champion-3,Works on a number of different levels,10,22 January 2001,"The only thing I really dislike about this film is the saccharinity - Charlie, Grandpa and the rest of his family combined with the whole 'perfect poor kid gets lucky' scenario. Oh, and some of the naffer musical numbers.
But, I realise that without this, they would never have got away with making the film. Look deeper, and you see the dark, satirical, hallucogenic fantasy world with no small amount of social commentary, a healthy dose of cynicism and - it has to be said - overtones of paedophilia, almost in the same vein as William Blake's Innocence/Experience poems.This will easily delight an audience of children or the elderly, and will hold their attention but the rest of us can see beyond the healthy family stuff, and watch this film for sheer escapsism value.Notice for example Gene Wilder's portrayal of the eccentric recluse - the beguiling stranger that kids are told never to talk to - and Julie Dawn Cole as spoiled brat verging on seductress. It's not just about interpretation either, I'm sure the film-makers knew exactly what they were doing.The morality tale that was at the core of Roald Dahl's novel is merely there to take the curse of an experimental and enjoyable film: take from it what you will.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

This movie speaks to children as well as the kid inside every adult. It doesn't talk down to kids and isn't afraid to be even a little frightening at times. Everything in the movie seems perfect: the script, the set, the songs, Gene Wilder, Jack Albertson, even the child actors. Only a jaded adult without an imagination would not enjoy this movie.And another thing. This is a story that isn't afraid to moralize a little. As Gene Wilder says in the documentary, the movie tells kids that there are limits, which is what they want and need.One gets the feeling that this movie was lovingly made. If you haven't viewed this movie in a while (or ever), do so. The DVD is an excellent transfer as well and looks every bit as good as the High Definition broadcast on Disney (ABC) I just saw.

206,peterlonglongplong,Dark Humor - the times,8,6 April 2008,"In 1971 our 6th grade class read the book, Charlie & The Chocolate Factory, and that year ""Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory"" came out. The shameful war was still on in the far east. There was still a peace movement happening. Woodstock was fresh in the mind & opposite of what PBS tries to make it look like now, that concert was about peace. Much of the humor in our society was dark. Lyrics from innumerable songs were protesting the war machine & the criminal powers that be. This movie with Wilder and what people like to call a low budget, was very well suited for that time period. For those who say that this movie was sick and evil, it was a FANTASY! Life was serious then, as it still is, and people escape in various ways. I loved the movie, in spite of its imperfections; as if life is perfect.?. Veruca Salt was my love, at least I wanted her to be. ""And by the way..."" the movie is funny in most of the scenes. I was rolling in laughter then & even now. People of now who can't find humor in characters like eccentric & possibly perverted rich old men take life too seriously. Obviously, Wonka's a freaky old self-centered corporate leader. It's good for kids to see this so they can know what to avoid. The book is great. The movie is great, but they're different. I know this movie doesn't lead people to do what these FANTASY CHARACTERS do. I'm not happy with the politics of factories, rich owners, workers struggling to survive (slaves). But, this movie shows the evils of corporations, in my opinion. Kids need to understand how evil the corporate money machine can be....

207,ryanmoynihan,Willy Wonka is a Dangerous Man. Do Not Cross Him,7,22 September 2020,"The sets are fun and interesting to look at and the performances and songs are iconic. The only thing that I feel conflicted on is the moral character of Willy Wonka. We all know the children are mean and spoiled, but they're constantly put in mortal danger by this man. I don't like them either dude, but they don't deserve to die! Jeez . . .I'd also say the mother's song ""Cheer Up, Charlie"" probably should have been left on the cutting room floor and nothing of value would have been lost.Other than that this movie is alot of fun. The director's background in documentary filmmaking really shows in the best possible way here. The world feels authentic even beyond how cartoonish it all is on the surface. Every scene leading up to the factory is like a short documentary piece about each child as they're interviewed by a news crew. It's not overstylized. It feels very ""matter of fact"".Gene Wilder's performance as Willy Wonka is the standout here. He tows a fine line between eccentric weirdo and charming inventor. From the outset it's unclear what to expect from him. He walks out to the crowds outside his factory with a very visible limp and slowly makes his way to the gate. Everyone is holding their breath in dismay and suspension. Once he makes it to the end it's revealed to have been an illusion all along. He somersaults the last few steps and the crowd goes wild. He's not quite a charlatan, but rather a showmen. And that scene sets the tone for the rest of the film.I can't write this review without talking about how amazing the boat scene is though. That whole sequence was trippy as hell. I felt like I was spinning and spinning with the whole group.There's loads more I can say, like how good the child actors are, how consistently clever and funny the dialogue is, how great the visual gags are. But chances are you know all about that stuff. This movie is a classic, and for good reason. It's like stepping into some weirdo's colorful and sweet imagination.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

It's a classic, timeless tale that is also very entertaining.The movie is about this kid named Charlie who really wants to see the factory of this famous chocolateer named Willy Wonka. Luckily for him, Wonka is handing out five special golden tickets in five different chocolate bars that can give an opportunity for people to go into his famous candy factory. Somehow, Charlie gets the fifth and final golden ticket and is allowed inside Wonka's factory.

However, Charlie maintains his grip and manages to come out on top after getting the reward of not only a bunch of chocolate, but the entire factory as well.Friends, this movie was spectacular. It has a great plot, great relatable characters, and a funny yet charming plot.

Gene Wilder almost plays second fiddle to the glowing enthusiasm of Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) and the character acting of Jack Albertson (who also played a very small, uncredited role in Miracle on 34th Street).The only mystery for me is where the story took place.  From the movie, it would appear that Charlie's town is somewhere in Europe, judging from the automobiles, driving on the right (ie, not England), and the typical layout of his town, with the cathedral at the center.This movie is an absolute requirement for any serious video collector.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
214,crazydude1989,Simply sweet and full of pure imagination,10,22 July 2008,"I have been a fan of the original Willy Wonka since I was 12 years old, which was way back in 2000-2001. It is my all time favorite movie and the newer remake will never replace it, even if the remake is just OK. The movie is about when the crazy candy maker, Willy Wonka sends out 5 Golden Tickets for a chance to win a tour through his amazing candy factory, run by the mysterious green-haired, orange-faced Oompa Loompa elves, and also win a lifetime supply of chocolate. The children who find them are a spoiled brat named Veruca Salt, a loudmouthed TV addict named Mike Teevee, gumchewer Violet Beauregard, gluttonous Augustus Gloop, and Charlie Bucket--a poor boy who lives with his mom and 4 bedridden grandparents in small house. 4 of the children get their demise thanks to their usual behavior, except for Charlie, and is promised to win a lifetime supply of chocolate, but is almost not given it because he and his Grandpa Joe broke one of Wonka's rules by drinking Fizzy lifting drinks and almost getting chopped to bits by a fan on the ceiling and dirtying it when they bumped into it. However, after Wonka dismisses Charlie and Grandpa Joe, Charlie gives back the Everlasting Gobstopper candy that he gave each of the kids earlier. The gobstopper was Wonka's most secret recipe and he finds out that he passed Mr. Wonka's test of honesty and is given the factory because Mr. Wonka couldn't work there forever, and he wanted to find an honest loving child who can be told all of Wonka's most precious candymaking secrets, and take care of the Oompa Loompas. My favorite parts are when Grandpa Joe does his victory dance ""I've Got a Golden Ticket,"" surprisingly after being bedridden for 20 years, when Charlie finds the ticket and runs home, the psychedelic boat trip, Augustus Gloop falling into the chocolate river, Violet Beauregarde turning into a blueberry thanks to some very special gum, the group first seeing the Chocolate Room, (while Mr. Wonka sings Pure Imagination) when Mr. Wonka leads the group through the beginning of the factory (MR. SALT--Is this some kind of funhouse? WONKA: Why, having fun?) the Wonkawash scene and the very end, when Charlie, Grandpa Joe, and Willy are in the Wonkavator. I know I have more but that's all I can think of. All I can say is, this movie is pure magic, and full of pure imagination, for young and old. So what if it doesn't have fancy computer effects like the 2005 remake? This movie is all real. The 1971 version will always be the best to me, because it's simple, fantastic, magic, funny, and Gene Wilder IS Willy Wonka. Maybe this version isn't true to the book like the 2005 version but this version is special in it's own way. It will remain my favorite movie of all time, with The Muppet Movie probably being second on my list. To end my review, I will say my favorite(and final) line from this movie. ""Don't forget what happened to the man who suddenly got everything he always wantedhe lived happily ever after.""

Depending on who you are, this version's ultra-clarity could ruin it for you. And on the other hand the clarity can add to its charm. Some of the props look very amateurish and aren't modified or transformed enough to hide what it originally was. It's like going back to a N64 game and realising how terrible those hold up and don't match up to your memories, but the game could still be very fun.As for the movie, it's great, it's dark, Wilder is amazing as this ambivalent god within his factory. The songs hold up well, It's one of the few movies I can watch over and over again. I'm also in the camp, after watching the special features, that the ultra-clarity and the fact that you can tell they spray-painted cardboard in some scenes adds to the charm.

Harry Potter wasn't very faithful to the book, and everybody loves those movies. I mean, what's not to like about this movie? Most of the negative reviews come from people who can't see that this movie was in the 70s! Of course it couldn't be over the top colourful and vibrant, as they didn't have that in those days. The 2005 one had Tim Burton at the helm, and quite frankly, that movie just looked plain ugly. Another common piece of criticism is Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka. Apparently 'he doesn't capture Willy Wonka, who's meant to be a quirky, energetic tout guide'. Erm, isn't that basically Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka? I mean, I suppose he isn't that energetic, but he's better than Johnny Depp's awful psychotic, creepy, deranged, man-child.Ignore what a lot of people say, this version is infinitely better, no matter how unfaithful it is to the book.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

For those who have read the book it is a treat to see this new interpretation, for those new to the concept it is spellbinding from start to finish. It is hard to decipher this movie from a kid flick or a horror movie. The kids are probably among the least annoying child actors I have ever seen, which is always a plus.

218,WHCernan,"Great movie, especially without ""Cheer Up Charlie""",10,5 October 2001,"I'm not the first to say it, but the song ""Cheer Up, Charlie"" is horrible. It's painful to listen to, and when this movie was shown on TV while I was growing up, I always left the room when Charlie's mother sang it. It doesn't help that the song adds nothing to the film; every other song in the production gives us exposition or mood. ""Cheer Up, Charlie"" just makes it drag and tells us what we already know: Charlie's sad that he hasn't won a golden ticket. Thanks, Mom.Thanks to the magic of VHS and DVD, however, I haven't had to put up with that awful song for years. Now I can see the rest of a beautiful, funny, scary, magical film that I first saw at age 6 in 1971 (!) It truly is watchable again and again. Compare this to, say, ""E.T."", which seemed good the first time I saw it and awful every time since.Gene Wilder is brilliantly cast and does an excellent job of playing an eccentric just-this-side-of-loony Willy Wonka. Jack Albertson also turns in an excellent performance, as do most of the child actors and parents, not to mention Mr. Turkentine, Charlie's teacher. Peter Ostrum (Charlie) does a fair job; his role is the deepest and most difficult to play of all the children and I can't fault him for not being a ten-year-old Robert DeNiro.Was I scared, age 6, watching the decapitation of a chicken? Sure, but for.. what, 3 seconds? The movie (save for ""Cheer Up, Charlie"") moves fairly quickly. Who has time to think about chicken butchering when there is exploding candy to be seen?Roald Dahl is famous for bizarre stories involving children and cruel or incapable parents/caretakers (""James and the Giant Peach"", ""Matilda""),  but he always puts the blame where it belongs and the deserving are rewarded. ""Willy Wonka"" is a worthy, if slightly different, adaptation of Dahl's book.I give the film a 9/10. Without ""Cheer Up, Charlie"", make it a 10.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

Yet, somehow, you can't help but like him, at least as he's played by Gene Wilder in ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" the semi-psychedelic, and ""psychotronic,"" 1971 version of Roald Dahl's classic children's novel. Wonka is aloof, sardonic, sarcastic, mysterious, manipulative, and devious--a leprechaun with a hyperactive thyroid and an edge. But, as Wilder plays him, you sense the sweetness behind the wild gleam in his eyes; he's really hoping that one of the five children he's invited to tour his chocolate factory will be a worthy heir to the world of his imagination.Yes, Wonka is a cynic and a misanthrope. (What else could he be after sequestering himself in his own little world for years on end?) But he wants to believe that there is still some good to be found in a ""weary world."" Wilder captures Dahl's creation perfectly.The rest of the cast is perfect, too, and they make the most of Dahl's often witty script. Peter Ostrom, in particular, is excellent as Charlie.Yet, this minor classic of a movie has its flaws. The production design suffers from a lack of budget. Wonka's ""Chocolate Room"" looks like an elaborate mini-golf course, with a dirty river running through it, in a brick warehouse. The ""Inventing Room"" is meant to be a whimsical, magical laboratory, but comes off more like an especially elaborate hideout for the Joker on the old ""Batman"" TV series. The songs range from reasonably good (Veruca Salt's ode to brattiness ""I Want the Whole World"") to saccharine (""The Candy Man"") to downright wretched (the Oompa-Loompa oeuvre entire, with lousy choreography to match). Wilder's rendition of ""Pure Imgaination,"" an overly sugary confection that could induce diabetic comas in the wrong hands, works thanks to the faraway look in his eyes; he makes it magical. The make up and costumes of the Oompa-Loompas (Wonka's workers), on the other hand, are simply embarrassing.Yet despite these flaws, ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" is hugely entertaining and probably the best family film of the 1970s. Think of it this way: ""Willy Wonka"" is to Burton's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" as the ""Batman"" TV series (from the 1960s) is to Burton's ""Batman."" Both are different, entirely valid takes on the same source material. Both are worth watching.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
220,r-downey1,My Favourite film when I was a child!!,8,7 November 2004,"When I was a child,Willy Wonka and the chocolate Factory was my all time favourite movie.I must have watched it more than ten times over the years.I'm now 17 and for some reason I still love it more than ever.I'm mostly into grown up movies now,so I had not seen it in a long time so the other day I found my copy again and so I watched it.Its still a great film to watch even though I now nearly every word in the movie.There may be a few spoilersThe story begins when Mr Willy Wonka(Gene Wilder)the owner of the most well loved sweet factory in the world,announces that he has put five golden tickets inside five of his Wonka Bars and the five children who get them in there chocolate bars will win a day out at his famous factory.A poor boy called Charlie Bucket dreams of having a golden ticket then one day in a corner shop he gets the 5th and last golden ticket and he takes him and his Grandpa Joe to the factory.Where they and four other children who are really unpleasant have a real wacky day.The ending is great as is the music.Overall this is a super fantasy film watch it as soon as you can.I give Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory 9/10 one of the best fantasy films ever!!!!!",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
221,bdwilner,"simply awesome, Wilder's apotheosis",10,21 March 2006,"People are fond of saying ""the book was better,"" particularly when they haven't read it but strive to sound erudite. In this case, it's true: by providing more detailed anecdotes expressive of Willy Wonka's encyclopedic knowledge base and earth-shattering sense of humor, the book scores eleven whilst the movie scored only ten. We all know how talented Wilder is--particularly, when he writes, not only when he acts, witness the astonishing creativity of ""Young Frankenstein."" This movie provided a vehicle for Wilder to sing, dance, jest, wisecrack, and even display the rare dramatic moment, typically centered around the emotion of love (even when seemingly busting on some child's self-imposed torment, e.g., blowing up like a blueberry or being micro-miniaturized during electromagnetic transport). Even Jack Albertson got a chance to sing and dance, but--as you may not have been aware--there was a time when a (young) Jack Albertson was nationally renowned as a soft-shoe dancer and vaudevillian. I frankly think that Charlie could have been better cast in a less humdrum figure than Peter Ostrum: certainly, he did not rise to the level of brilliant characterization that we discern in, say, Mike Teevee or Veruca Salt (BTW, quite apropos, as 'verruca' is Latin for 'wart'). This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Plus, the occasional quotes from classic English writers are immortal: ""We are the music-makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams,"" or perhaps, ""Where is fancy bred? // In the heart, or in the head?""

223,jpking-1,Williw Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,10,23 October 2005,by Corey Duncan.Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is the most fun-filled movie ever been made for TV or the movie screen. So rent this movie today because it will have you laughing. I think Willy Wonka is the best movie made to have ever been seen on a movie screen.Willie Wonka has a few funny scenes in it. The first funny scene was when Augustus Gloop fell in the chocolate river and got stuck in the tube. Another funny scene was when Peter Guff got shrunk into a microscopic boy. The last funny scene was when Violet ate a piece of candy and turned into a blueberry.The next part of the movie was an action-packed part. Charlie got the golden ticket and everybody tried to get it from him. Willy Wonka freaked out when Charlie and his grandpa were the last ones left to finish the trip. The elevator scene was action-packed because you didn't know if they were going to have enough speed to break through the glass ceiling and fly.The third part of Willy Wonka was the scary part. Charlie and the rest of the people were on a boat going through a tunnel. They saw all those pictures pop up in front of them. It was pretty scary! The last scary part was when Mr. Slugworth kept following Charlie everywhere.The last part of the movie was the suspense part. The first suspense part was if that man was going to kill Charlie. The second part was when Charlie opens up the candy bar and there was not a gold ticket inside of it. The last suspense part was when Willy Wonka himself gave Charlie the chocolate factory for him to operate. So now Charlie owns the chocolate factory in the new movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.,Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
224,YFL,"Sweet rendition, but you gotta read the book!!",7,24 September 1999,"This movie is endearing, but I have to say ... the book is better! Forget the images that come with the movie, your imagination conjures up visions way beyond the limits of any special effects!But still, not a bad version of the book. The actors are all adequate, but Gene Wilder is fantastic, the best thing about the movie - he was the only aspect in the movie which was at least as good as what I envisioned while reading the book, if not better. And watch out for the twinkle in his his eyes! :) This is also one of those movies where knowing the story beforehand doesn't really do much damage when you actually watch it, if anything you anticipate what happens. Really the only thing to criticize - is that the movie isn't as good as our own imaginations. The other criticisms just make me laugh. Granted the special effects aren't that cutting-edge, but hey, this was made years ago and it's OK considering! Also I don't really feel it's too 'scary' for kids... I know lots of children who think that Roald Dahl's stuff are cool, and no, they don't grow up to become mass murderers. And true, there is a dark side to it, but it's got a good message to send. If anyone got traumatized, they probably grew up like a glass bubble. I'm not a kid anymore and I do still know how to enjoy it, perhaps it's even more amusing because you really get to appreciate the intelligence of the absurdity and the fun of the exaggerations that Dahl inevitably dishes out. It's silly, but perhaps that's why you love it. Another thing ... really interesting to watch out for if you're familiar with the great works of Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde etc ... I haven't read all, but enough to catch some of the quotes from their works deliciously sneaked into the dialogue here. For example, ""Parting is such a sweet sorrow"" from Romeo and Juliet by Shakespeare, and ""The suspense is terrible. I hope it lasts"" from The Importance of Being Earnest by Wilde, among others.
I especially love one of the last lines in the movie where Dahl shows his total ability for sweet innocence (and Wilder delivers it to perfection) when Wonka tells Charlie, ""And Charlie: don't forget what happened to the man who suddenly got everything he'd ever wished for."" and Charlie asks, ""What happened?"" and this is when you're sure that he's gonna give you one of those righteous, cautionary, adult message of the preachy kind when he says, magically, ""He lived happily ever after."" *sigh* ...",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
225,davidrulesyou,Excellent Family Classic,10,14 February 2009,"I love this movie. I think it is a great family classic which might age more over time. This is based on the Roald Dahl novel ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" I first read the book when I was a child and some time later I watched the movie at school and, since I happen to not be a Dahl purist, I liked it. I also liked Tim Burton's more recent version, but I like this one better.Out of either Johnny Depp or Gene Wilder, I have to admit that Gene Wilder did a better job on capturing the character of Willy Wonka. I know this movie is like a mediocre version of Dahl's novel and failed upon its original release, but does a movie have to be perfect to the novel it's based on to be great, no matter how beloved the novel is (anyone apart from purists)? Seems not. But time has become kind to it to make it a beloved cult family classic. While Tim Burton's movie may have done a better job on the book, it is no way as good as this movie (well almost).I think this movie is what one of the songs in this movie describes it: Pure Imagination. It's a shame Roald Dahl despised this movie (because of the liberties this movie took), but it is quite imaginative, sweet and (in terms of chocolate) scrumdidilyumptious. The songs also made an impression on me too, including the aforementioned ""Pure Imagination."" Your family would want to experience this minor classic over and over again and I would recommend it for anyone. If you're a purist, however, stick with Tim Burton's more recent adaptation. My rating: 10 out of 10.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

The acting is terrible, especially by the main character Willy Wonka himself, the additions of characters like Slughorn are unnecessary, and in the end, Charlie wins it all even though he and grandpa Joe were as bad as the other children!
Roald Dahl himself was so upset at this movie's adaptation of his book that he demanded in his will that no more Willy Wonka books be made into movies. That should tell you how terrible this film is.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

230,Fishbait,Fun for the entire (dysfunctional) family!,10,20 October 1998,"""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" is an unconventional children's story that refuses to become watered-down or P.C.  It manages to be great family entertainment without too much watering down of Raul Dahl's disturbed ideas (although Mr. Dahl did not enjoy the film version.)  The child actor isn't too annoying, which puts it ahead of most children's movies, and the songs are pretty good.  What gives it the extra edge is the LSD inspired visuals and Gene Wilder's brilliant performance of the eccentric Willy Wonka.  There are a few moments that only adults will get, a few moments only a kid could love, and a few scenes which are rather disturbing (The legendary ""Boat Scene"").

Even as a very small child I did not understand why they gave the movie a different title, then I realized it was because it had nothing to do with the book.Very little of Rould Dahls story is here, instead we are flooded with cheap sets, chocolate that looks like dirty water, bad acting and the some of the worse songs ever.

And I wasn't very pleased with the fact that they changed Veruca's squirrel attempt and replaced it with geese and even though she went to the Incinerator, she sang a terrible song! And Augustus Gloop was the thinnest man in the world compared to the new Augustus but I'm giving it a 7 because not all of it was bad the Oompa Loompa songs were okay.

Gene Wilder as Mr. Wonka was superb. His character goes from being sooo odd to almost creepy and then back to a caring man about teaching kids to do the right thing. All of the characters in this movie really play their parts sincerely which only adds to the full impact of the movie's message. The movie has an aw and wonder about it that leaves one feeling a real experience has happened (real story with coherency). I haven't seen the remake but I know that no actor could replace Gene Wilder in the role of Willy Wonka. The music, the orange people, this is movie magic!

239,Exploding Penguin,A world of pure imagination.,10,7 May 2003,"A wonderful story with a wonderful message: honesty cannot be bought for any price, but it is the most valuable gift that any person (child or adult) can have.This is a great film because it appeals to both kids and adults.  Roald Dahl packs his story full of all the tasty and grotesque things that children love, while the script includes enough clever jokes and quotations to keep the attention of their parents.  It is without question the finest family film ever made.The first part of the film is possibly the funniest.  Rather than seeing a group of children searching the world for Golden tickets, we are instead presented with a variety of obsessed adults who seem willing to pay any price for the prizes.  This makes the film even more enjoyable for children; they get to see their parents acting like maniacs, the way the children themselves would.But it is five children who find the tickets, and they are hand-picked to be the worst examples of bratty kids: the overfed glutton, the snotty gum-chewer, the smarmy couch potato, and of course the most demanding, spoiled little demon in history (in my opinion, one of the greatest performances by a child actor ever)But the fifth is the golden child, the hard-working, honest little boy who has never had anything.  From the beginning he's taking care of his family, trying to be the man of the house now that his father is dead.  One can't help but love Charlie, especially as he sadly walks home alone to the sounds of his mother singing him a lullaby.The point of the film is that honesty, innocence, and faith will eventually make dreams come true.  Those dreams are brought to life through the Chocolate Factory, a spectacular series of sets and scenery, along with a delightful musical score.  Yet all through the Chocolate Factory, it is only Charlie who really seems to be enjoying himself; the others only whine and complain about all the strange and wonderful things around them.I thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.  It teaches an inspiring lesson, it has many colourful characters, and the scenery is enough to make your mouth water.  It's positively scrum-diddly-umptious!",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
240,igotranover,Like a bar of chocolate without a golden ticket inside...,7,30 June 2005,"As I say, the book is always superior to its film. In this case, my philosophy proves correct. Charlie and The Chocolate Factory was a brilliant book with great characters. Willy Wonka, was personally my favourite character. He had an evil, twisted side to him. Quite cynical at times, and a very sadistic individual. ""My chocolate! My chocolate! Look what this child has done to my chocolate!"" Wonka shouted, as one of his guests began to drown in a pool of chocolate sauce.In the film, he proves very similar. Gene Wilder is the best part of the film, and there's no doubt about it. And there's no doubt that Charlie deserves a candy cane through the head. The film has bad actors (overall), a decent array of script and effect and um-pa f*****g lump-as. The um-pa lump-as ruin many aspects of the film, and everything seems too childish all the way through. The glittery music and bright presentation didn't impress Roald Dahl, and it didn't impress me.If you were to class this as a kid's movie (As it is) you'd rate this well and give it to your children for their enjoyment. But, don't expect too much. Wait until Tim Burton's adaptation is shown in the cinemas, and then make up your mind what's better.For other alternatives, I'd recommend something like Toy Story or the Lion King for your kids.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

For instance, the Oompa-Loompas sang really bad songs ""Oompa-Loompa do-pe-de-dah, I got another puzzle for you"", was one of them.

First of all, I thought that the book was OK. It had its charm, but wasn't a great American classic. This movie is not the book, they took the same general concept and then put their own bad spin on everything. I don't mind if they change some things like the squirrels to geese, because they did not have the technology to do squirrels. But changing the song lyrics and adding their own songs, that was bad. The Ommpa Loompas were all wrong, how anyone could even come up with the idea of making their skin orange and hair green is anyone's guess.

In earlier videotapes and even seeing the actual film projected on a screen, the killing of the chicken was considered something that should never have been included. Actually, the removal of the execution of the chicken made the whole film so much more enjoyable. I laughed, I cheered, I thoroughly enjoyed the production from beginning to end.

However, as an adult, I was surprised to see how sadistic the movie can be - kids die in a number of ways. Nothing violent or gory, mind you - but still unusual for a ""children's movie"". Comparing it to Seven, as some reviewers have done (kids die for their sins) is a large stretch.That being said, this film is just pure, pre- packaged imagination. It is a visual treat, and Wilder's performance is perfect. As a child I wasnt able to enjoy the bitter sarcasm he presents. He's hysterical!

Other than the images projected on the tunnel wall as the boat went through, I didn't find anything particularly scary. Mostly it sparked my imagination and made me laugh.In my opinion, this was the best ""children's"" film of my generation. It wasn't until _Babe_ that a children's film of comparable quality was released.

261,chrisn-cn,A film about Pure Imagination,8,26 May 2014,"""Come with me and you'll be in a world of pure imagination"" as we are guided through the Wonka Factory by the unpredictable Willy Wonka showing that anything is possible with some imagination. A fantastic family musically film filled with inspiration and imagination that everyone would enjoy even with the dark tone. A wonderful adaptation from Roald Dahl (personally he despise the movie)a great cast, wonderful soundtrack good storyline makes a movie worth watching.Willy Wonka thought off a great marketing ploy by opening his factory to the winners of the 5 golden tickets and a lifetime supply of Wonka bars. Wonkamania begins everybody wanted one,as the golden tickets are found we see that the kids except Charlie won are brats. The second half is about Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory hence the title name.The fine-line of genius and insanity is blurred with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka and his only role Peter Ostrum as Charlie the innocent kid. The movie is directed by Mel Staurt and was release back in 1971 so it is a classic and filmed in Technicolor.The entire movie most of the color were muted except the color red a few other color but mostly bright red (Charlie sweater).Not only the characters and the wonderful props but the original musical score brings another aspect to this magical movie. Composed by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley it was nominated for Best Original Score back in 1972.It is indeed a musical with catchy musical numbers and inspiring songs with a message behind it. Starting with the opening credit to the ending credit an instrumental of Pure Imagination sets the tone.  There are some dark tone like the how world obsession with chocolate early on (Wonkamania)and the tunnel scene which Gene Wilder did a great performance that people on the set though he went crazy by being in the tunnel. It seems that Willy Wonka planned on getting rid of the kids throughout the film and what really happen to the kids when they disappeared? Overall a musical about imagination and inspiration with a little bit of insanity making it worth watching many times.Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory shows a possibility of joy for a poor boy. So what happen to the boy who suddenly got everything he alway wanted? He lived happily ever after. Take the main lyrics and apply it to life.""We are the music maker and we are the dreamers of dream"".",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
262,galnaraven,I need to tell you something about this film,10,30 October 2019,"I read the top of the most helpful reviews, noone mentions this.
There is alot of great stuff in this movie like Charlies story and the morals. But that is for kids hence sung by the small oopma lompas.
No, the most masterful in this is the best acting performance ever.
That is the sadness and loneliness of Willy Wonka conveyed by Gene Wilder.
The same sadeness I feel for having to write this out since noone seem to get Wonka.Willy Wonka has the admiration of everyone in the world. Do you ever see him admiring anyone? No and he doesn't care for anyone. Not even Charlie. He doesn't care how he acts in front of people nor what they say. He is all alone.
The candy is his extreme attempt to make him happy, however in the end he is not. Why do you think everything is in half in his personal office? He is not fulfilled. He does not care if he or anyone else die in the boat or the elevator. He uses everyone for his own amusement. And why shouldn't he? Noone cares about him, only for his chocolate.In the end Charlie makes a good deed. Maybe seeing himself in him, Wonka gives him his legacy. He can't give it to an adult because he is not like them. Alas he just continue to give joy to others like his candy has always done.
The final conversation is there only to be ambiguous. It's simplistic for children not for adults.
What I'm trying to say is this; Please don't just enjoy the movie like a candy. Try to understand Wonka so he won't have to be so alone.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
263,Kathy7,Still the best after all these years,10,31 August 2001,"There are alot of reviews telling you about this movie, so I am not going to do that.  I am just going to say that this movie was released the year I was born, and 30 years later, it still is timely.  The morals of this story hold even in 2001, and will in 2071.  If you  for some reason did not see this movie, I urge you to do so.  It is such a pleasure to watch.  It really is a great movie.  Children and adults alike will enjoy it.  The music is good, too; who can't help but sing along with the oompa-loompas!!!  I own the soundtrack, VHS tape, DVD, and probably will end up getting the special edition 30th anniversary DVD also. This movie airs plenty on the Fox Family Network so if you are a bit weary over a certain part of the movie (which other reviews have touched upon) you can catch it on there since they cut out that scene completely, which is a shame because it really is a good scene.  Creepy yes, but me as a child was not affected by it and believe me I am the worst when it comes to that kind of stuff.  In fact, I never even noticed it til I was much older, and saw it 100 times (no exaggeration). Children will most likely be so absorbed in Gene Wilder's singing and the effects of the scene than the actual stuff going on in the background, but if you haven't seen it yet you can always watch it first.  I highly recommend viewing.  You will not be disappointed.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
264,indiegirl26,"classic, funky modern fairytale and fable",8,21 December 1999,"All the greatest children's stories are slightly dark and feature a maniacal hero that only kids can accept without applying cynicism. This Roald Dahl story is far less cruel and sadistic than the book, unfortunately, yet still transports you into a magical world of fantasy. Both a modern fairytale and trippy fable, this is a film that I watched on rotation as a child. It both speaks to, and awakens your imagination, and now as a young adult, it is still one of my favourite films, and it's moralistic approach always has me returning the metaphorical everlasting gob-stopper.Made in 1971, this film is definitely a product of its time. Colourful and highly kitsch, I can just imagine a flat of students,  sitting down to watch this as a fail-safe cosmic experience. The scene with the hallucinogenic tunnel is scary when you are little, the Ooompa Loompa's, amusing, yet when you get older, they both become equally terrifying and yet incredibly captivating and call out to a part of you that you thought had fallen asleep when you hit puberty.Gene Wilder excels as he plays a pure caricature of an eccentric magician with a sky-high intellect and equally vast plans for his golden ticket winners. This is not an easy task, but is executed with complete style - a totally classic performance. Veruca Salt's dreams of a bean feast are also a delight everytime. Julie Dawn Cole expertly plays the role of psychotic exorcist-style' brat from hell with a twinkle in her eye and a sardonic smile. This child of Satan also went on to provide a name for a rather average but fun band, as well as perhaps demonstrating the first signs of dangerous girl power to a generation of Spice Girl parents.
Each stage of the film is memorable, playing with your mind and teasing the senses. That is the beauty of this film. Suspend all rationality and ignore the messy confines of logic. Instead, look into yourself and be reminded that the most important thing to be, is a good person. Or something like that. That, and it is always good to eat a lot of artificially coloured confectionery.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

A slow first half (I know, build characters) grinds to a halt with the sappy ballad sung to Charlie by Mrs. Bucket.  It takes the appearance of Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) to get things moving again but momentum is lost a second time as the movie slows down after the ""fizzy lifting drinks"" scene.  The middle third of the film, though, makes everything forgiveable.  In all, a timeless movie to be enjoyed by everyone.

For this is a real pity that Mel Stuart direction be so anodyne. He doesn't has style and he is incapable to provide the movie with style and real atmosphere. A possible fantasy gem is lost. The mise-en-scene is rather bland and flat ala Disney. The strange elements of the story (the subtle ""perversity"" of Willy Wonka, the boat ride scene, the ""insinuations"" to different substance addictions ...) seems reduced to like-a-joke ingredients. The movie is to enjoy like a kid for its whole shameless tone but without the cinematographic rigour that could rise the movie to a real artistic value.Newest Roald Dahls book adaptation is much more incisive and technically professional respecting Tim Burton direction but also it is much less winsome than Stuarts movie. The aseptic CGI effects and horrid musical numbers ruined the possibilities of a pure Sense of Wonder.Willy Wonka & the Chocolat Factory (1971) - 5.5/10.

268,pinkispunknotpimp,"Caramel. And Cherries. And Peanuts, oh my! Oh wait, that's a different movie.",9,17 June 2005,"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory has long been one of my all time favorites when it comes to children movies. The more I think about it, though, the more clear it becomes to think that this movie isn't only for the youngsters, but adults and teenagers alike. The humor that melts off of every single action and event, the zaniness of the story, the setting for which the film takes place in... all of it adds up to a movie that the whole family can enjoy. The book that this movie was based off of, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is also a favorite of mine, if not because Roald Dahl wrote it. That brings me to one of my biggest reasons why this movie was such a hit success: the man truly behind the story was not necessarily the director, but Dahl, who made up from scratch every nook and cranny you see. He also wrote the screenplay, as a matter of fact. From the almost loony Willy Wonka - - played perfectly by none other than the legendary Gene Wilder - - to the chocolate factory itself, it's hard not to take notice and admit that Mr. Dahl played an important role in the movies glory.So let's get down to the meat of the movie, shall we? The lead character of our story is a young boy by the name of Charlie Bucket (played by the talented Peter Ostrum) who lives in a lower-class neighborhood alongside his Grandpa Joe (Jack Albertson) and several other ailing family members. Sweeping into town comes an announcement from behind the doors of a mysterious chocolate factory: five lucky children will have a chance to get a tour of the also mystical Willy Wonka's factory! The chase is on, and all chocolate factories from one end of the street to another are jam-packed of kids wanting to find the lucky golden ticket that holds the ""key"" to the tour. Before anyone knows what's happened, four kids have got their tickets. Sadly, all of them are spoiled rotten brats. This pattern changes when Charlie finds the final ticket, and he's ecstatic. Bringing along Grandpa Joe, Charlie embarks on the tour with high hopes. What he gets is more than a little unexpected, I'm sure.I can't help but take notice of the amazingly beautiful background that this film is saturated in. Yes, perhaps they are dated, but for a movie that was filmed in the early 1970's, the producers and what not did a superb job of making the whole ""fantasy candy land"" a reality, and I applaud them sincerely. I actually think it's better that this movie is so old, as it gives it a very surreal aura. I also cannot forget the acting! Throughout the movie I found myself honestly intrigued with every character that was thrown my way. Every actor made their persona as believable as possible, especially Gene Wilder who I have to tip my hat to. I first saw the man in Young Frankenstein, and he never ceases to surprise me with his unbelievable top-botch portrayal of zany characters. His job as Willy Wonka is no exception.Willy Wonka is a part of pop culture, it would seem. It's hard not to notice the effect that it's had on the States. Whether it's constant references to people turning into blueberries, the constant jokes about Oompa Loompa's, the memorable Marilyn Manson video where he imitates one of my favorite scenes in the movie... it all gives more reason to check this movie out. As I said before, this is a total family movie. Not just confined to the age-old ""child"" or ""adult"" categories, Willy Wonka crosses the border and becomes a classic that no one will forget any time soon. Check this one out now for good laughs, an intriguingly eccentric story and character line-up, and extraordinary acting to boot.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

Charlie and others are led by Willy Wonka through a world of imagination and wonder.This is absolutely one of the greatest children's movies ever created.

It just is a feel good movie that lifts your spirits and dears you to dream of a world of pure imagination. Willy Wonka is arguably one of the best characters in film history as Gene Wilder plays him to perfection and was truly sad to see him past in 2016. A beautifully stunning film with set pieces good enough to eat and music so delightful it makes you want to cry. I don't really care if Roald Dahl hated it, I loved it and makes up for that empty remake Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which is accurate to the source material but not appealing to the original. I believe Gene Wilder should have been at least nominated for an Oscar of his portrayal of the candy maker.Overall if you haven't seen this film, you will be living in bland world until you take a golden ticket tour into Wonka's chocolate factory.

From the oompa loompas to the TV that can shrink candy bars, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory has an intense imagination embedded in the dream of a little boy that could be anything if he simply believed that he could be anything he wanted.

Violet was the least believable one, but even she was TOTALLY believable.  Get my point?  The song, the very first song sung by Willy Wonka, has to be the greatest movie song ever, and be the greatest scene ever, esp. what he does at the end of it. It's so cool, and you never expect it.  Any of it, through out the whole movie.  The monologue/song in the boat, the umpa loompas, the many, MANY changing expressions of Willy Wonka.    Man.

273,braknbeans,"My favorite movie of all time, forever",10,13 February 2001,"This winter I went into a wave of nostalgia, and Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory was the biggest thing from my childhood that I remembered and loved. This is undoubtably my most favorite movie of all time, forever. Despite all of the shallow comments by some saying this movie is 'horrible' and 'disturbing' I grew up on this movie and loved it. So did my friends, and my family. To this day if I go out and wear my shirt that has the Wonka logo on it (yes, there is one ^_^) I get a barrage of comments on how that's their favorite childhood movie. It remains a treasured childhood memory to this day for me as well. As a child, I was captivated by it's colorfulness, the thought of so much candy, and by the humorous characters. Today, I'm captivated by it's true depth and moral meaning, and the depth of the characters. The kids are hilarious because we can all relate to their faults and hate brats. Charlie is wonderful because we always root for the underdog. The Oompa Loompas are a subltly humorous and wise touch, and my all-time favorite, Willy Wonka, is a mix of charming and eccentric, funny yet sarcastic, and gentle yet harshly wise. To this day he remains my favorite and most inspirational movie character. Gene Wilder did a completely fantastic job as the eccentric candyman- they couldn't have picked a better person to display Wonka's wonderful wackiness. (""If the good Lord had intended us to walk, he wouldn't have invented roller skates!"")All in all, definitely give this movie a try. I wholeheartedly agree with someone who wrote not to listen to the people who say this movie is 'bad' or 'disturbing.' I'm not bashing those who don't like the movie, but those who make ridiculous assumptions about it. This movie, despite it's little bits of intenseness does teach an important lesson on where greed will get you and what a kind-heart will ultimately win you- you just can't be too shallow with it or you'll miss it. (And no, the children don't die when they fall into their own traps. At the end Wonka assures Charlie that they'll be perfectly restored to their old selves, but perhaps a bit 'wiser for the wear.')

Now a re-make of the classic film is slated to be shot. I find this hard to believe-- just like re-making Psycho-- what is the point? Re-making films in the era of video and DVD seems silly. In the earlier days of films, the older versions were not readily available for the public, so it seemed fine to re- introduce the world to the stories, but now I just don't understand the point in re- making films that are classics. The new one may be a fine rendition-- I have faith that Johnny Depp is fully capable of playing a wonderful Willy Wonka, but it's a role that I think was already extremely well portrayed by Gene Wilder.

277,chelseamccarty-cm,"BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME, at least one of them",10,12 August 2013,"This movie is phenomenal on all accounts. I haven't read any other reviews, however if any say this movie is not top of the line material, discount them immediately.To appreciate this movie you need to appreciate so much more than simply mindlessly watching television. It is immensely deep, and anyone who says otherwise is a nitwit. (see what I did there?)Naturally one can appreciate the movie for the sheer brilliant performance given by Gene Wilder. He is horrifically and terrifyingly BRILLIANT! Whether it is his ability to pull at the heartstrings of the audience from his sweet and innocent eyes, or his ability to pierce the very bottom of the audience's soul in pure terror and fright, he is amazing. He is definitely one of my favorite actors of all time. Some people claim that this movie is just plain weird, so be it. It is weird, but that doesn't mean it isn't good. I love every last bit of this movie. I also read in the trivia listed here that Leonardo Di Caprio once claimed it was one of his favorite movies, so tell that to those naysayers. My favorite scene is most likely the boat scene. I LOVE IT. Wilder is so terrifying. That he can captivate so much fear, just WOW. There are not words to describe my feelings about this movie. Further, I love the random quotes throughout the movie. The one liners that Wilder throws about on whim throughout the movie are actually references to brilliant works of literature and poetry. He quotes Shakespeare and Arthur O'Shaughnessy, just to name a few. From this movie I also gained on of my favorite poems of all times, it was an Ode written by the latter from above. ""We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams, wandering by lone sea breakers and sitting by desolate streams, world-losers and world- foresakers on whom the pale moon gleams, yet we are the movers and shakers, of the world forever, it seems."" AHHHH. Wondrous. I actually have that portion of the poem memorized because I love it THAT much. Also, fun fact, if you want to creep people out hard core, take a lesson from old Willy himself. Memorize random quotes and such and then at random times stop whatever it is that you are doing and peer deeply into the eyes of someone around you. Then begin reciting what you have memorized. The reactions are hilarious. Something to look for in the movie which methinks is an anachronism can be seen right about the time when Charlie gets the golden ticket. There are actually several if you look hard. First, if you see the ads behind him when he is wandering about the outside of the candy store they are clearly not the era they are going for in the film. But what is most out of place is the man standing in blue jeans and a black shirt reading a newspaper. I don't know if he was mistakenly on set, if he was supposed to be there, or what. But it is worth noting and observing. All in all it is a great film. Good for children in that they don't truly understand everything about it. Cool for adults because they can see it on a deeper level. One final remark, why did no one ever notice the man with the huge slash across his face talking to their children? For all they knew he could have been whispering sweet nothings into their ears. But at the same time I think it was done for humour reasons. I like to think of Gene Wilder and his crew sort of being like Seth Rogen, Michael Cera, Jason Segel, James Franco, and that lot. They just represent different time periods.

Now there is a new movie coming out directed by Tim Burton. He makes such interesting movies and is a creative director, but I wonder why he couldn't have moved forward with one of the other Wonka stories. Certainly Johnny Depp is an ""odd enough"" and versatile actor to play the recluse of Wonka, but would have much preferred they left Charlie & The Chocolate Factory for Wilder and let Depp play Wonka on The Great Glass Elevator. Still, will go see the new movie and see how Burton has ""darkened"" the Wonka character. I'm hoping it will still be a lite enough movie for younger kids, but am guessing this will not be the case.

For child viewers it's a very blatant morality tale where poor behaviour has consequences. For adults there is a rich vein of humour.
They cleverly shot it in Berlin with a mix of American and British actors, which makes the story feel like it could be anywhere.
Gene Wilder puts on an unforgettably mesmerizing performance and Roy Kinnear makes a very good exasperated straight man to his zaniness.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
280,bheck1,In defense of the original,8,27 August 2005,"While Tim Burton has claimed that his remake is closer to the book, it is purely superficial. Mel Stuart did add some original songs, changed the title, and swapped the nut room for the room with the golden geese, but the integrity and heart is intact. (granted that Burton did add his own subplot about wonka's childhood) Roald Dahl's books are not simply dark fantasies or absurdist romps, but are moreover sensitive and warm in a rather odd way. Dahl's conception of Willy Wonka is more reflected by Gene Wilder, who grounds himself in both worlds of fantasy and reality and moreover is warm, caring and somewhat aloof. This is something that Depp couldn't channel in his interpretation, and actually helps to cause Burton's film a breakdown. There is a quality to the original that cannot be reproduced. It is a far simpler film that doesn't try to be high and mighty. The acting is superb, the effects are simple nearly seamless, and the screenplay is dead on. This film has attained the status of a classic without trying very hard, and will not be forgotten. It needs no on screen antecedents, and I feel that the remake was made more or less to cash in on Burton's swiftly declining originality, and the fruits of the box office. Simply put, the original is far more genuine.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
281,sas6789,A touching Movie But i hate Wonka!,10,2 April 2005,"I found this movie very touching until they got to the factory.(Warning Contains spoilers!) Charlie Bucket is a very poor boy who has a love for chocolate. He lives with his mum and four grandparents (of which he favours grandpa Joe) who have been in bed for 20 years. He lives in the same town as Willy Wonka's chocolate factory which hasn't been open for years. One day it was announced that Wonka will let 5 people in if they found the gold tickets. The first 4 were found by naughty greedy brats first Ourgust Gloop a greedy German boy then Vereca Salt a spoilt brat whose rich father forced his factory workers to unwrap Wonka bars till they found one. then Violet Beeruagard a gum chewer with bad manners then Mike Teevee a TV lover and a pain in the neck.Then the miracle happens Charlie finds a golden ticket and his dream comes true he and his grandpa Joe go to the factory.Oh dear then we meet Wonka a Weired seemingly friendly chocolate factory owner. though he dosen' care that Orgustus nearly drowns in his chocolate river or that violet turns into a blue berry by his dangerous products, then he doesn't cared that Vereca falls down the eggdicater or that mike Teevee shrunk by sending himself be television though all their parents were worried sick. In the end Charlie gets the chocolate factory because he was the only one left, which i was very pleased about but a definitely hate Wonka. But i was very impressed by Gene Wilders performance he played a great Wonka",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
282,Fenchurch_Dent,this movie is scrumpdidliumptious.,9,25 July 2005,"OK, let's face it, this movie is an out and out classic. I know bad movie reviews are much more fun to read, but I just can't think of any thing bad to say about it. Well, except maybe the special effects, (the elevator-on-a-string) but they did OK considering it was before CGI. It could've been worse. And everything else in it kicks ass!!! Gene Wilder rocks as Willy Wonka, constantly coming out with odd quotes/comments/songs at totally random moments and just generally freaking everyone out. The songs are all brilliant(except maybe ""Cheer up Charlie"" which is OK in moderation but gets a little tiring after a while)I mean, come on, ""Pure Imagination"", ""I've got a golden ticket"" Verruca Salt singing ""I want it now"", and obviously, ""The Candyman"". And no matter what anyone says, I love the boat scene. i know the special effects are crap(none of them get splashed, their hair isn't even blown back!) but Gene Wilder's weird spur-of-the-moment song sends shivers down my spine. (He's the best actor EVER!!)Overall, i would say, go buy this classic movie. Now! Go on! You're not gone yet! What are you waiting for? you heard Gene Wilder's in it, right??

The extremely creepy scenes and the constant literary references makes the movie appropriate for older kids, maybe teens, and for adults looking to remember what it was like to be a kid and imagining what magical it must be like being inside a chocolate factory.P.S.- The internet meme of Grandpa Joe being a scumbag are totally true.

I have never gotten bored of it ad i have watched it many a time for a long time. the passion of children and making something with love is unspeakable. its a masterpiece a creation of the soul and the mind in one. it's the most original screenplay and cast and script. do not leave this undiscovered. it contains issues everyone will enjoy and on one side it is not an easy movie to understand or to grasp the concept of the whole meaningful script. i didn't really understand it much until i watched again lately after about 5 or 4 years without watching it.i absolutely love it and so will you.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

The characters are all so memorable, with a great cast to back them up, particularly Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, Peter Ostrum as Charlie Bucket, and Jack Albertson as Grandpa Joe. The songs are all magnificent, my favorite being Pure Imagination. The practical effects are groundbreaking even to this day. The ending is perfect, one of the best I've seen in cinematic history, one that leaves you thinking. If you haven't seen it you're missing out.

I recommend the new & improved version directed by Tim Burton & composed by Danny Elfman. Johnny Depp was great and much better then Gene Wilder. Freddy Heighmore also did a better job in my opinion then the other actor who played Charlie in the 1971 version. The ompa loompa's were much better in this film. I feel they had more of a purpose in the new film,Deep Roy did a great job playing the ompa loompa's.

It was the first VHS tape that I purchased for myself and will be the first DVD I buy in a few weeks. But enough about me... This movie has everything you could ask for in a clean, family movie. It has hilarious comedy, a suspenseful storyline (though almost everyone knows what will happen), great special effects (for 1971), well-developed, unique characters, and of course, a story that any sweet-toothed viewer can relate to. This movie is perfect for viewers of all ages. I've watched it with wide-eyed 5-year olds, perverted teenagers (they love the Oompa Loompa scenes and the boat ride), adults, and the elderly, and all of them enjoy the flick. It is truly a classic movie, despite being underappreciated at the time of its release. Grab a handful of Gobstoppers and sit down to enjoy Willy Wonka!!",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

I've rediscovered the eye-popping delights of a secret world dedicated to the guilt-free invention and sampling of scrumptious chocolate and sugar confections. It's a cautionary tale of course - a concept my son has yet to grasp, bless him - warning against the evils of excess and over-indulgence and celebrating virtue and honesty. I love the three main characters - they all play their roles to perfection, particularly Gene Wilder who was just perfect casting. His Willy Wonka is, naturally, a reclusive oddball who, in the course of the factory tour, proves to be an intriguing combination of secretive, controlling, unpredictable grown-up and candid, excitable, mischievous, capricious child.

Or giggle at Violet Beauregarde's sassiness, Veruca Salt's tantrums, or Wonka's many mind-bending one-liners? Gene Wilder is absolutely perfect as the leading role, which gives Johnny Depp EXTREMELY huge shoes to fill if a remake is indeed made.

The costuming and sets are great, and although the special effects may seem a little archaic by today's CG stuff, it's still pretty good.

When Charlie says 'I bet that golden ticket makes the chocolate taste terrible' he is summarizing every false word of consolation any poor child in history has ever heard or said. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is an everlasting movie, one that exudes surrealism in every frame; yet it is so human it's hard to imagine a world without little green men that make chocolate and sing morals.

Now, as an adult, I watch Wonka every few months and am simply amazed how timeless everything is about it. I know that the new Depp vehicle will be a better version of the book and Dahl's fantastic writing will come to life through Tim Burton, but I doubt if the new movie will ever take away from the magic of Gene Wilder; the acting by the five fantastic kids; and of course, the chocolate.

I always hated the musical interludes - they dragged on forever and felt more like filler than story information. The boat ride was just weird, and sent my five year old shaking out of the room.

The designs are superb, both inside and outside the factory, there is almost every kind of comedy, from verbal to visual, and the dramatic device involving deception (and a certain sweet) is almost secondary to the wild adventure which Charlie Bucket undergoes.

It didn't quite follow it, and I don't know why. It's basically a very uncomplicated and short book that easily could have turned into a movie. And I just can't see why they have turned Willy Wonka from a strange but eccentric man (book) to a rambling nutcase (movie).But still. If you haven't read the book I can strongly recommend that you see this movie. A movie about dreams coming true, worlds that just exist in your imagination (and on film) and great humour.

Not only does it feature a great plot, fantastic acting and show how movies don't have to be full of computer animation to be good, but it also features some of the best music I have ever heard in a movie.I still remember, almost as clearly as if it were yesterday, the remarkable thing the movie did to me the first time I watched it: It completely changed my mind about musicals! I was about 10 years old when I first sat down and watched the movie. Like a lot of kids, I didn't much care for musical numbers in movies. So when the music for ""Pure Imagination"" started playing, I thought, ""Oh great, a musical number!"" I was just about to press the fast-forward button when Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) began singing.Within about two seconds, I was completely mesmerized! I didn't think I had ever heard such a beautiful song in my life, nor had I heard too many singing voices that were as beautiful as Willy's. It felt like he was singing that song as much to me as he was to the kids and parents in the movie! That song certainly captured MY imagination, and after hearing it for the first time, I saw musicals in a whole new light.I may be grown now, but I still like the movie every bit as much as I did as a ten-year-old....and I will always have a special spot in my heart for ""Pure Imagination"" the song that convinced me that musicals can be some of the best movies out there!",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

I would give the new one 2 out of 10 as it is a disgrace to the old version. Just because Roald Dahl didn't like this film it does not mean he would like that one.

We all have some aspect of each of these characters inside us.  Both the greedy kids and their equally greedy parents are unfortunately just like us.  However, there is hope for our world because inside each of us is a bit of the virtuous Charlie, struggling to succeed.But Willy Wonka is the truly magical character of this movie.  He has the creative mind and flamboyant nature that we all have, but rarely show.  He lives in a paradise of his own creation.  He lets his imagination and desires dictate what he does, without succumbing to the sin of greed.But this is all subtly delivered to you.  You don't have to analyze this movie to enjoy it.  You have so many fantastic characters that parallel the school teachers, news reporters, psychologists, and scientists of the world to laugh at again and again.It's a movie of two halves: The first is the outside world where five golden tickets are found.  The second is the fantasy world of the Chocolate Factory where imagination comes to life.  What this movie does so well is combine the two worlds, suggesting we add more fantasy and creativity to our repetitve and greedy everyday lives.  Use your mind to warm the world up, so you can get out of bed without worrying about a cold floor.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
315,mcfcderry,If you are wise you will listen to me,10,2 June 2003,"Quite simply the greatest film ever.  What it may lack in technical expertise (don't forget, it was made in 1971) it makes up for with a wonderful story, superb script and bedazzling performances from all.Ignore any negative comments on here about this film so far.  It is a moral tale showing what happens if you do not pay attention, eat too much, pick up bad habits, are spoilt or watch too much TV (too much tv apparently gives you a pain in the neck and an IQ of 3!).  It champions innocence, honesty and childhood dreams.  As Wonka says ""I couldn't leave it to an adult, they would change things"".  The factory is a place where anything can (and does) happen.If you've become hardened and desensitised to today's fodder, transport yourself back to your childhood via this film and recapture your glorious youth.Infinitely watchable, wonderful characters - four absolutely beastly children, one underdog; one manic chocolate maker and a host of Oompah Loompahs which were rescued from snozzwangers and vermicious kernids! What more could anyone want.Never forget that ""We are the music makers and we are the dreamers of dreams.""",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
316,madyworld10,My review for my Film Analysis and Exploration class,10,30 November 2011,"Calling a movie your all time favorite is quite a task. I believe I was around seven years old when I first watched Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Ever since that first viewing, I have been in love with the film and its incredible diegesis. Though the film all together is a wonderful timeless piece, for the purpose of my review I want to start when the winners of the golden tickets enter the factory with their parents. As they travel along the many rooms, corridors, tunnels, and halls of the factory, the viewer learns more about each individual child and, more importantly, what is characteristically wrong with them and their parents. Though Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory captures the viewer through Gene Wilder's quirky character and the sensory delightfulness of the factory, one of the most important things the viewer takes away from this film are morals. More specifically, to be polite, selfless, kind, respectful everything that our parents are suppose to teach us and are deemed desirable by society. What makes this message so universal is the fact that not only is it meant for children but adults as well. The viewer learns these ""lessons"" from all of the children as well as their parents, who are partly if not entirely to blame for their behavior. The first child to be taken away is Augustus Gloop, a fat little boy who falls into the chocolate river. Even though Willy Wonka tells Augustus to stay away from the river, the boy is disobedient and even falls in and gets sucked up into a pipe. His fault is gluttony. Three other children all share similar fates, all representing an imperfection in society. The second child, Veruca Salt, is terribly spoiled by her father and demands to have one of the golden egg laying geese inside the factory. She attempts to get one and is deemed a ""bad egg"" and sent down a chute, followed by her father. She is, of course, greed. The two other children personify stubbornness and rudeness and are both punished for it; one by becoming a human blueberry, the other, turned into a micro-sized version of himself. The protagonist of the film, Charlie, is the only child left at the end of the factory tour. However, since he is only human, him and his grandfather (the only respectable parental figure besides, perhaps, Wonka himself) drink a fizzy soda that makes the both of them float up to the ceiling. Unlike the other participants, their predicament is only temporary. Even so, Willy Wonka is displeased with them and tells them to leave. Being obedient, regretful, and respectful, they exit the factory. Only through their act of humility does Wonka present them with the ultimate prize, the factory itself. This sends an obvious message to the viewer of what attributes are right and which ones are wrong.It was only recently that I realized Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory was made in 1971. I knew it was an old movie, but I was shocked to find out it is over forty years old. Once the characters enter the factory, time seems to stop. There is nothing dated in the factory, save for the television, and the characters themselves don't necessarily give away a time period. These elements, along with the very universal message the film is sending, make it sincerely timeless. People in twenty years from today can watch this movie and still take away from it, young and old.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
317,Geekgoth,Gene Wilder kicked ass,8,14 January 2004,"The suspense is terrible... I hope it lasts.This was one of the few times, that I read the book be4 I saw the Movie My hat goes off to  Gene Wilder . He is great as Mr wonka. he should have got an Oscar or a lest been nominatedAll the kids play a good part,that was a surprise because kids normally sux in Musicals. I thought that Charlie looked like a wuss, and he was going to buut up the movie, but he did a good job, and Julie Dawn Cole(Veruca Salt) just kicked ass.The Musical numbers ain't that great, but they are not supposed to be. There still fun(love those Oompa Loompa  puzzles.)Soundtracks list.The Candy Man Can. ****Cheer Up, Charlie. **""(I've Got a) Golden Ticket"". ***Pure Imagination.*****Oompa Loompa"".*****I Want it Now!"".***.
So who is this movie 4? Well its 4 anyone, but some scenes might be bit scary 4 kids, like the boat trip scene has some nasty pics playing in the background.(actually  this scene can be quite funny cus its obvious that the boat is not moving.) And there is a scene when somebody goes up a pipe.
, I loved this movie mainly cus of Gene Wilder . One last thing, Don't watch this film if you are on a diet, cus it will make you crave chocolate. I had to go out and buy a Galaxy  after I saw this.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
318,jamescampbell1971,My Favorite!,10,11 April 2004,"This is MY favorite movie of all time. It just has a magical feel to it. Peter Ostrum should have at least been nominated for an Oscar for his performance! Was it really a stretch for George C. Scott? He really came across as an innocent, wanting a better life for his family. If Haley Joel Osment could be nominated for the Sixth Sense (yes he was very good), so should Peter. Can anyone say Honorary Oscar? I think it may be time we got a grass roots movement together to get this guy some kind of recognition for his acting. My particular favorite, and most touching moment is when he and his grandfather open the candy bar while everyone is sleeping, no golden ticket. His response...""I bet it makes the chocolate taste terrible""...Remember this was his first and ONLY movie.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
319,CHSBowler18,I agree about Mr. Turkentine,10,21 June 2005,"I agree that Mr. Turkentine is the most underrated character in the movie. I love his humor and his quotes, especially the one where he asks Charlie to come to the front of the class and help him with an experiment, ""Well, of course you don't know. You don't know 'cause only I know and if you knew and I didn't know then you'd be teaching me instead of me teaching you and for a student that teaches teachers it's presumptuous and rude... do I make myself clear?"" he-he:) The way he presents himself is so hilarious. Another that is hilarious is when he's trying to teach the class about percentages and he asks Charlie how many Wonka bars he'd opened and Charlie replies ""2"" and Mr. Turkentine responds by using 200 and then when Charlie reassures him it's only 2, Mr. Turkentine replies that he can't figure out ""just 2"" and then says to pretend Charlie opened 200. he-he. :)",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
320,mcnugg,"A film not without flaws, but fantastic nonetheless",10,22 May 2005,"The film ""Willy Wonka and the Chocalate Factory"" has divided critics and moviegoers alike since it was first released. Doubtless there are some who would not enjoy this movie, as with any movie, but it is certainly among the best kids movies ever made, that is also enjoyable for adults. The film deals with a boys journey through the chocolate factory of the eccentric Mr Willy Wonka. It is an adaptation of a novel by acclaimed children's author Roald Dahl, and as such, the plot is whimsical and engrossing. I have no complaints with the plot, except for Charlie visiting his mother at the laundry, an intrusive device to allow the inclusion of a song that is boring at best. The song was supposed to give some emotional impact, and give us a look into the relationship between Charlie and his mother. The only thing this achieves, is to leave the viewer wondering why Charlie did not even consider asking his mother to accompany him to the chocolate factory, instead of his bedridden (and lazy) grandfather. Aside from this small complaint, I believe the plot is excellent.The casting of the film is superb, leading to some great acting. The obvious standout is Mr Gene Wilder, who gives the performance of his lifetime as Willy Wonka. He is charming, eccentric, dark and a little bit scary. Of course no small amount of this is due to a script that gives him some great lines. Still, we must take nothing away from Gene Wilder, who gives a performance that most actors would give their right arms to equal. Other characters are also memorable, such as; Charlie's teacher, Veruca, Veruca's father, Violet, Mr Slugworth and the candy store owner. All of the actors playing these parts give exceptional performances. In regards to the characters, the only real complaint is Charlie himself. He is noticeably the weakest link in the chain. This is not entirely the actors fault, though he must shoulder some of the blame. The character, as written, is weak. He is given nothing memorable to say or do. He seems to be your classic goody-two-shoes (despite the ""fizzy lifting drink"" episode, obviously added to try and combat this problem). Charlie is supposed to be the ""straight"" character, in that he is the normal one. This is to give the other characters someone to ""bounce off"" if you will. However this idea was carried much to far, to the detriment of the film. Such is the problem that every second Charlie is on screen, we wish for the camera to focus on a different character. Other than this, the characters, and acting, are great.It may seem that this review is rather critical given the rating (10/10). This rating was given in response to the amount of enjoyment that one can get from watching this film. The movie is flawed, yet it is a great movie nonetheless. No movie is perfect, despite what some fans might say. But a great movie is enjoyable in spite of its flaws. This is a must see movie. Please, before seeing the new Tim Burton version, watch Mel Stuart's version, as it is one of the great films.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

322,brundage3,Gene Wilder revealed...,9,20 May 2005,"Most excellent works in the arts are seen and enjoyed at a variety of ""levels."" That is true of this movie in general and of Gene Wilder in specific.Wilder has been known in the circles of movie creators as a creative genius for many years. Here, his acting ability showcases that genius. To be sure, at the level of good fun for kids and Moms and Dads, he comes through. But writers must have loved his work. Watch for the ""look"" in his eyes. You will see ""changes"" in them as he speaks or as he listens to the kids. Those unheard, barely seen changes can be read many ways. And that is the genius. They put more into the lines than the words themselves.Art should be clearly and quickly understood. It should also be the tool used to make us wonder a bit. Think a little. Or find meaning we didn't see at first look. In this movie, Gene Wilder's almost imperceptible nuances speak volumes.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
323,RLANTZ,"Poignant, Moralistic & Eye-Poppingly Brilliant!",10,18 April 2006,"Having seen this as a 10 year old, I can understand how this film still brings me a great sense of warmth. Being a HUGE fan of chocolate, I was instantly drawn to the theater that day. Wonka bars were being sold by the fistfuls at the concession stand. Having procured my bounty. I stepped in, soon to be enveloped in pure cinematic magic. I was not disappointed, for then I became completely immersed in the films warm, chocolate blanket. I just saw this on TV a few days ago, and was (almost) equally mesmerized by the imagery. Undoubtedly Gene Wilder's most endearing role. If any of you didn't get choked up when Charlie unwraps the golden ticket, Sorry, you're dead already. I have to give it a 10",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
324,titozar,Wonka is God,10,18 May 2005,"Viewing Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory as a child and as a young adult I appreciated it's whimsical appearance and it's fantastic story. Not until recently did I discover the religious symbolism that runs throughout the film. I've never read the book which the film was based upon so I can't say if there are any similarities regarding religious symbolism in the book. The Religious spin: Wonka represents God The Chocolate factory represents Heaven or Eden Slugworth represents the Devil The everlasting gobstopper represents the soul The story essentially tells the tale of how mankind is offered the opportunity (the golden ticket) to reap Heaven (Chocolate factory). The opportunities are few in a world littered with corruption. The adults of the world are portrayed as cynical, untrusting or untrustworthy. The golden tickets find their way into the hands of children. Charlie, the protagonist of the story, is shown to be the kindest and most humble. Upon receiving their tickets the children are immediately confronted by Slugworth (the Devil) who whispers temptation into their ears. The first impression we are provided of the reclusive Wonka (God) is that of a prankster, as he shyly limps out only to tumble forward evoking both shock and delight. Throughout the film the Wonka character expresses a gamut of emotions to the point of knowing what he is like but not understanding him. He's both structured and chaotic. Upon entering the factory the guests are provided rules (some visible while others are practically invisible). The guests are instructed to sign that they will obey the rules (Symbolic of Adam and Eve). During the story each of the children fall prey to a number of the deadly sins; Augustus (gluttony), Veruca (greed), Violet (envy/vanity), Charlie (envy), and Mike (vanity). In each case the sin brings shame and disastrous results. One of the most famous quotable lines from the film is the Wonka statement,'We are the music makers. We are the dreamers of dreams'. Wonka (God) is stating 1. The relationship between He (God) and his guests (humans) exists when expressing We and that they each share the ability to create. And, 2. that the infinite is possible. With Wonka (God) all things are possible.Throughout the story appear the Oompa Loompas (Angels) who do the bidding of Wonka and provide sage advice for those who've fallen prey to sin. At one point in the story the children are each offered Wonka's greatest invention, the Everlasting Gobstopper. He informs them that this special treat will last forever and instructs them that it can never land in the hands of Slugworth (Devil). The children and their parents eye one another expressing their understanding of it's significance and of Slugworth's desire for it. In the end only Charlie and his Uncle remain at the conclusion of the tour. Wonka shows them the door and turns away to go about his business. Confused, they inquire about the chocolate and they're rebuffed by Wonka who scolds them for disobeying the rules. At this point Wonka (God) appears cold and distant. Charlie's Uncle, experienced to the corruption of the world (and victim of his own slothfulness), suggests to Charlie that they deal with Slugworth. Unswayed, Charlie, expressing remorse for his actions, offers the Everlasting Gobstopper (Soul) back to Wonka. Wonka turns to Charlie with a look of gratefulness and forgiveness. He tells Charlie that he did it. He passed the test. He returned the Gobstopper without letting it fall into the hands of Slugworth. Moments later, Slugworth enters the room. At first Charlie and his Uncle are taken aback by his presence, but, they are informed that Slugworth actually works for Wonka. The ominous presence previously embodied by Slugworth dissolves as he provides them with a congratulatory smile. In the final climax Charlie, having received the Chocolate Factory, takes a ride with Wonka up into the heavens. Much can be derived from the symbolic nature of the film and what it potentially is suggesting. Most notably the idea that the Devil actually works for God for the purpose of providing man with temptation in order to test his/her trustworthiness. To some that conclusion might appear to place man at a disadvantage. But, certainly not more so than what original man (Adam and Eve) had to face. Mankind still has free will. The Slugworth character (Devil) can be perceived much the same as a tool, albeit a dangerous one. A tool that enables men to act out poor choices. Similar to the adage that guns don't kill people, people kill people. The tool in the wrong hands can be a dangerous weapon but if it's ignored it's harmless. What I found most satisfactory about the potential symbolic nature of the film was that beneath it's whimsical appearance and fantastic story lie a moralistic teaching. It is a story meant to be seen by children and beyond entertaining them provide them lessons (some visible and some practically invisible) on how they should conduct themselves. And, potentially save themselves. I don't suspect that the soon to be released remake, directed by Tim Burton, will provide such lessons. The last and most intriguing question that I have regarding the Religious spin of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory is by who's design does it occur. Was it the author of the book? The screenwriter? The director? Or, by some other providence??",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory
325,seussical1976,"""Traveling in a world of my creation""",10,20 May 2005,"When I sit down to watch a movie I want to be transported someplace else and I want to walk away feeling SOMETHING. When I sat down to watch 'Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory' (after many years of not seeing it) I still loved it, I still felt happy at the end and I still believed that there was that golden ticket out there for the taking. The viewer is carried away into a world where good is rewarded and evil is punished (or sent down a garbage chute!). In the end you walk away feeling that good begets good and all is right in the world...if only through the course of the film.Even though the film was made in 1971 it is not dated and the effects hold up. Gene Wilder plays a quirky chocolatier who randomly slips into the erratic but guides five children into a world of pure imagination. His performance is infallible and unfaltering. Along the way the viewer is able to see what behavior is unacceptable, thanks to the Oompa Loompa's musical morality. The film does leave some questions unanswered. The most glaring being where are Charlie's parents? If you as the viewer can dismiss reality and all logical explanation for just a few hours...you're in for a wild ride.The sign of a ""classic"" film is one that holds up through time. This movie is perfect for families needing a night's entertainment. The same is true for adults wanting to recapture the first time they stepped through the doors of the mystical factory, golden ticket in hand. David Seltzer was able to take the basic premise of Roald Dahl's book and create a timeless screenplay that transcends the years.

326,eonblue9,Genius,10,28 July 2005,"Like most other commentators here, I too am a long term fan of this classic, primarily because of of its attendant virtuoso performance from Gene Wilder, as well as its super-charged Technicolour treatment of the subtly unsettling source material.It is here we find the dichotomy of Wonka: is he really a benevolent eccentric, or does this surreal exterior mask something more sinister? Who knows? That the film itself manages to neatly sidestep the more moralistic overtones of Dahl's book is testament to its innate sense of wonder and purpose.So, for kids of all ages, this is 'scrumdiddleumptious', and one can only hope Burton's latest take on the story lives up to it's predecessor.",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

Willy Wonka, played by Gene Wilder, is a very quirky, unusual character with a sweet tooth and an interesting way of teaching moral lessons. The film is colorful and lively and it definitely captures the imagination. There were a few moments in the movie that were disturbingly weird like the part when the characters took the boat down the chocolate river through the tunnel. The pictures on the tunnel wall and the almost psychotic look in Gene Wilder's eyes added a level of weird that interrupted the flow of the movie. But overall I thought that the film was enjoyable.

When was the last time this guy made a good and original movie.I wish he would go back to making movies like Edward Scissorhands and The Nightmare Before Christmas, but it seems that he has run out of ideas (as evidenced by his poor remakes of Willy Wonka and Planet of the Apes).",Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory

I was sort of surprise what Charlie did at the end. I could see his character has a good heart, but I didn't know it was really a golden heart coming from a kid. I suspected that Willy Wonka will do something like that at the end. I just couldn't believe how the other kids was acting.

of a rags to riches story that fails at bringing up the true disparaging nature of class
discrimination between the brats and the Buckets. Though not all the children are of
the spoiled nature, they are all somewhat entitled but not in a meaningful and well-
developed way that would show off a different side to the characters that will display
more of the complex nature of the class difference more than simple character types
with one gimmick. How the Buckets are portrayed are also heavily distorted as their
lower-class status is reduced to a nature vs nurture philosophy that makes Charlie
inherently kind hearted because of his up-bringing but not through specific events
