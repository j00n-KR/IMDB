0,SnoopyStyle,easy money for big screen studio,7,26 August 2013,We all know why they made this movie. You pay these kids next to nothing. And you promote it as a party movie. It's a classic money making move. The surprise here is that this was actually a pretty good movie. The kids aren't necessarily that likable or great actors. All of it is mostly recycled old teen movie parts. But it's the energy that so great. The utterly over the top chaos in this movie is just too much fun to ignore. The flamethrower does go too far. But it's too late to do any major damage. It just adds to the general chaos of this movie. Miles Teller is the biggest name to come out of this wild ride.,Project X
1,kosmasp,Found Footage goes teen (comedy),6,13 September 2012,"Yes this is rude and offensive. It also aware that this might bring copycats to the front. Which is why there was a warning before the movie started (which kinda ""destroys"" the whole concept of it being ""real"" ... but then again, you should already know that by now). The morality is questionable and of course you know where this is heading ... well almost, because the end really goes over the top! Well you'll see, if you can stomach it.They did actually cast nobodies to play the roles and they took their time to build a relationship. This shows on screen. You can see their friendship shining through, it feels real. Apart from that the jokes kind of work, there is a lot of nudity, a bit of violence and other stuff that will get teenagers excited (loud music). As insane as it looks, it does look like fun ... if you're not the owner of the house the party is held, of course ...",Project X
2,zardoz-13,X-travagant!!!,8,12 March 2012,"Take the teen comedy ""Can't Hardly Wait"" (1998) about an unruly house party, add a ""Lethal Weapon IV"" lunatic with a flame thrower, shoot it like ""The Blair Witch Project,"" and you've got freshman director Nima Nourizadeh's outlandish opus ""Project X"" about a party-gone-wild. Incidentally, ""Hangover"" director Todd Phillips, who produced this mammoth 88-minute mock-documentary, didn't helm it. This R-rated, teensploitation tale about a high school student's birthday party that escalates out of control is prudish compared with the ""Hangover"" movies. No transsexual prostitutes appear. Nevertheless, the property damage is staggering. ""Project X"" delivers laugh-out-loud hilarity during its best moments, while some of its shenanigans amount to amusing contrivances. For example, a gang of drunken kids stuff a pugnacious dwarf into a kitchen oven. After he escapes, the dwarf embarks on a genital punching bender. An anonymous but charismatic cast and the spontaneity with which events whirl out of control makes ""Project X"" a gripping, white-knuckled roller-coaster of a comedy. Prepare yourself for displays of lewd, crude, rude behavior wrapped up in general air of unreality. ""Can't Hardly Wait"" meets ""Porkys"" best encapsulates ""Project X."" ""Project X"" represents a definite hurdle for future house party movies to scale and a chilling cautionary tale to parents who entrust their property to their children while they are away.Three high school students, Thomas (Thomas Mann), Costa (Oliver Cooper), and J.B. (Jonathan Daniel Brown), have a dream that degenerates into a nightmare. Thomas is about to turn seventeen. Thomas' best friend Costa wants to throw him a party. Of course, Costa sees Thomas's birthday as nothing more than an excuse to invite scores of sexy gals in tight clothes for a night out. Of course, Costa dreams about scoring. He sends text messages, e-mail blasts, and publishes the event on Craigslist. Initially, Thomas wants no more than fifty people at his party. Furthermore, he doesn't want them inside his house. Imagine his surprise when between 1,500 and 2,000 people show up to celebrate his birthday and trash the premises! Ironically, Thomas' bespectacled dad (Peter Mackenzie of ""One Hour Photo""), shares the sentiments of most who classify Thomas as a ""loser."" He knows his son will invite friends over while his wife and he are away for the weekend so he forks over $40 in cash to buy pizzas. Naturally, he forbids Thomas from using certain rooms. Scenarists Matt Drake and Michael Bacall rely on Murphy's Law in their clever screenplay. Everything that can go wrong does go wrong. Nevertheless, Nourizadeh and company paint our heroes as sympathetic but naive. The party turns into an anarchic extravaganza. Before Thomas realizes it, his guests overrun the house, clog the streets with their vehicles, and start shedding clothes. Two disc jockeys are spinning platters. Hundreds of guests are coming and going by the hour. Disgruntled neighbors are complaining about the racket. Costa has put a sign up that only naked women may swim in the pool and the gals comply without a qualm. Thomas catches up with his favorite girl at school, Kirby (Kirby Bliss Blanton of ""Scar"") and they grow chummy. Things go awry when he takes campus hottie, Alexis (Alexis Knapp of ""Couples Retreat'), to bed, and Kirby walks in on them. During a grocery store run before the bacchanal, our heroes encounter local high school baseball star Miles (Miles Teller of ""Footloose"") and invite him. Miles agrees to bring the booze. Costa visits a paranoid guy named T-Rick (Rick Shapiro of ""Pootie Tang"") who sells them hundreds of Ecstasy pills. Costa steals a Santa Claus gnome that T-Rick treasures and stashes the synthetic amphetamine in it. What Costa isn't prepared for is the rage that T-Rick unleashes when he visits Thomas' house to recover his prized possession. If this weren't enough, Costa has persuaded another high schooler named Dax (Dax Flame) to video the party. Essentially, ""Project X"" is seen from the perspective of Dax's video camcorder with shots from other cameras spliced in to capture the overall frenzy of the occasion. Whereas everybody else is pretty much who they are, Dax has an aura of mystery about him. Dax's parents haven't been seen in a long time and he still attends school. He doesn't drink and he dresses like a Goth from head to toe in black leather.If ""Project X"" were just a raunchy version of ""Can't Hardly Wait"" with people drinking until they dropped, it would be just another potboiler. The party itself provides the conflict as well as the setting for the conflict. The reactions of Thomas, Costa, and J.B. provide the humor. Thomas is catapulted from being another nobody to a celebrity at his high school. Nerdy, overweight J.B. whose parents argue he may be gifted in a belittling way probably grows more than his two friends over the course of the evening. Before everything goes up in smoke, J.B. emerges as a gigolo and a daredevil. He dives off Thomas' roof with Dax's camcorder and lands in the huge inflatable bouncy castle that Costa has furnished for the revelry. As funny as these three are, some of the supporting characters are scene stealers, particularly the two little guys in yellow windbreakers hired as security. They pop in an out of the proceedings and function more like ninja than security. One point they are prepared to torch a neighbor's house because the owner threatens to call the cops.Altogether, ""Project X"" is enormous fun. Reportedly, the filmmakers drew on an incident in Australia when a teen invited hundreds to guests to his house while his parents were gone. No American film has attempted anything like ""Project X,"" and director Nima Nourizadeh soft pedals the consequences of such an endeavor. In the end, what makes ""Project X"" memorable, rather than deplorable which many will label it, is how Thomas' father reacts.",Project X
3,grantss,So many loathsome characters...,3,27 April 2015,"So many loathsome characters...Mildly interesting, and some funny moments, but pretty much lowest common denominator stuff. The ""heroes"" of the story are probably the most unlikable, loathsome characters you've ever seen. In fact, just about every character is unlikable. Plot, what little there is, just gets more an more bizarre, and random, the further it goes on. Over-the-top events just for the sake of them.Really makes you worry about today's youth. A truly repellent generation.",Project X
4,Boba_Fett1138,It delivers on what it promises!,7,13 March 2012,"Of course this is not a great movie but that is more so because you can't even really call this a movie in the first place.It's not necessarily following a story, or trying to build its characters. It's simply being one very straightforward movie, that delivers on what it promises. In that regard I also can't really see how someone can dislike this movie. It never pretended to be something that it wasn't and I liked the movie for that.In the days that found-footage movies are getting really popular, it is fun to see movies coming up with new and original, great stuff. This movie entirely looks like it got shot with cell phones (which was also true for most part, by the way), which gets you right in the middle of things and gives you the feeling you are really participating in its wild, crazy party.And this is really all the movie has to it really; its wild and crazy party. And I must say, it's all pretty fun to watch and to see how things slowly but steadily are getting more and more worse and just totally insane. The movie constantly keeps coming up with more crazy stuff throughout, which makes this never a boring watch, or a movie that constantly keeps repeating itself. It helps of course that the movie is a very short one.Who knows, maybe it would had been a better thing if we actually got to care about, or got to know any of the characters but really, this didn't took anything away from the movie for me. It's just clearly one not to take very seriously (or to try at home) and a movie you should simple take and enjoy for what it is.Especially teenagers shall really love this movie.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Project X
5,george.schmidt,"""The Hangover"" for Generation Z: Kids don't try this at home :D",8,10 March 2012,"PROJECT X (2012) *** Thomas Mann, Oliver Cooper, Jonathan Daniel Brown, Daz Flame, Kirby Bliss Blanton, Alexis Knapp, Peter Mackenzie, Caitlin Dulany. ""The Hangover"" for Generation Z: underclassmen trio of buds Mann, Cooper and Brown (Edward Norton/Matthew Modine; Jon Stewart/Chico Marx; John Candy/Jonah Hill manques) plan an epic birthday party for Mann in a 'game changer' to make a mark on their social inadequacies with their high school peers which results in a Bacchanalia of debauchery and kids-gone-wild imbibing and chicanery at full tilt. A bougeliasbaise of John Hughes meets ""Animal House""/""Bachelor Party"" and ""American Pie"" that while it borderlines cartoonery the mix of ridiculous comedic moments and an undercurrent of trying to belong are heartfelt but few in between overall. Hilarious more than it has any right to be in its high concept premise alone no thanks to its all-out screenplay by Matt Drake and Michael Bacall and the you-are-there video work by novice director Nima Nourizadeh",Project X
6,neil-476,Vile piece of trash,1,9 March 2012,"It is Thomas' 17th birthday. His parents are going away for the weekend, admonishing him not to touch Dad's car, make sure Dad's office is locked, etc. etc. etc. All the time, Thomas' ""hilarious"" friend Costa (performed extremely well by Oliver Cooper) is pushing pushing pushing for Thomas to host an insane party to boost their credibility, his other ""hilarious"" friend (the obligatory fat one) is hanging around, and the entire proceedings are being filmed on an enormous hi-def video camera by a fourth kid who no-one notices. And, of course, hundreds of people turn up leading to the house being trashed (burnt, car in the swimming pool, riot police, trees in the street on fire, press helicopters etc.) Perhaps this is funny if you are a teenager. Personally, I found the Costa character (effectively Jonah Hill's character in Superbad only immensely more offensive, and the driving force in the events which destroy his friend's house) the most repellent character I have ever seen on screen outside monsters like Uday Hussein. It isn't so much that things get out of hand (although they do), it is more that Costa is pushing pushing pushing all the time with a total lack of respect for other people's hard-earned belongings or for their desperately needed peace and quiet.At the end, after everything has gone horribly (and predictably) wrong, even Thomas' Dad, while watching his car being hauled from the pool and explaining that the cost of the damage will consume Thomas' college fund, shows that he is impressed by the turnout to the party and, back at school, Thomas' star is in the ascendant.The message underlying this film is that it really doesn't matter what damage you cause, or how badly you screw up your own, and others' lives, as long as you come out of it cool and, as a parent who has had occasion to be dismayed at the lack of respect shown to my home by guests of my teenage offspring, I think it is a disgraceful message to purvey.I thought that this was a deeply unpleasant film with a truly horrible central character (portrayed as someone to be admired), selling a perverse life lesson under the guise of comedy, which it wasn't. And the hand held subjective camera footage is getting terribly old now.It is interesting to note from IMDb's user votes that this film has scored highly with the youngsters who would be the target for such parties, and badly with the older generations whose homes and lives and years of work would be what ends up trashed without remorse. I also read many comments along the lines of ""Wow! I wish I could go to a party like that right now!"" And I despair somewhat.This film has absolutely nothing in it, apart from some singularly unerotic breasts, to justify watching it. I hope those responsible for putting it on the screen never work in films again.",Project X
7,anaconda-40658,This Film Should be Marked With a Big X!,5,18 May 2015,"Project X (2012): Dir: Nima Nourizadeh / Cast: Thomas Mann, Oliver Cooper, Jonathan Daniel Brown, Dax Flame, Kirby Bliss Blanton: As with Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Home Alone, this comedy caters to every teen's fantasy when it comes to freedom and responsibility. It starts out fine with parents off and gone and a party that goes horribly wrong. Cops are called and diverted, sex is quested and conquered, alcohol is vastly available, and a car ends up in the swimming pool. An endless amount of vulgar behaviour with an ending that seems to applaud these boys and reward them with popularity. Films like this can work, as it does with National Lampoon's Animal House and American Pie, but here it seems more exploited as oppose to addressed. Nima Nourizadeh presents the hysteria of forbidden freedom but unlike The Hangover, the characters are merely stereotypes. Thomas Mann portrays the reluctant kid who betrays the trust of his parents because he allows himself to be talked into the chaos. The whole relationship bit is laughable since the so-called plain Jane is actually hot. Then he spends the remainder of the film whining as if the victim to what he allowed. Oliver Cooper plays the kid pushing for sexual conquests and rationalizes the nonsense. Jonathan Daniel Brown plays the typical overweight nerd out to lose his virginity. Dax Flame videos the charade and does little else. Kirby Bliss Blanton plays one of the friends with a gay crush. It attempts to capture the energy of teenage rebellion but misfires with its applause of behaviour that deserves to be marked with an x. Score: 5 / 10",Project X
8,siderite,A show about... nothing,7,16 August 2012,"It is hard to rate this movie on the basis that it doesn't really have a category I can put it in. It feels like Tom Hank's ""The Bachelor Party"", but without the humour or character development, just the party. From the very start the producing company is apologizing for the trouble the party has caused to the neighbourhood and the ending of the movie tells about what happened with each character, so it is either made to look like this or it is based on real events. If that is true, it pretty much means some highschool guys threw a party, got out of control then Hollywood made a movie out of it.Now, the movie is not bad. It nicely portrayed the three guys and the debauchery at the party, all through a hand held cam, but one that thankfully didn't shake all the time. The problem with all this is that in a few words one can tell the entire story of the film, which is pretty much the same story you get from the trailer, so the only thing you might enjoy is the actual details.So basically I can say that I didn't mind the film, but it is a completely forgettable experience. Had I have been in highschool I might have understood a thing or two about popularity, but probably the wrong thing. At the end the movie can help but glorify the entire endeavour, which is both good and bad. The moral being that being too uptight about it is not better than getting out of control.",Project X
9,StevePulaski,"Slay everyone, identify no one",3,3 March 2012,"Project X reaches a whole new level of juvenile debauchery, and because of its repetition of incoherent party scenes, it spans for what seems to be a lot longer than eighty-eight minutes. It isn't offensive, if you've seen other R rated comedies, but it isn't as original, funny, clever, or as witty as it bills itself.The plot is wholly absent. High school Senior Thomas (Mann) plans to throw the ultimate party at his house to commemorate his birthday, and to try and become popular, with the help of his friends Costa (Cooper) and J.B. (Brown). Because Thomas's parents are vacationing for the weekend, they decided to hold the jam at his house, and after hours of promotion at school and throughout the town, it finally happens. It turns out to be the craziest thing ever. Hundreds and hundreds of teenagers show up, and spend the night drinking, stripping, gyrating, dancing, swearing, fighting, and, well, being teenagers.Project X plays less like a film, and more like a music video. Scenes involve inconsistent shots of all different age groups of men and women, dancing and stripping, combined with the never-ending hip-hop song with booming bass.If that's what you want, cease to read on much further. At this point, you can decide if it's for you or not. I love comedies, especially the ones that don't succumb to neutering content just to make an extra buck from the teens. I, however, don't like comedies with faceless characters, or ones that follow the easy path of ""all style, no substance."" The difficult thing with party movies is that not only are they incredibly hard to write, but they are incredibly hard to write well. Rarely do we get descriptions of people in these films, and in Project X, any form of credible, definable characterization is completely absent.It isn't long before the film turns from juvenile, to just plain nihilistic and mean-spirited. Nihilistic in the sense that nothing matters as long as we have fun, and mean-spirited in the sense the film doesn't seem to like anybody. Every group of people imaginable in this film is depicted in their lowest possible form. There's also a lovely scene that qualifies as one of my rules on how to make a poor comedy, or movie in general; it's the animal in distress. Thanks, movie, for showing no passion or feelings to even the virtually helpless.Not only is an animal treated poorly, but both genders are depicted at their lowest. The film shows men as horny, brainless delinquents, and women as useless caricatures that are no better than the size of their breasts and buttocks and only deserve to be shown in a Girls Gone Wild-esque light. Few films bring light and wit to these dehumanizing traits, and Project X brings misogyny to an all time low.By the final act, the film goes from vaguely comedic and dizzying, to brutal, unforgivable, and harshly consequential. Oddly enough, it involves the best scenes in the film, even if they are a little far-fetched. So many films show the great side of parties, but never the consequences. While it is taken to the extreme and may be a bit impractical, after hundreds of jump-cuts of gyrating teenagers and exhausting bass, these shots are fresh, welcoming, and sometimes a bit frightening.Project X is partying to the extreme, but not nearly as fun as one would like to believe. The found footage aspect is fine, although not necessary, but I'd still take it over 3D any day. The film's main flaw is in its indistinct script that characterizes everyone by stereotypes, and makes the protagonists into unlikable snobs who believe popularity is the only way to go through life. Even the use of verbal timing, an almost vital trait in any good comedy, is very rare. The end we're left with is extremely off. It basically says ""even if you endangered the life of yourself and hundreds of other people, hey, you're popular, man!"" Starring: Thomas Mann, Oliver Cooper, Jonathan Daniel Brown, Nichole Bloom, and Alexis Knapp. Directed by: Nima Nourizadeh.",Project X
10,MovieAddict2016,"Basically Superbad meets The Hangover, but with less interesting characters and a more exploitative, gratuitous, mean spirit.",3,23 February 2012,"As a preface to this review, before anyone's knee-jerk reaction is to dismiss my opinions as those of a prude: I'm not at all opposed to ""hard-R"" comedies. In fact, I love many of them. But something about this one rubbed me the wrong way - indeed, to even refer to it as a ""movie"" seems wrong: there were scenes chronicling the party that basically devolved into mini-music-videos focusing on naked girls. And not even in tantalizing ways -- rather, these scenes felt creepy (especially since a lot of the girls featured are supposed to be high schoolers) -- for example, the director relies upon paparazzi-style upskirt shots. And because the movie is shot a la Blair Witch/Cloverfield etc. with its ""found footage"" style, it only makes these shots seem all the dirtier and more voyeuristic.Moving on past that stuff... other flaws: The fact that the main characters were so clichéd and stereotypical of the genre didn't help, either -- the Jonah Hill-type character from NYC was sporadically amusing but overall just seemed to be trying too hard: the mandatory overzealous good friend who's obsessed with girls and thinks he has game but doesn't. So, nothing original or distinct enough to make him different than any other sex comedy character. He made me laugh a couple times, but that's faint praise.While the first half of the movie is sort of dumb fun, the second just gets derailed by increasingly silly, unrealistic, borderline disturbing stuff - e.g. a huge sequence with a dude wielding a flamethrower at the end was not just stupid but kind of terrifying, like it belonged in a completely different film.I also didn't like the 'moral' of the story or whatever you want to call its attempts to reconcile its events. Unfortunately I can't discuss it without spoiling the film, but suffice to say the ""feel-good"" moral closure of Project X felt like an attempt at Risky Business without any of the actual morality behind it. Not to mention the main character wasn't half as likable or realistic as the Tom Cruise character, despite ostensibly looking more like an actual high schooler than Cruise did - alas, that's why good writing is key. The only word I can use to describe the film is...sleazy, but not in a good way.Think back on what made films like Superbad so much better than much of their genre: it was the characters. They said and did a lot of crude, dumb stuff, but they were rendered as realistic and likable kids and we could relate to them. When they were put in compromising situations - like an out of control party - it was funny because, as corny as this sounds, we cared. They weren't throwaway caricatures of teenagers, or one-dimensional mean-spirited idiots.In Project X, whose various elements and characters are basically ripped off of superior teen films, you don't particularly care about any of these kids - nor can you relate to them. Is the film enjoyable? People in the theater laughed - I imagine it'll appeal to its primary demographic, which is the teen/college crowd - but I think years from now those viewers will look back on movies like The Hangover and Superbad and realize why those were better.(P.S. Don't be fooled by misleading marketing -- while this film was indeed produced by Todd Phillips, he did not direct it. The studio is capitalizing on his involvement - and can you blame them for it when the Hangover films have made like a billion dollars worldwide? - but apart from a producer credit, he didn't have anything to do with this flick.)",Project X
11,KineticSeoul,Parents worst nightmare...,5,21 April 2012,"While watching this movie I thought this one would be another ""Virginity Hit"". Even the characters in the trailer to this movie seemed so much similar to that movie. And in some case yeah, this movie is sort of like ""Virginity Hit"". But has less bull-crap and but less script to go alone with it. The so called friends trying to build and start a party is even more crazy than in ""Virginity Hit"" and might be close to being immature and obnoxious as well. Anyways there really isn't a story for this, just group of 4 friends in high school including the camera guy trying to start a big party at one of the 4 friends house to become popular and get laid. And the friends decide to film everything that happens from the build up of the part to the actual party itself. So it's a found footage movie that isn't really a found footage movie. The build up to the party was just plain immature and obnoxious and not funny. But when the mayhem begins during the party that is when this movie becomes somewhat entertaining. If you wanna see some chaotic party with hot girls and riots happen in a modern neighborhood than this movie might be for you. Or just hit up a crazy night club or rave party or something. I give this movie a 5 since although I found some aspects of the actual party to be entertaining and even slightly engaging but it just didn't have any other elements. So yeah if your looking for a actual plot you will be disappointed, but if you wanna see a crazy party you might enjoy this.5.3/10",Project X
12,Hellmant,Definitely a 'feel-good' movie that's moving for anyone who can relate!,7,5 May 2012,"'PROJECT X': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Another 'found footage' film, this one is a teen party film produced by Todd Phillips (the director behind such popular crude comedies as 'THE HANGOVER' 1 and 2, 'OLD SCHOOL', 'ROAD TRIP' and 'DUE DATE'). It was directed by first time feature film director Nima Nourizadeh and written by Matt Drake and Michael Bacall (who also co-wrote 'SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD' and '21 JUMP STREET'). It was cast with many unknowns through a nationwide open casting call and filmed on a budget of just $12 million. The nerds gone wild storyline doesn't have much originality or surprises to it but it is funny and somewhat inspiring.The movie was originally titled 'PROJECT X' as just a placeholder for another title but after the name drew a lot of interest the filmmakers decided to keep it. The film revolves around three high school friends (Thomas Mann, Oliver Cooper and Jonathan Daniel Brown) who decide to throw a birthday party for one while his parents are gone. The three are outcasts at their school and want the party to be big in order to gain popularity. So one advertises it heavily at school, on craigslist and through massive text messaging. The party of course grows increasingly out of control as another friend (Dax Flame) films it.The movie is obviously heavily populated with themes of reclusive kids letting loose and partying for once in their lives. I would guess it was majorly influenced by other 'nerds gone wild' teen party films like 'RISKY BUSINESS'. It's been criticized by some for encouraging irresponsible morals but I think it's inspiring. Definitely a 'feel-good' movie that's moving for anyone who can relate.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8oXDJoapdc",Project X
13,thesar-2,X Marked a Sore Spot,1,7 March 2012,"Let's put aside the fact that the found-footage genre is rapidly becoming a poor excuse for real filmmaking and a sad gimmick. Let's erase the fact that NONE of this would ever happen. EVER. And let's ignore the obscene extension of a clichéd 5-minute You-Tube video stretched for 88-over-long minutes that literally felt like twice that long.The single worst aspect of Project X was how incredibly irresponsible it was. Sure enough, younglings will flock to see this, adore it and glamorize it to the point of attempting to recreate the horrible actions of the horrible individuals in this film. Since this movie or the creators have no soul or accountability to children, I can miserably see the next found footage ""documentary"" would be on how to make a bomb to bring to High School when no guns are accessible.Speaking of indignity: shame on you Harkins Theatres! My 4:40 Sunday afternoon, half-packed showing was overrun guardian'less groups of preteens and obviously-under-17 crowds. Sadly, they seemed to really love, LOVE this movie, cheering and laughing at all the most inappropriate times, i.e. when these senseless, inconsiderate, thoughtless, brainless and evil characters destroyed property, hurt the innocent and worst of all, felt zero remorse about their actions/crimes. Eh, who am I fooling? Harkins employs the same mindset teens to run the front of the movie house, so of course, they'll let young punks into this Project X.Speaking of my unfortunate movie-going experience, these two adolescent girls behind me laughed and laughed throughout, but oddly, not in the finale. That's when I cracked up. Yes, I did laugh once. You see, the main nerd, Thomas (whom I heard was ""Sooo cute"" by the preteens behind merepeatedly) wants to be accepted by his high school peers, or at least the devil on his shoulder (Oliver) tells him that's what he wants. In the climax, he's being high-fived and cheered on by his ""new"" buddies when he walks down the school hall. I laughed in utter disbelief because of how incredibly sad I was that all of these losers actually lived through the party and how, if this were true, I will end up having to pay for their inevitable many trips to prison later in life.I digress. The movie's opening is a set-up to a birthday party for a 17-year-old (Thomas) whose parents strictly warn him not to have a big party when they're out of town for the weekend. Well, flip-flopping Thomas is controlled by the most evil of all the children, his ""buddy"" Oliver, a boy whose self-esteem should be questioned each time he makes homophobic comments (Oh, did you know if you don't drink alcohol, you're considered a ""faggot""?), racist remarks and insults against their third musketeer, the heavier-set JB.During that small, yet, drawn-out opening of ""Hey, Party at Thomas!"" we have yet another unbelievable series of explanations in yet another incoherent found-footage movie to why one rarely seen psychopath carries a camera one-quarter his body size. Apparently, no one notices this camera in the classroom, in the boy's restroom or even worse, in the boy's locker room. That last one had me really puzzled to why no one seemed to mind being filmed while they changed or came back from the showers. If you didn't see this massive camera on one guy's shoulders while the other males are changing, you're either flipping blind, an exhibitionist or, as usual, the filmmakers can't always explain the flawed found-footage dilemma during 80% of the film.I digress, again. All but the final 3 minutes takes place at the most incomprehensible and out of reach party of any generation. You will see the obligatory midget stuffed into an oven that literally could kill him. You'll see animal abuse that makes the tying of the dog in National Lampoon's Vacation seem tame. You'll see ""High School Girls,"" whose ages range between 25-30, that could model the bathing suits off Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit Issue's females. You'll see freshmen banned from the ""festivities"" while two 9-year-old Damien's work as security guards. You'll see policemen that get outwitted by a punk whose only legal expertise is from Judge Judy. You'll see two hot fight impractically over a guy who makes Jay Baruchel look gorgeous. You'll see five hundred perfectly placed and always water-proofed camera angles from the delinquents as if they're hands were always free to film with their phone cameras instead of holding onto the alcoholic beverages they shouldn't be having anyways for another few years. You'll see how both the movie's audience and the characters think it's funny to burn down a house with a baby in it. (Literally, my theatre's group of asses thought it would be funny to burn down a house with a baby in it. SIGH. If this is Earth's future, bring it, Mayans!) And you'll see how easy it is, when splicing the ""found-footage"" together, to obtain police and news videos.What you won't see is any realism, or any resemblance to the real world; even MTV's The Real World is more genuine. You won't see more than one neighbor call the police – instead, they're busy calling the nerd's Dad and ""over-exaggerating"" on the party's extend. You won't see any adult with a double-digit IQ, but not in the fun/funny John Hughes way. You won't see a plot. You won't find an original idea or thought. You won't see a single female that would even come close to what a High School girl really looks like. You won't find anything intentionally funny.

15,bowmanblue,X marks the spot,7,31 December 2014,"I didn't actually get why this film was called 'Project X' - I must have popped out the room to make a cup of tea of something, but, no matter, I think I understood the rest of the film pretty well.Every few months a story comes on the news about a party that was 'accidentally' posted on some social networking site or other then spiralled out of control. Well, Project X is basically telling that story.It does it from a 'first person perspective' (think Blair Witch just with even more bodily fluids and a proper ending) where all footage is either filmed on hand-held camera, or someone's cameraphone. It follows the exploits of three high school boys who try and bump up their popularity by throwing a 'wild' party. And they do just that. The two thousand guests who attend end up being the least of their problems compared to flamethrowers and riot police - you'll have to watch it to find out.I found it worth a watch. Yes, you have to put up with plenty of annoying teenagers and some people have said that it's 'pro-drug taking' so you can probably guess some of the things they get up to.Apparently the people who made it had something to do with The Hangover. Well, I didn't find it half as funny as The Hangover, but I didn't really think it was supposed to be a straight out comedy. It's more a warning of the dangers of social networking (not to mention trusting your teenage kids with your house when you go away from the weekend).Project X will probably play best with teenagers who can relate to it, but if you're into those cringeworthy 'jackass' type shows, you may enjoy it too.",Project X

I say B.,7,9 May 2012,"""Tonight's about the girls we never had a shot at. Tonight's about changing the game."" When three ""loser"" high school seniors decide to throw the biggest party of the year in order to become more popular they had no idea what they were getting into. Plans and rules go out the window as what starts as a party of no more then 50 begins to escalate quickly. I have been saying that the ""reality"" movies have been used up and are really kind of annoying to watch. While this isn't a total exception this one is at least watchable. On the other hand it is also nothing new. Combine ""American Pie"" with ""Superbad"" and a hand-held camera and you get this movie. This is nothing amazing at all and those other movies were much better, but I have also seen much worse and this one was at least entertaining. Very, very unbelievable but entertaining. I again wonder if I just went to the wrong school because nothing like this was even thought up when I went. Does that make me old?. Overall, nothing original but a watchable teenage party movie. I give it a B.",Project X

Lots of teenage fun, naked bodies, madness and total anarchy is what the lead character Thomas's house is full of. Even the police are intimidated at one point.

Many critics have based the film, though simply from the plot and trailers, it showed exactly the type of film it was intended to be.Though the film ins't that funny, most of the jokes are misses besides a few that are okay, nothing too much stands out in terms of the jokes.

21,filipemanuelneto,This film should be burned. With all copies.,1,23 August 2020,"Teen films have the gift of pushing absurdity to the limit, and this film is perfect for exemplifying it. Presenting itself as a ""found footage"", it shows how a college birthday party, initially thought for some friends, gets out of control when it is massively advertised, taking almost two thousand young people thirsty for alcohol, noise and sex to a suburban house, where adults are conveniently absent. What follows is, pure and simple, all sorts of crazy things that can be imagined at a party, and a trail of destruction and chaos that seems to worry no one.I think I have already shown, by other reviews that I have written, that I am not a fan of this kind of film and I think that they have nothing artistic or comic. This film broke all, or almost all, of the stupidity records by making the case for madness and drunkenness. But the worst of all was to see, in the ending, with the neighborhood half burned and that house totally destroyed, the face of that father who, while pulling his own car out of a pool, proved to be unable to give his son a real lesson, showing even a hint of pride! Pride in what? That brat gathered a crowd of Huns, they destroyed the house, all the houses around, everything! That father will live the rest of his life stuck in debts, will see his son plunged in lawsuits, surely happy to not be arrested for years, as he deserved! Pride in what? If a son of mine did a finger of what that idiot kid did, I would make him work hard to pay the losses and ground him until the next century! Education starts at home, with rules and limits. And this film is the glorification of the absence of limits. Then the teenagers start to find all of this very cool and to imitate it... don't say it isn't true.The film is just bad, sad and depressing. It's not funny, it exudes amateurism from every pore and is simply stupid in its essence. In addition, and from everything I've said about how wrong the concept of this film is, it's all highly unbelievable. You can't believe that more than a thousand people drank and used drugs without thinking about what was happening around them. Someone would have stopped all that madness because teenagers are not all like that and there are many who prefer to abstain from excesses. And it is not possible to believe that, in the whole neighborhood, only one neighbor would revolt with all that, or that the police would be so lenient. It is simply too fake and artificial to be credible. And it may not be worth talking about the cliché characters, made up of one-dimensional stereotypes, and the cast of amateurs, made up of the worst students in drama schools.Excessive, unbelievable, brutally stupid and painfully artificial, this film is of no use. It will only serve for teenagers to try to imitate, on a very small scale. Therefore, all copies of the film should simply be burned.",Project X
22,Turfseer,Highly amusing tale of hapless teenagers who throw party that gets out of control,7,15 July 2013,"Every year just about, a movie comes out of nowhere, that is actually quite clever and funny. Three teenagers, Thomas, Costa and JB, plan a humongous birthday party for Thomas, at his parents' home, after they split for the weekend. Before the parents leave, Thomas reassures his father that he'll keep the house in good order as there will be only a few kids coming over to celebrate his birthday.We learn that Thomas' father is disappointed in his son in general, as he's not very popular at school. In contrast to the hesitant Thomas, Costa is the bad-ass friend whose main goal is to get laid. As he says later on, ""Tonight is about the girls we never had a shot at"" and the party is the opportunity to ""change the game."" Costa continually eggs his conservative friend on, urging him at every turn to embrace his inner wild side. Rounding out the trio, is their nerdy, overweight kid, JB, who also seeks sexual freedom.A fourth confederate, Dax, an AV student, follows Thomas, Costa and JB around, videotaping all the events with a hand-held camera. Other footage is shot during the film with smart phones, police dashboard cameras as well as by the news media, which plays a prominent role during the film's climax.Before the break into the Second Act, when the big party begins, there's some important foreshadowing going on. The three friends pay a visit to Costa's marijuana dealer, T-rick, a military vet, who sells them some weed for the party. Costa ends up stealing a Santa Claus gnome, a figurine that later is revealed to contain hundreds of pills of Ecstasy. The theft of the gnome sets T-Rick off later on, with near deadly consequences. At this juncture, T-Rick is seen chasing the hapless trio, as they make a getaway in Thomas' father's car; the vet manages to break the car window, foreshadowing some real crazy things to come.Since the three friends want to achieve popularity amongst their peers, they advertise their big event on social media, with disastrous consequences. Before they know it, about fifteen hundred to two thousand teenagers populate Thomas' backyard (soon the orgy spills into the house itself, earlier proclaimed off limits by Thomas' father).The three must then cope with an escalating series of crises which all have unexpected results. An initial crisis involves Thomas' pet pooch, who the drunken revelers hoist into the air, tethered to a bunch of helium balloons. Thomas lowers his dog down from the air and averts the first crisis. Then a neighbor comes by and threatens to call the police because of the noise. One of Costa's very young 'security guards', tasers a neighbor 'who doth protest too much' and then ends up getting slugged himself by the angry protester. In another great twist (and there are many of them here) Costa averts another crisis by threatening to report the neighbor for slugging his 'security' (a minor).As teenage girls strip off their blouses and bras and swim nude in the swimming pool, Thomas is tested by Alexis, 'the hottest girl' in the high school, as she French kisses him as they both down shots of Tequila (the seduction foreshadows the discovery later on by Thomas' girlfriend Kirby, of Thomas about to have sex with Alexis).When the police arrive, Thomas and his friends manage to get everyone to quiet down in the backyard. The police want to search around but Costa smartly reminds them they have no warrant. Later, Thomas is depressed by the wanton destruction going on outside and Costa tries to relax him by giving him an Ecstasy pill, recovered from T-Rick's (now shattered) gnome.Now completely high, Thomas is hardly in a position to try and keep things under control. His ego is stroked when all the party goers sing happy birthday to him. Meanwhile events are set in motion, leading to things getting totally out of control. A dwarf is thrown into a dryer and after Costa saves him, he repays everyone by striking them hard in the testicles. Later the dwarf returns and promptly drives Thomas' father's car into the swimming pool in the backyard.The second act crisis reaches its apex when T-Rick appears with a flamethrower, torching Thomas' parents' house and the rest of the neighborhood. For a few minutes, the comic tone of the movie is lost and I'm not convinced that the flamethrower scenes with all the kids running for their lives and police firing rubber bullets, enhanced the overall spectacle. In other words, it got a little 'too real'. Nonetheless, the way in which the news media is depicted covering the event, was a nice satiric touch.'Project X' manages to re-introduce the comic tone when Thomas' father both berates and praises him for the riotous goings-on the night before. Besides lamenting how much all this is going to cost him to repair, the father also is impressed that Thomas has made himself popular. In a great touch, the father makes Thomas drive to school in the burnt out mini-van. But Thomas finds redemption from both his schoolmates who cheer him in the hallway and Kirby, who forgives him for his indiscretion with Alexis.Finally, we find out that the legal consequences for the hapless trio are not so bad after all. And the party becomes fodder for even Jimmy Kimmel, who jokes about it on nighttime network TV.'Project X' is successful because all of its unexpected twists and turns. It's a clever concept which manages to sustain itself until the end, when it slightly wears out its welcome. The three principal actors were discovered after a nationwide casting call. Since they didn't know each other before, the producers brilliantly sent them on a week Disney vacation, where they presumably bonded. Teenagers will love 'Project X' and adults with open minds, will too.",Project X
23,freemantle_uk,Douchebag: The Movie,1,3 March 2012,"We have all heard the horror stories of parties being posted on the Internet with events spiralling out of control. This story idea serves as the basis for Todd Phillips' (The Hangover) latest movie, Project X, which he produced. He intended it to combine teen comedies/party movies like Old School with found-footage films such as Paranormal Activity.Thomas Kub (Thomas Mann) is a high-school student from Pasadena who is about to celebrate his 17th birthday. His friend Costa (Oliver Cooper) plans to host the most epic party possible at Thomas' house when his parents are away in effort to change their loser status. Costa spreads the word throughout the school and on the Internet, but the party is bigger than anyone could imagine. As Thomas tries to control the situation there is also romance in the air; he must choose between his long-time friend, Kirby (Kirby Bliss Blanton), and the most popular girl in school, Alexis (Alexis Knapp).Because of the success of The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity, the found-footage genre has become popular, with this already being the third movie in that style in 2012 alone (after The Devil Inside and Chronicle). It's a cheap alternative, so now studios are trying to extend it into other genres, and an R-rated teen comedy seems as good as any.But Project X is blighted by montages, using music, multiple cameras and cuts. The explanation for the filmmaking style is that it's meant to be a birthday video for Thomas, but it begs the questions of why film something so self-incriminating and also how did the characters get all this footage? Dax (Dax Flame) serves to be no more than the cameraman, not having a personality whatsoever, and he has a very voyeuristic filming style.The movie pushes its premise to its extreme. It features 12-year-old security guards with Tasers, people jumping the room with skateboards, a crotch-punching midget and an angry drug dealer with a flamethrower. Considering the idea of using found footage is usually meant to bring a sense of realism, that was thrown out the window early.As a comedy, Project X is not funny enough. The dialogue lacks wit and most scenes rely on more crude and physical humour, such as dogs humping things, because that is always funny. It does have its moments, but the best bits tended to be in the trailer.As for the characters, Costa is big dick and one of the most annoying characters imaginable. Think Jay from The Inbetweeners without the redeeming features. He brags all the time, uses his friends and looks only for sex. He throws the party for his own selfish reasons. Of course the character was likely written this way to some extent, so Cooper performed decently, but deliberately making him annoying worked a bit too well. Costa was the type of person I'd personally want to punch—and then again when he gets back up.The acting throughout is pretty good from the young cast. Thomas is a decent kid pressured into having this party who tries to keep order when chaos descends around him. It is sad then when he changes in a negative way. Jonathan Daniel Brown is basically a young Jonah Hill, and Blanton reminded me of Dianna Agron from Glee, a nice person and easily desirable. So why would Thomas' eye wonder to Alexis? There is a mean spirit behind this movie. Why should we support these people turning a suburban home into a rave and ruining the lives of the people around them ? None of the characters face real punishment. Instead, they celebrates their excess at the expense of others.The R-rated high-school comedy always has an audience and I am sure Project X will develop a fan base, but it will surely attract as many dissenters as it will fans.Rating: 4.5/10",Project X
24,dee.reid,"""To the break of dawn, yo!"" - The most epic party movie of all time???",10,14 April 2013,"Todd Phillips may very well be the king of the epic party movie - ""The Hangover"" movies appear to be his most significant claim to fame in the early 21st century. But 2012's ""Project X"" - coming fast on the heels of other epic party movies of times past like ""Risky Business"" (1983), ""Bachelor Party,"" ""Revenge of the Nerds"" and ""Sixteen Candles"" (all of which were released in 1984), ""House Party"" (1990), and more recent classics like ""Can't Hardly Wait"" (1998) and ""Superbad"" (2007) - may very well be the most epic of all party movies, of all times.""Project X"" aspires to be the most epic party movie of the MySpace generation, which is my generation. I was born in 1985, so technology is as much a part of my generation as The Beatles were for people growing up in the '60s. MySpace, YouTube, and, of course, Facebook, are referenced here many times. ""Project X"" is also a play on the ""found footage"" genre that's been so popular as of late, although the film is not ""found footage"" in the usual sense that we've been accustomed to over the years (and is many times filmed from multiple points-of-view, so it's not always clear just who is holding the camera and when). It's actually filmed as a documentary chronicling the most epic house party of all time.The documentary aspect of ""Project X"" is actually the only great innovation for the film and signifies its place as the epic party movie of the MySpace generation. Otherwise, the soon-to-be out-of-control party formula remains otherwise unchanged: the mayhem, nihilism, and debauchery is still front & center and in full swing.So I loved just about every single minute of ""Project X,"" even though I will admit that it is not a movie I paid much attention to initially. There's no underlying message here. All we're getting is straight-up hardcore party madness, and then some!As I stated earlier, ""Project X"" chronicles a party, but not just any party; it's chronicling the most epic party of all time! But it starts out in a rather honest fashion to celebrate the 17th birthday of the film's nominal hero, high school senior Thomas Kub (Thomas Mann). Thomas and his two best friends, the motor-mouthed, swinishly amoral yet overly cocky and confident Costa (Oliver Cooper) and the mentally deficient A/V geek J.B. (Jonathan Daniel Brown) - joined by their cameraman, the ever-creepy loner Dax (Dax Flame) - are at the bottom of the social totem pole at their posh Southern California (Pasadena) high school.But Costa has a plan to change all that. In order to boost their popularity (while also, more or less, celebrate Thomas's birthday) they're going to throw an epic house party at - who else's? - Thomas's house, while his parents are away for the weekend (it's their anniversary, which Thomas was fortunate enough to be born on). Of course, the party quickly grows out of control and balloons into a full-scale riot. Cops, angry neighbors, crazed ripped-off drug dealers with flamethrowers, rooftop skateboarders, floating dogs, inexplicably disgruntled little midgets with a penchant for punching people between the legs, you name it - it's all there, and of course, the house gets trashed in the process and someone even drives Thomas's dad's prized brand-new Mercedes into the backyard swimming pool. And of course, there also has to be at least one innocent dream maiden for our protagonist Thomas. The film's central emotional component has Thomas realizing his mutual attraction to his childhood friend Kirby (Kirby Bliss Blanton), who gets understandably angry when he tries a drunken hook-up with a more popular girl at the party.I know it sounds like I wrote about a whole lot of detail regarding this film's plot, but, truthfully, that's really about it here (even in this film's Blu-ray DVD-exclusive extended version, which is what this review is based upon). Producer Todd Phillips, screenwriters Matt Drake and Michael Bacall and director Nima Nourizadeh are only concerned with the drunken antics of the drunken underage party-goers, which appropriately contains many slow-motion shots of all the party-related mayhem (and even more naturally, many bouncing boobies, which, incredibly enough, provides the film's most significant visual imagery). The film has been painfully described as ""the longest Facebook posting you've ever sat through"" (according to Michael O'Sullivan, of ""The Washington Post""). Incredibly enough, ""Project X"" seems more like something you'll probably see on YouTube, and then posted on Facebook.Considering that none of the characters are especially likable or even sympathetic, Thomas Mann turns in the film's best and most enthusiastic performance. He's meant to represent the film's Everyman, the poor unpopular kid with a bright, promising future who gives into peer pressure from his amoral friends to throw one hell of a massive, kick-a$$ kegger at his parents' house while they're out of town, and the heart-warming revelation of his mutual affection for a mutual friend, who, like Thomas, is also sympathetic and is incredibly well-played by the young actress Kirby Bliss Blanton.And you thought ""National Lampoon's Animal House"" (1978) was the greatest, craziest slice of cinematic debauchery and drunken antics of all time, didn't you (for the record, ""National Lampoon's Animal House"" is my favorite comedy of all time)? And you also probably thought that ""Project X"" was the modern re-incarnation of ""National Lampoon's Animal House,"" didn't you? Not so fast there, slick. But it may very well earn its place as, ""the party you've only dreamed about.""Party on - ""To the break of dawn, yo!""10/10P.S.: ""Project X"" also has one of the best dance/hip-hop soundtracks I've heard in a long time!",Project X

I realize that I am not the target demographic for this movie, but even taking that into account, I did not care much for it. The three boys, were extremely unlikeable. So was almost every other character. Cool enough party, I guess, at first, and who can complain about gratuitous boobie shots? The only performance of any note was by Kirby Bliss Blanton, playing ""Kirby"". It's hard to imagine, but even the shallowness of most of the characters seemed forced. I cannot recommend this film to anyone.",Project X
26,kluseba,Don't do this at home!,8,6 April 2012,"This is a movie filled with hilarious laughs, over the top characters and many crazy ideas that you should enjoy with your friends in the movie theatres or watch at home in an appropriated atmosphere. Once you saw this you might know what I mean. This movie makes you want to break free, have some fun and get out to have the party of your life but of course you should not do any of what the movie shows us at your home.In the end, the main character prefers to celebrate his next birthday with the girl he likes and loves instead of having a big party just to get famous at school and this is where the movie shows us the real sense of life and morality. I must admit that some characters are even pretty well developed for this kind of movie and represent quite well three naive teenage guys that play the main role. You have the sneaky and egoistic guy who only wants to have a hell load of fun, the more responsible and naive birthday child and the shy and awkward young man who risks everything to be cool and live the best night of his life.The rest is great and of course superficial entertainment. You simply have to switch your brains off and enjoy it. Of course this epic movie is not a joy ride for everyone. It's about drugs, it's about alcohol, it's about sex but you should see all of this coming. This movie contains probably more swear words and bad gestures than a gangster rap album and more naked women than a regular porn flick and might not please to younger and older audiences. I'm not used to watch this kind of movie at all as I watch rather exotic and intellectual stuff but it's a light and welcome change of my usual habits and I enjoyed it and would definitely watch it again.",Project X
27,davispittman,There are no words....,7,11 July 2016,"There truly are no words to describe this movie. Project X is something that is just so wild and crazy, that it is entertaining, but it's also just soo crude and wildly inappropriate that it's like ehhhh.... I mean in the beginning, the three starring boys are pretty misogynistic and homophobic, especially Costa. That I definitely did not appreciate, and would've preferred that that aspect of the film would've just been cut out. I will say that I liked Thomas Mann, and I thought he did well in the leading role. I thought the nude teenage girls was a bit over the top, I mean seriously, we don't gotta see all that.... Don't have a problem with the language, or some of the sexual content, I realize that's a given with a movie like this, but seeing sequences of teen boobs?? No thanks.... I liked Kirby and Thomas's connection and on screen romance, I thought that was sweet and refreshing to see amongst all the chaos. I didn't like how Thomas was the only one actually convicted of crimes, and Costa, the one who was actually responsible, got off on no charges whatsoever, but idk if he actually had to do time or not, I just really liked Thomas's character, he's a sweet nice boy that just made a mistake and because of others actions, the situation got out of control. So overall, Project X is somewhat entertaining, but often times too crude, 7/10 is more than fair.",Project X
28,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,Project X (2012),8,10 June 2012,"I swear I'm never going to get bored of the found footage genre. Maybe I'm just simple, but it has the ability to breathe life into tired genres. Or maybe I just really allow myself to get carried away with it all. Project X is that simple story of the outcast kids throwing a party to become popular. It soon spirals out of hand, but what Project X does right, is that it makes sure to really push it ridiculously far without betraying its set-up. None of this would work if we didn't have some lovable protagonists to root for. We have our hero Tom, the friendly and most normal guy. JB is the slightly rotund geek that tries to act sophisticated, and finally we have Costa. A big douchey dick. This could go horribly wrong, but his pranks are often harmless and Cooper plays it in a way where you can see how desperate he is for attention. It makes him very sympathetic, even when you can't believe how outrageous he is being. The film builds up the party slowly, which is perfect. It starts off with a few drinks. The dog is then attached to helium balloons, and once the ecstasy comes into play all bets are off. The film is also littered with those bizarre curiosities that often make great comedy, which thankfully it doesn't overuse. Two of my favourites were the 11 year old security guards. I would have liked to have seen more of the party halfway through, as it turns into a huge montage of hilarious moments. Overall, this is a riotous teen fantasy, where people act like cocks, but you somehow hope they succeed in one way or another. In such a politically correct world, I'm kind of glad it didn't pussy out.",Project X
29,Seraphion,A great laugh at a decadent life,7,26 June 2014,"The story was so crazy, so not educational, yet can be worked out quite nice. The basic premise is nice example of how most of the population feel with not being cool and trying to do something about it. That was developed nicely into a drastic point to a riot at the finale. The acting is a so-so for me. The guys don't seem like normal high school students for starters, they look somewhat a bit old. But the duped out story and madness the movie portrays are just great in inciting laughs. The delinquencies shown in this movie are indeed crackers that are guaranteed laughs, though they are definitely not nice to do on anyone. The added ingredient of small romance duration is also a nice touch. The screenplay is nice and got very creative in creating party events to show. The added ingredients of From me a nice 7 out of 10 is indeed deserving for this movie.",Project X
30,p-stepien,"All out party, humour non-inclusive",4,13 June 2012,"Every slightly geekish high school senior apparently dreams of a one-in-a-life-time party, which brings about fame and am unlimited supply of booze, boobs and... Thomas (a likable Thomas Mann) is no exception. Hence his best mates Costa (an egregious Oliver Cooper) and JB (Jonathan Daniel Brown) aim to honour his birthday with an ultimate house party code-named ""Project X"". Parents out of town? Check. Craigslist activated? Check. Alcohol? Check. Blow-up sex-dolls? Check. 'Naked chicks only' swimming pool sign? Check. Pot? Check. Weird ""American Beauty"" wannabee with camera? Check. Any other items of interest... like guests... 9:20 PM - the party is 20 minutes in and no-one has yet arrived... but wait...Sounds like a hell of a party? And boy it sure is! Scriptwriters Matt Drake and Michael Bacall were told to go all-out and fantasise a party of their wettest dreams. The scope of the event is pretty out there, but unfortunately for them an excess of quantity does not make for quality, as dramaturgy and dialogues take a back-seat for countless sequences are dead-pan party events, upskirt shots and a plethora of female boobies. The hand-held camera stunt does give the movie a novel feel, but since this is nothing more than an endless no-holds-barred party, it adds little to proceedings and seems crisp / purposeful for the opening 20 minutes of the movie. What's more the casting seems counter-intuitive, as we are supposedly watching found footage, but two recognisable actors (Miles Teller and Martin Klebba) do appear on screen to underline the fictionality of proceedings.Going through myriads of random gags and ridiculous situations, fronted by closing a raving midget into an oven, the movie throws one hell of a party, but basically one, which viewers would much prefer to partake in, than to watch. Enough said that the only few times that incite laughter happen before the party has even started and during the end credits. The rest is mildly amusing bland attempts at punching at laugh glands, putting all the focus on the sudden BIG BANG, instead of giving thought to more well-wrought sequenced events, which build up to a stupendous KABOOM. For case in point the much underrated ""Superbad"" or the memorable ""Ferris Bueller's Day Out"". ""Project X"" just feels too random and chaotic with countless unconnected stints of gags or low punches feel forcibly pasted onto what otherwise would have been a pretty awesome party, albeit almost misogynistic and woefully crude.A clichéd opening sequence with the father telling his son 'not to touch the car', 'not to enter his office', 'not to...' foreseeably ends up as an outline of the script and basically points out to the lack of credible invention regarding characters and occurrences throughout the runtime. Unlike the previously mentioned movies ""Project X"" lacks morality, which seems a necessity to thread together a passable story, instead selling itself almost like a pointless ""Girls Go Crazy"" romp.Then again maybe I'm just not the target audience?",Project X
31,raulfaust,This girl is on fire,4,3 June 2013,"I genuinely believed this movie could bring something new to the genre, given that party movies are all basically pretty much the same. However, it sadly doesn't. It is a comedy movie for a ""Paranormal Activity"" generation, showing stupid teenagers doing unrealistic stuff all the time. There is nothing believable in this plot and there is no character for you to enjoy; they're all nerds trying to be cool, and sadder than that, the movie tries to show that it's worth it doing what they did if that makes you ""popular"". Also, the story is full of clichés and cheesy lines, making spectator rolls his eyes while seeing all these dumb scenes. For example, why did police take sooo long to come to the house in the second time? Wouldn't all the neighborhood call urgently the police when people started taking ecstasy and screaming all around? Other than that, there are some similarities to 2012's ""Chronicle"", but that one is way better than this. ""Project X"" is just a random project that entertains every audience, but satisfies only horny teens who think one party is going to save their lives.",Project X
32,eric262003,What's the Point of This Travesty?,5,24 December 2012,"What is the point of reviewing ""Project X""? I mean adolescent kids will view it just for the sake of it and the rest of the masses are going to fill the theatres without any other reason except watching a bunch of adolescents partying, drinking, taking drugs, sexy hot nude women and just totally wrecking the party throwers abode. You're not expecting to see any Oscar winning film, top of the line acting, crisp and concise dialogue, or an intriguing plot that's more than just a bona fide party movie that goes out of whack. It's not rocket science folks, all you have to do is watch the trailer and you'll know what you're getting yourself into. It's just a brainless party movie with a lack of any social intentions and it's shot as if we're watching a documentary.The movie's footage is executed by a ""documentary cameraman"" and the camera work looks as though as if the footage was shot by smart phones by the party animals. That's right folks the shaky camera effects comes to life that will surely turn your stomach to knots. But hey, it's all in fun right? It's just one really stupid party movie and it shouldn't be taken seriously. With an absent plot with a slight exception of three outcasts (played by three unknown performers Jonathan Daniel Brown, Oliver Cooper and Thomas Mann) who just want to fit in with the cool teens in hopes to boost their status quo by throwing this awesome party. That's all peachy keen by me but, even party movies like ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" can feature great writing and characters we can sure take sympathy for. ""Project X"" has characters we couldn't really care less about with maybe one exceptional guy and a female character (Kirby Bliss Blanton) who show some spark of interest, but they're surrounded by people who wouldn't even consider to party with. These boys are just desperate for attention.If you think for a moment that ""Project X"" is a more raunchy R-rated version of a John Hughes or that you miss John Hughes or just a more raunchier version of ""Superbad"" than you're all out on a limb. It''s far from anything that John Hughes would even consider getting involved in. and unlike ""Superbad"", ""Project X"" oozes any intellectual integrity ""Superbad"" possesses.I don't find the humour in throwing a midget into a stove, someone getting punched in the pecker, sniffing dildos, and a flame-throwing lunatic torching people's houses. Once ""Project X"" puts on a mean streak, it never looks back. Yet while the filmmakers do everything they can to push the envelope, you'll be surprised to discover just how predictable it get at the very end. And the party scenes seem like they were recycled from other party films (the trio party hosts are perched on the roof surveying is reminiscent to the movie ""Almost Famous"" Okay so ""Project X"" does have plenty of laughs and the first half gave me the impression that this movie might have some potential. but just like the radical party, it just totally becomes uncontrollable. which lead to the finale to take a 180 degree turn in its tone. It's the ending that was a major letdown even for a film that didn't have very much going for it from the beginning.",Project X
33,brando647,"PROJECT X is No Masterpiece, but it's a Fun Ride",7,18 September 2012,"OK, I don't know about the rest of you but I'm getting a little burnt out on the whole ""found footage"" genre. I feel like it found new ground in 2008 with CLOVERFIELD when filmmakers realized that they could utilize the technique to try and put the audience in the middle of the action. Sometimes it works (e.g. CHRONICLE) but most times it doesn't. In the case of PROJECT X, I suppose it sort of fits. I can see what the filmmakers were aiming for here, but somewhere around halfway through the movie I realized I couldn't figure out the camera sources anymore. The only two ""established"" sources are Dax with his video camera and the two security kids. Outside of these sources, who was shooting this whole thing? If you're not going to do it right, don't bother doing it at all. Anyway, there's my complaint on lazy ""found footage"" films. Glad to get it out of the way. So, PROJECT X is a low budget movie that drops you right in the middle when three high school nobodies plan to throw the biggest party their town has seen. It's Thomas Kub's 18th birthday and his friends J.B. and Costa have conspired to throw a massive party and score themselves women that are way out of their leagues. Costa goes a little overboard in advertising the party and, next thing you know, their hopeful little party of around fifty people has exploded into a block party of over a thousand and everything spirals out of control.By no means is PROJECT X a good movie, but then again I barely consider it a movie. It's really just an hour and a half of chaos with minor characterization scattered between montages of teenage debauchery. I admit, PROJECT X is a good time for at least one viewing. Especially if you're not sober to begin with. There isn't exactly an intricate plot to follow here. The first half hour of the movie sets up the dominoes, establishing each and every rule these kids are about to break and every person their going to cross. When Kub's dad is walking the kids through the house and giving them the lowdown on which room's aren't to be entered or which of his things aren't to be touched, you know that means they will be. When Costa steals a garden gnome from a psychopathic drug dealer or makes a point of warning the neighbors that they're holding a ""minor get-together"", there is going to be a conflict before the night is over. The setups are established, and the following hour is just payoff after payoff in a series of escalating gags. It's fun to watch everyone go from the doubt that anyone will bother to show up to absolute chaos in the streets, and it's a steady escalation. By the end of the night, it's absolute anarchy and you can't help but wish (even if it's just a minor part of you in the back of your mind) that someone had had the nerve to hold a party like this when you were in high school.No sense in worrying about production value in a movie where everything appears to have been shot on Handi-cam, so that leaves the characters. Or, wait, sorry. That should be ""characters"", because there really isn't much to them. Most of them are left to mere stereotypes. Thomas is the birthday boy, a kid who's popularity is so low that even his father has to admit he's a loser. Costa (Oliver Cooper) is one of the most annoying characters you'll ever see. He's a self-professed ladies man, or at least he claims to have been one before he moved to this small town. And then there's J.B., theumfat kid. His sole purpose in the film is to be the butt of Costa's barrage of fat jokes. Throw in a girl next door/love interest (Kirby Blanton), the hot chick (Alexis Knapp), and the sleazy college athlete (Miles Teller) and you've got your bases covered. This movie is all about the party and the bizarre antics that happen when a thousand teens get together and get drunk. Half of the movie is just montages and music, set to what I'm assuming is the director's own ""killer"" party mix CD. Remove all the filler and movie is probably only 40-45 minutes long. PROJECT X is no masterpiece but it's a fun ride, I'll give it that. Once you start watching, you can't help but want to see how it all plays out.",Project X
34,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Wildly unlikable actors, disturbing amounts of misogyny, and a narcissistic/sociopathic plot and characters make this the worst ""comedy"" of the year...",1,22 August 2012,"In what universe is this ""comedy"" considered funny, entertaining or good by any stretch of the imagination? I have just witnessed nearly 90 minutes of cold-blooded, hateful misogyny, violence, spitefulness, narcissism and sociopathic characters in the ""movie"" ""Project X."" This is a fundamentally unlikable film by any and every stretch of the imagination. I felt downright filthy watching it, and only finished it out of sheer masochistic curiosity, hoping it would get better at some point. But... oh, god... It didn't. It only got worse and worse.This is one of those exploitation films that just misses the mark completely. It aims for it's target, and then turns 90 degrees, shooting in the completely wrong direction.From the opening minute, you know this is a stinker, when Costa (Oliver Cooper), one of the main characters in introduced. He is a loathsome character. From the second he's introduced, it's clear he's some sort of evil hybrid of Jar Jar Binks and the raunchiest frat boy you could find. His voice is like nails on a chalkboard, and his complete and utter hatred of women (from his first few seconds of dialog) and sociopath tendencies towards anyone else turn off the viewer instantly. Oliver Cooper- if god forbid there's a sequel, at least tone down your obvious hatred and spitefulness, please!Costa (to be hereafter referred to as ""Evil Punk"") and his friend/cameraman Dax (Dax Flame), are working on a video for their friend Thomas' (Thomas Mann) birthday. Thomas is actually kinda, sorta likable at first. We also meet JB (Jonathan Daniel Brown), another friend, an overweight nerd. Evil Punk continues to spew his misogyny CONSTANTLY, and they plan to have a party at Thomas' house to gain popularity and to get laid. Thomas and JB quickly lose what little likability they have, and it is hinted that there might be feelings between Thomas and Kirby (Kirby Bliss Blanton), a friend of his who sadly like the others is likable at first, but quickly degenerates into a caricature.The trio invites a ton of people to the party and go to get booze. (During which Evil Punk further proves his vile nature by shoplifting, harassing shoppers over the PA system at the store, and even putting alcohol into a baby's hand and making it cry. HOW IS THIS FUNNY? That's mentally deranged behavior! These characters should be committed to an asylum.) They also get drugs and the party starts. From there on in, the film is a whirlwind of evil, deplorable scene after evil, deplorable scene.The rest of the film features consistent continuations of the misogyny from Evil Punk and the others, consequence-less depictions of under-aged drinking and use of heavy drugs, cases where people from outside of the party are assaulted (including an upsetting and disturbing scene in which a father is physically attacked for asking the party to quiet down so his infant can sleep), excessive property damage and severe and aggressive instances of violence. (And the influence of this film on impressionable teens has already caused at least one death and well over $100,000 in property damage from copycat parties in the months after it's released, so congrats filmmakers! You're responsible for death and destruction!)This is one of the single most deplorable, unlikable, and (I don't say this lightly) evil films I've seen in quite some time. It has absolutely no sense of self-control, and simply tries to shock the audience again and again, despite having no respect for basic human decency or life. It's disgusting and vile. I'm a fan of extreme cinema, including films like ""Human Centipede 2"", ""Ichi the Killer"" ""A Serbian Film"", ""Cannibal Holocaust"", etc. And from a basic level of human decency, the sheer hatred and disrespect this movie has makes those others look like Disney film.In addition, from a technical standpoint, this film is a mess. It's meant to resemble a ""found footage"" feature, yet the footage is either way too professional looking, or just too awful looking from shot to shot, making it feel manufactured, the editing is a mess, and the music is dreadful.Shame on Thomas Mann, Oliver Cooper and the other actors involved. Shame on director Nima Nourizadeh. Shame on producer Todd Phillips. Shame on writers Michael Bacall and Matt Drake. And shame on anyone who supported this film.This is one of the most deeply disturbing, upsettingly misogynistic, poorly made, shockingly unfunny and unlikable, and downright narcissistic films I've ever seen. It's easily the worst comedy of the year, and possibly the worst comedy of this decade.I've been trying not to use the word ""hate"" so much recently, but there's no other choice- I hate this film and all involved. It's a 1 out of 10.",Project X

It is clearly styled on Superbad and for me personally, that is no bad thing. The use of an amateur filming style helps give Project X its own identity and the overall feel of the movie is refreshingly original. The main actors, while blatantly modelled on Jonah Hill, Michael Cera and Christopher Mintz-Plasse's Superbad counterparts, nevertheless do a great job and are thoroughly believable as nerdy outsiders.The escalation of the party is gloriously nihilistic and creates an incredible final act that is extremely well-directed. On top of that, the movie is under 90 minutes long which is an increasing rarity these days. Tell the story and get out- no padding and no filler. I cannot praise this movie enough. It has all the best elements of a good high school comedy but with a dark indie edge. A true sleeper of teen comedies that deserves way more credit.",Project X
39,deatman9,I don't understand all the hate,7,22 November 2012,I watched this movie the other night and I actually really enjoyed it finding it to be a very accurate well executed movie showing what a lot of teens are like. The acting was actually really good surprising considering all the young unheard of actors. Bottom line this movie was a very intense real depiction of youth. Some people say they hate it because of the drugs or because of the vandalism and lets me put that into perspective. When your a teen who parties all the time you do drugs just how it is...And when you get that many people together..a couple thousand or so a couple people are going to start destroying things. This is very real and it all happens so Im very confused at the outrage of this movie.This movie is about a young nerdy guy in high school who wants to become popular so his friends help him set up a party that will be the talk of the city and the highscool for years to come....and he does just that..I personally really liked this movie..Maybe because in high school I was one of those kids and I could easily see this kind of thing happening. I think a lots of the hate comes from people who were never really invited to parties. They are just jealous at how much fun that looked and boy it is.,Project X
40,Christian_Dimartino,There's something very familiar about all of this...,4,1 July 2012,"Party comedies have been done to death, so I feel that there was absolutely no need for Project X, a film that follows all of the party film rules and clichés, and brings us a stale experience that feels as if it were written by, you guessed it, three teenage boys who want to be famous.So, I have sort of given away the story plot. Using another filming style that's been done to death(the hand-held camera thing), four, not three, teenagers plan a party when the parents are gone, and of course, because it's produced by Todd Phillips(The Hangover), it just happens to be the craziest party in history.My head was rolling so much when I watched this that it almost fell off. I'm not sure if I laughed. To me, it feels as if the writers of this movie sat down at a table, thought of the wildest things possible, and thought,""Hey guys, we gotta make a movie outta this."" And not much of the material, the insanity, works.And the ending, God, the ending, is ridiculous. It's not like the movie is a true story or it's trying to be plausible, because it isn't, and the very ending, God help us, is so poor and annoying.

Seriously everybody move on from the whole person in the movie filming the movie. It does not work!! I'm not that fussed on destructive teen movies but can usually appreciate them without being too judgemental but honestly the level of disrespect and lack of responsibility shits me off. It shows the scum of society doing what they do best in not caring about other people's belongings and not having any respect for human beings in general. There wasn't even anything funny about this film. It was painful to sit through and a complete rip-off of better movies that have already gone there.Look I know I'm ranting but honestly anyone who thought this piece of trash was movie genius has morality issues and needs help.

There's the kid whose parents left him their house for the weekend. And he has three faithful buddies: The confident instigator; the dorky fatso; and a faceless camera operator who captures everything. The ""all you see is being filmed"" device ala CHRONICLE works nicely here, making the inevitable suburban bash feels like it's right in your face – and you don't even need 3D glasses.But while the party is key, some of the best scenes occur beforehand. As the popularity-seeking geeks set things in motion, from getting the word out to ripping off a ""loaded"" garden gnome from an urban drug dealer, we get to know these underdog losers enough to where, once the raging party occurs, their winning matters. While the cocky Oliver Cooper delivers the scene stealing role – think of a younger Vince Vaughan in SWINGERS – the heart and soul belongs to Thomas Mann, providing the essential drool-to-cool story arc.It's his birthday party after all, which occurs in montage tidbits ranging from naked girls to a midget locked inside a stove, and fireworks and even a flamethrower. And while the intensity increases a bit too quickly the party morphing into an act of terrorism within a ten-minute time frame it's never a drag. Yet what remains consistent throughout all the noise are the characters we've grown comfortable with. All leading to a weak and implausible resolution. Although the aftermath really doesn't matter.

I wanted to see this film, mostly because I'm a huge fan of the ""found footage"" gimmick. I loved Cloverfield, all three Paranormal Activities, Blair Witch, and plenty of others. This is the third movie in the ""Found Footage"" gimmick I've seen in 2012, and I can tell you right now that it is way better than ""The Devil Inside,"" but not nearly as good as ""Chronicle."" This movie got mainly negative reviews from critics and pretty mixed reviews among people, so I didn't know what to expect when going into this movie.Stuff I didn't like included some generic characters. A lot of people are complete idiots in this movie. There is a scene where the main character's friend gets angry at him, and I really don't know what she was mad about. But my biggest problem was that the film wasn't that funny, I chuckled a descent amount of times, but I never got that big laugh and there were too many dry spots. Not as bad as Paul or Bridesmaids, but I was just hoping to laugh more.However, despite not being that funny, this movie is never boring, at least not once the party starts. I was entertained almost all the way through, so much stuff happens at this party that it's hard not to call it ""the party you've only dreamed about."" I also really like the main character ""Thomas,"" he reminds me of me. If I were in his position, that is how I would act, I would want to not get in trouble.

""Project X"" is my first movie of 2012 that I have seen so far. I've been reading that this movie is one of the craziest party movies since ""The Hangover"". It recaptures the events of a knock-out party gone wrong, with ""found footage"" that looks like it actually happened, or rumored to be. It's like a combination of ""Risky Business"" and ""Paranormal Activity"", all wrapped up into one. When walking in the movie, I expected to see that this movie was just your average party movie involving sex, drugs, and alcohol. But, boy, was I wrong. This movie is more than a party movie involving sex, drugs, and alcohol. From the opening scenes to the end credits, I was surprised on how hard I was laughing and how crazy everything was. It was the most awesome movie I have seen so far this year. Every single time this movie tries to be funny, it did more than just make me laugh. It made me laugh so hard that I wanted to jump out of my seat, and crap my pants. But I'm a getting ahead of myself, so let's start from the beginning. The movie starts with three ""losers"" planning the biggest blowout for another guy's birthday. They start having the time of their life, with a party filled with ecstasy, liquor, and madness, until it leads into a unbelievable consequence filled with mayhem, chaos, and destruction, that's way too impossible to believe. Trust me, when you watch the movie, you will understand. That ending will make your jaw drop throughout. The only thing that disappointed me was that the movie took forever to develop, and you are stuck in the party for almost half of the whole movie, before getting into more interesting territory.

To those that have been involved in the crazy high school party, you will learn a lot from this movie! It's so hilarious that it will make you laugh-out-loud, bust your guts, and tickle your funny bone. Yep, it's stupid and mindless, but that's what makes this movie great.

50,Chris_Pandolfi,A Movie That Sends Mixed Signals,5,3 March 2012,"Is ""Project X"" a cautionary tale of irresponsible teenagers, or is it a glorification of underage debauchery? I wish I could answer this question. The film is nothing if not an eighty-eight-minute lesson in sending mixed signals, which will not do any favors for its primary audience (you and I both know its R rating will not deter those under the age of seventeen from seeing it). While much of the film is exactly what I expected it would be – wild partying, crude behavior, a lot of foul language, profane sexual references – the experience was nonetheless unsettling, for at no point could director Nima Nourizadeh make up his mind on what message he wanted to send. It's hard for me to accept this movie as pure entertainment, since there is nothing innately entertaining about teenage drinking, drug taking, and the wanton destruction of private property.The film is yet another example of a found-footage mockumentary, which in the last four years alone has become an overused stylistic trend, especially in the horror genre. Its purpose in ""Project X,"" according to the filmmakers, is to give audiences the feeling that they're guests attending the party. It works to an extent, but the illusion is repeatedly shattered, most notably during montage sequences that are mistakenly made to be as cinematic as possible; the dancers dance in slow motion, there are multiple back-and-forth edits between various locations, and the soundtrack omits all ambient noises in favor of throbbing background music. These scenes play less like cinema verite and more like a hip hop music video. There was no real reason the film had to be shot in this particular way, apart from the fact that it's currently popular in movies.But the real issues stem from a premise that isn't all that engaging, characters that aren't all that likable, gags that aren't all that amusing, and a message that isn't all that clear. It's delinquent porn – a gratuitous celebration of booze, pot, ecstasy, sex, and destructive juvenile behavior that I'm fairly certain is illegal in all fifty states. At times, it's wildly wrong in what it believes is funny. One example is a foulmouthed dwarf who angrily punches guys in the crotch. Another is a pet dog consistently at the mercy of thoughtless partiers; after being tethered to a large bunch of balloons and getting suspended in midair, it repeatedly has marijuana smoke blown directly at its face. The audience is made to think everything is alright when we see it eating from a spilt bag of potato chips. Ha ha, the dog has the munchies. In reality, this would count as an act of animal cruelty.The plot: Los Angeles high schoolers Costa (Oliver Cooper) and J.B. (Jonathan Daniel Brown) decide to throw their unpopular friend, Thomas (Thomas Mann) the biggest, wildest birthday party ever. Thomas' parents will be away for the weekend because, as fate would have it, his birthday and their anniversary fall on the exact same day. Costa, who can never stop bragging about that fact that he's originally from Queens, doesn't invite his classmates so much as recklessly orchestrate a viral marketing campaign, especially to the girls. Night falls. Hordes of guests show up with every kind of alcohol imaginable. Music blares to life. Every rule Thomas' parents set are broken. The crowd balloons to well over 1,000, taking the party out into the streets. As the night progresses, the rowdiness escalates into a riot, the cops are called, a news helicopter flies over the house, and a nut with a flamethrower torches the neighborhood over his stolen garden gnome.Most of the footage is captured by a rarely seen high schooler named Dax (Dax Flame), who, despite his age, mysteriously lives alone. Apart from the party, he also gets candid glimpses of Thomas, who believes so strongly that he should get lucky with a variety of hot girls that he misses the tell tale signs exhibited by his friend, a young woman named Kirby (Kirby Bliss Blanton). Thomas is repeatedly distracted by how out of hand the party has become and worries that his parents will find out about it. Costa assures him that everything will be alright; he even gives him a tablet of ecstasy to calm him down. At that point, Thomas no longer cares about much of anything. This would account for why he flips off the news helicopter with both hands.All eventually leads to an unsatisfactory and curiously ambiguous ending, one that begs the question of whether or not ""Project X"" serves as a warning against the behavior it depicts. I'm afraid I cannot elaborate on why, as I would have to issue a spoiler warning. Let it suffice to say that Thomas' actions have generated two markedly different reactions, and that specific people are disturbingly unclear about their feelings in the matter. As far as I'm concerned, uncertainty is inappropriate for this kind of story. From the very start, it should have been open about its intentions. Of course, if I had any say in the matter, I would have opted to make the film a cautionary tale. Throwing an epic party might have made Thomas a legend in the short term, but twenty years down the line, I suspect he and his friends will deeply regret what they did that one night. Who would want that on their conscience?-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",Project X
51,the amorphousmachine,Kids these days!,4,18 December 2012,"MASSIVE SPOILERS! Admittedly, this film was reasonably well-directed even with the obnoxious flare it embodied. There was gratuitous mammary pool scene that enhanced the crazy party atmosphere of the most-craziest party imaginable. It has the usual plot pointers with the exposition in the beginning such as ""don't touch the merc"", the acquisition of the garden gnome, and the friend you love to hate who helps spiral this endeavour out of control. There were some humorous moments as well, such as the next door neighbour punching a twelve-year old Taser-wielding security freak, and subsequent Intel on that particular neighbour adding some needed laughs. 'Project X' wasn't trying to be realistic, even though it employed a documentary style of filmmaking- this was exhibited by the complete unrealism of the partygoers remaining silent when the Police arrive initially, as well as putting the dog up in the air via balloons. The film never apologises for being anything more than a silly movie with the initial premise. As the party spirals out of the control as well as the characters becoming more far gone in apathetic bliss (thanks to some ecstasy) as their house and contents are getting trashed, the movie also spirals into more stupidity; with glamorisation of drug-use, dick-punching midgets, vengeful flamethrowers, and more obnoxious behaviour from the lead characters proclaiming the party's greatness because of the sheer insanity! It's like 'Superbad' on steroids and then some, except the former film is far superior, and their kick-ass party is funnier and with less destructive elements. 'Project X' is a well-directed mess much like the party itself, and unlike 'Chronicle', 'Paranormal Activity' or 'Cloverfield', I don't think the documentary style adds to the subject or makes it any less artificial than other similar-themed party movies with spliced footage of revelling overlapped with loud music. In the end, the main character was less of a atypical ""loser"" in his father's eyes, and popular in high school, and no one got hurt- except for the badly burned should-have-been-dead drug-dealer! ** out of *****!",Project X
52,dallasryan,The Ultimate Party,7,5 October 2015,"Todd Phillips has always liked making movies with ultimate partying i.e. Old School, The Hangover, Road Trip, etc. So it doesn't surprise me he produced this film and I'm sure he was very big part in the final product which is Project X (some producers are, some aren't, some just fork over the cash and stay out of the process). In all honesty, you don't really care much for the characters, this movie is about pure partying, pure exploitation, pure entertainment. The film shots are so incredible, I have never seen a party movie like this before which such beautiful and elaborate film quality shots of people partying. One has to see it to believe it and you will believe it once you watch this film, it is the ultimate party. I just crack up at the end when all chaos finally breaks loose as the fire starter enters the picture, cracks me up because of what is not see (on what all the neighbors on the street must be feeling at that moment in time, that's what cracks me up). Absolute pandemonium. A very slick film overall.",Project X
53,dschmeding,I am not sure if I did not get the movie or most people on IMDb did not get it,7,1 August 2012,"I went into this movie with the expectations of a guilty pleasure teenage party romp. Its kind of what I got but this movie is so over the top I was kind of irritated in the middle, more irritated in the end and utterly irritated when reading what people think of ""Project X"" on IMDb.Whatever you think about Project X... its a movie that conquers new ground, it breaks taboos constantly and doesn't seem to give a s**t. Its a fun movie in its uncompromising way ... but it leaves a strange taste in your mouth.The premise is simple... three horny high school kids not to popular at school try to use the birthday party of one of them to raise their popularity at school by making it BIG. So they invite many people, buy booze and drugs and hope to score big time... but like in those Facebook stories things get out of hand and hundreds of horny drunk high school kids show up. Now that is pretty standard stuff but the director just stacks one ludicrous thing on the next. They raise the bar so many times you lose hope they ever find an end to it. All that is filmed in ""found footage"" style by a guy who no one really knows or cares for, who is barely shown or heard in the movie but who seems to be a focal point, especially because the movie ends pretty much on him.The strange taste in my mouth was not really caused by the massive amounts of drugs, booze, tits, puke and pee shown in the movie but by the way ALL characters behave. EVERY character in this movie is an egotistical douche-bag. People constantly treat others disrespectful or use them for their own fun or game. The three main characters get treated like s**t and they treat others and each other just the same. There is one scene where they are high on ecstasy (after a ridiculous scene where pills are falling on the ground and dozens of kids just taking them without knowing what it is... the whole ecstasy/drug dealer plot line is so full of holes and unbelievable it really feels a little forced... just like the choice and editing of the music). It feels like they have an epiphany about how badly they treat each other... but they just keep on making fun of each other and being a-holes. And thats what the whole movie does... it just goes on and on, there is no resolution. Whatever happens, it just goes on. In it to win it, nothing else.You get animal abuse, kids constantly bullying each other and neighbors or clerks in stores, jocks bullying nerds, parents calling their son a loser, friends calling their friends fat pigs, midgets locked in ovens, kids tazering and beating up adults cowardly, exploiting the law, constant lying and manipulating, shaving drunk persons and even peeing on them, filming couples having sex for hidden cam youtube videos... the whole thing feels kind of dystopian at times.Now there seem to be two ways people react to this movie... ""Aaah, this is the best and most radical party movie ever"" or ""This is a despicable display of teen assholism and irresponsible to downplay that kind of behavior"". I might be over-analyzing but to me this is a biting satire and critique of our times.My clues?EVERY person, and i mean EVERY person in this movie is an unlikable egotistical and ignorant douche-bag. The birthday kid comes across as a victim at times but the way he reacts and desperately thirsts for attention is as despicable as his friend who talks him into it all and the people showing up and destroying everything. There are no likable characters in this movie. I was really irritated about that and the casual presentation of all this behavior until the movie pulled full throttle in the last montage where kids are shown as drugged out pale zombies, shouting for someone to jump off a roof, exploding bottles in full rooms and in a an ultimate scene peeing on a drunk guy puking in a toilet and having a guy explode and runs around burning. Seriously... the last montage was more of a modern Techno-Video version of Pasolinis Salo than a fun party movie.OK, maybe i over-analyze... but look closely in the end. Look at the repercussions, look at how they get out of it with money, lawyers, lying and bending the law (all written on screen). Look at how a father seeing his son as a loser respects him simply for making hundreds of idiots show up to a party that could ruin his whole life. Look at the kid who films the whole thing who turns out to be an outcast no one cares for who eerily looks like the Columbine shooters and lives alone with his parents missing and the police inspecting their disappearance. Look at how everybody thirsts for attention and hurting others is a fine vehicle to get there including how the school treats the three losers after the party, how the girl forgives birthday-boy. All just because 1000 people showed up to a party... it eerily fits with the fat loser guy regularly referencing his facebook friends. This is a giant inferiority complex in progress.Its funny how in this case some seem unable to even see the utter ignorance this movie is made up of while others are simply appalled by it and ignore the statements in the end.Many reactions to it are damn scary. The depiction of social interaction in this movie is more dystopian than anything that Ayn Rand could ever make up.",Project X
54,carlos37andre,An extremely funny teenager movie,8,12 October 2017,"I believe that there isn't much to say about the movie. Project X is a really funny with some awkward and hilarious moments movie. It's a concept really clever in a genre that in some way is saturated. Some ""plot"" points makes really no sense at all (for example, the parents reactions to the house destruction), but it's okay, you are watching a dirty teenager movie, that's really is not the goal here.One thing that deserve attention is the found footage, the camera work is pretty good, just two or tree scenes that bothers. I'm a real fan of this type of movie, and I was glad at the end. Well, in short I think that the movie try to be funny, and succeeds, the actors are great, extremely funny and charismatic, and the camera work it's pretty good in 90% of it.If you go see it with the right expectations, I recommend.",Project X
55,FountainPen,Losers get drunk and make egregious asses of themselves,1,3 November 2017,"Yes, truly awful, awful, awful. Do you REALLY want to see 88 minutes of fools acting stupidly? If so, this is your thing! I see no actual reason for this film myself, but maybe I'm terribly old- fashioned, huh? It has no valuable, redeeming qualities, zero depth, any comedy is contrived, simply not funny, or base. On the plus side, the picture is shot in focus and you can understand (through some slurring) what is being said. There is sexual content, though not to the ""X"" level, which may disappoint some watchers. Mainly, I guess, its appeal will be to curious pre-teens who want to see what they may be in for within a few years' time. Or possibly to a much older crowd wanting to see what young people get up to (or down to) these days. At least, if you do watch it, you can relax and put your mind totally out of gear for an hour and a half. For me, this flick can't join the ""GARBAGE"" pile fast enough.",Project X
56,solojere,Insanity,6,29 May 2021,"*Spoiler warning*Like Cloverfield and The Blair Witch Project, Project X is a handheld stile film that follows three friends who throw the world's most epic party. This movie is pure insanity, and it is defiantly not for everyone. It pushes the envelope in almost every way possible. Honestly, I have mixed feelings about this film, and the only way I think I can review this film is by breaking down the pros and cons of the film.Pros:
There is never a dull moment. Something crazy is always happening. I couldn't look away and never felt bored. Most of the time, I was shocked they had the guts to put whatever was happening in the movie.I like the found footage genre, and I think it works well with this story.The music is amazing, especially the remix of Kid Cudi's pursuit of happiness.This movie isn't afraid to be edgy
The dog was super cute
Alexis Knapp is super cute and actually a pretty Alexis as an interesting character who defiantly deserved better than what we got to see.The bonus you get to see Alexis Knapp Naked (unfortunately, the scene was trash. See cons).The old guy who wants to party was funny.Lastly, the party itself is simply epic.Cons:
The main characters are all selfish jerks, especially Costa. However, Thomas is pretty bad when you think about it.The cameraman doesn't really talk. It would've been better to be like Cloverfield, where the cameraman comments on what is happening.Also, the film switch between camera views a lot. This is a pet peeve of mine in the found footage genre, as I think it cheapens the experience a little when they edit together footage from different cameras because that means someone edited within the world of the story. Personally, I find the experience more immersive when it is edited to look like the footage came from just one camera.Kirby's character was pointless, and it was stupid that she just forgave Thomas at the end was pathetic. I know they wanted her to be the girl next door best friend trope, but I think it would've been better to omit her character in favor of Alexis' character.Furthermore, the film is very degrading to women in general. The women in this movie are all sex objects to be sexualized by the men in the movie.This is particularly true with Alexis. I love Alexis Knapp, but this movie did her dirty by just making her the hot chick. Honestly, her character was the most interesting. She is painted as being shallow, but she seemed pretty down to earth once Thomas started talking to her. And then, when she finally opens up to Thomas, he dumps her for Kirby even though he was totally fine with it before she walked in. And to top it all off, they set it up as if a 12-year-old is filming her while she is naked like a perv! Plus, she is supposed to be only 17! I know in real life she was 23 and that it's a movie, and she agreed to do the scene, but it's kind of creepy when you think about it.My final criticism is the film tries too hard to have a happy ending. Thomas has a crazy party and destroys not only his house but the whole neighborhood. However, his dad finally respects him, gets the girl, and is now the popular kid at school. A more tragic feeling at the end would've made the movie better, IMHO.Overall, it's a fairly entertaining movie with some great music. It's defiantly worth watching at least once if you can handle its crudeness. However, if you are sensitive, find something else because this movie is not PC at all. Just don't think too much about it.",Project X

59,plasticanimalz,"Aimless, Pointless, Not Entertaining, and All Hype",1,8 March 2012,"All this is is a marketing campaign to make money and fool teens and others to spend their hard earned money on...video footage of a fake party. Come on. This can only be compared to the gimmick infommercials you see on late night TV where they have all these fake claims about how great the product is, when they're hired actors. They do it for the movies too. The people you see in commercials saying how great the film is: actors. The tweets you see on billboards pretending to be kids, saying this is ""Super Bad on crack,"" or ""if Super Bad and the Hangover had a baby"": social marketers. These claims are not real. Just like I don't believe the majority of people who gave this a positive review who claim to be teens and in college are real. Movie marketing teams hire social medial guys they pay $8 to $15 and hour to write reviews everywhere, saying how awesome this was and relatable, fun, blah, blah.Don't be a dummy. Do you want to go to a party or watch a video about party?? Are they going to start making full length films about riding a bicycle? Walking a dog? Transformer movies are dumb but at least they are actual movies and you get the benefit of cool special effects and hot super models, this you get none of that. All this movie is really for is for people who DON'T get invited to parties. And seriously, how many people can't get an invite to a party?

60,cadillac20,"Not So Much A Film, But An Experience",5,29 February 2012,"Make no mistake, Project X is not trying to be something it's not. This is not a film that disguises itself as some kind of moralistic film with a message. Yes, it has a message, but most of the film demonstrates that it knows what it is and that's what it wants to show you. The found footage elements is incidental as this is about one thing and one thing only: the most kick ass, epic party ever.Certainly, this film piles on the necessities for any party film. It follows the cliché losers: the normal one, the one who things he's all that but is really just a jerk, and the fat friend that gets made fun of a lot. Oh, and there is the creepy camera guy that follows them around, but he is mostly incidental as well. Then there are the others: the hot chick, the best friend chick, the jerk of a jock, and every other party movie cliché of a character there is. But this is not about the characters. No, this is about the party. The party is the most important character. And let me tell you, it is one hell of a party. In fact, it's probably the most exciting and best party I've seen in a movie. Ever.I mean that. In every party film, we have things that happen. But not like this. This party, in fact, gets so out of control, by the end of the night, you think you're watching another movie. We're talking horse stealing, flame thrower wielding, driving a car into a swimming pool. Okay, now maybe you can imagine what that's like, but until you've seen it in this film, you haven't experienced it. And in fact, that is what this film is, an experience. It's like being the by standard at the greatest party ever. You're just watching the events unfold. And in that sense, it's a good time. It is quite funny at times, which is surprising, considering that I hardly thought a found footage style film could be a comedy.But if you're wondering about my rating, I will refer you back to the part where I said this isn't really a movie. The film deviates between uninspired clichés and random action, but there is very little plot here. And what is there is weak. The actors are surprisingly good, but they are second to the chaos that commences. And in the end, the film is nothing more than a progressive series of calamities that escalates into an unbelievable climax of destruction. It's certainly the party of the century, but much like said party would be, you're not there for anything deep or meaningful, you're simply there to partake in the debauchery. The experience of this film is much the same. So, if you're down to see this film, don't expect much, but sit back an enjoy the chaos.

64,Treyroo,Awesome Party movie,7,24 November 2012,"Did you spend your entire high school career as someone with few friends who will more than likely be forgotten by the student body moments after graduating? What could you do to change that?Thomas (played by Thomas Mann) is turning seventeen and his parents are leaving town. His parents (played by relative unknowns Peter Mackenzie and Caitlin Dullany) fully expect him to throw a party in their absence and simply ask that it be kept under control. Still his friends Costa (played by Oliver Cooper) and JB (played by Jonathan Daniel Brown) believe that they can bring into being an epic gathering that will elevate their friend and themselves to legendary status simply through social networking and word of mouth. Unsure of what to expect, they encounter a former classmate who recently graduated and invite him only to discover he's already planning to attend. And, every step of the way, Kirby (played by Kirby Bliss Blanton) is telling Thomas that Costa's party is a bad idea. Kirby is apparently Thomas's only female friend. Of course Blanton is quite attractive herself and while they've never been more than friends, Thomas entertains numerous fantasies regarding Alexis (another student played by Alexis Knapp) who has no idea he's alive.The title is terribly unoriginal, but it was initially intended to be a placeholder until it started to generate interest. Whether that was in any way related to the 1968 science fiction film of the same name or the 1987 comedy-science fiction-thriller starring Matthew Broderick, I can't say. I will say that I and many others in the theater laughed out loud numerous times throughout the film. Some have called this film irresponsible and said it sets a bad example to high school students. Then again, a film that sets a good example would probably depict a party where no alcohol or drugs are consumed, no cigarettes are smoked, and everyone returned home and went to bed at a decent hour after, of course, helping to clean up. Would ANYBODY see that? I wouldn't. It's not revolutionary and there are no profound life lessons but it is unmistakably a good time.",Project X
65,n-mo,"A nice little waste of time, but most people born after the mid-90s may not ""get it""",7,7 January 2020,"'Project X' starts with a familiar but very timeless concept: ordinary, marginal John or Jane Doe hatches a ""foolproof"" plan to make a big splash and ""become someone"" overnight. It's a fantasy firmly anchored in the American imagination when proud rugged individualism clashes with the need to belong to something greater. The trope is particularly powerful among adolescents, who aren't yet fully attuned to the adult consequences of adult-scale actions or the potential for a situation to get out of hand, and we've all heard about the discrete kid deciding to throw a wild party while his parents are gone for the weekend, in the hopes of landing a spot in the ""in-crowd"" and maybe humiliating the alpha persecutor (the Cocky Blond Guy or Nasty Cheerleader) along the way, while scoring the ultimate bomb of the opposite sex (the potential to bang the chick of one's choice being, of course, the primary motivation for males to get ""in"").The thing is, this sort of situation depends on the backdrop of a kind of a sleepy, cohesive and (ironically) ""wholesome"" neighborhood tissue to support the public high school from whence the host and the guests are drawn. By 2012, what with increasing ethnic and social fragmentation in the American landscape - especially in large urban conglomerates (this one is set in Pasadena) - this adolescent dynamic already seemed dated, and 'Project X' is not a period piece. Watching it just a few years later, after the Obergefell ruling and the instauration of ""Drag Queen Story Hour,"" the movie looks even more naïve, the creators drawing their inspiration from the high-school dynamics of their memories projected into their day and blissfully unaware of how the ongoing social revolutions were rendering it impossible to continue.Some may find it odd that I should characterize as ""naïve"" a picture depicting casual use of ecstasy, an army of young, topless roses jumping in the pool, underage characters engaging in foreplay, scatological accidents, the most sexually racy rap lyrics imaginable and even girl-on-girl face-sucking. That *was* long the reality for *certain* wild middle-/upper-middle-class adolescent/young-adult parties - though perhaps not in *quite* the concentrations depicted here and less and less every year for quite some time. Not only does it happen less often, but also, we're all jaded. Nowadays the biggest controversies even in those demographics seem to be over political correctness rather than sex or drugs. This isn't an edgy film by any means, the proof being that it was fine depicting lesbian filigrees but not male-on-male sexual activity (a similar film made today almost certainly would have, but that is not edgy in the current context however much the critics would argue it is).So is it a comedy? A drama? A coming-of-age story? 'Project X' wants to be all these, but is more than anything an exercise in un-self-conscious wish fulfillment which leans too much on the grandiosity of a spectacle that wasn't even shocking anymore by the time it was made, at the expense of clever comedic timing. Furthermore, the film takes itself too seriously: its adolescent protagonists assign disproportionate importance to their current social repertoire, as adolescents often do, yet this is never sent up or satired in any way.All that said, the film is not a total loss. The cinematography is top-notch: the filmmakers work the cinéma vérité style to perfection and the director draws out awesome party energy. It's about as close to being simultaneously cinematic and documentary as one could reasonably hope for. The actors portraying the lead buddy trio put a great deal of heart into their roles, and despite their cocky attitudes, total lack of discernment and crass adolescent mouths prove themselves as devoted and caring of friends as anyone could want, something that was lost on a lot of contemporary critics hung up on feminism and dainties and forgetting the age-old lesson not to give too much importance to appearances.One will of course need to suspend disbelief to project a 1995's American society with 2012 technology, to believe that adolescent girls would willingly flash themselves at a huge mixed party in front of unhidden cameras just because adolescent boys asked and to accept, for no reason other than the script calling for it, that Kirby Bliss Blanton could be any less tempting a score for the birthday boy than Alexis Knapp. But if you can just play along, it's a fun little ride into a wild night - as well as a good reminder of how far NOT to go when partying - and you'll be rooting for the birthday boy despite the silliness of this project and entirely predictable catasrophe he and his friends are courting. The film was remade in France two years later as 'Le Babysitting' with an adult cast, a reversal of the social-climbing dynamic, a less cataclysmic dénoument and much better comedic timing: despite its far-out premise the remake was overall more plausible. But it's worth checking out the original.",Project X

You stuck with 3/4 extremely lame characters, one of which is super annoying and made me want to turn it off, then your told there pretty much unpopular and they host a party to change that status. So the first 45 mins pretty much plays out as a bad hash of Superbad before the movie actually gets interesting. A series of outstanding events occur which actually recapture a dwindling interest. I would say really that the found footage style worked pretty well for the concept but the movie does slightly insult your intelligence with stereotypical high school characters, nudity, drugs and drinking. Its not a great movie but i would say its shot differently, its fairly entertaining, the events which play out are funny in a ridiculous sort of way",Project X
68,tecnogaming,The absolute worst message you could send to teenagers,1,8 June 2012,"I am furious, not because I watched this whole movie (which I did for the only purpose of doing a proper review) but for the painful experience it was for me to do so.From the first 10 minutes of the movie you can really see what this piece of crap is going to be like, dumb, terrible, insulting are not proper words to describe it.From the first minutes you see a couple of teenagers insulting everybody, more insulting, treating them and others like crap and just plain insulting pretty much everywhere. I don't have a problem with this words, in fact I usually say a few of them in a day because, well, they are just the right words to describe some situations, but, using this kinds of words to go shop, to talk to a stranger, to say hi, to speak to your friend, to go out of our house, to drive a car, well, it reaches a point in which the whole dialog you're gonna see in the movie is insulting to the same intelligence of the viewer and at that point, I get annoyed.That alone cannot contribute for a bad movie, bad examples and really bad signals are things that really contribute to completely destroy a good premise (like this one).According to this movie, this things are just OK to do: -Going about and insulting everybody in your path if you think it's cool. -Going ahead and call your only son a loser because it's not the star of the show in school (that is the lowest point a movie can reach). -Having a frenetic friend who compel you to have sex with anyone in your path, if you can't do it, just go get hi, use and abuse of drinks in any way you can, try to have more sex and then just use any action figure to simulate having it in another people's house just because you think that's cool. -Go buy stuff to get hi, even if you're very young and that probably will destroy the few neurons you had left, but, in the process, try and steal something from the seller's house, just because stealing is fun! -If by mistake the person discovers you are stealing, just turn on your car and run!, if by any chance you hit the man on the street, please, do not stop to see if he is OK, just run! -If the guy somehow manage to survive, just call him a moron because he broke the front glass of your car.Are serious??, are these the kind of message that teenagers should receive? I understand that this is just a movie, but, sometimes too much is just too much.The funniest part is when parents gave them a nice car to the son (because of his birthday) and the friends keeps telling him how bad that is and that they can't go out with that car?!, seriously, this is materialism-consumerism-capitalism to the extreme and it's just plain horrendous, the movie is hideous in more ways that it seems at plain sight.If you think teenagers any age should watch this movie and they probably will think that all the things here are 'cool' you are being part of the dumbing down movement of the masses that is going on right now with Hollywood.Well, i'm not part of it, this movie is crap and sadly I don't have a zero or -1 to qualify this disaster of a movie and had to be settled with 1.This movie is impossible to watch if you are reasonable sane person with good values, probably watchable if you're sufficiently hi enough but that is not for me, not in this life.The movie serves to show the absolute worst and most stupid and horrid examples of how you should NOT be and this examples are put into perspective as something fun and that in itself speaks volumes about the level of stupidity that is feed up to the public this days.More than 70 million dollars to make this crap? I saw movies done by 3000 dollars that are 1500 times better than this one, I could name a few hundreds of them but, I think you understood my point.Oh, treating humans like crap is bad, but the movie also had to show how this guys treat animals like crap too, not a single thing is right about this movie. I am really upset that this kind of things are considered ""comedy"" this days....Oh, and one more thing, Oliver Cooper please do us all a favor and do not act anymore, on any other movie, yours was the worst acting ever done on a movie, any quality aside, and your character was a lunatic, ready to be put to sleep or in a mental institution, not a figure to be considered a ""cool"" guy, this teen seems to be hi the whole movie and it's the most irritating character I've ever had to endure.PD: even IMDb complained about my language and I tend to be polite, just image the level you will face in the movie.Nuff said-1 out of 10",Project X
69,Pistol219,Forgot how awesome this movie was.,9,1 October 2021,So in the beginning says it's fictional story. However this movie is legit based off of an Australian Teen who had a party very similar to this. Shits legendary.,Project X
70,indiedavid,One of the worst I have ever seen,3,6 January 2013,"There was nothing redeeming about this film. Poor story, very poorly produced, amateur cinematography, no lighting, bad acting, etc. I think the filmmakers were trying to re-create the scripted-reality feel of other horrible films like ""Blair Witch Project"". The most fascinating aspect of this film is the budget. How in the hell they spent $12 million on this joke is beyond my comprehension. I could easily have pulled it off for $2000. Of course I would never have my name associated with such a pathetic attempt at a feature film. From a production perspective, I have never seen a film shot completely without lighting. If they used lights, they shouldn't admit it. I am not sure if they used the hand held camera to contribute to the amateur format or they just couldn't afford a tripod. In either case, it was awful.",Project X
71,stebird,The teenage pinnacle is reached,9,24 July 2017,"First time director Nima Nourizadeh reeks havoc and nothing is spared but the camera filming the chaos. Some have groaned, but I absolutely loved Project X for its raw, uncut, anything goes anarchy, it's as though the producers have said ""We've seen teenage house party movies before, but we're going to raise the bar to new heights"", and yes they have certainly achieved that.What makes the film that extra bit special for me is the ""found footage"" style of shooting it, having a background character record the whole day leading to the party, and then the party itself makes the whole project look seriously real, using the found footage way of filming is indeed risky, as a lot of those kinds of films are lacklustre and even very poor, but not this one. Thomas is your average, unpopular ""loser"" kid that everyone had in high school, but for Thomas and his friends Costa and JB, things were going to pick up and most certainly, they decide that, as Thomas' parents are away for the weekend, and they have the house to themselves, nothing would scream ""cool"" and ""popularity"" more than staging their own birthday for Thomas, but of course, this would not be any ordinary birthday party!Costa invites practically everyone at school and everyone he knows on the outside too, the party naturally gets out of hand with everyone from freshman to Miles Teller turning up.Damage, so-so much damage ensues, loud music, a pool, a bouncy house, people inside the house causing mayhem (when they shouldn't actually be in there), even the dog gets involved, and at one stage the poor mutt gets tethered to a bunch of balloons and almost floats away, until Thomas saves the day, and the dog. Yes for reasons unknown there's a romantic angle inserted into the film, Thomas still has a thing for Alexis, and for me this little angle was unneeded and served no real purpose to the actual film (why did they have to throw romantic mush into this!?) In the future some may consider Project X to be a cult classic and hail it one of the best films in its category, but for now, in the present day, it has earned its fair share of notoriety particularly involving its choice of location for the filming, as local residents all complained about the noise, despite the filmmakers trying to stay as far away from residential areas as they could.This is the party we all wished we had at the end of high school, but the quality of such a party can only be achieved through fiction, well done for a highly enjoyable film.",Project X
72,Legendary_Badass,Makes The Hangover Look Like Adventures in Babysitting,8,3 March 2012,"Project X is not the kind of movie I expected to enjoy. It takes the overplayed gimmick of fictional found footage (shot supposedly by tweaked out teens) and uses it to hold the flag for all things irresponsible. It may at the same time it carries the burden of frankness few teen comedies offer. Underachiever Thomas Kub (Thomas Mann) is celebrating his birthday, which coincided with his parents' anniversary. They've left him in charge of the house, but his three friends force his hand into throwing the most epic of parties.In the traditional sense the brash teen comedy has always incorporated a party scene. Many have been as bold to display the party as the focal point for a night of revelations. Usually this is nothing more than a collection of clichés. The jock bully is dating the innocent hot girl who happens to be the object of the introverted protagonist's affection. His plump friend provides the slapstick. Debauchery is civil.In Project X most of this is turned upside down. For starters the information age takes an active role as the narrative comes from every camera on the scene. This is nearly identical to the device found in Chronicle where telekinetic teens shoot themselves experimenting with their powers. Project X takes this to another level in terms of the screenplay. Seeing teenagers wreck themselves so candidly hits the older viewers hard, the only way to make it a more cautionary tale would be to have deadly consequences. When an adult neighbor threatens to shutdown the fun, his actions are caught on video and used to blackmail him. An argument out of earshot is played out through pantomime. The unrealistic advantage of focus, lighting, and amazing sound do force some suspension of disbelief.The party itself lives up to the billing, and then some. You've heard of being the life of the party, but this thing makes itself a character. Like a monster it consumes a neighborhood. There's something genuine about the collection of bodies not simply standing around holding red plastic cups and advance subplots—the plot is how to control this beast. Hiring 12-year old security guards probably wasn't the best idea.Our heroes aren't likable, but that's what makes them interesting. They talk the big game of high school boys. Their performances are genuine. The arrogant Costa (Oliver Cooper) is particularly charming. The girls that arrive for the bash are surreally beautiful, and in hyperbolic quantity. It would be easy to write off the female characters as nothing more than over-sexed, one-dimensional shells. The two that stand out are Kirby (Kirby Bliss Blanton) and Alexis (Alexis Knapp). The former is the friend of the group, the latter the most desired girl of the film. Do either engage in an over-the-top showdown? No, and in an even bigger surprise the hot girl isn't the mean girl.What initially struck me as a surely aimless movie filling the fantasies of the recreational drug crowd engaged me with its kinetic energy and dare I say authenticity. I have to hand it to a movie that makes good on its promise. Directed by first timer Nima Nourizadeh but produced by Todd Phillips, a comparison to The Hangover is inevitable. Project X makes The Hangover look like Adventures in Babysitting.Vist my site VaughnOnMovies.com to see my video review.",Project X
73,byrann_gowan,"I guess I was one of the only ones on this website who knew what he was getting into, in regards to this movie",7,16 March 2012,"I've read some of the reviews for this film, and quite a few have mentioned how bad it apparently is. One reviewer even said that this is typical of society today. I agree with this to an extent, but for those who weren't expecting that out of this movie; they need to watch the trailers for movies more often.This movie isn't awesome, but it's good enough for an entertaining hour and 28 minutes. I think that people either just need to lighten up or realize what they are getting into like I did. This movie is not for kids, obviously, but it's not for parents either. It's for people who are between the ages of 19 - 30, and it is for those who just want to have an entertaining brainless afternoon. That's all it is.Overall, it's a completely brainless film that will not win any awards, nor should it win any. People who are going in expecting an award-winning movie are going to be sorely disappointed. The older generation will not enjoy this as well. Basically, those who do not enjoy this type of humour should not see this movie, yet they do, for some strange reason. If you know what it is, and you usually enjoy films like this, then this film is for you. Otherwise, you'll be very discouraged. A 7/10 for me.",Project X
74,mfnmbvp,'Project X' (2012),8,13 August 2012,"I was hesitant when a friend presented me with a copy of the DVD fresh out of the Redbox, yet I found myself at 9 in the morning watching 'Project X' while he dozed off in a chair behind me.I was initially thinking that 'Project X' would be just another forgettable rehash of the same crap that has been floating around over America for quite some years now. 'Superbad' is the film that mainly comes to mind when we put this into perspective, but really, 'Project X' outdoes 'Superbad' 5 to 1. Don't get me wrong, I loved 'Superbad' but virtually every frame of 'Project X' had me laughing. Not even so much because of what was happening was funny, but because it was plausible. Things like this can and do happen all the time. The actions of the characters were very natural pretty much the entire time; of course there are the occasional scenes which tie in other scenes of the film for the sake of continuity, but that's not really what's important. What's important is that 'Project X' captures that primal human behavior and plays it back for us. Some of the things that are so completely beyond ludicrous are actually plausible because of how ridiculous they are.Like one user said, it's like watching a thread of Facebook statuses play out before your eyes in music video form. Quick, jumpy flashes to bring those viewers who aren't familiar with this sort of environment a real glimpse at it. And some conservative f**ks out there might not like too much of what they see.You don't really need a review of this kind of schleck. It's not amazing filmmaking, but in reality 'Project X' raises the bar for party films, and probably takes the cake for the being the most epic party movie yet. Watch it, or go out and live it.PROJECT X -----8/10.",Project X
75,TroyeEvans,"""Teenage Hangover"" Isn't As Hilarious and Successful",2,16 March 2012,"Movies like this, there is probably not much acting or storytelling to be taken into account when rating. You just enjoy it, or you don't. In terms of commercial success or entertainment, this does seem to only earn a place far under the ""Hangover"" series.While the theme and genre remain highly comparable to the ""Hangovers"", the location does not. Basically, a party gone out of control in a house wraps up the entire movie. So considering that it all takes place in a house in the suburbs, it is pretty crazy already. The gradual progression from a plain fun party to complete chaos either draws your attention and appeals to you, or it does not.""Project X"" adopts a camera-style filming. In other words, you see through the cameraman's eyes. In a way, the somewhat ""Chronicle-style"" display does enhance the excitement through consolidating a reality. This technique, nevertheless, still fails to interest a certain group of the audience with regular complaints regarding ""undirected"" cinematography.Despite the insanity that unfolds, the background stays simple: Three high-school kids organize a party for one of the kids on his birthday. It is the usual emotional transition from fear and doubt to the ""what the hell, let's have fun"" thought. The ""love interest"" aspect was handled casually and does not interact much with the rest of the movie. It probably serves its purpose by bringing closure to this wild-party movie.It is understandable teenagers may be interested in a movie like this. (I am a teenager myself.) This is probably the most ridiculously out-of-control party that most can never experience. While it proves to be great cinematic experience for some with its decent box-office performance, ""Project X"" slightly disappoints as an addiction the genre of comedy due to its lack of attractiveness and genuinely entertaining and engaging moments.",Project X
76,Rat_27,Sorry for those of you who don't get it,9,21 June 2012,"I am not sure if people are just getting too PC, or what the problem is. Yes, this is our modern day version of Animal House. The plot is not mind-blowingly original, but everyone remembers high school parties. Oh no!! High schoolers aren't supposed to be depicted behaving that way, even though it is a party that everyone would have wanted to be at.The movie may not be very good at showing the consequences of their actions, but if I wanted to watch an afterschool special, I would have downloaded that instead. This movie will NEVER air on the Estrogen networks (Lifetime, Bravo, etc.), and for that, I am glad.This movie shows (albeit unrealistically) how 4 high-schoolers (I am including the camera man) had an absolute blast one night, and made history at their high school.Oh yeah, and I love the soundtrack too. Definitely adding it to the collection, and I have watched it three times since I downloaded it. Bring on the sequel!!!",Project X
77,MatthewLong23,Basically a party movie,7,21 June 2012,"The producers of this movie want you to believe that what happens in this movie actually happened. It really didn't but the producers want you to think otherwise. It's about a teenage kid named Thomas who's friends want to throw him a party the weekend his parents are out of town for his birthday. As the night progresses things get wildly out of control and eventually his house gets destroyed. There is tons of footage of girls with their tops off and teenagers doing drugs and drinking. To say this movie is a bad example for teenagers is an understatement. The movie is basically saying that if you do something crazy you will become popular and people at school will like you. Even though the consequences for their actions is mentioned in the end, they still become popular and are happy about that. I was also not a fan of all the drug use in the film.",Project X
78,valbrazon,Boring and not fun,3,4 August 2012,"I watched the trailer and i expected a funny movie. I read some reviews of peoples who watched it and many of them told it was really bad, to avoid. But in the other hand, some teenagers told it was excellent and a very funny movie. My review will be like the first peoples i said in this review, it's boring and not funny at all. I was checking the time remaining during the whole movie. The trailer show everything and the whole movie was predictable : it talks about three losers teenagers who organize a big party and they become famous after it. This movie is probably the dream of the teenagers of today : organize a big party and do what you want.A movie to avoid.",Project X
79,Chance_Boudreaux19,A documentary about millenials,3,26 March 2018,"This is the movie that perfectly sums about the sheer dumbness of this generation. I understand that movies like these have been made for a while e.g. Animal House (which is actually funny) but for some reason this one seems so much more obnoxious and just plain unfunny. That's due to the awful characters that are annoying and shallow. There is no need to see this movie, if you want a taste of it go outside and watch a group of teenagers taking selfies and talking about bullshit for 5 minutes and then imagine that for 90 minutes with some partying to awful music and you have Project X. As I said in the title this works great as a documentary about millenials and most things that are wrong with society right now and if that's what you would like to watch then go ahead but I don't think it's worth anyone's time. The lesson emphasized by the beautiful and touching ending which I won't spoil is that you should go out there and do whatever you want, it's very similiar to Good Will Hunting but better. I really hope they make a sequel, the twist could be that someone doesn't remember last night's wacky events but they view it all in the morning on Snapchat, that would give found footage movies the new edge that they need, make it happen Hollywood!",Project X
80,MarcusJ13,Does what is says on the tin,6,22 March 2012,"Project X is a straight up comedy about some traditional losers trying to throw a party to celebrate a birthday and of course boost their status. It's 2012 so the notion of teenage parties has been around for a while of course and what the film makers have aimed to do is just try and make a fun film and they succeeded for the most part. There are of course the clichés about our main character wanting to get close to a girl he's had a long term crush on. The fat friend, the well meaning but ultimately reckless friend chiefly responsible for the whole incident and of course the protagonist and teen who's parents have left him for the weekend desperate to keep things under control. They are all here and if you can't handle that then this film won't be for you and that's fine. It does know that, above all it's requirement from it's audience are laughs and there are plenty of them. All of which stem from lets face what we've seen before. As the party progresses it was fun to see just how far the party was going to go even if it did feel a little tired at times it is still enjoyable. The lesson is to expect the expected when viewing this film because then as the chaos ensues you may end up enjoying it. It is not perfect by all means and the writing can despite my compliments get lazy in terms of humour. Overall though it's worth a rental if you just want a few cheap laughs and let's face it that's what the film makers were going for.",Project X
81,barberic-695-574135,Avoid this like the plague,1,28 January 2013,"When I logged on to IMDb to review Project X I could not believe that the average rating scored to that date was 6.6, how can this unadulterated load of rubbish score 6.6, I gave it a 1 and that is too high by at least 0.95. This film is the biggest load of pure drivel that I have seen for a very long time, a complete waste of effort and money. Someone please tell me why anyone would go to the trouble of making a film as bad as this and why any company would distribute it. As you can probably guess I did not like the film, why you may ask? The story line is simplistic bordering on boring and extremely predictable, the acting is an insult to real actors, the filming is atrocious, my 5 year old could do better with his Ipad. Now lets talk about the dialogue, I bet the person who wrote the script for this film is really proud, what sort of Neanderthal would contemplate writing something like this. If this is a true depiction of what American teenagers are like today, God help us, the human race has no future. For some reason, obviously understood by the script writer the ""brain dead"" teenager characters in this film cannot string a sentence together without at least 70% of the words in that sentence being profanities, do not get me wrong, I am not offended by swearing but this was just ridiculous. Take out the swear words and the film would be about 12 minutes long at most. Why depict teenager as complete ""Drongo's"", these are the people of the future, or perhaps that is the future, where evolution has gone into reverse. I have seen some bad films in my time but this one really takes the ""Oscar"" for the trashiest film ever made.",Project X

He then finally decides that by throwing a party, he can get something. At that party he usually discovers his true love.""No. This movie is different. Leaving aside the great documentary style, it is actually fun to watch. There are is nerd, jockey, hot bitchy girl, nice girl clichés. There are no ""American Pie"" situations. It's just a guy who have thrown a party and it got out of control.On a more serious level, this is a great analysis of teen psychology. We see people who are willing to take every risk possible to get some kind of social attention, engaging into reckless behavior along the way. We may not see 2000 people parties very often, but we can see reckless driving, drug abuse, alcohol abuse and much more.So yes, I've enjoyed this movie - both as a comedy and as a movie that actually makes you think. Plus, the soundtrack is amazing.",Project X
83,suicidea,a real achievement in un-comedy,1,22 September 2012,"I worked on the subtitle translation process of this film. So instead of boring you with stuff you already read elsewhere, here are a couple of stats.The film uses the f-word and its variants 208 times. Which means once about every 26 seconds.The film uses the s..t word 86 times.""Dude"" is said 70 times.Also I noticed that the film tries too hard to be politically incorrect. There's animal abuse, a little person is abused, all females (and sometimes guys too) are referred to as ""bitches"", a lot of drug use... You'd think that with such a devil-may-care attitude, you'd at least get some crazy scenes with over-the-top humour. Well, think again. Running in just about 80 minutes, this so-called comedy manages to keep the viewer with a blank face all along. Not even a gentle half-smile. Not even a twitch of the lip. Nothing.In that aspect, the film is a success. It's not easy to find a film so completely devoid of any humour, of anything that's remotely funny. It's as if a team of scientists thoroughly scanned the film, frame by frame, removing any hint at comedy that might make someone chuckle.Plus, the writers seem intent on making a statement by using so much profanity. Last time I checked, only 10-year olds were laughing at that. The average dialogue goes like this: -S..t dude, f..k this bitch. S..t. -No way dude, f..king s..t. F..k.You wouldn't believe how many times this intelligent exchange of ideas is repeated in the film. Apparently, some people thought this would be funny, or this is solid entertainment, or this is what the world needs to see right now. So some people spent millions of dollars on this.Partying teenagers, crazy high school days, losers and nerds wanting to get laid... this has been quite an endless source for comedy in the 70s, 80s, 90s, even in the new century. But even the worst, most inept of those films managed to make you smile once in a while. Be it genuinely funny scripts, or funny actors, or fart jokes. You found something to laugh at. But this Project X is a miracle. It's as interesting and as funny as a 2-day insurance seminar, and seems just as long.By the time of this review, the film has a rating of 6,7.

My cousins and I partied the whole time I was out there, and this movie definitely fit into what I was into at the time -being young and living it up. Kosta is my favorite character, along with the two 7th grade bouncers! Lol! I've watched this movie several times, so it's definitely one of those movies that you can rewatch without getting sick of it. I'm glad this movie came out when it did. Society wasn't so soft.

85,LBarlane24,You'd have to be a stick-in-the-mud to call this one trash,9,14 September 2019,"Project X is a 2012 coming-of-age black comedy film that features Thomas Mann, Oliver Cooper, Kirby Bliss Blanton, Alexis Knapp, and Miles Teller. The film revolves around three high school seniors who decide to throw a huge party for one of the three's birthdays. Now, I've seen many comparisons between this and Superbad (starring Jonah Hill) and I will admit that it is similar in some parts. But at the same time, it actually differs heavily in other parts. For instance, Superbad was your typical geek-type comedy involving the misadventures of two friends (with one tag-along) trying to get to a high school party, whereas Project X involves 2-3 friends planning to throw one giant party for the fourth friend as he had just turned 17. But instead of focusing on their misadventures, it focuses more on the party itself.Some (if not, many) reviews have dismissed this film as an hour-long music video, but that is quite inaccurate. While it does feature a huge soundtrack, it does in fact have layers to it. The performances were spot on, the young women were gorgeous, obviously, and the ending was, there I say, very satisphying; I also loved that the blonde female, Kirby, was portrayed as more of a tomboy friend as apposed to being the shallow hot type.Now, if I were to name any gripes that I had with the film, it would be the direction, not that it was bad in any way, it just felt a little inconsistant. What I mean is that, the fact that this movie is in the found-footage genre, it (same thing with Chronicle) seems to forget that it is found-footage; if you've seen the movie and have paid attention to every single detail from it, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.All that being said, this is one of those film that just aren't for critics. It is not a film that is meant to be analyzed but more so experienced, and I'm rating it 8.9/10 stars.",Project X

87,amahlanand,Romp of Ages,7,9 June 2012,"Before entering the cinema, try and imagine what you would with a title 'Project X'. I can guarantee you, that will enhance your experience. By the end of this, I thought 'now THAT's a party'. Truth be told, it was the wildest, craziest romp, a 'soiree' (as termed by one of the characters) of epic proportions. Unrestrained and out of control, this 'home video' had everything you've seen in a high school party, plus, everything you haven't. There was no tangible story and it felt like there was no definitive script either, it definitely seemed improvised, like a bunch of random clips put together on a DVD. As if it was very real. It was to an extent, some of the clips were supposedly taken through cast using iPhones and Blackberrys in case they could get footage the cameras couldn't. Yes, it was THAT large and the filmmakers were looking for THAT detail. And I think that director Nimah Nourizadeh's choice to film it like this made it look like quite the blockbuster event. Without a doubt though, it was hedonistically extreme and just the promotion of hooliganism and absolute debauchery. There's no morals, there's no social acceptability, there's no legality. It's all about a bunch of adolescent teenagers congregating with an intention to create havoc, after all, that's just another way of saying 'having a good time'. I don't know if it was supposed to be inadvertently didactic or a satire on generation Y youth, but it went to lengths which were so extreme that you got that kind of feeling. But did I like it? Hesitatingly, I will say that I really did. It was just a thrill ride, I won't spoil it but it's just raw, juvenile entertainment. It's insanely different, quite the endeavour for producer Todd Phillips and I'm sure he would feel that this is what he envisaged. Oliver Cooper I believe has a promising future in the comedy genre. Whether you found his character Costa awesome, despicable or annoying, he was the ringleader and perpetrator of the spectacle/disaster (depending how you want to look at it) and owned his scenes. It was through him that we saw some comedy as well amidst the widespread chaos. I'm not sure that anybody else mattered. It wasn't as much about the people as it was about the bash as a whole.Ultimately, this would not be for everyone, least of all for more traditional previous generations who would probably find this 'misbehaviour' quite appalling. But if you'd like some comedy and some thrills, rock up to the mysterious 'Project X' and see what you get. If you aren't surprised, I look forward to your 'Project Y' to show me how its done.",Project X

NOW, full-stop.This isn't some old fogy who doesn't ""get"" what's happening - no. I love thumbing-your-nose-at-establishment type of pictures. Anarchy has been a well of inspiration for great cinematic comedy for decades. This is joyless, shapeless, sloppy, mean-spirited, ugly, thoroughly misogynistic and nihilistic teen-sploitation piece of junk that insults its audience by forgoing any semblance of story or characters that you can cheer for. It's just one long anti-human, soul-crushing iPhone-shot movie.Carelessly ripping off much better movies like ""Superbad"" and ""Risky Business"", the filmmakers (wrongly) figured that the success of those smart films was just the lure of the all-night party... and that its lead characters are just the flimsy entry point to the massive, destructive annihilation that audiences assumable want put down good money to see.""Risky Business"" and it's decades-later offspring ""Superbad"" recognized that the night-long journey of an ""epic party"" was a chance to learn something about its characters, and for the characters to learn something about themselves. It was also an opportunity for audiences to identify with and even come to like a Tom Cruise or a Jonah Hill or a Michael Sera as an entry-point to engaging in the movie as a viewer and caring about the character's outcome.No care was spent in making the three children (which is what they are) sympathetic, interesting, smart or aware. The roughly-sketched characters were all instead boorish, crude, unlikable douchebags whose ultimate goals (getting laid, getting drunk, getting high and getting laid, in that order) are so off-putting, one almost wants to see these insufferable stock characters (dumbfounded nerd/classless fat-guy/jerky mouthpiece) get the full punishment that they really, truly deserve at the end of the picture, instead of rooting for their plucky, ingenious wiliness.This is such a sad, vacant, cruel picture that cares little about anyone. The leads - and filmmakers - see their female teenage cast as submissive whores who either need or should be taken, and the boys as party-hard frat kids with no personality traits other than being sex-crazed idiots who have random hookups, get high and destroy things.Your life is so much better than this, and your time is worth much more than spending 90 minutes watching this crap.",Project X
89,rum2550,It's all about experiencing the atmosphere.,7,13 June 2012,"Despite the negative reviews by the critics, I thought of seeing this movie mainly because of curiosity I had after seeing the large discrepancy between Rotten tomato's critics' rating (26%) and the audience's (67%). Anyway I never had to regret. Though it true that there are no meaningful life lessons in this movie, seeing this was a unique experience.It was non-stop fun with music,dancing and crazy stuff plus some romance as well.May be due to use of POV presentation, the party was felt very much live and real. We have seen enough movies which used the technique of home video footage before. But they mostly belonged to either horror or supernatural genres. My guess is that this is the movie which used this format to the maximum effect. They have used multiple footage claiming to be from mobile phones of party attendees which enabled us to see a particular incident in different angles. To me it was a quite reasonable excuse during this era. Just go and see this not as if you are going to see a movie but as if you are going to a party.",Project X
90,FFman-847-460126,A New High in Found Footage,9,2 March 2012,"""Found footage"" movies are entering an incredible era. Chronicle was incredible. Project X reaches heights that no other ""found footage"" movie has ever reached. The movie is simply pieced together from the beginnings of ""just a few friends hanging out"" to the most epic party of all time. The slow transition is seamless. By doing this movie is first person, it feels like you are at the party yourself. And you will not want it to end.While the party itself is the main storyline, Project X is riddled with side story lines. The gnome. The girlfriend. The jackass from school. The neighbor. The midget. Each mini storyline gracefully moves in and out of the party. Nothing feels out of place. You will find yourself laughing hysterically at times. I spent most of the movie wide-eyed trying not to audibly ask, ""Are you serious?"" Each element of this movie works until you honestly believe you just attended the best party ever thrown.The drawbacks are completely minor. The movie should have ended about 30 seconds earlier—when the main character indicated ""cut."" I keep trying to think of other problems with the movie, but I can't honestly find them. Had the movie finished 30 seconds earlier, I would probably have given it full marks. The romance is subtle and pleasant. The party moves along without a hitch. It even cultivates on a beautiful moment between father and son at the end. There isn't much more I could have asked for.I saw Project X opening night (Friday). I have to note the atmosphere. The audience was pretty much the age of the people attending the party (17-25). They laughed with every twist. At the end, several people jumped up and declared it the best movie they have ever seen. The audience was directed, with police, toward the nearest exit. Part of me believes they feared the movie might actually start a riot. Considering the talk as we left the theatre, I wouldn't be surprised. Everyone was asking where the party was tonight.Alongside Liam Neeson's The Grey, this movie is the best movie of the year—thus far. With a slew of nobody's in front of and behind the camera, this was an incredible feat. With special effects now status quo in Hollywood, ""found footage"" movies has become an outlet to create cult classics with absurdly tantalizing stories to tell. Project X is sure to become the cult classic that will hover in the background of every epic party for years to come.reillyreviews.wordpress.com",Project X
91,richy1024,"Project drunk, funk and dunk.",4,27 September 2012,"Young adolescents, unknown by most, trying to gain popularity by throwing the wildest party since American High School discos began. This may excite the majority of youngsters as binging in this movie is only the beginning of the hullabaloo. Topless ladies, perverted young teens and dwarfs in ovens only typifies the beginning of how most binge party hosts wish their gigs would turn out. There is only one word to express how audience would describe this outing: lunacy, and there is heaps of it. Law enforcements would feel revulsion for this motion picture. If you're after seeking monotonous entertainment Project X will certainly make you giggle as well as being a little stunned by various acts of chaotic folly.The film is enjoyable but to what degree is the difficulty. We've seen it all before across various mediums, but those intended to watch this would understandably find careless pleasure. The first person camera choice suggests overtones of voyeurism of topless girls and up-skirt shots as we imagine this to be footage found whilst sweeping the ashes of this teenage carnage. Protagonist Tom fits the unpopular mummy's boy to a teat. He has a crush on a girl way beyond his dreams so 'agrees' to laminate himself to grab her attention, and everyone else's. Wanting to party hard and make an impression, crossed with attempts to lay down ground rules and asking for people to not enter certain rooms is rather charming and exemplifies how a majority of us feel when we host our own bachelor party. If you hosted this bash it would certainly be your most unforgettable, but in terms of film judgement, it wouldn't astonish the majority if this film disintegrates from mainstream popularity sooner rather than later. Remarkable, not, I'm afraid to say.",Project X
92,jramza-1,A sad commentary on today's generation.,2,30 September 2020,"People have described this movie as a modern day ""Bueller's Day off,"" for millennials. The difference, is that Ferris Bueller never hurt anybody. He never attacked anybody, stun gunned someone, took advantage of them sexually, ordered them to undress , or set their house on fire. If this is the next generation's Ferris, then I worry we have raised a bunch of sociopaths.",Project X
93,Glock_Boy,The perfect movie for the Obama voter,2,16 August 2012,"This was the most nonsensical collection if idiotic claptrap that I have ever witnessed. This is not a movie. This is prepubescent mindless randomness completely devoid of any humor whatsoever. It's mean, ugly and stupid.I normally would not rate trash like this. To rate & review it gives it credence. It has none.Listen, I knew what I was getting into when I plopped the cash down at the theater. I knew it was going to be dumb. I just can't believe how dumb it actually was. The notion that somebody actually invested money in this trash scares me.I'm sure there are plenty of Obama voters out there that love it, however.",Project X
94,aceellaway2010,Stupid and irritating!,2,28 May 2015,"Watchable, but such a waste of time. The performances are OK, the cast, OK, the direction competent, but it pretends to have a message. And that message is so offensive that it grates. By the films end, where the stupid cast of ""Young"" party goers, who are game for everything and ignore the world around them. treating people who do not find their mindless destruction of property-And here it is fair to point out that the property destroyed is not there own- as unimaginative and unsympathetic. The stupid lead and his equally stupid father, stand reviewing the total wreckage of the house and property. They exchange mild comments as though it didn't really matter that much , and that the father has some kind of sneaking admiration of his son, for achieving the disaster. Only morons will find this waste of money worthwhile.",Project X
95,rpete528,Worth seeing once....just once,3,5 February 2013,"OK, I have to say anyone who went to parties during their teen years would dream of being at a party this epic as portrayed in this movie. With that said, this movie was sadly unreal and only had funny parts in it. The character Costa is a poor unfunny ripoff of Jonah Hill. In fact annoying enough that you wanna smack this dude. The actor played that character too well...lol. I thought the dick punching angry midget was funny. The angry flame throwing dude wanting his gnome was kind of funny. Mostly a forgettable movie at best. Anyway, see this movie if you like raunch at a higher level. It raises the bar over American Pie and Superbad. I see this movie being a lot more popular with high school and college kids.",Project X
96,toby-brace,Those who can only dream about it are left feeling bitter,10,21 June 2012,"The tagline is like a perfect line that divides those who will love this film, and those who will hate it.If you've never been to a party like that, you will hate it. You will hate it because it is true, you can only dream about it ( you are probably too old or too square to do it now ) so you feel left out.Also you probably disapprove of 'drugs'. You are probably not very into dance music. You don't have much fun at all really.But some of us have been to a few parties like this one. Me, just a couple of times. But I remember what it was like when the roof came off.Boy was it fantastic. This film captures it perfectly. It doesn't try to do anything else except tell the simple story of 3 normal teenagers who accidentally give the party of the decade.Epic.",Project X
97,franciscoraposo72,American Pie+The Hangover+Superbad+Chronicle=Project X=Fantastic movie,9,28 June 2012,"Project X is epic! Todd Phillips produces it, the director of my favorite comedy movie, The Hangover, the legendary R-rated comedy. Project X is basically sort of the happenings before a hangover, well, it's more about crazy parties that turn into riots. I loved this movie, when I first watched the trailer, I thought this was going to be terrible, but after it was recommended to me, I decided to give it a try and I loved it. It's epic, it's crazy and it beats Chronicle considering that it's also a 'Found Footage' movie. You got to watch it, it's like the party that you'll never have but you can witness, I don't find this movie pointless or dumb at all. Since the very beginning to the very end, Project X is a wild and hilarious experience, I know I'm being a bit lame, but this movie is a crazy way to make the three main characters popular. Oh, and the soundtrack, well, the soundtrack rocks! Watch it if you haven't, one of the best movies of 2012 and one of the best R-rated comedies I've seen since The Hangover, oh, and definitely (so far), the best 'Found Footage' movie I've ever seen. Worth every minute, and by the way, Project also brought the Pursuit Happiness song to my ears. What a fantastic movie... R-rated at its best.Thomas and his two friends are a group of unpopular teens that no one cares about unless if it's about mocking. Thomas' 17th birthday arrives and he's hosting a party at his house since that date is also his parents' anniversary. His dad leaves clear that he wants 5 people tops and no touching in his Mercedes. His friend Costa hires Dax to film the whole birthday and posts everywhere Thomas' party. When the party arrives, there's not even aproximendately a number of 5 people, but yes 15.000 people, including hot women and cool guys. Thomas will try to have fun and keep it under control, but soon, the party will turn into a riot, oh, and the Mercedes, well, the Mercedes will end up in the swimm... But still, this party will be a game changer for those 3 L's. To the break of dawn, yo!Dad: I just didn't think you had it in you. Thomas: I know. Sorry I let you down. Dad: No, I literally didn't think you had this in you. So uh, how many people were here?Thomas: Uh, 15 hundred. Couple thousand maybe. Dad: Wow. Thomas: You should have seen it. It was awesome. Dad: Well, you're still f*beep* Thomas. *AWESOME*9/10",Project X
98,DoctorRabbit,"Not A Movie, But An Experience",9,1 June 2012,"Project X is the kind of movie that isn't going to be for everyone. It's vulgar, mean-spirited, and insane.The film has pretty much no plot besides being about three high school kids who throw a birthday party that gets way out of hand. But, the film accomplishes what it sets out to do and that is to be a hilarious, over-the-top, and intense party film. This film was easily some of the most fun i've had at the movies in quite some time. The found footage style works well here and really makes the viewer feel like they are at this party which only made the film more enjoyable. Once the party gets going in this movie, it grabs you and does not let you go. This film really did feel like a cinematic experience that needs to be seen on the big screen with a large crowd to be fully appreciated. The only thing I didn't care for in the film was the unnecessary romantic subplot which felt really forced and didn't really fit the tone of the film.Overall, if you're the films target demographic, than you'll have a blast with it.",Project X

100,paulilepisto,A bad joke.,1,1 August 2019,"Its just the same basic ""plot"" of teens drinking and having a party, but the makers did not even bother to do it properly.People compare this movie with Superbad and the hangover series, how come? those movies had some sort of development while in this movie its random ""found footage"" shots of arrogant teen doing stupid things.I can't help but to wonder the honesty of those ratings higher than 7/10 ? i get that some 12 year old who has never actually drank alcohol thinks this is funny, but still how can someone by any standards think this is 10/10 film? this is no film, anyone who is annoying enough, has 2k of dosh for the liquor, and large enough following in social media could film this with a cheap camera.
Found footage by the way, might work in horror movies ( i think it does ) but it only made this look even worse than it would be without using this low budget tactic. What is this supposed to be a wannabe american pie with blair witch twist? Btw, whats the point of them drinking so much alcohol, when they don't even seem to get drunk, they act just the same before and after downing all those tequila shots, if you are someone who drinks often this looks so fake.I saw this movie in Netflix, some entity or just sheer common sense forbid people for actually paying for this separately.Its a joke, but its not a funny joke, you can think about a situation when someone desperately wants to tell a joke, but doesn't have anything genuinely funny to say, so he will just prolong the joke hoping it will get funny at some point, even though its just the same crap over and over again.Well this is how i felt, you can try to watch it, maybe you find it funny... But i think you should't especially if you are over 20, would be pretty stupid idea to pay for it in my opinion.If you think drinking alcohol and swearing a lot of funny watch Trailer Park Boys instead (canadian series) it has actual funny jokes, and it actually depicts how alcoholic life is more like. Btw, the things they did in this movie are not fun IRL, having a hangover and destroying an expensive house and disturbing the whole neighborhood is not funny, its really sad, well now you can't say i did not warn you about this movie and it's absence of message, plot, or ... anything linked to actual films, except that there was apparently a camera present.I don't consider this review to contain any more spoilers, than lets say the synopsis of the movie - Because not much happens in it.",Project X
101,djkbee,Wow this one surprised me...In a good way!,8,25 September 2012,"OK so i watched this with an open mind not knowing whether i was going to like or dislike it. The fact it was an 18 certificate gave me encouragement suggesting this was going to be extreme! At the end i was grinning and thinking wow that was a pleasant surprise. Project X as many already know is about 3 high school kids who are general losers amongst their peers. Nobody knows who they are, they don't get any chicks and are deemed uncool. One of the kids (Thomas) has just turned 17 and his parents are going away for a weekend leaving him alone to house sit. Thomas's father has no idea his son has it in him to throw the party we end up witnessing. The neighbourhood is peaceful and the house is huge with a swimming pool in the back and plenty of space to throw a crazy party. Thomas is not keen at first on the idea of a party but his mate convinces him and the word gets out on the internet and local radio.... about 1,500-2000 people show up including all the cool kids in high school and plenty of hot chicks. Be prepared from this point on to see the craziest house party you will ever witness on film... the sort of house party you watch wishing you could experience. Chaos is an understatement... i myself watched it thinking OK so things are going to get out of control but i couldn't have guessed how far it could go! As long as no one spoils the extremeness of how far things go then you should really enjoy this and be surprised and shocked at how far the chaos gets!This movie is easy to watch, no complicated storyline, no deep thinking, character development but hey if there was then this film wouldn't be what it is. Its just a fast paced fun adrenaline rush which manages to keep getting crazier beyond belief. I really enjoyed it! Plenty of laughs along the way as-well as shocks and i found that i was torn between feeling sorry for this Thomas kid and feeling the opposite. I was like that all the way through. I gave it a strong 8 - well worth checking out.",Project X
102,avsroxbronxfan,"Hey, what does the trashcan and Project X have in common? They're both garbage!",1,25 September 2012,"I did not enjoy this film. I actually haven't seen many bad movies this year, but this was the worst I've seen. I'm sure there's worse than this, but this is the worst I've seen this year. I actually didn't know much about this film before I went to see it with some co-workers of mine. The others (except for one of them) seemed to like it for some reason, while I just completely hated it.The story is very recycled. It's basically your nerd in high school trying to get popular type of story, but he and his sailor mouth friend, who is one of the biggest jerks. I've seen in movies, have a huge party while his parents are out of town. Before I go in, let me just say that his friend cusses way too much. I don't mind swearing, but you don't need to say it in every sentence! This just makes you look childish! If I had a dime for every time he cussed in it, I'd be richer than Bill Gates.My first complaint is that the actual party is about 70% of the film. I know the film is about it, but that's way too slow paced. My second complaint is towards the filming. It's some friend of theirs, who, for some reason carries a camera and records everything that happens. Wouldn't the battery die eventually? Okay, that may be nit-picky, but here's something I've questioned for a while. During the party, he still just stands there and records everything. Wouldn't he want to put down the camera for a bit and join the party? Another complaint I have about that camera is that they want HIM to be recording everything, yet he would be shown in one area, then in the next shot, we're upstairs. What happened? Is there another kid who randomly records everything? Maybe I'm just being too harsh about the camera. Although, there is too much movement. You don't wanna do that. I should know, I'm good at filming.But my biggest problem with this film is that... wait for it... EVERYONE IS EITHER SEX OBSESSED, A DRINKER/WEED SMOKER, OR A COMPLETE JERK!! Yes, there are irresponsible teenagers. Yes, some do have sex too early. And yes, some can be mean people. But the thing is that they make EVERY TEENAGER IN THE PARTY ONE OF THOSE THINGS!! Sorry, that part really irritates me. This is the most stereotypical movie I've seen since North. (1994) Anyway, we're done with the party, and after everything goes completely wrong, the neighborhood is destroyed, and his parents have returned to find the huge damage. Well, this kid is dead meat, so this should be fun to watch! His dad: ""Your college fund will pay for this. But I'm amazed you got this many people to come."" ARE YOU F***ING KIDDING ME?!?!? Who cares about how many people came? Your son destroyed the neighborhood, and this damage will cost thousands, if not millions of dollars in damage, and part of you is impressed with the turnout? THIS IS STUPID! But, I do have to give credit where it is due. Parts of it is very funny, and it is based off a true story.Other than that, this film is complete garbage. I'm 20 years old, and think this. Do not waste your money on this.",Project X
103,Sack-3,Guys will love Superbad meets Hangover!,8,13 February 2012,"I love when movies don't pull punches. If the movie's about an out of control party, it better have: booze, drugs, cussing, sex, and lots of irresponsible behavior. This movie cashes its checks. The plot is similar to ""Superbad"" but it has a distinctly ""Hangover"" feel. The movie is shot entirely as if through a series of hand-held cameras, which I felt effectively added to the chaos, but beware if Blair Witch made you dizzy. My concern, however, is that this movie will mostly be appreciated by guys. Here's what passes for female character development: there are only two women characters in the movie (1)the gorgeous ""friend"" and (2) the gorgeous ""conquest"". I also suspect more mature viewers will have trouble not wondering about the insurance consequences of this party, but I personally had no trouble deciding to worry about that tomorrow along with the rest of the cast.",Project X

Just get a bunch of preppy frat boy loud mouthed punks together for a party and call it a movie. This is a direct to DVD party movie that somehow made it to theatres. The thing that fails most about it is the fact that it tries to latch on to what American Pie, Can't Hardly Wait, and Dazed And Confused already did. The difference between those movies and this one is they actually have a plot. I think for an 18-19 year old it will be enjoyable. I feel like I have seen better direct to dvds.

The actors are mostly new faces, but they do a great job.There are so many other really awful movies, most of them starring anyone from the American Pie movies, that a movie like this deserves attention and praise.

I find it had to believe that anyone who has ever been a teenager wouldn't enjoy this film. Three obnoxious teenage boys plan a party while one has parents out of town. The make all the plans they can, even go around warning the neighbors. In the end everything that could happen does, and there are a few surprise twists, but really it is what it is.I mean I've seen it before, everyone has, it's just a great party.

110,Stoh80,"A party movie, with some moments—but not many",6,16 May 2012,"I was not disappointed with this movie, but I wasn't impressed either. I went in expecting to see a somewhat humorous teen party movie, and that is exactly what I got, with ""party"" being a bit of an understatement. The first half of the movie is about three high school friends who, tired of not being popular, decide to throw a party of their own. After that it is basically nothing but partying, with a few funny but not very memorable moments.I found it very similar to Superbad, except WAY more over the top and exaggerated. Even Thomas, the main character, reminded me a lot of Michael Cera's character in Superbad. However there is nothing ""more"" to Project X. There are no serious parts, no lessons to be learned at the end, as was the case with Superbad. The movie seems to try and make it feel genuine by throwing in some conflict between the characters, but in the end it really adds nothing to the plot, which is nearly non-existent. The movie simply progresses as the party gets more and more out of control.One thing I found unique was the way the movie was filmed. Much like the movie Chronicle, which I happened to see right before Project X, it is in a first-person point of view. Most of the filming is done by the character Dax, whom the three friends higher to record the night's events. Some shots are done by flip cameras, cell phones, or even news cameras, all which are being held by actual characters in the movie. The director Nima Nourizadeh said he did this to make the audience feel like they were actually participating in the party, and for the most part, it was successful.I saw this movie for free at a prescreening, and I'm glad I did. It was worth seeing with friends, but I definitely would not pay to go see it. If it happens to be on TV, or if you want to get in the mood for partying, I might recommend passively watching this with a group of friends.",Project X
111,andrewshieh0712,You'll like it if you like parties. Just Parties.,7,12 August 2015,"It's pretty surprising to see Project X on the top of the most illegally downloaded movie of 2012 beating the Dark Knight Rises, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, and The Avengers. It made around 50 million dollars at box office which was ""meh"", so what is Project X so special about?Actually, there isn't much special about Project X and not much to say about is. Project X is a humongous, out-of-control, high school party which was held by some not-so-popular teenagers. So if you are expecting something like a twist or even a story in Project X, like me, just don't because you're watching Project X because you want have a blast.As I just mentioned previously, I was expecting something before watching Project X since I was literally thinking ""that just can't be it"" after watching the trailer. I had no idea what Project X is about since all I see is music, people, and alcohol in the trailer, there is no story going on, so I thought it might be something like Chronicle. I guess I'm half-right-half-wrong.Project X starred Thomas Mann, Oliver Cooper, and Jonathan D. Brown who I never heard of. The only actor I heard of is Miles Teller who is just himself in the movie. So, basically, these three teenagers are the three teenagers in Superbad. There's the main character that is not in the popular group, the guy who just thinks he knows everything, and the other guy who's just not cool. Basically, they're going to hold a party while the parents are out. That's all it's about. I know I've been saying this a million times, but Project X is literally a guy recording a high school party. So I don't recommend to the adults who are 35 or over, because this movie is just for teenagers or young adults who had been to these kind of parties. Thus, Party X might recollect the memories in high school for some people, but others, might not. Project X is also a found-footage which I find no problem with it. It's all about a party so I guess it's the best way to introduce the characters, and to go deep into the party. Project X is nothing new to the genre and you've see many movies about parties going wild, such as Superbad, the Hangover, and other films that released after this, such as, 21 and Over and the Neighbors. And to me, Project X is not as funny as both Superbad and the Hangover. But as a whole it could still be enjoyable (if you like parties). The acting are convincing since they do like buddies in real life throwing a real party and the editing is not bad, too. The soundtrack is also pretty nice (party songs, of course).Overall, even though Project X is unoriginal, predictable and has nothing deep about it, it could still be enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously. I didn't really like Project X, but I don't hate it either. So, I guess you can go watch Project X if you're a party animal. Cheers.",Project X
112,mariajoaou27,Just an epic fail,4,2 January 2013,"My friends decided to watch this and as I'm not very into the kind of movies they like I decided I'd look it up here first and gave it a shot because some reviews were good and normally I like comedy movies.However, I didn't find anything funny about this movie. I do not understand why it is labeled as comedy, but I guess it was because it is so dull and plain and soulless that it does not fit in any other genre either. It's all about a party that gets out of control and then people get wasted and crazy and act like stupid teenagers. It is kind of unrealistic too, because not all teenagers are only interested in drinking and having sex like the movie makes it seem. Furthermore, there really is no plot development. When the movie ends you don't really know anything you didn't when the movie started. There is a little character development and that is the reason why I didn't rate it even lower than 4 stars. You can see some characters regretting what is happening but eventually they decide to get high and just like that, character development is goneSo if you're looking for a good movie, you'll have to look somewhere else. This movie is boring from start to finish. This could not even be considered a light movie because it is actually disturbing in some parts and makes you wonder what society is this we're living in. This is a movie I would not recommend. It is not worth the time you'll spend watching it.",Project X
113,brycehoogland,Too much party for one night,6,21 March 2012,"Project X is about three friends who plan to gain popularity by throwing a party, a plan which quickly escalates out of their control. Project X is director Nima Nourizadeh's first film and decided to go with the overly done found footage POV. This film is really bad filmmaking because it's sloppy. It feels like there isn't really a lot direction going on. It's like a bunch of crazy party shots thrown together to make a movie. I can't deny though that Project X is hilarious all the way through and is a lot of fun. That is the only reason why I didn't hate this film. The performances by Thomas Mann, Oliver Cooper, & Jonathan Brown are alright. There isn't really anything special about their performances besides they're somewhat believable and make you laugh. If you go into Project X with the mindset of thinking its going to be an extremely good film, you'll most likely hate it. But if you go into it wanting a hilarious, pointless, chaotic, party film; then you will have a fun time.",Project X

Project X promised the most epic high school party of all time, and they delivered in spades. I also believe that the best movies are the ones that can pull you in and make you really feel what the characters are feeling, and project x nails that as well. Granted, it's not gonna be all good feelings, especially you have high anxiety, but hey, they're still feelings.This movie perfectly captures the pure debauchery and hedonism that we all either dreamed of or dreaded as a kid in high-school.

Perhaps the best part about it is at the end where there's a minor hint of guilt after all what happened. Sure, some will like this due to all the nudity and some laughable scenes throughout the flick. But most of all this is a perfect example drawn to extremes about another spoiled generation that doesn't know how to appreciate life in a respectable manner, doesn't know how to cope with their luxury and freedom.

118,afh179,Documentary-style party film meant for teenagers,6,18 March 2012,"So, a movie about a party gone out of control. Like we haven't seen that before. Where Project X separates itself is that the film is shot in documentary-style. The plot is simple : three high school losers attempt to make a name for themselves (and get laid) by throwing the most epic house party ever for one of the boys birthday, while a friend of the group films the whole thing. What was supposed to be a fun party with enough girls for everyone to get laid quickly turns into the most epic of ragers, complete with an angry midget, plenty of topless girls, drugs, a ton of alcohol, and even an angry man with a flamethrower. Bottom line is, this movie is meant for teenagers. No doubt the high school crowd will love this movie for its nudity and drug and alcohol consumption, and will fantasize about throwing a party as crazy as the one in the film. The acting is alright at best, and the documentary- style presentation takes away from the film. Can't a movie just be shot normally anymore?Overall, this was an entertaining trip to the movies. Some parts are actually hilarious, and I found myself laughing out loud more than a few times. Don't go see this expecting to watch a typical movie, instead be prepared for a 90 minute party. The movie is meant to entertain by showing the lengths that teenagers will go to too throw ""the craziest party ever"". And it does exactly what it is meant to.Overall: 6.5/10",Project X
119,jens-wegar,The moral of the story is just wrong,4,11 June 2012,"From a technical point of view this movie is no worse than most other movies that are out there right now. Sure, you won't have a superstar cast, but they do their job OK. There's no real character development, but that doesn't really matter for a movie of this type. It's one of those ""authentic"" hand held camera movies, which seem to be so popular right now.The main issue I have with this movie, considering it's probable target audience, is that it sends a quite skewed moral message. The ""lead"" character gets the girl in the end and the boys become popular despite having cause an entire neighborhood to be destroyed. Sure, the movie mentions that they got charged for various crimes, but it was just a quick mention in the sidelines. You did not get a sense of how much the family at who's house the party was really lost due to the stupidity of their son. Considering that people who most likely will like this movie are at the age where they probably wouldn't mind trying to throw a party like this also, I think the real consequences should have been given more weight. The end result should not have been the boys achieving their original goal in short, which was to become popular.In terms of humor the movie fails to impress also. It was advertised as the next Superbad, but in my opinion Superbad wipes the floor with this movie.",Project X
120,lucyrichards27,"Great soundtrack, non-stop fun and chaos!",9,3 July 2012,"This movie tells the story of 3 teen boys, all with completely different personalities, who decide to throw a fairly large birthday bash, which in the end goes totally out of hand. The movie is based on the real life story about a boy named Corey Delaney who threw a huge party that involved the whole street. The movie has worried several people due to the fact that teenagers are represented in a very negative way. Reports of imitations of the Project X party have also been in the news. I think everyone is overreacting personally but that's just me. This movie is so much fun, and as much as it makes me want to go to a party, I would never act so ridiculously as portrayed in Project X. The movie can be compared to American Pie, Super bad etc with it's really American humour and classic story line. It features filthy comedy, naked teens, scenes of drug use and alcohol consumption and is a non-stop thrill ride. It will leave you gritting your teeth and covering your eyes due to it's absurd stunts and the cringe-worthy events in it. It has a great soundtrack that makes you wanna get up and dance too! However, the reason why I haven't rated it a ten is because towards the end, it becomes a bit TOO dramatic and silly. But overall, it's fun, sexy, funny, pulse racing & definitely memorable. Just like in Super bad, you emphasize with each character and each one is completely different to the other. If you like Super bad/American Pie, you'll love this :)",Project X

All i can say is....if that were me, my parents would have absolutely killed me!Well worth a watch my dears if you want a film that is entertaining but doesn't require you to pay a lot of attention then this is the film for you!

A few geeks throw a birthday party and not being sure if anyone shows up, they advertise it, they even have a radio spot. And then all the hell breaks loose, and instead of max 50 people, perhaps 2000 show up. Ecstasy, kegs, hot naked chicks, a stoned dog, body shots, midgets, getting laid... all the typical premises are present, but the setting takes a place in the quiet family neighborhood, burning down, overtaken by anarchy and all the while a SWAT team, cops, news... and the parents take notice ... :) Happy birthday!I loved it!",Project X
123,JBlueNote,The Hangover: Teen Version,10,2 March 2012,"OMFG What. A. Movie. The only thing I can say about this movie is that it could have been the movie on what really happened when the 3 guys in the Hangover party in Las Vegas. It was that epic. You'll be coming out of the theater with the same feeling you had with the Hangover, but multiply that by 1,000. In the end they should have put a huge disclaimer saying ""DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME"" in big red letters. I think some people may have think this was actually real since in the beginning they had a message saying sorry to the local police. Man, as I'm typing this I'm still laughing. I even saw it with my mom thinking that she would be totally freaked out by it, but she's laughing as much as I am. I don't think I'll ever stop laughing. Once I remember one scene, I'll probably laugh at the drop of a hat. It was that good. You will be talking about this movie for months and months to come.

124,ross_kewl,"To like or not to like, Project X is the question",7,21 June 2012,"*****Spoliers*****Watching this movie is like drinking a glass of Metamucil, not sure whether you like the taste or not. Thomas (Thomas Mann) is, in the words of his father, a looser who via the persuasion of his friend Costa (Oliver Cooper) decides to throw a party for his 17th birthday. Hoping to climb off the bottom of the social ladder and get laid, Costa advertises the party through means of mobile phones, social networks and email. As anticipated, thousands of teenagers and college students turn up with an abundance of alcohol and drugs.Now to the meat of it.There were bits that I loved and bits that I cringed at. As soon as the party started the audience knew that Thomas was screwed. I mean seriously, two 12-year old security guards was just silly and begging for trouble. The trip to T-Rick (Rick Shapiro) was unnecessary but hilarious. They didn't need the marijuana which didn't even look like that much, plus we never see any of the main characters actually use it. When T-Rick comes back and hits the car, I jumped, and following was the terminator reference which was comical. Costa is a laugh but to be honest he frustrates me. He wants to make a huge party for his friend and get laid etc but the consequences of his actions won't affect him, Thomas ends up taking most of the blame and puts Thomas' parents into a horrible position where their only child has destroyed their home and most likely their reputation. Thomas, Costa and JB (Jonathan Daniel Brown) seem to appear as a friendship trio. However JB is constantly called fat by Costa and he (Costa) is also quite mean to Dax (Dax Flame) by referring to him as ""weirdo"" which is probably true I guess considering the Thomas and Kirby (Kirby Bliss Blanton) where he spies on them. Some things I was quite confused about, JB's erection, is he gay or what? Also around the middle-to-the-end part Thomas realises he screwed yet continues to make stupid decisions, like taking the ecstasy pill. He surely must of realised he was powerless to stop people vandalising his home and wants to prevent people from doing that, yet when the police show up he tells them to go away, silly boy.The overall message of ""to become cool, you must throw an outrageous party"", worked well in the end. They were well known in the school which was one of their goals but this is different to being popular and having friends. By throwing this party, did they actually get laid and find new friends? No, of course people are going to be nice to the party host and they only know him for the ""awesome party with the gnome with ecstasy in it"" not for ""He reads science-fiction and plays tennis"" or whatever. They don't like Thomas for his personality, they like him for the party. I recently attended a ""ball-afters"" party which was hosted by a girl who wasn't that popular but because she was hosting this party for her entire year group, all the popular girls were really friendly to her, yet after it happened they ignored her, they weren't mean or anything, they just didn't show any of the kindness they showed her before the party occurred. This message that I mentioned at the start of the paragraph stands to be true, I think, in modern day society but ""coolness"" in this sense does not refer to sex, friends and popularity, it refers to notoriety and being renowned. This movie comments on some interesting issues in today's society. Parties that spiral out of control are a common occurrence and Project X addresses these issues quite well. At the end of the film, I felt really sad for Thomas because it was true what his father said, he is a good kid, but he was led astray by the somewhat selfish ambitions of Costa. There were some hilarious bits with the midget and the ""found footage"" added a sense of realism. As I said in the beginning, not completely sure if I liked it, I found some parts really enjoyable but the story of Thomas was kind of cringeful as we knew what his parents would do to him. I will probably watch this again with my friends and see what they think of it.",Project X
125,HarryPotterIsGarbage,The best movie for perverts and delinquents,4,6 January 2014,"It's a movie about a party that gets out of control. The plot is that the main characters become cool at school after throwing a huge party. That's pretty much it. I don't mind seeing an unrealistic movie, but I just didn't enjoy it. I didn't find myself caring for any of the characters. It was like watching a long recording of endless boobs and high schoolers doing crazy things at a party.The found footage style doesn't work very well for this genre of film. When you do a found footage style movie, it has to be at least somewhat realistic. This film is FAR from realistic. The dad's reaction at the end, the flamethrower guy, the main lead driving to school in a busted car, fat dorky kid getting laid. They should have just filmed it without using the whole found footage gimmick.

129,TypedbyTara,A Nice Dream,4,4 March 2012,"Project X was exactly what you thought it was going to be. The movie spends a very brief 20 minutes establishing the plot line and introducing the characters. The rest of the time is spent delving into a teenage male fantasy-complete with drugs, booze, and hot babes. As a teenager myself, I found this movie interesting because it felt like I was there, at the party. For 88 minutes I (and probably all other teenagers) got to see our fantasy play out on the big screen, this was the stuff we could only dream about. Hard core Movie lovers will hate this film, and I don't blame them. It's true, Project X won't win any awards, and it'll probably be forgotten in a couple months once bigger productions like John Carter and the Hunger Games come out. But what Project X lacks in the ""theatrical masterpiece"" department it makes up for with a message. That message is the plight of teenagers around the the world- which is the desire to be accepted. Basically this movie says that if you aren't popular, then do what society has deemed ""cool"" and throw a huge party. Even though I'm a teen I don't agree with this message (shocking I know). Sure it would be cool to ATTEND an epic party like that , but would you really want to throw one?? At the end of the movie the main character, Thomas Kub, says ""I burned down my neighborhood, bankrupted my parents, trashed my college career and I'll be in debt for the rest of my life.."" Wow really?? I may be 18, but there's no way I would destroy my future for ONE night of epicness. What most teenagers don't realize is that this ""pubescent angst"" period is a drop in the bucket of our lives. It seems to me that trashing 80% of your life (just so that 10% can be spend bathing in the false admiration of people who, after high school, you'll probably never meet again) isn't worth it. Project X lets teenagers fantasize about what could, not necessarily should, be like. There's a reason why it's a called ""Hollywood"" because like most movies, this is a fantasy created to draw audiences, not to be taken seriously.Project X was an epic 88 minute dream, but like all dreams, when the lights come on, it's time to wake up and get back to reality.",Project X
130,beatlesdudeireland,Critics=Death,9,16 July 2012,"Critics are the definition of evil in our creative world. They are the species that lacks the ability to create and innovate. They are fraught with jealousy, regarding their other peers as paragons. Because of this they are prone to a violent agenda of bemoaning anything and everything that comes into their domain. They are the pinnacle of moral prudishness, the barrier to fun and freedom, the challengers of all humour, and the proponents of sluggish and elitist dramas. They tell us, with their flamboyant and pompous words, what to watch and what not to watch. But today we stop listening, today we realise that the reviews from the film critics are irrelevant, that our views hold more substance.Prior to pandering in Project X, I was subject to merciless reviews of the critics, I was forced to look upon it as trite, as amoral, and utterly idiotic. I was forced to side with the moralists, the cynics and the naysayers. My mental condition dictated so. But then I learned two of the most fundamental clichés of our time: Don't judge a book by its cover, and until you see it for yourself, everybody's opinion is invalid. In order to truly enjoy the movie, one must watch with an open mind The film centres around 3 high-school geeks, who attempt to throw a large party in order to augment their popularity . They invite an inordinate amount of people, all of whom are wild, lewd, and reckless Soon after, the party spirals into anarchy, with the teens showing a lack of respect for property, disseminating ecstasy tablets and engaging in hilarious antics. Costa is the breakout character of the film, sustaining the brainless humour. Costa, is obnoxious, manipulative, and lively. His actions go largely unpunished. Karma seems to elude him. He does not suffer the same consequences as his ""normally"" well-behaved friend Thomas, the unfortunate sufferer of the film. Thomas is a victim of compliance. His acquiescence allows Costa to distort the reality of the situation, and stage the outrageous party. Eventually, Costa gives him an E tablet, causing his inhibitions to severely lower. Thomas, begins to enjoy the party, diving of the roof to the cheers of the other teens. There is sweet irony in this when Costa outright refuses to emulate him: Costa spends the night nagging Thomas to let loose and do something dangerous , but when faced with the rooftop dive, show his cowardice. Although the majority of the characters are stereotypical high-school teens the , the premise, the dialogue, the theme of teen debauchery, and the use of the shaky camera are outstanding and worthy of praise; a provocative film for the legions of Superbad fans.

Seriously, do it.Whether you have memories of Stifler drinking sperm-tainted beer (American Pie), seeing a naked Chinese man leap out of a car boot (The Hangover), or witnessing a disturbed redhead performing masturbation to an unsuspecting party with her feet at a dinner table (Wedding Crashers), Project X is out to surpass them.It's young Thomas Kub's (Mann) 17th birthday, and who is Kub you wonder? Well, nobody really. At least, he's a nobody in the eyes of his fellow peers (and father), and as a high school virgin that means a significant amount to him and fellow outsiders/best friends, the token crude and obnoxious loudmouth Costa (Cooper) and regulation fat nerd JB (Brown).It just so happens Thomas' birthday coincides with his parents' wedding anniversary, which leaves them foolishly trusting their shy and retiring son to stay out of trouble while they leave town, an impossibility with Costa around.Following the likes of Cloverfield and more recently Chronicle, the entire film is shot on a hand-held camera by an AV goth named Dax, as part of Costa's documentation of Thomas' big day, which allows the audience to become really immersed into the film/experience.The three boys, well Costa anyway, leads preparations for a party at Thomas', which is billed to be the party to end all parties in an attempt for the lads to become cool and get the holy grail of the female ladygarden. (Of course, to clarify, that's not the term used in the film).The Hangover director Todd Phillips is on board for production duties and his influence seems to have rubbed off. I personally found the three central characters of Thomas, Costa and JB mildly comparable to Phillips' own Stu, Phil and Alan, in the way that they're portrayed – normal, wild and stupid.Think of the wildest bash possible, and then double it, by 900,000, smothered in drugs, and you'll be approaching something like Project X. If we ever saw what happened on the night that The Hangover boys forgot, it would probably look like that.The film itself is actually based on the events of an Australian teen that invited over 500 people to his house via MySpace, which ended up causing $20,000 worth of damage.The characters aren't new or unique, and Costa is a lot like Stifler and every one of Jonah Hill's characters rolled into one, but Cooper nails the role with what seems like ease.The film has a number of real jaw-dropping moments, some of which, most actually, will make you green with envy, while others will definitely be cause for laughing out loud.For fantasy, extremes, a monstrous soundtrack and making me wish I was American, the film grabs an 8.5/10 Project X is in cinemas from 2nd March 2012.",Project X

I miss the good films...(Don't get me wrong, Hollywood does come out with great films here and there, they were just more popular back then)This movie is about 3 teens who just have an out-of-control party. THAT'S IT! Wow...what a great plot. It's a weak ""story"" and the filming is awful...not to mention they show nudity so it could actually gain some money from male teens.....such garbage...do NOT waste your time and money to see this crap.",Project X
141,tom_d_w99,... I don't get it.,1,22 January 2015,"Where do I even begin with this? The characters! They're horrendous! They're nothing but the lowest forms of teenage stereotypes I've ever seen. Seriously, this film must make teenagers look ABHORRENT! Please... If you're reading this... Teenagers aren't like this... The Writing! If this is a comedy, THAN IT'S NOT FUNNY! Gratuitous swearing and sex references alone will get you nowhere. There is no wit to this movie. It also fails as a crime movie because the plots aren't put together well enough. There are a few sub-plots in this movie. Many of them go absolutely nowhere, and contribute almost nothing to the overall plot of the movie. And the subplots are stupid anyway. And the message... OOH the message... Hey kids! Social rejection got you down? The solution is simple! Gather a bunch of untrustworthy strangers and invite them all to a big party, absolutely DESTROY your house, possibly putting your family into bankruptcy, cheat on your girlfriend (who gets forced into the plot during an incredibly pathetic ""Emotional Climax"" by the way...), and DON'T HOLD BACK ON THE DRUGS AND ALCOHOL, and you will SKYROCKET into popularity! This movie is just an attempt to pander to teenage boys. And a TERRIBLE attempt at that.",Project X
142,TheCineSinge,Was expecting a lot worse,5,27 December 2012,"I'm going to be honest, I can get a bit snobby with films like these and of the special effects blockbusters and stoner comedies ilk. I went into this as I'd have went into those - expecting very little based on reviews. Let's have a look. Does it have a plot? Not really. Proper characters? Not really. Is it crude and crass? Very. Is it morally questionable? Certainly. Is it pointless? Very. Is it really even a film? Arguably not. Is it still entertaining? Yes. Before watching this, I watched Rock of Ages and that was a chore for most of its 136 minute runtime. In comparison, the hour and 20 odd minutes I spent watching this flew by. To be fair to most critics trashing it; it is rather without artistic merit but I'm just happy I wasn't sat there bored out of my skull. I'm actually quite surprised at myself. As I said, I usually wouldn't go for a film like this (and I certainly don't love it) but it could have been a lot worse. Still want to punch Costa in his obnoxious bloody face, though.",Project X
143,hello-310-626610,"The geek will continue to inherit the earth, one party at a time.",7,9 March 2012,"Some films take their time to get there and some films never even make it, but Project X hits you right in the likability testicles from the word go. And so I was won. I bought in, I paid up and I went along for the ride.I wonder if everyone else in the audience were thinking ""yeah, yeah, I've been to some parties in my time"", as the film began. Indeed up until a certain point, I was still thinking ""these boys are just partying like it's 1999"". And then there was the midget in the oven. And at that point, I took my hat off and allowed them to boast of the ""most epic party"".Thomas, the nerdy birthday boy, who's constantly on edge, understandably, as his parents' house gets wrecked, still manages to dip in and out of pride and awe. Which feels quite genuine, because is there really a former 17 year old nerd amongst us who wouldn't have loved the whole school chanting our name; whilst at the same time having half of the girls topless in our pool just waiting for us to come over with a bottle of tequila and do body shots. That didn't happen in Milton Keynes, for sure.And as all good coming-of-age stories do, Project X makes you really will for them all to get, well, laid. Lots.Ultimately it doesn't do much more than Ferris Bueller did, back when I was small and in denim school sport shorts. And as Ferris did all those years ago, the set up of the Dad's car getting trashed is so obvious that for it to be held back until almost the very end, feels a little lazy on the writing side.Regardless, it's hilarious, and made me want to go out and party all night. I didn't, however. Instead I came home for a lemon and ginger tea and played on the Xbox. Partying like it's actually 2012.",Project X
144,jojosimien14,Mainly for Teens,6,30 May 2012,"Basic story of uncool kids throwing a party to be cool. I heard comparisons to The Hangover and Superbad, but it was nothing like those two. This was not a comedy and unless you are between the ages of 14-18 (I'm 22) or under the influence of something you won't enjoy this movie as much as others. It was basically flashing lights, music and sex. There was no real dialogue. The ending tries to make it seem like everything turned out for the best, but in all honesty this was too absurd. He burned down his parents house, wrecked his dad's car and was convicted of 3 charges. Anyone who has graduated from high school and moved on with their lives know that there is a lot of living to do after high school. Him ruining his and his parents life for one night of fun and popularity has to be one of the dumbest conclusions I have seen in a while. In other movies the house is trashed, but still in tact and the neighbor hood was not set on fire. This movie is good if you have some time to kill, but does not hold your attention for long. This is not a comedy, but more of a fake documentary. So, if you are looking for laughs try another film because you won't find many if any here.",Project X
145,Dave_ATC,Project X - Unlike Anything You've Seen,8,27 February 2012,"How far would you go to become a legend?Would you have more people in your backyard then some countries in the world? Would you obliterate your parents' million dollar home? How about set your entire neighborhood ablaze? For Thomas, Costa, and JB this was just the tip of the iceberg.We welcome back Todd Phillips, infamously now known for Producing such films you may have heard of like The Hangover, The Hangover Part 2, Due Date and Old School.Phillips brings us a film in Project X unlike we have ever seen before.Imagine the most insane, mind-numbing, seizure inducing high school party possible, then multiply that by about million, and you have yourself, Thomas Cub's epic birthday bash.It's hard to describe this film, because so much is happening all at once.Don't listen to the people that want to compare Project X with The Hangover or Super Bad, while there are some similar underlying tones, all three films are very different.Project X begins with Oliver Cooper who plays Costa coming to Thomas' house on the day of his birthday with plans of throwing a big soiree as JB would say. The catch is Costa hired an AV nerd, Dax, to film the entire event, from a first person point of view.Now most of the film is shot this way, and when I noticed the first few minutes were continuously through this perspective, I was worried for the rest of the film. Rest assured, there is no shaky camera for two hours, and it does not become a distraction.In fact, for this film it was actually the perfect way to present the party.Thomas Mann plays Thomas, he's sort of a ""loser"" as even his dad describes him, while JB played by Jonathan Daniel Brown is the token fat kid who chimes in with awkward input here and there.Costa is the brains of the operation, he wants to throw Thomas a huge party for his birthday while is parents are out of town, while at the same time get laid and become infamous for all of eternity throughout California.The greatest quality of Project X is how bad it makes you want to be there.With the first-person camera view, you're engulfed into the madness, from all the crazy dancing, to massive amounts of drug use to outrageous hijinks performed by various party crashers. It literally comes off as the greatest party you've ever seen. EVER.And for that to be depicted so vividly on film by Todd Phillips and director Nima Nourizadeh, deserves a drunken stupor-like round of applause.Then there is the music. Todd Phillips has been known to be ahead of the curb with music selection in his films, and the choices he makes here are phenomenal. Every major scene is accompanied by a great song, that gives this monstrosity of a party the feel it deserves.As the party progresses obviously things go haywire. From a missing dog, to midgets, to jumping off the roof of the house, that doesn't even give you a taste of what is about to come.The element of surprise, in terms of shock and awe of what will be around the next corner is the basis for Project X.If you don't leave this film wanting to go out and have the night of your life, you don't have a pulse.I give a ton of credit to the casting of this film. One of the best things they did was bring in the three leads who are unknown. It made you really enjoy the journey because there was no star power. Will this film catapult Oliver Cooper, Thomas Mann or Jonathan Daniel Brown into stardom like it did for Jonah Hill in Superbad, time will tell.There use to be a T.V. show on Nickelodeon called ""Wild and Crazy Kids"" well this is the high school versionwith more drugs, nudity, swearing, and fire.Simply put, this is the greatest, most unfathomable set of events taken place at a party that we have ever seen. And we all haven't lived life to the fullest unless we were apart of it. Because after you finish watching it, you'll be wishing you were there, you can count on that.Rating: 8.5/10",Project X
146,j-davidc13,Party Foul,5,15 March 2012,"Ever see the Tom Cruise movie Risky Business? Yeah, me too. Great fun, isn't it? But did you ever get to the end and think, ""No way."" Yeah, me too. Ever wonder what might happen if a party really did go out of control like that? Yeah...me too...Currently grabbing headlines for it's inspiration of a string of costly (and, in one recent case, deadly) teen parties, Project X attempts to answer that question. Three high school kids decide to throw a giant, ""epic"" party to capture some fame, propel themselves to legendary status at their school, and hopefully get laid.Produced by Todd Phillips and directed by Nima Nourizadeh, the film continues in the tradition of other Phillips films (such as The Hangover) by throwing the most despicable behavior in the universe on screen and using it as fodder for laughs. Unlike The Hangover, the laughs don't come nearly as often, which is far more unforgivable than anything done by its characters.If you can choke down the stupidity, the teen sex, the drug abuse, the abuse of animals, and the never-ending cavalcade of absolute and unbridled misogyny, Project X does have its cinematic rewards. It is mildly funny, in its over the top zeal. And it does cause jaw dropping reactions as the scale of the chaos is pumped up past the point of no return and into the stratosphere. Plus, the found footage filmmaking method gives it an extreme verisimilitude (for the most part), resulting in a feeling that you are seeing something insane actually happening in this suburban neighborhood.But the really egregious error the movie makes is in trying to spoon feed you some Pablum and make you think everything's okay. That's not the answer we wanted, and it's not even an answer that makes any sense. It's what one kid deplores in the movie as ""bitching out"", and though the movie expects its protagonists to be better than that, it has no problem doing it itself, leaving you to go home feeling cheated and unfulfilled.Screw it, just rent Risky Business and watch that instead. At least you'll laugh more.Rating: 2/5 Recommendation: Wait for cable. And read more of my reviews at clarketaculargeek.wordpress.com!",Project X
147,fca182,An outrageous party EXPERIENCE,9,2 March 2012,"I agree with another reviewer here who cleverly stated that this movie is an ""experience"".Unlike other teen party movies, like Superbad or American Pie, this movie does not try to have any Hollywood ""morals"". As outrageous and fictitious as the party is, it feels very real because the decisions made by all the party goers are real.Lets put it this way, if you're a teen and you go to a house party with no adults you're gonna be on your worst behavior with no regrets. Your gonna make bad decisions. If you can score with the hot chick, you will. You're not gonna make a ridiculous typical-movie decision like ditching the hot chick for a moral stand. You might do drugs, booze, have sex with whoever. This movie gives you a real party experience and that is something no other Hollywood movie has done.The movie isn't necessarily ""funny"" in the way The Hangover or Superbad is, nevertheless it manages to be a FUN movie simply because you actually FEEL like you're in that party having the time of your life.This movie is probably a parent's worst nightmare but for anyone under the 30-year demographic it's a must-see.",Project X
148,thempk,Always wondered how far a party can go when you invite across all possible means?,8,29 May 2012,"Not sure about you 1 star rating folks but I for one had a lot of fun watching this flick. If you've been following the news in the recent years mass invitations to birthday parties via FB or any other means tended to end up roughly like this.So which high school student who's unpopular did not dream of something like this? Tell you what, barely none. And that's what this movies captures: how a plan of three youngsters went from legendary to dreadful. Even the end was alright because you know that parents are bound to love their children no matter what crap they do. Besides it's something you will remember all your life.Granted a burned down house may have been a bit over the top but honestly we're living in such crazy times...better said we never stopped living in crazy times so what the hell.For anyone who wants to enjoy a movie, has no issues with boob shots (no offense, really but that's usually just an US issue ;) ), wants to feel like you're partying, if you're INTO partying or just having a good time following one...watch it. Perhaps not on the movies but at least on DVD.Roger and out, I'll get me the soundtrack. Was a sweet ride.P.S. I barely party ;) This was fun :)",Project X

150,Loopnova,fun party movie great to blow off some time,6,22 June 2013,"so i finally watched Project X. i know most people give it a bad review but i thought it was pretty good.as far as these crazy-party movies go it was quite good.the beginning(before party starts) was pretty funny..good jokes there.also the fact that it was filmed with the one-camera effect like Cloverfield(2008) made it interesting and added something unique to it.then when the party starts a lot of crazy stuff happens.to be honest i am not the type of person that particularly enjoys that sort of stuff.for me it was a little uncomfortable might be why i felt that the party was dragged a little.the crazy stuff that happened during the party was extremely unrealistic so many people might dislike that.but other than that not that much that bothered me.oh! that's It i forgot to mention.there's the romance between thomas and kirby from the start didn't really work that well for me.i thought it should have been more strongly built from the start.but even that had it's good/sweet moments bottom line,watch it as a popcorn movie and you'll most likely enjoy it.for me i enjoyed the beginning most after which the party scenes might have been too much for me.the negative reviews this movie got might have something to do with the fact that this was much like any other high school party movie...there's nothing that's too original about it..it's just a little more crazier and over the top..the acting for the most part was pretty good the actors held themselves pretty well for even the most weird situations it almost seemed authenticI might also mention this is a movie that is going to leave a different impression on different people.it depends on what you are expecting from it and your mood etc.so there isn't going to be a general review of it so I suggest give it a shot it might just be your type of movie",Project X

That alone left me interested throughout the movie but if that isn't enough for you there is nothing else on offer for you.",Project X
153,ingareik,Nostalgia trip,8,24 January 2020,"This is a definitiely a movie for the younger audience, I would say between 25-15. Project X is over the top, but still relatable.

154,hotspur75,Slow moving music video beer commercial,3,23 April 2012,"*spoilers are mild at best, essentially mentioning items or actions that are present here but not in other films of this genre*Project X is of the POV genre, this time as a group of kids celebrating a birthday party with an epic house party in order to be ""cool"".The stock characters are all present: The birthday boy is so uncool his dad thinks he's a loser, but he happens to have a hot chick that he's been friends with forever, the instigator is the ever awesome guy who used to get play but not since he moved to the new town, and the requisite ""fat"" kid who knows more about sex than you'd expect.Why a three star rating? First, because there is nothing new here. Tabbed as the most epic party of all time, the claim falls short of other ""epic high school"" parties, such as American Pie, Superbad, and Can't Hardly Wait, on every level except numbers. Even there, the party falls short of the earlier released ""Chronicle""'s rave. Stock characters placed in a common situation and experiencing exactly what they are supposed to according to the genre does not gain you style points, not even with a flamethrower.Second, the film moves as slow as molasses in January and with all the excitement of a cliché. With a running time of 88min, the decision was to put as much time into the party as possible. However, there are few things you can do once you get the party started. Putting a midget in the oven is funny and original, but it only takes 15 seconds of screen time. Otherwise, all you have are a lot of quick cuts of boobs, beer, pools, bounce houses, bedrooms, and a house being trashed before the police finally show up in force to end the 'souiree'.Finally, the acting is weak because they casted it weakly. Most of the people you see have limited or zero acting credits. The idea is that it will add to the feel of a home movie, but the result is hollow relationships and flat characters. High school kids act like stock high school kids from every party movie you can think of from the past 30 years. But the characters you are actually supposed to care about, the three friends throwing the bash, have no chemistry. Their lines are poorly delivered, not believable, and show little reaction to one another, otherwise known as ""acting"" skill.Why three stars? I gave it one for each entertaining moment of the film. The movie is absolutely a waste of time, so stream it or snag it on video where you can stop and start at will if you just have to see who gets naked. Honestly, there is no other reason to spend time with this film, unless you are trying to write a paper on how not to make an entry to an overcrowded genre.",Project X

I knew I wanted to write a review but wasn't quite sure what to say or how to say it.You see I'm waaaaayy beyond being a teenager and usually steer clear of most teen coming-of-age movies. In fact I wouldn't have watched this one except I didn't read what it was about. I just saw it had almost 7 stars. I thought it was a science-fiction type movie. Boy was I wrong!!! And I almost turned it off(I saw it at home. I can't imagine what it would have been like to see it in a theater full of ""young adults""!)I'm glad I left it on. I REALLY enjoyed it! Almost right away I thought of ""Risky Business"" with Tom Cruise in 1983 (I was 23yrs old). But this made ""Risky"" seem like a little old ladies' tea party.

156,wapper300,Superbad meets The Hangover gone immensely bad.,4,20 October 2014,"Brainless. It's the sort of film that makes a mockery of Hollywood and the art of film-making.It's all too 'cliche' even for its own genre. I went into this film not pro or against it, but I was left very disappointed. In all its essence the film lacks creativity, thought input and originality above anything else.What hurts the most is the predictability of the direction in which the film heads. From the themes,atmosphere and plot we can assume that it's a comedy only just missing the jokes. Leaving that aside,poor acting coupled with an atrocious story line makes for a perfect failure. As is the film is still watchable, however, one major performance wrecks the film-that of Cooper as Costa. Seems apparent that he tries to give a Jonah Hill performance but only manages to make an annoying version of a rotten headed kid.It's likely that it's 12 million budget went props and repairs of the destruction caused rather than actual film-making. In its entirety the film does contain some enjoyable pieces but in all the film does cause for a nod of disappoint.I give it a 4/10.",Project X
157,The_Grimm_Reaper,The Only Party Movie To Have Balls,9,2 March 2012,"I walked into this film thinking this film is going to be a rip-off and be a stupid predictable party movie. Though some things were obviously predictable but isn't all comedies predictable.Though critics have rated this film horribly I think they are wrong you have to look at this film for what it is supposed to represent. Mostly 15-25 year olds appreciate the film. But some people have to understand not every film is made for everyone and not every film has to be Oscar material.As for the movie itself I loved it, it was a different way of showing partying in a movie. The film has some type of feel to it like when you finish it you feel you were at the party. Some people may complain about the sex, drugs, nudity, etc in the film but one thing that made this film unique is the power of them 'going there' like going way over the top making the craziest things happen in it.If you basically do not have a sense of humor I do not recommend this film but if you have some fun in you and understand what it is like to be a teenager in this generation you will like it. Also I know some people say the film is not realistic in ways but it is one of the best movies to show how teenagers party there are teens that have partied like this but without the over the top ending it is very realistic.The found footage idea for this film is what made it better a new concept and it is finally being used for a comedy an excellent job. Though I hope this film becomes a hit because I feel it is highly underrated it is no different from the 80's-90's party movies the only difference is 'Project X' shows everything that happens at parties.You can say the fans of the film are immature but the film is worth seeing. Also it is nothing like 'The Hangover' nor 'Superbad'. Though the film is funnier and more over the top than the hangover. This film is just another classic that was supposed to happen but won't it has too many mad reviews.I give this movie a 9/10 a perfect comedy and a good way to show what happens at parties. Interesting to see what happens through out the movie, it is very intense so you will be blown away at a lot of scenes. May contain lots of nudity and outrageous behavior but at least the film had the balls to make it right. Please see the film first before you hate a lot of you are missing out.",Project X
158,Theusualguy,A disgrace to be called a movie,2,3 October 2012,"This movie can hardly be called a movie, it is pretty much just a one and a half hour long advertisement or music video. I would firstly like to say, that movie had a cool party in it. But there was no plot, no characters that we actually gave a sh$t about and their was no complication or resolution. Just a film with an awful soundtrack of boring dub-step and Kid Cudi the whole way through.Project X is about a group of dorky, nerdy friends whose parents go away and they plan to have a massive party with only a few people. Then word gets out that they are having a party then the whole town of teens show up then craziness ensues.If your looking for a coming of age comedy, watch super bad or American pie. If you want to listen to cool music, buy an album, not a movie. This movie is nothing more then a music video 2/10 for a cool part which the film centers around, but nothing for it to go on.",Project X
159,nicknaseef17,This actually could happen..,7,3 March 2012,"Seriously, it could! The fact is nobody would have the balls to do it, and with good reason. This type of party is certainly achievable, sadly if it ever was achieved the repercussions would be even worse than those of the movie, but I digress. The thing that is pissing me off though is all the people hating on it because it is ""over the top"" or that it ""sends a bad message"". Of course it is over the top, that was the point. If you wanted to see some realistic party, you shouldn't have bought a ticket to Project X! Simple as that! Also, I would agree that it sends a bad message...but who freaking cares. Teenagers aren't stupid enough to be influenced by this movie into throwing some huge party, they've experienced bad enough stuff just at normal parties. I would recommend that anyone who wants to see this film goes in with an open mind, don't have any sorts pre-conceived notions about it when going in. Just sit back and enjoy the ride, it isn't supposed to be artistic or have some incredible story line, it is supposed to be fun!

The movie had a lack of story, no red thread, and no real point except these 3 high school buddies trying to become popular at school and hook up with some girls - but it works! The movie starts off with about half an hour with ""actual"" storytelling, before the party breaks loose. The rest of the movie is just witnessing this amazing party, and being put right in the middle of it! Craziness happens all the time, and everything is extremely wild. It's everything from 12 year old security guards beating the sh*t out of neighbors to police helicopters trying to take control. The party is a next level party which even ""Tryvann"" can't compete with. The movie is funny and entertaining. Although this is a found footage/home video/ hand held shot movie, you don't really notice it because the editing is very good, and it's shot by a ""pro"" cameraman. It starts off a bit wiggly and shaken, but that's mostly to give the audience a feeling of it being ""real"".I do not recommend it to people who don't love to party. Picture yourself living on the street next to the party. If you'd run over and joined the party: Watch it! If you'd called the police and ordered silence: go to bed. I loved it! It was crazy, it was fun, and a really good time at the movies! I can see why some people don't really like this movie, but that's just because it's not really a movie.

The comedy follows three high school students as they attempt to gain popularity among their peers through hosting the ''party you've only dreamed about'' in central character Thomas' house while his parents are away. However, this plan soon falls through as the house descends into chaos and things grow more out of control throughout the night.First of all, Project X is an enjoyable film; there are several genuinely funny moments and it boasts an excellent soundtrack of carefully selected electro house party music designed to make you feel as though you are experiencing the party itself, which combined with the shaky hand-held camera succeeds in this method. There are clearly appealing factors and on the surface Project X is a perfectly good comedy film, worthy of anything we've seen so far this year, yet it suffers from an inherently distracting and vital flaw; Project X is a carbon cut copy of Judd Apatow's 2007 classic high school comedy Superbad.Let's examine the plot lines of both films for a moment to test the accuracy of this statement; Superbad follows three high school students who attempt to gain popularity among their peers by going to a huge party and getting drunk girls to sleep with them. Check. How about the characters? Well there's Thomas, our main character, an all round average guy with a sensible attitude and sensitive touch who's only looking to party in order to finally get the girl of his dreams. Then best friend Costa, the loud jackass friend who abuses and bullies Thomas into hosting the party and attempts to charm every woman in site, oblivious to his outrageous behaviour. And finally JB, the stereotypical nerd who provides cheap laughs for the audience through his combination of unwittingly amusing outbursts and terrible dancing. Sound familiar? Well that's because I've just described Evan, Seth and the beloved Fogell (a.k.a McLovin). There are even replacements for the idiot cop duo of Seth Rogen and Bill Hader in the form of two underage and underweight bouncers who attempt to control the increasingly crazy shenanigans of the party folk to no avail.Ultimately, the main strength of Project X is the sheer realism the cinema goer will experience of the party, and there are also solid performances from the male leads, in particular Oliver Cooper's portrayal of loudmouth Costa which makes for some hilarious encounters, but it remains a mystery that nobody turned to Nourizadeh or Philips in the production stage to let them know they were creating a blatant rip off of a film not even 5 years old.

162,alishalangley24,Amazing!,10,16 February 2013,"The movie was great,always had your attention. It's something you would watch with your friends to have a laugh.Amusing, funny and exciting is how i'd describe it.I brought it on DVD right away as it is something i feel i could watch over and over. The film really makes you feel like you want to be there. It was easily the best party film i've ever seen. It's different to most films, but that's what makes it exciting! Every part of the film had you on the balls of your feet.I'd say the film was aimed at teenagers, that's why me and my friends love it so much. The only negative side to the film is that there wasn't much of a plot.",Project X
163,mevans-19,As satisfying as someone's stupid YouTube video,4,4 March 2012,"And that's this film's biggest problem. Saying this is the current generation's ""Animal House"" or ""Superbad"" is insulting to those other movies...and possibly to this generation.Those films stand up to repeated viewings because of the writing. That's the key to great comedy -- from Woody Allen to stoner comedies -- if it's not there on the page, there will be nothing worthwhile on the screen. You NEED things like character development and clever dialog. Project X had neither beyond tired clichés and predictable jokes.Speaking as a guy who has worked on a handful of movie sets, it was a cool movie to watch from a technical stand point. The extras wranglers alone deserve recognition. The soundtrack was decent too. But all flash and little substance only takes you so far for so long.In the end, Project X is probably only really good ONCE. This isn't Clerks, Caddyshack or even Cheech and Chong. Sorry -- ""There's a midget in the oven"" isn't a very quotable line.",Project X

165,elijahwithaj,Good fun!,6,16 April 2012,"This movie was interesting for me. It was over the top fun. I did not hate it but I didn't thoroughly enjoy it either. But everyone else in the group I was in did (there were six of us). I wanted more of a comeuppance for the stupidity and felt it wasn't given. I wanted the kids to pay a bigger price for what they did than they did. The performances however, were spot on. I could have sworn some of the kids in the movie were in the theater with us. The obnoxiousness and youthful naivety was played perfectly. If it is a commentary of the under 18 crowd then sad as it is, it nailed it. The truth of the matter is a lot of people get away with just about anything and that was definitely underscored in this film. I just didn't think that the audience that was in the theater with me, needed that assurance. At the end of the day (and on the way home) my friends jumped all over me for bringing down the party and I have to say I agreed with them and wanted to enjoy the movie for what it was. Just not sure what to say that is. Obviously I am getting old.",Project X
166,paidsmurf,someones party fantasy,3,15 May 2013,"So i watched this movie recently, well after it had been on the big screen. I came in with an open mind having not seen the trailer or had anyone tell me about it. About 35 minutes into the movie I became concerned because I had not laughed, I had heard that this was a comedy. So i consulted IMDb and flicked through the first few pages of reviews, there were some high marks and some low marks. The high marks sounded a little artificial so I looked at the user profile and found that invariably those who rated it highly had only ever rated this film and maybe one other......wait what? a number of user profiles created to rate this movie highly? I'm saying thats a fact.....anyway the take away is don't bother watching this",Project X
167,ian-edmonds,My NAme Is Gerald Marshall,3,11 March 2012,"As all of you know my name is actually Gerald Marshall and i went to watch this movie with my friend Brad Burton and we thought that it was going to be a good stupid funny movie but it wasn't it was just stupid.First of all who the hell would drive a car into a pool,the guy who directed this disaster has never been to a party,It's just a stupid teen film that you would forget overnight.A midget in the oven is about as inspired as the dialogue and set pieces get in this queasy-making entertainment. It's trying so bad to be like superbad but this attempt that takes the partying to outrageous ends without any of the humor or heart. It's yet another ""found footage"" approach, which means no narrative style.Most of this review is done by Brad Burton",Project X
168,tylern2009,Dazed and Confused of Our Generation,8,21 March 2012,"It is what it is.IT""S A PARTY MOVIE! did you really think this was going to be some Oscar nominated film!? even the makers know it's not.From trailers you should know it's going to be a ridiculous party that gets out of hand and that is the mind set you should have had when seeing this film. This movie uses a 1st person camera so it makes you feel like you're in the party. Kind of like the movie Cloverfield but not anywhere near as shaky. This was a very intelligent move by the makers. Also, not many people know this, but YES THIS MOVIE WAS BASED ON AN ACTUAL PARTY. Don't believe me? go to you-tube and watch Australian party kid. This movie was wild, loud, and immediately made you want to party and have the time of your life. Truly influenced by YOLO. Also, this soundtrack was amazing, the girls were incredibly hot (some nasty chicks for laughs), and had decent characters. Not to mention, this movie was not just a big crazy music video party, but had a lot of funny one liners and funny scenes. I really don't get why people can rag on this. Maybe because they've never partied before, and in that case, after seeing this movie they probably have. Even though I enjoyed this movie, there were some flaws and room for improvement. Some characters were left basically undeveloped and uninteresting, and also having a party that upbeat made some slower scenes feel even slower. But overall, grab a case of beer, take some shots, and get crazy. Go see this movie, its a must especially if you are in the college/high school ages. To THE BREAK OF DAWN!",Project X
169,louhefner123,Party Party Partyyyyyyyy,10,20 June 2012,"This movie was good for a great hype moment before you and your friends go to the club, yoo im tellin you this is it right here, now grant it. You don't want to repeat the events that happened in the movie but for a house party, this was it. The cast did a good job in the beginning and reason why i say beginning is because there wasn't really a need to act in this movie. just party and you'll be alright. A lot of people got paid in this movie and for pretty much free, cause again all they did was party party party....Half the things that went on usually happen at real parties to, except the flame thrower, lol but then that was the (SPOLIER ALERT) crazy junkie looking for his nome filled with Xstacy, lmao overall it was a great one time movie, great party. makes me think of my old days.....",Project X

If you're not this sh*t is lit and an inspiration to future parties in America. 10/10 most inspirational movie I've ever seen. It's basically just an orgasm of sex, drinking, drugs, crazy sh*t, a sh*tty attempt at a romantic plot but who cares about that it takes up like 5 minutes, and a lit party you wish you went to but do not wish you hosted.",Project X
171,meganhinge,Quite disturbing - not in a good way,1,25 August 2014,"I was waiting for there to be a lesson, a moral a 'something' in this film, but it never came. This film and its pursuit of 'cool' is everything that is still wrong with the world today. As I was watching I was sure that the constant denigration of woman was going to turn into some sort of lesson towards the end, but no the 'bitches' remained bitches and all that the 'boys' seemed to be after was pussy, as if females were only put on this planet to service their needs. I really wonder how much damage this sort of film does to teenagers and early 20 somethings who are still chasing this meaningless concept of becoming someone by being remembered for doing something 'cool'. People are not objects, hosting an 'epic' party will not bring you lasting happiness in life, seeking validation from others for meaningless acts will only hurt you in the long run.I found this film quite disturbing on many levels.",Project X

173,leosnery,Extremely entertaining,9,23 April 2020,"I mean, you expect this film to be a life experience but it is a really good entertaing option. It has everything to be a typical teenager party film but it just keeps subverting your expectations.",Project X
174,iremtab,Was I supposed to laugh?,1,30 August 2019,Was this a comedy? because I didn't even chuckle once.Bad movie honestly.Overhyped.Maybe if we were still in 2012 I'd say it was funny.But a good movie has to be timeless and has to make you feel the same as it did 10 years ago in my opinion.,Project X
175,TheFunk16,A New Generation,8,26 February 2012,"Project X shines a light on the largest most realistic party scene kids involve themselves with today. House party's with DJ's infused with lights and drugs and strangers.I was lucky to see an advanced screening in Toronto last Thursday .It's hard not to compare this film to Superbad, but to address the elephant, this movie has the stereotypical character set but takes the morality and skews it in a way much darker and much realer than Superbad.That is to say, in Superbad, they made the right decisions and did not accept their fate, they fixed most they could and salvaged what they had.The key moment in this movie is a turning point with Tom on the roof, and the characters begin to accept the destruction, embrace the madness, and live the night how they needed too, absolutely wildly.This is that wild movie to represent the visceral experience these boys needed, just as everyone needs in life, a dose of danger, and sometimes even a full out image-flipper.Project X represents the new generation of party animals that is becoming foreign to mainstream media. It also treats drugs and sex and other ""troubling"" youth acts with positive or no consequence.Project X reminds me of Breaking Bad in many ways, and I highly recommend participating in this wild ride!",Project X
176,feagurth,Greates party movie ever.,10,3 August 2012,"It's an entertaining and good movie from the beginning to the end, and definitely one of the most amazing party movies I've ever seen. I recommend it to all party goers. It's defiantly not a movie for douches and stiff spine people. Little dog and the midget scenes were one of the best ones but the flamer guy was a bit exaggerated. On the other hand hell had to break lose sooner or later one way or another, so I guess the flamer guy was an O.K. way to do it. Enter at your own risk, massive amount of young tits and sweet ass. Boys and girls play absolutely awesome and seam mostly very authentic, which is hard to find quality with young actors. To all you people that say that this movie had no message in it, you're wrong. The message is ""Party to the break of dawn, yo!"". Word of advice, kids don't try this stuff at home ;) It might not end up as well in the end as it did in this movie :D As the last I put my message to all the ignorant that this this doesn't happen for real, watch this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xc0CB6URrV0 or do some research on Corey Delaney.",Project X
177,judder_vision,Typical Comedy Movie for Teens,7,11 March 2012,"Project X goes where no teenager had the balls to... or maybe didn't want to. You've got your typical main character who doesn't have many friends, the over-the-top wannabe who thinks he's cool with everyone and has all the hook-ups, and the chubby geek. The three set out to have the most outrageous party in order to gain popularity at school and ultimately make it with hot babes.Though it sounds like any other teen movie, the main characters weren't as exaggerated as I expected. They were actually probably exactly like kids you would've known in high school (or possibly *were* in high school), and that's what I think made it so funny and easy to relate to. You felt like you were part of the group and living the party. It was like you were right there with them the whole time and just laughing at your own friends.You're quickly introduced to the main characters and get a sense of their personalities, which are pretty decently consistent throughout the movie. You see Thomas constantly worrying about the house, his sleazy friend at his side assuring him everything will be alright in order to encourage him to enjoy the party, and of course the geek whose only worry is trying to get laid. You experience the party, all the crazy events that ensue, how quickly it can all get out-of-hand, and how everything works out at the end.What bothered me was the overdone drug-dealer. When he came for his revenge, my friend and I just looked at each other confused, thinking, ""Is this even the same movie?"" Also, I was distracted with the way the whole movie was shot. I found myself constantly thinking about how that kid was following them around with a camera the whole time. Every scene throughout the entire movie was from someone with a camera. I mean, I understand that we'd all love to record every crazy party we've been to, but why not just shoot the movie normally?Overall, the movie consisted of an insane party that would be any teen's fantasy, booze, drugs, topless girls, and a tiny bit of romance thrown into the storyline. All around, it would be appealing to any teen.",Project X
178,owenob1,"Great film, amazing soundtrack!",10,13 July 2012,"This film will forever be in my list of ""best party films""...Loosely based on a true story of an Australian teen who's party lost control, 3 average 17-18 year old's hold a party dubbed ""Project X"" and invite countless numbers of people.Every high and low of a killer high school or college party is portrayed in some way. Alcohol, Relationships, Sex, Drugs, Police - it's all here.Complemented with a killer soundtrack, and a good balance of nudity; Project X is the party that everyone will be left wanting to be part of.",Project X
179,dmlucifer,A slightly different approach,7,30 May 2012,"Some of you view this as a straight-up comedy, I view it as a study of humankind. With some funny bits thrown in because life is often funny. Not to get too melodramatic but I think this film captures realistically both the magnificence and ugliness of the feral human spirit. It shows what humans are able to do in packs, what the mob mentality is like, what humans are capable of when unleashed. Undoubtedly inspired by incidents like Corey Worthington's party or Gemma Anscomb's, this movie is not carried by its predictable plot or simple love story. It's the experience of the party that carries it.If you've ever stumbled on a drunk unconscious teen and drawn a giant sausage on his forehead, this is the movie for you. If you've handed the permanent marker to your friend with words:""Hey, you know what would be fun ?"", this is the movie for you. If you just thought that a giant permanent marker sausage would look great on his forehead, this still is the movie for you. If however you thought ""That's disgusting, he shouldn't be allowed to drink in that age."" then this movie is definitely going to bore you at least but it's more likely to upset you.",Project X
180,mycellardoor24,Seriously awesome.,10,1 January 2013,"I went into the this movie with no expectations whatsoever and having already read a million times that this film was nothing but ""...predictable mean-spirited debauchery..."" I admit I was wary. However, I found this film to be unexpectedly fantastic and I absolutely loved it. I'm 26 and a teetotaler, but come on people, don't we all at some point dream of at least attending a party like that? That's what the experience of this is like. Going to someone else's party and enjoying it because it's not your house you're trashing. There's a little bit of destruction in all of us and it comes out when we drink - who can say they truly didn't revel even a little in the sheer destruction and chaos portrayed brilliantly throughout this film? Not all films have to have the same structure, I've seen a ton of Indie movies that seemed to be one long take without a middle or end.This film was explosive, nerve shredding and at times repulsive. But it was just pure brilliance. All these people saying it's empty and hollow...why? Because no-one died? Because there was no enormous backlash at the end? The absence of morals has shocked you to your core? Maybe it's more of a reflection of today's reality. Often times these things happen with little to no consequences to note - this is what is happening everywhere, albeit in a smaller scale. This was based on a true story, after all.I think the harsh critique of this film is more to do with other people's denial about the world we are living in. About children, about what they really are doing when parents go away. Some things in this film were horrifying, but to simply cast it aside as a music video? Ignorance is bliss I suppose. I threw a party like this once, what little I recall anyway and although it cost a me a lot to repair and hide what I'd done, I still look back with a smile...as a fully grown adult with responsibilities and a mortgage.This film is a blast, for God's sake don't go expecting an Oscar Wilde epic. Go for a party you won't have to worry about because it's not your house! Go for the experience, because you wouldn't dare to do this yourself!",Project X

182,polokill,I'd rather sit at home than party like this.,1,14 April 2013,"This movie was for me the WORST piece of crap I have ever sat through and I sat through Batman and Robin. This movie is basically a youtube video of high schoolers partying with no real plot or premise and the bad quality actually makes you believe that you are watching a youtube video. The characters are either bland or stereotypical who provide no real or original jokes and neither does any of the antics in the movie(even the final scene with crazy drug dealer). The movie is filled with unending montages, lames lines and to actually get your attention, they show boobs. Lots and lots of boobs. If I were you ,I'd skip this movie every chance I get. If I could sum up this movie in one sentence it would be,"" The worst film I have ever seen.""",Project X
183,moochisaurus,Misleading in that it does not promote Crazy Parties,2,15 June 2012,"I thought this would be a fun SuperBad on speed, but instead i really loathed this movie and was cringing and stressed the whole time. Some say that this movie glorifies wild parties, but instead i think it does the opposite. In the ratings, I think that the younger audiences took the movie to the first degree and not really thinking about it about the dramatic consequences of the characters and this actually left me a feeling of being disgusted by the end of the movie. ***spoiler time***The main character (Thomas) sees his house gradually getting trashed and we do feel his level of anxiety, however the Ending looks like it is finishing on a high note: he becomes one of the Cool kids in school and gets the girl... However beyond that, Thomas' life is completely ruined because of that one night: when high school finishes in 1-2 years time, everyone will go their separate ways (probably university) and no one will remember him. His relationship with his girlfriend will most likely not last after high school as he will probably have to start working or go to some community college near by due to the huge amounts of debts he is stuck with for the rest of his life, where as she has the opportunity to go away and continue her studies. Costa, the quick-mouth type of character who think he's ""da bomb"" also royally annoyed me. Usually those type of characters are entertaining to listen to, have some witty banter and some kind of redeeming quality. However here, not only was he annoying for the whole duration of the movie, but he was also incredibly selfish! Thomas' birthday is just an excuse to organize a party that will pretty much benefit to Costa, who will become popular and won't have any issues with debt and legal action. He's the type of friend who is dragging the others down which Thomas and the fat token kid are too naive to notice. It just would anger me so much if a friend took advantage of me like that! The movie also criticizes the values important to our society nowadays: the characters become popular and respected because of that huge bash which just shows how shallow people can be, worried about their status (example: Thomas' crush only starts to reciprocate his feelings when Thomas is throwing the party and after that when he is validated by his peers as a cool kid). The ending gives out a of feel-good type of vibe however when you think about the consequences, they are disastrous and leave a bitter taste.",Project X

It was what we thought it would be...and in my opinion...in a pretty damn good way too. The three kids were hilarious and the movie was just an amazing and outlandish party scenes and sequences that had everyone in the theater pumped up and ready to do some crazy stuff after the movie was finished. I do not understand what is wrong with the critics. Did they expect this movie to have a deeply moving plot with excellent characters and unforgettable sob scenes? It did what the trailer advertised...and in a good way.I'm a teen and I gotta say it is a great movie for all the teenagers out there.

186,niksnijders,Not deserving of the hate it got,9,20 September 2012,"Right off the bat, let me say I enjoyed this movie a lot. I'm pretty cynical when it comes to comedies, but every now and then I get lured into watching one and sometimes I come out enjoying it, needless to say, this was one of those times.The premise is simple: A bunch of nerdy teen guys organize a party, lots and lots of people show up and thrash the place. The way this story is realized is through the use of 'found footage'-style images, which in short means someone else was filming everything so the camera becomes a part of the actual movie instead of a voyeuristic peek, including the cameraman being spoken to a few times and actually talking himself. We get to see a whole lot of debauchery, nudism, teens getting drunk and high, wanton destruction of property, callous disregard of neighbors, dancing teens and loud music. All of this adds up to a, in my experience, very enjoyable watch displaying the biggest, noisiest, most depraved and most anarchistic party in the history of cinema, and it's displayed in a way that's actually pretty realistic in the 'you feel like you're there' kind of way. Some of the stuff that happens is pretty out there/far fetched, some of the teens are way more hedonistic than anyone would ever believe them to be, I'm pretty sure midgets won't get thrown into ovens in a real party and I have personally never seen a garden gnome filled with xtc get smashed by a baseball bat, resulting in free dope for everybody, but that's not the point.The point is, that this is a movie about partying. It is what it is, it's not a movie about responsible teens throwing a party and growing up, taking responsibility and becoming adult. It's a movie that borders on the verge of exploitation because all it tries to do is show the biggest and wildest party ever captured on celluloid.Most of the flak this movie received (and still receives) focuses on two things:1: Nobody takes any responsibility in the end, lives are left in shambles, the place gets completely wrecked, adultery, casual drug use, you name it. It all happens and there's no repercussions at the end. 2: The old 'I hate these depraved teens' argument, from people who generally don't like this kind of movie anyway.To both these critics I repeat: It is what it is. The movie was obviously not made with the intention of being a 'coming of age' flick, and as long as the actual movie is as entertaining as it is, I couldn't care less if there's no message at the end. It's pure, unadulterated anarchy and depravity raised to a level rarely seen before, it's escapism at its finest. It sets out with *one* goal in mind, and it delivers the goods like a movie of this type rarely does. The fact that in the Netherlands there's a matter of a girl organizing a party through Facebook, accidentally not making it a private event, thousands of people planning to come and the media calling it 'Project X' speaks volumes in my opinion.In the end, it's a movie that makes you want to party and I salute Nima Nourizadeh for directing this wonderful flick. Party on and thanks for reading!",Project X
187,rhoecus,Not your average coming of age,7,1 November 2012,I was apprehensive about watch this film. The trailers show it as some sort of wild partying students who are having a good time with no worries in the world.Some of the characters tend to lean towards annoying. But it was good to see this film also focused on the implications of trying to be popular by throwing the 'best party'.The Thomas character was particularly interesting in his reflection on the reprecucsions throwing the party had on his life & that of his family. It was funny to see his fathers reactions towards the end of the movie.This was enjoyable & I dare that if you watch it you don't feel a twinge of sadness for what happened.It does however get spoilt when the drug dealer appears mid-way through setting the scene for a riot. But despite this it was really enjoyable.,Project X

Project X was cast with a nationwide open-for-all casting call, but the actors (who were nearly all first time on-screen) did not seem to uncomfortable before the camera. My personal favourite was Cooper who played Costa, though his views are too misogynistic for me too digest.The characters have been portrayed well when you consider that the movie has almost no plot whatsoever. The music is something that I would like to take back home with me. But the most interesting aspect for me was the 1st person camera shooting involving a character from the movie. I am a fan of this mode of shooting, and like almost all movies that have incorporated it( Cloverfield, Rec, Trolljegeren to name a few).All in all, a good movie to watch when you have some time to kill, or when you want to see a live example of how the vanities of man might lead to his intellectual extinction.",Project X

192,braff182-1,Extremely over the top yet strangely relatable,6,3 March 2012,"Depending on which age group you fall in will determine your enjoyment for Project X. Project X does so many fundamental things wrong such as sub par acting and glaring plot holes. However, for a film that on paper seems absolutely terrible I could not stop laughing and really enjoying this movie.Project X isn't so much hilarious as it is entertaining. This movie will really appeal those who can relate to the plot somewhat. As an 18 year old that has thrown parties when my parents were away the film struck a chord with me. I could feel the main character Thomas's anxiety when he realized he had no control over his house and that's why I feel many teenagers and even those in their early 20's would really relate to this film.Project X might not be worth 10 dollars to see it in the movie theater but if you go with a good group of friends the 10 dollar ticket will seem more than worth it. I really enjoyed the film for personal reasons but I can see a lot of movie goers detesting it. 6/10",Project X
193,reactiv,A New Low For X-Cremental Filmmaking,1,21 August 2012,"Project X (2012) Stars: Thomas Mann (Thomas), Oliver Cooper (Costa), John Brown (J.B.), Dax Flame (Dax) Director: Nima NourizadehDown through all the years of movie making, there have been certain films that leave a unique taste. Some leave a taste of satisfaction, whereas others leave the opposite. Yet even the worst films can be saved by something. Maybe the music is great, or a character is interesting. It may be unintentionally funny. Then there are films like ''Project X''. That rare cinematic beast: the movie with no redeeming features. I've seen a diverse amount of films, and I can safely say that ''Project X'' is the worst one I've ever encountered. I'm not exaggerating. To elaborate...The ''plot'' is simple enough. It's Thomas' 18th birthday and his parents are leaving for the weekend. However, his ''friend'' Costa wants to use the occasion to hold ''the most epic party ever'', all at Thomas' house. With the help of a nobody called J.B., Costa hopes the party will make himself and Thomas ''cool''. Soon enough, Thomas' house is flooded with hundreds of high-school idiots and everything predictably goes to hell. Filming this terror is Dax, a quiet kid who becomes creepy for no real reason. Can our loser heroes resolve the carnage before Thomas' parents arrive home? Not if Costa has anything to say about it...The ''shaky-camera'' style of filming is headache-inducing as always. Each ''plot point'' is separated by a montage of unerotic shots of girls lifting their shirts, and idiots gurning at the camera. All of this is scored to hip-hop drivel and booming bass that assaults your senses. But where ''Project X'' truly fails is in its characters and ''comedy''.Simply put, Costa is the most horrible character I've ever seen in a film. He makes Eric Cartman look pleasant. This tanktop-wearing scumbag dominates the film, and is obviously meant to be the ''funny'' character. The one everyone quotes. Yet his onslaught of racist and homophobic bile makes you want to punch him even harder. Other characters treat him like a king of cool, and he treats them like dirt. For example, he brands the non-drinking Dax a ''faggot'', casually blows fag smoke at a baby and manipulates his ''best friend'' in order to get laid. Result: He ruins everyone's lives, destroys Thomas' home and gets away with it without a shred of remorse! Not only that, his actions are glamorised at the film's end. Ferris Bueller he ain't.The other characters don't fare any better. Thomas could be sympathetic if he didn't blindly follow Costa. J.B. is the obligatory ''fat kid'' and only exists to be the butt of Costa's depraved jokes. Dax is only there to film the insanity and hide in the bushes, covertly filming peoples' private business. The only sympathetic character is an angry neighbour who comes to complain about the noise. For his troubles, he is shot with a taser, threatened by two junior psychos and nearly has his home torched by a drug-peddling maniac. We're told this innocent man has a baby! So, this apparently makes his suffering ''hilarious'' and makes Costa look like ''da bomb''. What a party-killer. To make a long story short, the film's bizarre message is that as long as you look cool, it's okay to destroy peoples' lives and houses. Even Thomas' dad is impressed by the chaos his son has helped to create, as well as some newscasters and Jimmy Kimmel(!) So, disgraceful characters, mind-numbing music and crass stereotyping of teenagers help make a truly monumental piece of cinematic vileness. I lost hope when a dog was tied to balloons and sent into the air, while an idiot went ''OMG it's a flying dog.'' Cue facepalm.Please spare yourself from this film. You won't regret not watching it. I already did that so you won't have to.",Project X

These kids took it to the extreme and it became a block party and only when it is too late that they realize that what they have done will go down as one of the baddest, most unbelievable, and unreal even of their lives.

I can only assume that all of the cast, the extras, and the crew have all voted for this as I can't see any other reason why it has all of these stars. It's just not anything to get excited about. I can only imagine that the reason why it does not have more negative reviews is because no one can really muster up the energy to slag it off. And the fact that it's also quite difficult to write 10 lines of text about something as naff as this.

196,Antaire,(SPOILERS) The Sensation Of Eating An Entire Buffet And Still Feeling Empty,2,18 July 2012,"'Project X' is something of a Frankenstein Monster comprised of many du jour culture trends and other films / stories but it never comes to life itself in any kind of genuine way. It's as if a robot collected data based on Youth by using a #swag hashtag and cobbled together 'Project X' in the hopes that it would be enough to make a satisfying movie experience. It doesn't. There are some decent things about 'Project X': for the most part it Looks good (cinematography wise) and the depiction of things getting out of control feels convincing enough.. yet it's all for nothing as the viewers intelligence is constantly insulted (examples below) and convincing human emotion never actually makes an appearance throughout. The popular consensus seems to be that this is a Fantasy tale made for the Young and doesn't pretend to be much more than that - I get this - but because people have yet to buy tickets to watch a 1.5 hour music video set to a generic electro soundtrack 'Project X' has to have a plot. This is where the real problems start: the obligatory character roles (the likable Main Guy.. the snarky sidekick.. the chubby goofy 3rd Musketeer) are all here. Ditto the square Authority Figures (parents, neighbor, police). So far so good, right? Wrong: The police attempt to serve and protect and end up getting hoodwinked by the kids. The neighbor is raising a baby with his wife next door and gets taser'd and his yard set on fire. The parents of the main character get their house, property, and one would assume reputation destroyed.. In each case: Why? We're left with No explanation other than ""so entitled kids can Rage and Party"". Even for the most targeted of target audience: this is enough for you? I get that it's a Fantasy - but what is the Fantasy saying? what does the film say? The ""F*ck Authority"" sentiment will always be around - but it only means something if there's a reason to rail back against said Authority: mild mannered parents and neighbors trying to get on with their lives are not enough to validate the ensuing war zone in 'Project X'. Instead of feeling like a righteous rally it feels selfish, barbaric and empty.Ideals aside there's also some staggeringly apparent loopholes we're expected to overlook: the party rages on out of control and the cops are nowhere in sight after the first check-in? the only girls who attend parties are model-equse bimbos who undress when instructed by random dudes? the entire way the chaos wraps up and is reflected upon... this leads me to the single most deal-breaking moment of the film (SPOILER) - when the father is confusingly informing his kid that ""you're f*cked"" but also quasi complimenting him (""I didn't think you had it in you"") as the car is being crane-lifted from the pool among the wreckage. Even The most vapid viewer I Hope would be needing some kind of Conclusion or Closure by this point in the film but instead we get a kind of ""aww shucks that's m'boy"" message which caters to such low hanging fruit of the Juvenile Fantasy so hard that the film swallows itself and collapses without a shred of credibility or believability.",Project X
197,tha_mariachi,"Unexpected, but in a very good way",8,15 September 2016,"After a long, boring day at work, I decided to watch this movie. Only thing I was aware of considering plot prior watching it is that this is 'party going out of control' type of movie. ""Another dull teen cliché"" crossed my mind. So I expected nothing special.But for some reason I couldn't stop laughing for almost total run-time. Weird, ha? But that's what happened. I kept watching and laughing. And I enjoyed it. Later, I recommended it to my brother and a friend (who is also a colleague) of mine, and they had exact same reaction.So, if you are looking for movie unburden with heavy twist or any complicated back story and just want to relax your mind, I strongly recommend this one. Oh, one more thing: people mentioned above, including myself, are all in late twenties or early, early thirties. So I suppose we are still very young in our hearts and minds.

If you are looking for a deep, thought-provoking movie with great cinematography, you definitely walked into the wrong screening when you picked Project X. Project X is, basically, a movie about a wild party that gets out of hand, and that is exactly what it delivers. It has some very funny moments, and there is no message that is trying to be put across. It is simply a party movie which in the end just makes you want to go to a party, it is a weird feeling to have coming out of the cinema. When I first saw this movie, the crowd was clapping during the movie, cheering at certain points, and overall it showed that the excitement from the movie seeped in to everyone, and it was a great feeling. To this day, that was the most responsive audience I have ever seen in a theater, and I strongly recommend this movie to any young person that likes partying and crude humour!",Project X

The acting is standard as expected and the characters are nothing more than any other stereotypical teen party movie nowadays. The confident nerd who thinks he gets girls but doesn't, the shy nerd whose conflicted between wanting to be popular and getting the girl who has been his best friend his whole life and then the token fat kid with the glasses. This triumvirate of characters does nothing to carry the film forward and leaves people in their seats wanting more of a story.In the end, I could speak about so much more, but please take this warning seriously, please do not see this film for the good of mankind!",Project X

Here's my answer to those people: Since when does ANY movie have to be believable or represent good morals? This is just a movie that's mindless entertainment and it has a set audience...if you are not part of that audience you are going to HATE it. There's genuinely no point to this movie other than to laugh at these people; you have to forget that nothing like this would ever happen or that everything that these kids are doing is WRONG. Yeah, of course it's wrong but then isn't that what one is paying to see? Something incredibly wrong? I know that's what I paid to see and it was worth it. I went to see this with a group of friends, which is ideal to go see this movie; you go in a group to see it and have fun, that's it. Besides, my friends and I, though in our twenties, would have loved to go to that party and not for the destruction but because for one night those kids didn't give a hoot about any of their responsibilities and let loose, which at the end of the day (and no matter what the age) we all want to do.",Project X
201,charles-simpson,Relatable and Entertaining,8,5 June 2012,"Project X is a film that, on paper, does not appeal to me at all. I predicted it to be a low budget film with some unmemorable gags and a poor plot. I was wrong. It was a surprisingly good film. The plot did, as anticipated, contain several holes and you couldn't help thinking ""surely that wouldn't have happened"" but after all it was based on a true story.The film is based on some unpopular high school students, (Thomas, Costa and JB) who throw a party when one of their parents goes away for the weekend and it quickly escalates out of control. The film is seemingly shot by their friend Dex on a portable camera and some other videos in a documentary style sequence. There is a good balance of dialogue, montages of general party mayhem and Thomas completely stressing out and the films great for watching with a few of the lads.The three of us who watched it were laughing consistently throughout the film and many of the characters were very relatable. Overall (despite being extremely far-fetched) the film was relatable, although I was hoping for a bit more development on the morning after the party.Don't watch this film if you're looking for artistic credit, watch it to be entertained. This wouldn't have been a film I would have picked out myself but after watching it I would recommend it, although not one to watch with the family.",Project X

The acting was so poor, especially at the beginning when the parents were telling their kid no to mess around while they were on their wedding anniversary. Every single dialogues was so ""parental advisory"" that the end of the movie was expectable. Besides, I didn't understand why they didn't get what was inside the dwarf after they stole it, it was so obvious...

It was funny and good at times like those two movies but unlike those movies this one got kind of over the top and a little bit stupid. In my opinion the best parts of the movie was before the party. There was some good parts at the party scenes but over the top also. My favorite scene was probably the pool scene. If your a guy you should agree. My favorite character was Costa, i love it when he would say ""Wear something tight"" i thought that was a good way to end the movie, with a laugh.

The main characters are all entirely devoid of any moral fibre and are glamorised to an outrageous level at the end of the film. By way of comparison, in The Hangover the characters are deeper (Not much, but deeper none the less) and hence there is a reason to be interested or invested, here however the three leads are painted as nothing but vacuous idiotic fools with no remorse hence it is impossible for the audience to empathise with them or be amused by their supposedly hilarious antics. Entirely flat all the way through, it would appear the makers decided gratuitous nudity and the continual shouting of inane nonsense make up for an interesting story and developed characters (Which apparently it does in the grand scheme of things since it's made close to $100million at the box office) An entirely disappointing and uninteresting waste of time and it concerns me how little thought seems to have gone into it all, perhaps no thought went into it at all, perhaps it being a fiction film is all a hoax. Maybe these people did do this and did film the results and then released their footage internationally making millions in the process and there was never any ""director"" or ""actors"" or ""producers"" just some guys being idiots. At least if that idea were true it would make me feel more at ease with the idea of this film and the film industry in general, sadly it's not, so instead I despair and simply say ""don't watch it, it's not very good""",Project X
206,itsfoz,It is what it is and when viewed as such; a great film.,8,7 March 2012,"As stated in other reviews, this film has been slated by critics. However, differing from other reviews, there is not 'quite rightly so' about it. The film is advertised completely as a film about teenagers getting themselves into all sorts of trouble over the course of just one night. Therefore, a detailed plot and character development was bound to be minimal at best. The script is as realistic as Superbad, with no 'can't-say-this-because- it-reveals-the-plot' type lines within it, and hey, how could there be, the plot's already detailed within the trailers.However, the film could have served the before party and party itself on the a plate and left it as that, but instead delivered an aftermath to the terrible yet highly entertaining events. Although the father's reaction towards the party seems highly 'unrealistic' and I understand this contradicts my statement about scripting somewhat, it is understandable that for such an event, shouting wouldn't do anything to solve the problems. The stereotypes of the three best friends were just right; the big kid, the leader of the pack, and the unsure about the consequences but will bow at the hands of peer pressure type. For three actors who spend the majority of the film drunk and on drugs, they did not exactly need to be skilled in their profession, but, with plenty of footage before the party, it is clear to see that they are fine actors and just like Jonah Hill (Superbad), will over time appear in numerous amounts of films that, apart from the odd occasion, all do very well.The end to the film is peculiar. I was not too sure whether I was supposed to be planted into a 'reality check' about what would happen after the fun partying and drink or whether it gave off the vibe that despite the fires, police involvement and fuming parents, it'll work out in the end. But equally, I don't know how this could of been clarified without making the film what it wasn't, which is a heavily thought about, stunningly plotted film. However, what it did provide, was an hour and a half of escapism from the uptight and rule filled world we live in.",Project X
207,pieter-vlekken,Good,7,13 July 2012,"Hi,Let me start off by introducing myself. I'm a 22 year old man fresh out of university. Tonight, I wanted to watch a comedy, so I checked IMDb and saw this title. I watched it without reading any reviews (except for the 6.6 score it currently has).I was surprised by the movie. If anything, it's way more realistic than superbad (I never understood what everyone thought was so great about that movie). Kids drinking? Yup. Taking drugs? Yup. Having sex? Yup. But hey, guess what. That stuff actually happens. Waving your finger and saying that's just ""a cheap way to score"" is sort of denying reality. That's how a party goes these days (ok, maybe the nudity parts were a bit over the top).The movie itself lacked any plot. Only thing there: a party getting out of hand. Only storyline besides that was the ""romance life"" of the main character (so cliché that it doesn't need any explanation).But honestly, the lack of storyline(s) didn't bother me one bit. This movie did something different, and in my humble opinion not bothering to make a storyline is still better than just making some crappy ones.Want an example of some crappy story lines? Teenage dudes ""swear to get laid before college"" and hilarity follows. These guys did want to have sex, but guess what: 17-18 year old boys just think like that. Those are called hormones. I've had my fair share of ""college/high school life comedies"" and this is the first one that looks mildly realistic, and that's quite an accomplishment.Must-see? Definitely not. But unless you go all ""OH THE CHILDREN"" you'll enjoy this movie, I did too.",Project X
208,LordRussell,Aggrivations about movies like this...,7,10 June 2012,"It's not this movie in particular. Frankly, I won't, nor can't add anything that probably hasn't already been stumbled or bumbled around already in a feeble attempt to get at what this movie 'is' to you folks reading.Basically, if you saw the commercials for the film, you get the gist. It's a Hollywood formula film on a bit more steroids update for the latest high school to post graduate crowd. It wasn't made with the intentions of garnering an academy award, so what the additional complaints are about seems to be lost on simple self loathing to me.Being a late 40s adolescent at heart, I can still find some humor in these style films & take them for what they are... their own individual form of escapism & attempt to pass on an anecdotal story of what not to do.Being a graduate of Cinematography, I'm also not a stick in feces like Ebert (who happens to be a journalist that WRITES about movies, not a film maker) who has forgotten how to rate a film on individual merit.Not everything is ""ART"". Not every story has to be intricately woven & dripping with elitist academia that takes a canonized ivy league professor of Latin to figure out the plot line. I mean, when was the last time you sat in a basic history class that didn't cure your insomnia? I'm not saying 'Project X' is art by any stretch of the imagination, but I am saying it took a lot of artistically talented people to put it together. It's just basic stuff. Anyone bemoaning about its simplicity is equally basic merely for the fact they also knew from the advertisements.Like everyone else stated... It's a ditzy, out of control, over the top situational comedy. Like the comedy writing of the film, if you go in 'wishing' the film to be more than what the adds already portray it to be... that's on you. Otherwise, if those kind of films aren't your cup of tea, simply avoid it. Visiting a sewage treatment plant & then complaining about the smell makes you an... you get the point.",Project X
209,gahbiya,Project X was off-the-chain and there was Actually a meaningful moment,10,28 July 2012,"Let me start of by saying that I am giving this movie a 10 on enjoyment factor alone. I'm not really a 1-10 rating kind of guy. I'm somewhere in between that and thumbs up or down. I believe in rating a movie based on an internal sensation and, basically, this movie made happy the entire time. I felt like I understood Thomas. He was a nice kid who never did anything wrong but was something of a disappointment to his dad because he didn't have BALLS. By the end of the movie, when his dad says, ""I can't believe you did this,"" what he means is, ""Son, you have a huge, hairy bag made of canvas with red-wood chips for pubes. And this may be the proudest moment of my life."" I honestly and truly loved that. The dad made it all worth it because he allowed Thomas to get the best of both worlds. No amount of punishment could ever take away from him what he must have felt hearing his dad, furious at what has happened to his home, open up and say that by doing the worst thing imaginable, he had exceeded his father's wildest dreams. It almost made me want to cry. Anyway, I was stoked beginning to end. The kids were delightfully goofy; the girls were TOO HOT! The nice jock with the bus of babes, he was fantastic. And let's not forget Dax. He shot that whole glorious movie by himself. What a trooper. The way intimate moments were captured without a narrative invasion of privacy was actually quite brilliant. And one last thing, this movie is not super-bad on crack. Superbad was a vehicle for Jonah Hill to be awesome and for that McLovin kid to be discovered. It was a super-fun movie, but this was a whole other experience. The trailer couldn't be more right on. Someone like me knows they're gonna love it before they even see it. Someone like the uptight chick with too much blush and her mascara brush up her --- isn't. Unless that mascara brush isn't a metaphor. 'Cause that chick would totally love this movie.

217,shockwave6464,"Loathsome, Pathetic, and Repulsive",1,3 November 2014,"Those are the three words I would use to describe this film. This movie has a basic ""humongous high school party"" plot but what was really wrong with it was the way it was put onto screen. The script has several subplots I could care less about and is filled with an unbelievable amount of unfunny, misogynist, mean spirited and crude jokes. In the course of the film, I absolutely loathed Oliver Cooper's character named Costa. He was an absolute disgusting sight on screen, him and his personality. No film character like that has made me disgusted like he has in a very long time. This film was also promoting the use of drugs and alcohol without showing it's lethal side effects. This so called ""film"" depressed me because of the fact that people actually enjoy it's mean spirited nonsense and went out of their way to pay $12.50 at their local cinemas to see immaturity and harassment put into an 88 minute film. If I could give this poor excuse of a film a 0 out of 10, I would.",Project X
218,Theater-Comments,Project Flash Bang,6,24 July 2016,"Usually I do not like movies based on real life events. Having said this, Project X is both a very enjoyable and very relatable movie. The plot is simple and not too burdened down with details that nobody needs or cares about. The acting for the most part is fine and the characters are portrayed well, with the exception of Kirby who is described as having always been a part of the group of close knit friends. I feel as though this could have been showcased a little bit more, giving more meaning to the relationship between her and Thomas that buds at the end of the movie. For those of you who have not yet seen the movie, be prepared for the beginning to drag on and on. But do not get discouraged, for the pace will pick up, very, very, dramatically. The crux of the film begins as what Thomas thinks will be a party with no more than 50 or so people, just enough to be cool, but that escalates to 1500 strangers turns into the party of the century and eventually culminates in flash-banging, both before and after the cops arrive, and even a angry drug dealer with a flamethrower. To sum up this movie goes from a crawl to warp speed craziness in what is a highly enjoyable movie that is great for a group of friends to enjoy any given weekend (as long as they don't enjoy it too much...)",Project X
219,Snoogans1080,Project X... Did that just happen?,4,4 March 2012,"Hollywood seems to be trending towards the next big POV (point of view) or ""found footage"" movie that will strike it big at the box office. With advertising claiming for this movie to be ""Superbad on Crack,"" I am sure that Project X will have no problem surpassing financial expectations. However, Project X really isn't a movie at all. Actually I don't know what it is? Is it a documentary, a music video, or a viral video that seems to go on way too long? Either way, what we are left with is an unfulfilled vision that leads audience members to ask, ""Did that just happen?""Synopsis: Not really a movie, not really good, not really bad.We meet our four main characters on the morning of Thomas's 17th birthday. Costa, Thomas's best friend, is planning a party for him while his parents are away. JB, the nerdy one of the group, just seems to be along for the ride. And Dax, our cameraman, is there to document what Costa proclaims to be ""Project X.""At first, we feel as though there is some hope for character development. There are a few funny conversations between the boys as we build up to the party; and you are looking for them to take roles in the friendship. This never really happens. When the party begins, storytelling goes out the window, and what we are left with are short clips of what is happening around the party. There must have been some sort of story in concept, but the characters actions throughout the film leave the audience despising them by the end of the film, and you just don't care what happens to them. They have no remorse for their actions, no one steps up to be a leader, and the ""love"" interest in the film is summed up as someone who has always just ""been there."" Even when there is a slight hope for Thomas to man up to the situation, he falls to Costa's level, and never reaches the ideals most audience members are expecting. (There is an awkward admiration for the results of Project X by the movies supporting characters, but it feels as though the wrong message is portrayed)For a ""movie"" to work, the audience must root for the protagonist during the second act of the film. Unfortunately, Thomas (nor his friends) have any redeeming factors, and by the end of the film, you want them to suffer for their actions. How is this possible for a major motion picture release?Now, I must say, there are some positives to the movie. The film portrays a party so epic, that you sit in your seat and wonder what it would take to get there? Short clips, bursts of audio, and talking heads create a setting that makes the audience want to throw a couple back and see what happens. That part works. But this only leaves us with a documentary for the next morning after everyone has forgotten what happened last night. It's nice in theory, but these stories are better told over breakfast.And that is Project X. You get what you pay for. The party was epic, but you hope the characters spend the rest of their lives cleaning up the mess.",Project X
220,m-loyer,Was funny.,4,12 March 2012,Being over 50 I felt rather over-aged to be watching this film but I have to admit I did laugh several times at the antics that befell these young people. I did enjoy the method of storytelling done by the director using a one camera approach. Although I do believe there were actually many more cameras used to film the entire sequence. I was disappointed to see the father's car being driven into the swimming pool. So done before. I will admit that I found the ending to be TOO-TOO over the top but that was one person's idea of writing a movie. Don't think I would watch this again but it wasn't a wasted afternoon. It was good for some laughs.,Project X

The idea has been done before but the way it was shot makes it seem like you are there enjoying it with them.The music is perfect and the over the top craziness of the party make for a great flick.Warning, you will not learn anything about yourself after seeing this movie, it is just a load of fun.",Project X

I thought I had a bite when the Russian Premier agreed to see the(can not even call it a film,) this project. But instead he felt so bad for us he agreed to dismantle his weapons if we did not send the project to his people. I can only imagine the total lack of intelligence during the focus group that green lighted this putrid waste of time. If the group was a bunch of go along with monkeys and this was an experiment I might understand the reasoning. The monkeys would be looking forward to their treat (a pay check,)for a completed project, nothing more. Fire them all, and be very happy when the project leader let the proverbial door hit him or her in the backside. What makes me such an expert you ask? I saw over 700 films last year alone. I only walked away from three (including this one,) before they completed the projection.

223,riversmichael32,"'Project X': I Know That the Kids Are Alright, but What About the Adults?",2,19 March 2012,"I had to walk out of this film. The film recycles all of the great elements from great high-school bash films, i.e. Superbad, Can't Hardly Wait, Ten Things I Hate About You, Less Than Zero, etc. However, Project X uses the hand-held camcorder approach. This approach makes the shallow characters in the film a bit too real and intimate. The film actually sort of made me feel physically sick, despite it having some funny bits.Please visit ctzine.com to read my review, ""'Project X': I Know That the Kids Are Alright, but What About the Adults?""

224,trofim-nd,That is FUN!!!,7,4 June 2012,"That is a really fun movie. So entertaining, so amusing. Yes, it might have some clichés, yes, the characters might not be analyzed in the deepest way, yes, there might be not much of a moral message, yes, some humor might not be super original, yes, it might not be completely realistic. But the movie never supposed to be any of this. If you are looking for super artistic- clever-Oscar film, you are in the wrong place. But if you are looking for great entertainment, simple laughs and easy night with friends- that stuff is for you. Makes you recall all the crazy parties you have been through )))). Whatever some people say, the 'making the movie' style of the film looks and fits great into the concept of the film. It really feels natural since I remember myself to film parties like that (well, not entirely like that, but still). Watch it, especially if you are young, watch it. It is real FUN!!!",Project X

226,Random_NN,about as interesting as 90 minutes of white noise,4,22 March 2012,"I'm having a hard time trying to find something to say about this movie.I really don't care about the moral aspects, bad behavior, crude language whatsoever. If you would hate a movie for that reason, you wouldn't really go and see a high school home party themed movie in the first place, right?But what really makes me dislike this ""movie"" is the fact that it doesn't have a plot, character development or anything like it. It is like 90 minutes of white noise. Crazy, sometimes visually appealing white noise, but nevertheless, there is just no content. It's not funny, the main characters are not really likable, and nothing really matters. Nothing that anyone says or does really has an effect outside of the scene, there is no connection between the different parts of the movie, and when it's over, you haven't seen anything but an incoherent row of scenes without meaning. And every time you start hoping for something meaningful to develop, your hopes get shattered with the next cut when the film moves on. In the context of this movie, moments with more potential to have at least some significance (for example what happens between Thomas and Kirby) can't really be taken neither seriously, nor are they at all believable.Project X is a movie that doesn't leave a lasting impression besides a strange feeling that could best be described as ""So what?"", ""Where's the point?"" or ""What now?"".4/10 for bad/no plot, character development and failing to leave an impression with the viewer.",Project X
227,yankees-rule13,"Funny, Serious, funny, then serious one more time",7,28 March 2012,"Project X was a film about party getting out of control. This is a big understatement when in fact half of the neighborhood that the party was held at was almost burnt to the ground. What was meant to be a birthday party and a fun get together happened to turn out to be the party of the century.I rated this movie so high though because I've never seen a movie like it before and I've seen plenty of them. This movie had that ""Hangover"" style of film to it. It was very funny at times of course but there were those moments that was truly shocking to see. I never thought the things that was going on in that film could possibly happen in a million years at the same party. To me, it took real imagination by the director to come up with all the ""craziness"" that took place in that 24 hour party. LMFAO was not enough to describe how much I laughed, but you should have seen the look on my face when the whole house went ablaze.",Project X

First off if your looking for a movie with a good plot and well developed characters than Project X is not for you. If your looking for a movie to go see with a group of friends and have a good time and laugh at the this may be right up your ally. But with saying that this movie is not for everyone. The type of comedy is raunchy and i mean raunchy, if your offended by a large amount of cursing or the use of the word ""fag"" then you will not enjoy this movie and should probably go see something else. I enjoyed every single minute of this, this is my kind of humor. I thought the actors portraying theses characters did a good job and were very funny. The movie may be cliché and predicable at times but I still had a very good time watching it and so did my friends and the entire theater. This is the type of movie that is better with a crowd of people. After the movie was over I was very hyped to throw a party like that and I'm not the type of person who does that kind of stuff, and I could also hear many of people saying the same thing. In the end Project X was enjoyable, and hilarious from beginning to end but not for everyone.",Project X

It incorporates hilarious scenes that are made believable by the documentary-style camera shots. However this movie will most definitely appeal mostly to the college and high school students and guys at that. The level of nudity is intense so definitely a just friends kind of movie. The comedic content however is reminiscent of hangover in the crazy drunken antics that take place and superbad's emphasis on getting the girl however it is perfectly executed and wont leave a willing audience disappointed. Laughs were a plenty and I highly recommend a trip to the theater to watch. Had me rolling in my chair and will leave you wondering how come you never went to a party like this.,Project X

233,neilashwinshah,Project X... Legendary,8,2 March 2012,"I will not explain to you, readers, what the movie is about. Nor will I include any type of spoiler in the following text. But, in my opinion, there has not been enough hype for this movie's release. In fact, there has been some negative attitude towards the movie altogether. Such reviews (Tom Charity) have been complaining that ""Project X"" is a ""wasted opportunity"" or it is a seen-it-before movie that includes the debauchery and insanity of a hormonally-charged, alcohol-driven group of teenagers. Well, I disagree! Although it may be predictable based on context that is spoon-fed to the audience in the films initial minutes, that is not the point of this movie. In my mind at least, I believe the director was trying to accomplish a atmosphere that not only makes the audience wish they were present during the making of the film but sends them into a spiraling daze of pure happiness. Of course this film is not being commended for its originality or cinematography, but in no way did it set out to do those things in the first place. Movies, like this one, are meant to be enjoyed for their ability to transport you to the very place they are trying to portray. To make you wish you could experience that lifestyle because it is just so damn ridiculous. Nowadays, you can really find any movie you want somewhere online or by downloading it from some torrent. The real challenge is to get people to the theater and to have them pay money to see footage on an incredibly large screen. People go to the movies for the cinematic experience and the sheer grandiosity of the film. This film captured that essence and it did it well. Basically, if you walked out of the theater smiling-- not because you were moved, emotionally enlightened, or intellectually stimulated, but because in your head you were thinking about how ""epic"" you wanted your night to be after leaving the theater or how large of a party you would have to throw in order to generate that much buzz-- then I believe this movie did exactly what it intended to do.",Project X

You have to take into consideration the fact that these critics were probably highly unpopular in high school and therefore does not know what it's like to loosen up and have fun. Critics have also mentioned the nudity, irresponsibility and rampant sexism in their reviews as being the selling point of the movie. For all i know is that behind the keyboard of the person writing the review is a lonely man/woman who hasn't got action in the last 10 years. This is a definite must watch movie!

It's such a different film and I think that's why it appeals, it isn't your standard party gone wrong film. The way its filmed from loads of different cameras and the humor in it is very funny.I found myself cringing when stuff was going wrong as you feel as if you're at the party!

It was produced for your ENTERTAINMENT, kind of like a novel--a medium to escape from reality. Reading too much into this movie and taking too many things literally will destroy your experience.Next, DO NOT GO INTO THIS MOVIE EXPECTING AN 'INCEPTION' TYPE MOVIE that makes you think and has twists and turns. (Did you not watch the trailer? It's a 2 hour movie about one huge party.)-Once you take in these two ideas above this line, you will definitely enjoy this movie-MY REVIEW:Project X is a GREAT film! Put together like a piece of artThe soundtrack is on point. I loved Pursuit of Happiness (Steve Aoki Remix). HAM by Kanye West and Jay-Z was perfection when it came on. Closing the movie with Intro by The XX left me with an epic vibe;The actors are HYSTERICAL. I loved Costa and the two young security guards. These guys made the movie for me, lol.Cleverly-used transitioning moved the story forward fluidly. Also, it is one of very few movies that made the hand-held camera effect work, and actually used it for its advantages;Very entertaining. I was on the edge of my seat the whole entire time, never, ever bored... Oh, and the girls are HOT!If you want to look deeper into this movie--you can. When I did, I found that Project X is just a modern-day Dazed and Confused.Dazed and Confused was set in the 1970s, when having fun was all about chilling out and feeling good. In contrast, Project X shows modern-day teenagers and what their idea of what having a good time is--RAGING, being stupid, and acting a fool.Also, like in Dazed and Confused, today, kids aren't worried about work, or even school, really. The only thing they really care about is fitting in. When three loser, high school kids seize an opportunity to become popular, they do not care for repercussions, just so long as they're noticed by their peers.Art should reflect the people and the lives in its time. Project X represents us and our time.10/10 for throwing the ultimate party... and to make up for the trolls.",Project X

But now they're grown and gone so my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this crazy comedy. It follows the sure fire comedic formula ; Take reality and push it to a ridiculous extreme and it rarely fails to entertain. Project X falls into the same silly company as the ""Vacation"" trilogy, ""Porky's"", ""The Hangover"", etc. Just be aware that it is extremely raunchy, but it is also extremely funny. This movie serves to make the viewer almost uncomfortable to watch this Greek-like tragedy unfolding before his very eyes. You're constantly thinking ""How in the Hell can you be so freakin' stupid, kid?"" And when you believe they've finally reached their height of ignorance, they get even worse, until they finally activate the proverbial ""launch sequence"" that cannot be reversed.

After you're finished watching it you'll properly be sad that you haven't been at party like that, but at least you'll have some new ideas for your next party :P The reason this ain't a 10/10? the same reason as hangovers: Great entertainment, but thats about all the movie offers.",Project X

It starts all peacefull,and well... go see the rest yourself ^^.The music, acting, chicks, explosions and humour, one big roller-coaster from beginning to end! No story, no plots nothing really. It's a movie about something which can be done in reality, and we would all dream of to experience, but never really will because it's crazy as hell. And that is what blows you away.So you either love it or you don't.

246,daniel-martinez-912,Shaky camera = Migraine!,2,13 March 2012,"OK seriously, I thought the shaky camera was bad because perhaps I sat too close to the screen. So I sit near the back and I still got a migraine trying to watch this! A damn shaky camera the entire time for me was too much. I only got through about a quarter of the movie before I almost puked at how nauseated I was. I seriously want my money back but by then the Ticket office closed. I recommend a DVD viewing because the camera was so shaky I left the theater! Other than that from what I saw, this movie just seemed like a movie for Freshman aged kids in high school. Anyone older than that knows that a party like this isn't the best a party there can be in real life anyway. It wasn't really too funny and I guess the best part were nudity scenes. The party sucked and I'm glad I wasn't invited.",Project X

Now don't mistake my praise for say this I a great movie, It has close to no character development and kind of a shallow plot that we've seen before in films like American Pie and Superbad, But like Superbad it is one of the most entertaining movies out right now. If you love Dumb funny films I don't really know why your reading this you've probably already seen this. If your an Oscar guy or a movie realist then You may not enjoy this film. I give this Movie a C. I suggest you bring friends to this movie because this is a film to see with a lot of people.",Project X
248,henry-305-493692,The real 'Facebook - The Movie',5,29 February 2012,"I'm still trying to figure out why this film left such a weird taste in my mouth. It's odd, coming out of a film and having NOTHING to say about it. Possibly, it's because almost nothing happens. They throw a party. It goes bananas. Stuff gets set on fire. Nothing you can't divine from the trailer.It took me a while to realize why. There was a gaping whole at the center of this film. The message - nothing really matters, everyone should do whatever it takes to be cool, skinny, popular, etc. And there are no consequences. Self-destruction presented as empowerment.This is nothing new, and I'm too young to be seriously offended by this sentiment, but Project X takes it to a higher pitch than ever before. It's like watching a stream of Facebook threads, links and comments fly past for 90 minutes. Intercut with whoops and heavy bass-lines. It doesn't feel like a music video. It is a music video. And about as satisfying.It's made in the image of John Hughes films, updated for the Ritalin generation, but it moves too fast. I found myself wanting to say 'How about that scene where ... ' but realized that there were no scenes I found funny enough to bother recounting.I know how this all sounds. Like a hater. But it's not. I just didn't care. There was nothing to care about. Nothing I hadn't seen in a dozen music videos a dozen times, but now, with a couple of fat kids thrown in. The only thing that leaves me wincing is the overtness of the film's nihilism. Screw everything. And everyone. This is the image of themselves these Socal kids are getting presented with. If it plays well at the box office - which it will, and nothing I can say will change that - it's the kind of thing we'll see more of. And more of. And more of. The same thing. Over. And over.

I personally loved the movie, and everyone in the movie theater seemed to love it too from all of the laughs I was hearing throughout the movie. Project X is pretty much the party that every high school and college student wants to go to--fun, crazy, and definitely unforgettable. It's just one of those movies that's meant to make you laugh, nothing too serious. Don't criticize the movie too much. I mean, yeah, I can see why some parents are outraged by the profanity, nudity, and overall morality of the movie. But hey, this is what adolescence is like nowadays. It doesn't have a wonderful moral of the story or great actors... But I do think you should just enjoy it and laugh at it because after all, it's just entertainment!",Project X
250,bweiss213,Worst Movie Ever,1,2 March 2012,"It pains me to even give this movie 1 star. During the first 5 minutes, I wanted to walk out of the theater. I should have trusted my instincts. I am not against movies of this genre, and I knew I wasn't viewing a future Oscar-winner when I walked in, but this was predictable and trite in every way. Even if the subject matter (high schoolers throwing a party when the parents go out of town), has been done before, there could have been an attempt at a plot, but there was not. Project X is unrealistic, sexist, and slightly anti-Semitic. In addition, it's expected for movies of this caliber to make alcohol and marijuana seem cool, but the casual use of ecstasy in the film takes it too far. At one point of the movie, I thought perhaps this was only funny for high schoolers, but I would never want a high schooler to see this and receive a message that if you take ecstasy you will have a great night and no matter how much trouble you get in, the fun you had will be worth it. This is therefore a failure for all age groups. At least I thought I would laugh, even if the plot is lacking, but I was mistaken. This is a cinematic waste, and it makes me cringe to think of the money that goes into actors, writers, camera crews, props, and the set for this movie, which is a hemorrhoid on the butt of society. During the film, I kept trying to think of a worse movie I have seen in my lifetime, but absolutely none come to mind. I would rather douse myself in syrup and sit on an anthill than ever see this film again. It is truly upsetting that the future politicians of America are sitting in movie theaters laughing at this monstrosity.",Project X

If you take this movie on face value - a humorous pure popcorn movie with no hidden meanings to teach you the values of life, it's pretty good. I don't see why it's getting bashed because for what it is, it was entertaining and funny. Before you go in to see this movie ask yourself what exactly you want to get out of it, if it's 1 hour and 20 minutes of mindless entertainment, then you're set. If, however you feel Project X will leave you pondering life and everything around you, this movie is not for you.

253,Lucien1992,Greatest. Party. Movie. Ever.,10,4 March 2012,"This movie is not original. It is not thought provoking. It's not well written. Hell, it doesn't even have a plot. However, Project X takes everything young people loved about movies like Superbad, The Hangover, Animal House, Van Wilder and the like, and it blends it all together brilliantly, to the point where you actually feel as though you're at the party. The character formula is basically Superbad 2.0. Costa is like Jonah Hill's character, but even louder, more foul and crazier. Thomas is the sensible one, much like Michael Cera. JB is Fat Mclovin. That's about as deep as it gets for characters. There is very little character development. Costa becomes a little more sensitive to Thomas' problems at the end, and Thomas acknowledges his 'female best friend' as a lover in the end, but that's about as far as character development goes. Oh, and JB gets some booty. That is it. The real fun comes from the actual party and the true host: Costa. The guy is hilarious and makes all of the negative aspects of American culture something to laugh at. He's loud, rude, crude and obnoxious. The movie is shot in such a way as to make you feel as though you are really at the party. I read some reviews from people that stated they did not feel they were at the party. I personally got sucked right into it. The soundtrack was brilliant and created a real party atmosphere. And boy, if you like breasts, you are in luck because this movie has plenty.The antagonist is an alcoholic neighbour named Rob, and the movie does a good job making him look like a d-bag. Even though he is right when he confronts them about shutting down the party, and the kids really should have kept the noise down, you still hate him for some reason. I suppose this movie represents that innate teenage rebellion, and Rob represents authority. As such you're forced to choose a side. If you're under the age of about 21 you will probably choose teenage rebellion. I, a 19 year old, surely did. What I love most about this movie though is how unrealistic it is. I doubt a party this big could ever last as long as this one does. Police would be there so fast it wouldn't be able to get past 300 people. I've never been a raver, but I've been to and thrown house parties, and this movie takes my small shindigs with 20-30 people and multiplies it by a thousand. The kids never face appropriate justice. If you're hoping to take your kids to see this to show them the negative consequences behind disobeying authority and disturbing the peace, don't take them to see this. There is no moral other than: never throw a crazy party at your house. Even that is kind of muddled, because while the house is wrecked, you leave the theatre with a sense of, ""it was worth it."" Thomas' father doesn't even beat him, which would have been more realistic (Just me?). All in all, project X is a very memorable experience. I would like to watch it again soon, but I have a feeling it will lose some of its glamour upon a second viewing. I had a lot of fun watching this in the theatre and recommend it to anyone who enjoys teenage rebellion, good tunes, scantily clad females, and laughing at ridiculousness. If you enjoyed Superbad, you will probably like this, as long as you don't put too much emphasis on a plot. *Side note, before i forget: This movie took something from Animal House that i noticed right away: at the end of the film, the fates of the main characters are revealed on screen via text narration (much like in Animal House). The birthday boy, Thomas, is said to have been voted ""most likely to succeed by his peers."" This reminded me so much of Animal House, how Bluto grows up to become a US senator. Just thought I'd throw that out there.",Project X
254,ttimbers17,"""Epic"" fail",5,4 March 2012,"If you plan on seeing Project X, don't. The catch phrase on the commercial was ""if super bad and the hangover had a baby project x would be the baby"" I guess if the kid was handicapped (no offense)they wouldn't be far from the truth. Long story short three kids, on the lower end of the social scale decide to throw an ""Epic"" party(that word is so trendy it makes me sick) to become popular. One is over weight, sorry don't try and do the Jonah Hill thing again, one over weight stereotypical Jewish kid is enough for our entertaining pleasure, and the other two are just average everyday kids. It ends up being completely unrealistic and predictable like the director had a list of popular check points to meet from every other high school comedy and one by one tried to meet them all. The party is held in some where ville California, complete and total suburbia and they throw this insane party. Which I must say was semi entertaining. It involved booze, sex, 100 person beer bong, midgets(sorry, little people) in the oven, don't worry it wasn't on and a lot of boobs. Which normally i'd be pretty excited about(about the boobs not the midget) but the premise of the movie is set in high school. So one side of my brain is telling me come on, you know they have to be 18 to show their breasts in a movie and the other side of my brain is saying ""you sick fuxk they could be 15."" So if you're in the mood to be mildly entertained and not have to think for a hour and a half and also walk away feeling like a man with a white van and creepy mustache Project X is right up your alley otherwise save your ten bucks or go see that new Dr Suess movie because a children's book would be more fulfilling than this.",Project X

There's nothing the director held back from he showed exzactly what happens at a high school/college party alcohol,drugs,sex he was not afraid to show anything in the movie. As a freshman in college i can relate to those ridiculous parties you'll never forget.When watching the movie you cant help to just be like ""wowww I would do anything to be there"" If you are a college kid or teenager you and like to party you will love this movie.This movie is by far one of my favorite moviesAlso the soundtrack was amazing, they were the perfect party songs i wouldn't doubt it if the writers went to constant parties for 3 weeks before writing the movies",Project X
256,bartthepimp,Really? Bashing a party movie for being a party movie?,10,5 March 2012,"As had been previously stated, what the hell did you expect out of a party movie that was made up of very new or inexperienced actors? There wasn't supposed to be in depth detail as to what was going to go on. Have a party was it. It was simple. Simplicity isn't a bad thing. Why do most of you have to take this movie up and try to give it some deep, intellectual meaning? My God. This movie is exactly what most parties are like or what people wish they could be like. The guys want to get recognized and become something out of this. You can't honestly tell me you weren't a little like the main character Thomas in your life. I related to him. I wanted to get known just as much as he did, and so did everyone else in this world. We were all envious/jealous at some point in high school. This dream has obviously been crushed by the rules set up by the world to live a strict life. If you have never just wanted to break loose, you're not normal. Also, for those of you saying it was somehow giving kids a message to ""do drugs"", why are you surprised? Most kids nowadays do all of that stuff. There is no need to jump the bandwagon and ignore the fact that they do it almost every damn day. Also, the main characters were guys. What do you expect of hormonally charged males other than wanting to have sex. Just stop trying to get so analytical with the movie, back up, and see the whole, not just small pieces.

The funniest part is the old guy that pops in to play beer games!!I highly recommend this movie for great laughs! This is instant junk food for the brain with instant humor you don't have to sit and think about. When I went to the theaters to see this, everyone leaving wanted to stay and watch the next show time.

258,whiteknight_ex,One for our Generation,10,6 March 2012,"OK, so if you're like me you can get easily distracted, all I wanted was to look up some of the music from the movie and I suddenly was overwhelmed with reviews for Project-X. So let me set the record straight for those of you who are thinking about seeing the movie or are thinking about it now after seeing it. Project-X is not about deep, intrinsic themes, archetypical symbolism, or anything that would make it a literary masterpiece. I say...good...we have enough of those. Project-X is simply about partying...and doing it until you're all partied out. It's about being young, being stupid, and most of all, realizing that you don't have a whole lot of time left to be like this. We all grow up, and unfortunately we spend too much of our time focusing on the future and we miss the present. Project-X aims to remind our youth of our responsibility to live before we need to actually be responsible. Our society is driving its kids to a point of psychological disparity. We put kids into AP classes, tell them to prepare for SATs or ACTs so that they can go on and learn at an even more intensive level. There comes a point where we loose our youth, it is inevitable, but why must it be lost so soon? Every generation deserves its right to let loose, Project-X reminds us of this. The overwhelming number of reviews out there are a testament to the cold standard that we as a society place on our youth. Reviews mock Project-X, claiming that it's a worthless excuse for a ridiculous generation's behavior, that it adds to the decline of Western Civilization. For all the professional movie critics out there, seriously...get over yourselves. This isn't a movie to be analyzed for in-depth character development, satire, irony, or intricate metaphors, it is a reminder. Project-X reminds our youth that they are young for a reason, not simply for anatomy's sake, but for the sake of living and learning. There will come a time in everyone's life where they need to realize that they've grown up, they'll need to put away those remixes, fold up the beer pong table, and only drink from Solo cups at company picnics. But until then, we need our youth, to experiment, to learn, to grow...without this time to make mistakes how will we ever know who we are, or what we are made of?",Project X

It's for teens to experience the party they've always wanted, but will never have. I almost didn't see this movie because of the negative reviews, but was convinced by some friends it would be time well spent. And they were right! This movie tells the story of a Thomas's (Thomas Mann) epic birthday house party his friends throw for him, which quickly spirals out of control. And it's awesome! It actually flows well, with a good set up, good rising action, conflict, and falling action. Plus it's funny! Kosta's character (Oliver Cooper) will keep you laughing throughout the movie.

This movie is geared toward the 15-25ish age group. If you are not in that group, I don't expect you to find it as epic as us teens do. Yes, I am 18, I don't party, but that movie was incredible. I have already seen it 2x. Yes, I agree it is similar to The Hangover and Superbad, but aren't all movies similar to another in this day? There was so much hype for Avatar, and it was the same story line as Pocahontas and Dances with Wolves. I'm just saying, if you aren't in the age range this movie is aimed at, then stop complaining!

It was fun to watch and really get to know the characters. My friends and I were able to associate ourselves with the main characters. I highly recommend this movie if you are looking for a laugh out loud comedy. I think this movie could be similar to brides maids. The reason for my rating is that there were a few ""uncomfortable"" moments but the stunts and attitudes of the characters are what made the film. I guess another reason why I liked it is because Project X is the first rated R movie I've seen without my parents. Laughter is the spice of life!",Project X
262,hottfuegos,Just an out of control party,7,14 March 2012,"like many have said before me, if you are going into this movie expecting some potential Oscar material you will be sadly disappointed. The best way to approach this movie is to not expect anything at all but a bit of over the top entertainment provided by an out of control high school party. If you are too old to remember the days when you were in high school and attended a party that seemed to get a little bit crazy, I would not watch this movie. I think you need to have had some kind of crazy party experience in the past in order to take that event in your mind and multiply it by 100 times. But you won't HAVE to create that scenario in your head, because that is exactly what project X does for you. There really is not much of a story. But that being said, there are some theatrical elements that will set up for scenes later in the movie. So in that respect there is a sort of a story line and a decent attempt at unfolding events. The characters aren't THAT bad. There is some character establishment although they may not be entirely likable. While they do establish the characters, there is not much development. Right from the beginning of the movie you get a good sense of the characters and that is what you can expect the whole movie. I didn't think the secondary characters are too horrible either. The 12 year old security guards, an angry midget and the angry drug dealer all create for some great mind numbing entertainment. Basically if you are over the age of 35 MAX, depending how young hearted you are. Or if you can't recall a crazy high school or college party experience to relate to, I would not recommend this movie. People are going to talk trash on this movie, because they were expecting something more upon going to see this. DON'T! Some people ask a lot out of movies. They need plot twists and turns surprises and thrills. This movie does contain some of that but in a dumbed down, mind numbing fashion. So don't expect anything other than some wild, over-the-top, epic party experience of the century and you should be OK.",Project X
263,gabyrulez,"Not bad, not great.",7,17 March 2012,"First off, this movie was not 'horrible', nor was it 'awesome'. As opposed to what most people are stating.I would like to start by saying that if you are stating that this movie is bad because of its lack of ethical value or moral lesson. Yes, it does in a way support the idea a of a reckless and unlikely favorable form of decision making; with it having drugs, alcohol, excessive nudity and violence. But, it's also true that it's just a movie! And not all movies aim for the title of 'Ethical Movie of the Year'; some just look to convey pure entertainment. That being said, entertainment, obviously, isn't perceived the same way by everyone. Personally, I found it funny and exciting. Someone of a more serious mental state might just see at as vulgar and disgusting.I strongly disagree with the people who say it's 'pure gold'. Previously, I stated that the movie is devoid in ethical manners. This is essential for a movie to be considered to be at such great heights. However, I realize that children and SOME adolescents would be influenced by this movie, I find it to be a trivial effect. It would be impossible to reenact such a feat, such as throwing a party like they did in the movie. Other than that, some scenes were actually extremely perverted and repeatedly disturbing. This does not ruin the movie's effect, though it does give the joy one gets out of it a sense of lag. If you are unbelievably immature you will fall in love with this movie and call it your favorite movie ever.That being said, it all comes down to 2 primordial facts. This movie provides an aura of entertainment that can be viewed from a critical eye as effectively set, for it's selective audience. This audience, is of course, a fun and fairly young audience; though in some cases, older adults could appeal to it. It entertains, and excites one's feelings. It's idea is not to explicitly portray drugs, alcohol, nudity and recklessness as a good thing, but it does imply it, unwillingly. Some might see it as innocent and unrealistically fun, others might see it as something to look forward to and try out.The movie is enjoyable as long as you keep your mind open, and just try to have a good time.",Project X
264,kriscreed91,Not a movie,4,22 March 2012,"Lazy. This movie, if you could call it that, is running off past successes in the same style such as Chronicle and Cloverfield. The difference between this movie and past ""shaky cam"" movies is that this has no plot. At the box office all you receive is a ticket to view a party. I don't go to the movies to see a party, I go to see some sort of coherent narrative, with action, or drama, or comedy. This movie was marketed as a comedy. I didn't see it. Nobody in my cinema laughed. If this movie had a genre I would say it is False Drama. The movie makes it look like something bad will happen, and while bad things happen, there is absolutely no consequences. The characters are bland and uninteresting, with no drive or belief in what they are doing themselves. I mean if the guy doesn't want to have a party, he should really just not have a party. There is no character development, no story and no comedy. What I will commend is that this party was realistic. The film really captured what a group of teenagers would act like if they were given complete reign and they had no fear of consequences.

EVER!,9,26 March 2012,"Well... 3 weeks has past since watching this awesome film and i can tell you i still have adrenaline rushing through me it was that wild! Me and my mates practically came out of the cinema high! This film did not disappoint me at all, the plot, the characters and the comedy in the film was brilliant to watch. Yeah sure it was only 90 minutes and yeah it had unrealistic scenes but its a film, the message was simply pointing that anything can be possible once you change your game face. Most of the scenes were realistic in a unique humorous kind of way. The actors fitted the characters perfectly, all though i would like to see more of JB's humour. The reason why i rate this a 9/10 is because even though it looked like a long music video, the vibe and intensity is what brought the film to its high standards in my view. Its mainly pointed towards a 15-19 year old target audience that has been well established with in the film. I love a film that has many twists and funny dilemmas and this film contained a lot of that. If you have watched The Hangover, i don't know whether anyone else would agree with me but i really wanted to see the footage of what happened when they got completely hammered. Well project X did that for me but form a teenagers perspective. Thats why the makers of the Hangover were perfect to create this wild film. Personally, the thing that made the experience more amazing for me is that it was me and two of my best of mates managed to watch this film on our own which was amazing. I consider this to anyone who loves to party and live their life wild. This will become a great inspiration to anyone.",Project X
267,Xewie,A party you wish to attend in real life,9,4 April 2012,"Basically if one watches the trailer of this film one should already know what to expect because it is pretty much there bright and clear. The hate this film is getting is undeserved and mostly is probably coming from very conservative people and those who were dull enough to look for a real message.Looking for a film that will make you think and and will make you puzzle for some time about your life? You won't find it. On the other hand if you are looking for a film in which you wanna see a mindless party, which you would very much wish to attend, than you are at the right place.The film has many cliché elements. California, high school & college students, nice and rich LA neighborhood, the typical ""red cup party"" feeling and quite a few more, but the film has these in a good way in my opinion. It has a decent number of funny moments (especially the ones with the security guards) and lots of party footage to keep you entertained for a little less than 90 minutes. The main characters could have had more in them, and I felt they were lacking something, although that might not even be important because the film is really all about the party. The only edgy thing to me was the ending. It seemed stupid and quite light headed knowing that they basically half-destroyed a neighborhood. I'll let this one slip because the film had no meaning in the first place and no life lesson teaching intentions anyway.To round it up, this film is what it is and doesn't want to be more. You sit in the movie theater, buy popcorn and soda, sit down and expect to be entertained and the movie does deliver it. Don't be too surprised if you feel like you want to go to a house party the day you watch the film on.",Project X

I just watched it, laughed out loud, and generally wished I was at this party. There were hot girls, booze, drugs, and hilarity. And while the one meaningful relationship is underdeveloped, who cares. There are still a few scenes of tenderness that we can relate to. I really liked it and enjoyed it.edit: so apparently this isn't long enough for IMDb's standards. I wanted to keep it short and snappy because I hate reading long reviews where the reviewer just ends up talking about himself. So I'll give it a shot.After I watched this movie I started thinking about what would happen if it happened in real life. It's tough to spoil this movie because there is really no plot (which I think is really pissing off all the movie connoisseurs, which is actually absurd, but I digress). The kid would obviously face criminal charges, and his parents might even be in more trouble if he is a minor. I'm not a lawyer, but I'm thinking about this on a larger scale. Why does society need to condemn this behavior? To me, I see a bunch of happy, excited teenagers, having a ball and f***ing each other. AFAIK nobody gets hurt. They may have been mean to one guy (no spoilers), but he had it coming, and he eventually hurts everyone else. And then there's the dog, but he/she turns out fine. Then there's the property damage. My point is, everything that happened could be fine as long as everyone is willing to have the right attitude about it. Perhaps all the perpetrators should have to commit to cleaning up their mess as punishment. But why, in our society, do we shun this behavior. Like I said, it just seems like a bunch of young people having the time of their lives. For all the pyrotechnics and debauchery, all it really is is a little sneeze in a stuffy neighborhood on a massive planet of people. Sorry to the working folks who didn't sleep much that night. But maybe they should rally behind the spirit of these kids. Because they sure have it. Anyways, this movie put a smile on my face.",Project X
269,ecaterinanepoliuc,What a great party!!!,10,8 May 2013,"I actually loved this movie!It's not your Oscar/life changing go-to movie,yet I liked the way they filmed it,the main actor was likable,but not over the top which fit well in the story!It showed the proportions of the disaster in the right moments and you could feel the party getting hot under the accompaniment of an AWESOME SOUNDTRACK!!!That being said i understand the criticism in it's address from a moral point of view(the degrading behaviour,obscene language),but it reflects very well the present as we are the children of social networks,gadgets and booze,which can make you more ""friends"" in one night than one needs in a lifetime!I had no expectations when decided to watch it,but by the end I caught myself high on the atmosphere that was transcending through the screen,all I wanted was to PARTY(and i never do)!!!",Project X
270,rjodrey1,What did all you expect?!,7,27 June 2012,"I'm not by any means going to state that this film is a ""must see"" or a classic; however after reading a few of the earlier negative reviews (which I finally just stopped due to annoyance) that went on & on reestablishing the negative stereotypes this feeds young kids, the unbelievable events that unfold throughout the movie that could never happen in real life (trying not to spoil), the (lack there of) weak plot, etc, etc, ETC!! OF COURSE all these things are all outlandish, over the top & unbelievable; & if you truly think this type of a movie containing the mature subject matter will affect its young potential viewers...give me a break.Going into this movie I fully expected an adrenaline filled, 90 min - balls to the wall, over the top flick, that wouldn't change my life's perspective in some way from before I sat down & watched; instead I got exactly what I thought it would be: a fun flick that was nothing more & nothing less. Maybe not for everyone? I'd say maybe not for anyone over the age of 40 or younger than 18.",Project X
271,colaco-loveson23,awesome movie,10,27 June 2012,"the movie is so good.... the party...\m/\m/... that it made me sign up.. to IMDb And write that ""THIS MOVIE/PARTY IS AWESOME..!!!!""... \m/this next part of the review is not mine so don't read it.. ""Project X isn't so much hilarious as it is entertaining. This movie will really appeal those who can relate to the plot somewhat. As an 18 year old that has thrown parties when my parents were away the film struck a chord with me. I could feel the main character Thomas's anxiety when he realized he had no control over his house and that's why I feel many teenagers and even those in their early 20's would really relate to this film.Project X might not be worth 10 dollars to see it in the movie theater but if you go with a good group of friends the 10 dollar ticket will seem more than worth it. I really enjoyed the film for personal reasons but I can see a lot of movie goers detesting it. 10/10""",Project X
272,connormchristie,Very Entertaining,8,7 July 2012,"What people need to realize is this movie IS aimed at a particular demographic. That demographic being from about 16-24. The reason this movie is not being being rated very well is due to the age of people rating it. It loosely follows the story of Corey Worthington who had a house party go wrong, which goes to show the majority of the events taking place in this movie do happen. As a 19 year old, this movie really appealed to me because they really get the attitudes of the kids bang on. Yes it does get a bit ostentatious at the end but throughout the film I was sitting watching with a smile on my face really enjoying these kids having fun at a house party. Older people may view it as cliché, I can't understand whats wrong with that as the style of the movie is documentation. It shows the events that happen at a certain house party, yes one that gets out of control, but at the end of the day a really accurate portrayal of how it can easily veer towards that due to the rapid broadcasting available to people now through the internet.The rating doesn't do it justice! Great film!",Project X
273,jeffronchetti,Quality Movie,9,14 July 2012,"Project X is a quality movie. Now reading this you may think I'm an idiot, but let me define quality for you. Quality- something that may be a tad unrealistic but completely 100% awesome. something fun to watch with friends, or even a significant other. Now that you know what I mean by ""quality"" I'm sure plenty of you will agree with me. This movie is NOT a good movie to watch with adults. Adults look at this movie as a disgrace and just a flat out awful movie. I mean if you are rating the movie on character/plot development, then yes this is no a good movie. If you are looking for a movie with good character progression, along with plot development do not watch this movie. But if you are just looking for a good time, and some good laughs, then I highly recommend that you watch this movie.",Project X
274,jvltx,"Nonsense , but fun.",6,18 July 2012,"I liked this movie because i didn't expected too much of it. Another found-footage comedy movie, you can't expect too much at all. The characters aren't very appealing and one of them is really, really annoying. I'm talking about Costa (Oliver Cooper), i bet you'll hate him too when you finish watching the movie. But as a whole the movie is fun! I think it's a dream of almost all teenagers to throw or frequent a party like the one shown in the movie. It's just drugs , sex and music all the way. Don't expect profundity in the story or the screenplay but both are a good foundation for the craziness that's seen all over the movie. This is a movie to watch with a bottle of beer next to you and preferable with some friends too. I bet it will be a fun watch.",Project X
275,mattbyers2011,American Pie POV,10,22 July 2012,"I wasn't expecting much when I watched this film, I'd heard the hype but I assumed it was going to be just another teen movie. I gave it a watch today and I'm glad that I did. For all of you that like American pie as do I, imagine a film that shows you the bits that you don't see in American pie. Well this is it, I'm from england and I've hosted some parties in my time but this film is the real deal. I have not seen the criticism this movie has received but I can say that they need to lighten up, this is a well made film which will get you in the mood to be a teen again and enjoy life. We were all young once, and this film brings back those crazy times in an epic way that everyone can appreciate, it has some controversial issues for you older Americans that do not appreciate these house parties, but it is a very good capture of what they can be. Sit back, relax have a beer and appreciate the fact that this is the best POV movie that has come out for a long time.",Project X
276,vietquocp,what kind of movie is this ?,1,28 July 2012,"OK, what do we learn from watching crappy movie like this ? To be honest, if 10% of the teenagers in the US behave like this, i wouldn't be surprise if your country go through another crisis in the near future. First, why do you set up a party AT YOUR OWN HOUSE ? people are gonna steal things, break your stuff, have sex in your bed room and your parents are gonna pay for all those things. You do that just to make yourself become famous at school ? what a pathetic little life you have. Secondly, to succeed, you have to STUDY, not PARTY. Is it really that hard to realize ? Finally, this movie is completely pointless, don't waste your time because you'll learn nothing from this. now i'm sad because IMDb won't let me rate this ""movie"" 0/10",Project X

Right from the getgo I was thinking I wish I woulda known it was one of these cuz I never woulda rented it. The friend that opens the movie looks like he is an old Jewish 35 year old...he is more like the protagonist's pervert uncle. Not to mention how rude they were to the old checkout lady. Then they go to some run down ""neighborhood"" for pot? really? That is so available anywhere, then of course they have to steal from him and their obviously new vehicle almost doesn't start. I really can't get over how old and face lined this Jewish sweater vest guy is. He shouldn't be in anything for him under 30...This movie was HORRIBLE save your money. I can't believe I rented this piece of garbage that was falsely marketed.",Project X
278,imcool-rohan22,8/10,10,2 November 2014,It's a movie for those people who are caught in their daily mechanical lifestyles and need to live rather than survive. For those who like to have a good time with their friends will have a good time watching this movie. The soundtracks will catch the ears of people who are into electronic music .Although it has received a lot of hate from many for the sexual content and drug use in the end it is the viewers choice to not be stereotypical and associate partying and having a good times with drugs or alcohol. It is a movie that you will enjoy watching more with friends than yourself alone. After all every person has his own choice and liking. Still i would like you to give this movie a try and watch it with an open mind.,Project X
279,fxKingz,"Breaks all the unofficial rules, in an incredibly funny way",10,15 December 2012,"This movie definitely is not something for everybody out there. However, I judge movies by how they appeal to the viewer, and because it is clear to everybody that this movie is aiming to be viewed by party people, I'm gonna judge this movie out of that perspective, which is easy since I am still a teen.The risk the directors took with this movie is that a large amount of it doesn't have a lot of plot. While in other similar movies such as ""Hangover"" there's build ups and climaxes, this movie has them too, but they aren't very noticeable and not the main subject of the film. However that lead the directors to make sure that the viewer would be entertained in another way: by making the party go harder and harder continuously. And that's exactly what's so awesome about this movie: it pictures the party of a life. Watching this movie will make you want to empty your bank account, use the money to buy every bottle of vodka or beer in the city, and party like the world is ending the next day.No matter how hard you've partied before, this movie will easily make any party you've been to look like a tea party of a couple of elder women.My point is, this isn't a movie, this is a party with some plot to it brought into cinemas, and the actors act perfectly, not necessarly because they act out being drunk and partying hard well, but because on set they actually were drunk and partying hard.All in one I love this movie and I can highly recommend this to any person who likes parties.",Project X
280,keanu1999-569-879150,party that goes wrong,10,30 December 2012,"i think this film was the best film of 2012. when you watch this film you fell like you was at the party. The film has a really good felling to it when you leave the cinema or when you watch it at home. The music in the film is very good and entertaining. I wouldn't watch this film with your parents as it can be really awkward when watching it as it contains bad language, sex and drug. This film is more for young adults and teens as they would enjoy much more.Everyone watch this film if you enjoy comedy's because it is one best films ever made. Also the director who made this film made the hangover 1,2 and 3 so it is a grate film and a grate director. Pleas watch 10/10",Project X
281,blackops-eclipse-is-grea,A good reminder to those with wild teenage years,9,13 February 2013,"I wasn't sure whether I hated this film or loved it. First off if you are shy to swearing leave now because the movie is packed with swearing which is to be honest expected for 3 teenagers setting up a party.The acting for the characters was good with a decent storyline. The storyline was basically just 3 teenagers make a what was meant to be a small birthday part which goes wrong with thousands of people turning up and wrecking the house and then the aftermath of the epic party.The movie was extended substantially by shots of teenagers dancing, getting drunk and kissing. This did get repetitive in some montages of destruction but this is a minor issue after being diluted with crazy stunts and fights between drunken hooligans.There where some great writing with the insults, inventive stunts and overall chaos of the party.Overall if you enjoy watching destruction, fights, crazy stunts and hilarious events then this movie is for you. I would suggest this film to the younger age groups of about 18-26 maybe up to 30 or somewhere around that mark. I wouldn't recommend it to the older age groups like the 50 maybe 60+ age groups just because of my experience they wouldn't like this style of crazy montages of destruction style filming.",Project X

I like a lot of things about the movie. From the actual high school crowd who show up to the randoms who always seem to show up at every party. You know it's a good party when your neighbor gets tazed, everyone's on E, and a midget gets shoved in the oven. Ignore the fact that that police would have,in a real world, shown up shortly after they departed and arrested everyone, the story explains the oppression and pressures that this generation of teens face, unlike any other generation. The cast of characters, particularly the young ""security team"" are among some of the more memorable I've seen in a while. I had no expectations about this movie, and it delivered on some pretty interesting fronts. It won't win any awards, but it is pretty entertaining and funny. Haven't seen one like this in ages.",Project X
284,cyberdavo,After watching this movie I want to punch myself in th face.,3,13 January 2014,"This movie is basically soft porn for high schoolers. It has a predictable plot involving MTV style video clip screen grabs of teenage boob and panties, a sound track by Eminem and enough explosions, dwarfs and gratuitous drug an alcohol abuse to keep most high school kids amused for hours. Consisting of a story where a bunch of seemingly regular kids attempt to ingratiate themselves with random strangers in the all important quest for 'popularity' this movie panders to shallow male egos complete with a happy ending where all the boys end up popular despite destroying their family home and all their possessions and inflicting the family pet to abuse at the hands of the uninvited guests... but I guess at the end of the day it is more important to be liked by a bunch of complete strangers even if it means ruining your family.

Barker says they learned that the chimps in the film had been beaten with blackjacks and clubs. A blackjack is a lead baton.A cattle prod and a gun had been seen on the set, along with a giant snake Barker believes was used to frighten the chimps.AHA officials claim that Barker's incriminating photos show not instruments of torture but batons and plastic paddles used for reprimands and a snake used ""to elicit a certain expression on the face of the chimp.""The Department of Animal Regulation asked the L.A. district attorney's office to bring charges against the film's six animal trainers. But the film's producers denied mistreatment, and the AHA, which had representatives on the set throughout filming, said its own investigation had turned up no evidence of abuse.
