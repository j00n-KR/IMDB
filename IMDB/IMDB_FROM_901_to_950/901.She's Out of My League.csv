0,SnoopyStyle,Funny Friends,7,28 December 2013,"Kirk (Jay Baruchel) is a geeky TSA agent working security at the Pittsburgh airport with his wacky friends. He's still under the thumb of his ex Marnie (Lindsay Sloane). Then he meet super hot Molly (Alice Eve). They start dating after he returns her phone, and nobody can figure out what she sees in him.There's no doubt that Alice Eve is super hot, and Jay Baruchel is a cute charming geeky nice guy. It's actually a pretty simple rom-com with likable people. I like the friends even more. T.J. Miller and Nate Torrence are especially hilarious. The constant referencing of the mismatch is actually more of a hindrance to a simple rom-com.",She's Out of My League
1,claudio_carvalho,I am Still Laughing and Delighted with the Beauty of Alice Eve,7,6 January 2012,"In Pittsburgh, the clumsy and average Kirk (Jay Baruchel) works as a TSA security agent at the airport. Kirk is out of shape, uncoordinated, not college graduate, has never been in Europe and drives a shitbox Neon. His friends are a bunch of losers that also work at the airport and use to rank themselves and women. His family does not support him and his father used his college money to build a large swimming pool in the backyard of their house. Kirk dreams on becoming an airplane pilot, but he is insecure and without self-esteem. He also misses his former girlfriend Marnie (Lindsay Sloane), who is a bitch that humiliate him all the time. One day, the gorgeous Molly McCleish (Alice Eve) is helped by him in the check-in to a flight to New York, but she forgets her iphone and Kirk holds it for her. On the next day, Molly invites Kirk to go to a party at the Andy Warhol Museum and he delivers her iphone to her. Sooner they date and he learns that she is a successful promoter of events that lives in a fancy apartment and drives a nice car. However, the lack of confidence of Kirk does not let him see that Molly loves him since she is totally out of his league. The delightful ""She's Out of My League"" is one of the funniest comedies I have recently seen. Jay Baruchel is hilarious in the role of a man that has no self-esteem and self-confidence to be happy with one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen, Alice Eve, who is really a pretty woman. Alice Eve was ranked #7 in 2010 in the ""Beautiful Famous Faces"" by ""The Annual Independent Critics List of the 100 Most Beautiful Famous Faces From Around the World."" My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Ela é Demais para Mim"" (""She is Out of My League"")",She's Out of My League
2,nogodnomasters,MALE CHICK FLICK?,8,2 December 2018,"This has all the makings of a chick flick except the male is in the traditional role of the chick. Kirk, our male lead (nice guy loser)has a circle of male friends who reminded me of something out of ""Sex and the City"". Through a series of unlikely circumstances Kirk (Jay Baruchel_ starts dating a hot chick named Molly (Alice Eve), who has looks, money, and can speak hockey. Which to you girls is like a guy who knows name brand clothes.The plot is as predictable as a James Cameron film. The jokes at times, are far from fresh, yet it seems to work. Kirk brings Molly home to meet his folks and have dinner. This is perhaps the best family dinner since the Murphy's ""Nutty Professor"" and it didn't rely on toilet humor for it. It does have some fresh scenes during the predictable plot.The lessons of this story is that NASCAR guys get NASCAR girls and nice losers get hot chicks because hot chicks are tired of rich good looking studs. And the sad truth to this is that the best way to get a girlfriend is to already have a girlfriend because women only want what other women have.PARENTAL GUIDE: Frequent F-bomb, no nudity, near sex (grinding etc.)",She's Out of My League
3,paul_haakonsen,Where did the comedy go?,5,20 June 2010,"Having seen the trailers and previews for this movie, it looked like something that I just had to watch. And so I did......and now I sit here with a somewhat empty feeling. This movie was nowhere near as fun as the trailers had it set up to be. Well, the movie wasn't bad, don't get me wrong, but it didn't deliver what the trailers made it up to be.The story was good and interesting, and there were some really nice, embarrassing moments in there as well. Oddly enough, there were surprisingly few moments in the movie that had be laughing. At best, it came to some smiles and chuckles. The overall experience was not that much of a rolling-on-the-floor-laughing experience.As for the cast, well they were good. The lead actor had enough nerd-like quality to him to make it believable, and the lead actress, well she was plainly alright. As for the supporting characters (the friends and the girl friend), they actually brought the most color to the movie. They carried more weight in the movie than the two leading roles. Which is sort of a shame, but still worked out well enough.If you like romantic comedies, give this movie a go. But don't except a laugh-fest, like I did, then you will be disappointed.",She's Out of My League
4,tavm,She's Out of My League turned to be somewhat entertainingly raunchy and touching at the same time,6,17 March 2010,"This is another movie I watched with my movie theatre working friend. It concerns an airport metal detector (Jay Baruchel), who's average-looking and not very ambitious, and his budding romance with a fine-looking party planner (Alice Eve). I'll stop and just say how funny and touching, if only hilariously grotesque in scattered places, this movie was and I was glad when the ex of the female lead turned out not to be a jerk eventually. Like I said, the movie threatened to lose steam near the end but there were enough elements throughout that stayed somewhat entertaining. And seeing Krysten Ritter, who I first saw on ""Veronica Mars"", wisecrack and react in certain ways was quite refreshing to me as she stole many of her scenes. And many of Baruchel's friends also provided their own moments. So on that note, She's Out of My League is at least well worth a look.",She's Out of My League
5,sunwarrior13,Formulaic Movie Looks Original And Refreshing,9,20 September 2012,"She's Out of My League is a romantic comedy film that stars Jay Baruchel and Alice Eve together with T.J. Miller,Nate Torrence,Krysten Ritter,Geoff Stults and Lindsay Sloane.The story is about an airport security guard that gets involved with a girl who's very obviously of a higher caliber than himself, and schemes to make the relationship last as his friends and family watch along in disbelief.It was written by Sean Anders and John Morris; and directed by Jim Field Smith.Kirk was languishing in a dead-end job as an airport security agent when he somehow managed to earn the affections of the successful and drop- dead gorgeous Molly. Even Kirk isn't exactly sure what Molly sees in him, though he's willing to do whatever it takes to make the relationship work. With his friends, family, and ex-girlfriend all watching stunned from the sidelines, Kirk discovers that he'll have to work overtime in order to convince Molly that he's worth hanging on to.The film is not insightful about anything more than a generic self- esteem boost for average looking dudes who dream of hot babes, but it's never not doing cartwheels to make you laugh.The story relies on the strength of the characters and effectiveness of the comedy to keep it going. Also,it is not a comedy classic but the ensemble manages to make this clichéd and formulaic story line looks original and refreshing.",She's Out of My League
6,Scarecrow-88,She's Out of My League,6,26 March 2010,"All of us nerds and very average nobodies have a fantasy that only can be presented in a fictional form via cinematic medium. Sure, perhaps some stunning, sexy women with adorable personalities might have attached themselves to one out of every gazillion guys like me, but it's as rare as Haley's Comet. That's life and I have accepted my role in it. I knew I would never wind up with an Alice Eve, and that's okay, but thanks to the movies we can watch a fantasy play out and smile knowing that in a more perfect world we just might have a shot to attain the intimate company of a very attractive woman. Alice Eve is an event planner who falls for an airport security guard, Jay Baruchel. I could certainly identify with Jay's plight(..maybe not to the extent that some girl that I was previously aligned with was living under the same roof with my parents, along with her new fiancé, but anyway..), how his life was pretty much mediocre day in and day out, and that he just continued onward despite how frustrating such an existence may be. Then this wonderful girl, who had built a career for herself despite her father's wishes to become a lawyer, enters his life, and actually enjoys being with him, and has accepted him without reservation. It's a dream come true, except Jay's very blunt pal(played to the hilt by TJ Miller)doesn't fail to remind him that such relationships will never last, that he's not good enough for Eve. Obviously, comparing what you are by the scale of 1 to 10, the hotness factor, doesn't assist Jay in an argument, but ""She's Out of My League"" develops this unusual ""what if"" scenario and it's a breezy, feel good comedy, with plenty of raunch(many consider it in league with Judd Apatow's work of late)and profanity. A very funny, and quite embarrassing, situation involving accidental ejaculation, as Jay gets so worked up by Alice Eve's ""bumping and grinding"" while in his lap he ""unloads"" and the ""pruning"" scene concerning Jay's preparation(shaving the ""nether region"")for a possible sexual event are two of such raunchy humorous touches which play out. I loved Kryston Ritter as Eve's potty-mouthed, rather bitchy colleague and best friend..her scene in an airplane, responding to a fellow passenger who was getting on her nerves because Eve was in a tizzy due to the loss of her cell phone(how the eventual romance begins through Jay's act of kindness towards returning the cell to Eve at a shindig she planned for an art museum)is an example of how not to raise her ire. Mike Vogel is Jay's hunky stud buddy(the hot male of this group of high school buddies)and Nate Torrence is delightful as Baruchel's constant source of encouragement(he loves to quote Disney movies as sound advice to Jay as a means to improve his belief in himself). Problems, such as self-doubt, parents, and ex-boyfriends/girlfriends, creep in to affect Jay and Alice's benevolence. The movie places emphasis on Jay's dysfunctional family dynamics. Eve positively radiates and is VERY easy on the eyes. Jay is perfect for his role and I cared about his dilemma.",She's Out of My League
7,george.schmidt,Inept attempt at joining the altar of Apatow/Crowe/Hughes,6,12 April 2010,"SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE (2010) ** Jay Baruchel, Alice Eve, TJ Miller, Mike Vogel, Nate Torrence, Lindsay Sloane, Kyle Bornheimer, Jessica St. Clair, Krysten Ritter, Debra Jo Rupp, Adam LeFevre, Kim Shaw, Jaskia Nicole, Geoff Stults. Beauty and the geek rom-com with scrawny airport security guard Baruchel (doing his best to avoid swimming in his own juices) as the painfully awkward type who winds up (inexplicably) having a 'hard 10' babe (Reese Witherspoon manqué Eve) fall for him despite all odds (i.e. his obnoxious family and friends overwhelmed by this obvious freak of nature occurrence). While it attempts to mingle with Apatow/Crowe/Hughes trinity of young adults' fare, the results are hampered by bodily fluids jokes (one upping ""There's Something About Mary"" in the hair gel department) and immaturity abounding in the inept screenplay by Sean Anders and John Morris with pedestrian direction by newbie Jim Field Smith (and it shows).",She's Out of My League
8,neil-476,Sweet but rude in places,8,2 June 2010,"The path of this romantic comedy is well trodden - loser Kirk is asked out by gorgeous Molly because she is weary of bad treatment from the hunks she normally dates, and he seems safe. He's actually a nice guy, and she falls for him. However, his friend Stainer has been driving home the message that he is way below her status (both socially and in terms of looks) and it will never succeed, and her friend Patty has been doing the same with her. This eventually drives them apart, at which point the friends realise the mistake they've made and conspire to bring them together again.I'm not familiar with Jay Baruchel (Kirk) other than as the voice of the main character in How To Train Your Dragon. But, on the basis of She's Out Of My League, he appears to be vying with Michael Cera and Jesse Eisenberg for the position of Self-denigrating Loser Unlikely Romantic Hero.And he is doing so quite successfully in this case, because the object of his affections is played by Alice Eve, another performer with whom I am unfamiliar but about whom I will say she is very attractive (of course, that's the point of the movie) and she has a great smile. I wasn't familiar with much of the supporting cast, either, but they were all good - interestingly, Molly's parents are played by her real life parents, English actors Trevor (Shoestring) Eve and Sharon (Gold Blend commercials) Maughan. I particularly liked Krysten Ritter as Molly's friend Patty, and Debra Jo Rupp as Kirk's mother.As is the modern fashion there is a fair amount of bad language, and some concentration on bodily functions (one of which gives rise to one of the funniest sequences in the film). But these are nice people and it's quite a sweet story, and the ruderies fit quite well, so I didn't mind that much.I liked this film.",She's Out of My League
9,anaconda-40658,This Film is Out of Its League in Terms of Quality.,4,22 May 2015,"She's Out of My League (2010): Dir: Jim Field Smith/ Cast: Jay Baruchel, Alice Eve, T.J. Miller, Mike Vogel, Lindsay Sloane: Comedy that examines the attitude when it comes to physical attractiveness. Jay Baruchel plays an airline security guard who retrieves the cell phone of gorgeous Alice Eve who misplaced it. To his bewilderment they hook up and everyone speculates regarding why she would hook up with him. Director Jim Field Smith does his best with the cliché ridden script. He asks the right questions regarding the opinions of others when it comes to relationships but the delivery is far from a perfect ten. Problem is that Baruchel and Eve lack chemistry. His character may be awkward but he is also unsympathetic. A scene where her parents walk in on them having sex could have been funny but instead it leaves him looking like a moron. She is great eye candy but needs more than just a slapped on event planner job. Eve is truly fetching to the eyes but that is the height of her performance here. T.J. Miller and Mike Vogel also appear as his friends of bad advice. They observe and form obnoxious opinions as to why he is not right for her and that the laws of attractiveness are being violated. Lindsay Sloane plays Baruchel's ex-girlfriend who split likely so to avoid being in the rest of the film. Its theme is right on with these arguments but the couple here just isn't believable. This film is out of its league when being compared to real romantic comedies with real feeling. The couple featured here is about as compatible as comparing this film to Casablanca.

10,Wuchakk,A really good romcom marred by profane crudeness,5,9 December 2019,"A TSA worker at the Pittsburgh Airport (Jay Baruchel) starts a relationship with a woman many consider to be a perfect 10 (Alice Eve), which surprises his friends and family. Can the relationship survive their pestering?""She's Out of My League"" (2010) is a surprisingly well-written, well-casted romcom that's entertaining throughout, but it's ruined for me by a little too much gross or profane (non)humor and I can't in good conscience give it a higher grade. This is unfortunate because the flick didn't need to stoop to that low-level.But if you can stomach the needlessly gross bodily fluid & raunchy 'humor' of ""There's Something about Mary"" (1998), ""The Girl Next Door"" (2004) and ""Forgetting Sarah Marshal"" (2008) you might like it more than me.The film runs 1 hour, 44 minutes, and was shot in the Pittsburgh area.GRADE: C",She's Out of My League
11,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: She's Out of My League,7,13 June 2010,"The cynic in anyone when coming across a couple where a hot chick is with an average or below average guy, will suggest that the fabric between them would either be his limousine or sports car, the size of his obscenely fat wallet, or he possesses the skills of a sex god blessed with a giant you-know-what. But if this film is to be believed, the babes are really down to earth people yearning for what everyone wants, genuine love. But you can trust a comedy to take this premise and spin it into quite the laugh-out-loud flick complete with one-liners, crazy characters, with everything fair game to be poked fun at.Jay Baruchel will likely see his stock rise this year, coming off with providing the voice to what I thought was the best 3D animated film this year in How To Train Your Dragon, before what seemed to be promising in The Sorcerer's Apprentice with Nicolas Cage. His current on screen persona is more aligned to that of a slightly older Michael Cera, launching into self- deprecating mode ever so often with that tinge of whine and self-consciousness that Mr Average doesn't have what it takes to beat the odds. As the TSA airport screener Kirk, his live revolves around talking crap with his airport employee buddies, being bullied at home by everyone save Mom, and has just come off a break up with Marnie (Lindsay Sloane) whom he is trying to woo back.Enter Alice Eve (Crossing Over, Sex and the City 2) as the hottie Molly, who enters Kirk's life when she left her cellphone at the screening station, and being the alpha aggressive female takes bold steps to get to meet up with Kirk to retrieve her phone, invite him out as a thank- you, and soon finds herself attracted to him because he is the quintessential Mr Safe, compared to the jocks she's been out with. It's Revenge of the Nerds people, if only the Nerd will stop not believing that his luck has turned, and that constantly reminding oneself of how lucky one is, is never cool.Being there and having done that (being tackled by and tackling a hottie), the film rightly addresses issues of self-esteem that one must maintain or possess in order to sustain a relationship of this nature, and the story by Sean Anders and John Morris takes what is called the hot-o-meter, and with some whiff of a truth in it, compares and takes stock of people's individual indices with one another, using it as a quick gauge to determine if relationships last, from a rather physical perspective. But what's always more important is to dig a lot deeper into the person and get to know him/her inside out, than to look out for flaws with which to wallow some pity in and to obtain some egoistic, proud advantage over. Nobody's perfect, and this film takes quite the while to bring this thought across.From the laughter perspective, She's Out of My League covers a broad spectrum of sources to elicit mirth, although those averse to F-bombs may want to steer clear of it, since Kirk's family doesn't think twice of letting plenty of it go everywhere. The middle finger also makes plenty of appearances, so uptight folks may want to give this film a miss. What was truly hilarious thankfully got hidden away from the trailer, and it's not since The 40 Year Old Virgin that a scene involving hair removal is done in such a distasteful yet hilarious sequence. Toilet jokes as it seems are popular, and that episode involving semen also gave the one in There's Something About Mary a run for its money.The supporting cast here such as T.J. Miller (who was also in How To Train Your Dragon), Mike Vogel and Nate Torrence all seemed geared up to give Team Apatow a run for it too, and I wouldn't be surprised if steps are taken to craft that (if they are not already indirectly from that same comedic creative force). Miller who plays Stainer probably got really close to upstaging our male lead with his devil-may-care attitude and brashness, and no thanks to the hurried ending (it seemed as though a large chunk was taken away for the DVD's deleted scenes) we don't get to see more of how he orchestrates the expected ending. As the female lead, Alice Eve doesn't do very much other than to remind you of how hot she can be thanks to her ample assets, and who would have guessed that her real life parents also turn up as the reel ones here too.This film won't likely join the ranks of classic, memorable comedies anytime soon, but for what it's worth for that instance of much needed comedy, then this film perhaps could be your pick over the bigger budgeted blockbusters that are currently invading the multiplexes.",She's Out of My League
12,namashi_1,Average...,4,15 June 2010,"'She's Out of My League' is an average, routine rom-com, that Hollywood has churned out a 1,000 times before. Sean Anders and John Morris, the writers of this film write something they have maybe grown up on. The writing is so lame at places, that you can guess what's going to happen the next minute! But this film has it's share of pluses as well. The track between the protagonist and his friends are memorable. In fact, they're hilarious and bring the house down! Jim Field Smith's direction is fair.In the acting department, Jay Baruchel is first-rate. Alice Eve is superb. Plus, she looks alluring. T. J. Miller, Nate Torrence, and Mike Vogel are fantastic. They are the real scene-stealer's. Lindsay Sloane looks jaded and least interested in the goings-on. Others are adequate.'She's Out Of My League' has nothing new to offer, it's a routine rom-com.

13,StevePulaski,A League of Their Own,9,4 July 2010,"Romantic Comedies come in three types. The first is rare, a cult classic. A memorable love connection between two time devoted actors who give it there all. Such as Gone With the Wind. The other is one so ridiculous that it's rare to ever watch it again. Usually movies that are fast in theaters and fast out. Most come out nowadays. Like When in Rome, Just Married, and Leap Year. The other is this movie's category. A good, funny Comedy that doesn't try to hard to be a classic or to be funny. Just a safe, no strings attached Comedy. Such as Sex and the City. This one can safely fit in this category as a movie that isn't to complex or just overly stupid. Its a fun movie.I especially admire the film's nerve to cast an actress as ""the ten"" and with her not having a big rep for best looking actress or an actress that isn't on every teen's ""list"". No Megan Fox or anything like that. Alice Eve gives an all out performance. She stated in an interview that she thinks she isn't ""a perfect ten"". I for sure think she is a beautiful woman who is too hard on herself. Anyone would be lucky to have her as a wife/girlfriend. Which is why this film is great.Kirk (Jay Baruchel) is a self conscious Airport security worker in Pittsburgh. After finding Molly's (Alice Eve) phone when dialed by her friend, Kirk returns it to her which begins the start of a new friendship and relationship between the two. Kirk being completely self conscious about his looks and personality, Often the case with me, he looks at the worst in himself and not looking at his potential. The duos funny on-screen appearance shows a completely honest relationship between the cast. I doubt any duo in the movies this year have had such a great relationship (even Shutter Island).I've seen pretty bad reviews of the film and I cant understand why. It is way better than When In Rome or Just Married. Though not Oscar material it's still a likable movie. I don't see the huge dilemma. It is a harmless Romantic movie. I must restate as I did before I'm glad Alice Eve got the role for Molly, unlike some other orange skin or model celebrity. She's Out of My League isn't an everybody film. But as least if the director reads this review, he'll know it's a somebody film.Starring: Jay Baruchel, Alice Eve, T.J. Miller, and Krysten Miller.

14,Smells_Like_Cheese,A lot better than I expected,7,30 March 2010,"When I saw the trailer for She's Out of my League, I have to admit that I laughed, but I was thinking that if I had seen this movie, it would probably be a let down. One of those ""you saw the funny parts in the trailer"" movies. But still, I saw the movie just keeping my expectations low as most romantic comedies are just awful. Much to my pleasant surprise, She's Out of My League was a really funny movie that I enjoyed very much. In a society obsessed with looks and being perfect, most romantic comedies have these gorgeous people in the leads who don't look like they need any help in their love lives, we finally get a lead who isn't drop dead gorgeous as for Hollywood standards getting a beautiful person. Though I do wish we could have a romantic comedy with the opposite, not so hot girl gets the hot guy, I guess we'll have to wait a while for that. But She's Out of My League does deliver in the laughs and entertainment with great chemistry with our two leads and supporting cast.Kirk is in his mid-20s who has a low self-esteem and, by his own admission, has not accomplished very much in life. He works at the Pittsburgh International Airport as a security officer and has very few goals other than trying to get back together with his self-centered ex-girlfriend Marnie. Marnie ended her relationship with Kirk two years ago and is highly dismissive of his continued romantic interests. However, she has remained close with Kirk's parents and overbearing brother and continues to participate in family activities along with her new boyfriend. With no relationship and an awkward family life, Kirk confides in his three close male friends who also work with him at the airport. Then at work one morning, a strikingly beautiful woman named Molly arrives at the passenger terminal for a flight to New York. She and Kirk exchange a few smiles and flirtatious words, and she then proceeds to her flight, accidentally leaving her iPhone in the airport security area. Upon realizing she has misplaced it, Molly calls her phone and Kirk, back at the security checkpoint, answers. To everyone's surprise Molly really likes Kirk, his friends constantly remind him he's a 5 and she's a 10, so he feels the pressure to keep her around.What I liked most about this movie was how it wasn't a COMPLETE cliché, Molly's hot ex wants her back, but he doesn't go through outrageous attempts to get her back or anything, he's just as insecure as our leading male. It turns out that the only reason why Kirk is uncomfortable dating Molly is because he is reminded on a daily basis on how average he is and how he'll never get a gorgeous or sophisticated woman like Molly. A lot of people can relate to that, heck, how many times on the street do we see an unattractive looking person with someone who is really good looking and make a judgment? I loved how even his family were a bunch of jerks and not the typical ""we're rooting for our son"" mentality, they actually almost preferred his ex's new boyfriend over him, how sad is that? She's Out of My League is a big recommendation from me, definitely worth the rental when it comes out, it's one of the better romantic comedies that I've seen.7/10",She's Out of My League
15,KineticSeoul,"Not a great comedy, but still pretty good",7,25 July 2010,"Some reviewers claim this movie to be a comedy with heart, and I agree. It isn't one of those really funny comedies, but it made me chuckle a few times and was intriguing from beginning to end. It's basically about a guy who is a 5 out of 10 when it comes to the scale of being a stud trying to hook up with a girl that is a 10. This movie can relate with a lot of people that suffer from low self-esteem and have lack of confidence when it comes to girls or visa versa. This isn't one of those uber adult comedies, but young teens can watch this as well in my opinion. Maybe I am giving this movie too much of a high score, but I really did expect this movie to suck but to my surprise it was a LOT better than I thought it would be. You care for the characters that they want you to like and really dislike the ones they want you to hate. It's a sweet romantic comedy with heart, and is a great date movie. The main guy protagonist who has a nice guy personality but lack the looks and status trying to hook up with the girl who has the looks and a good personality was surprisingly entertaining, especially cause of the direction it went. Although this concept has been done before in other movies like ""Hitch"" this one had enough to hold it's own. Not a great comedy, but still pretty good.7.3/10",She's Out of My League
16,Hellmant,Proving to rival the likes of Judd Apatow and Kevin Smith!,9,14 October 2010,"'SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Sean Anders and John Morris, the writing team behind 'SEX DRIVE' (which Anders also directed and I thought was one of the best comedies in recent years) and the upcoming 'HOT TUB TIME MACHINE', wrote this hilarious comedy that is emotionally touching and inspiring as well. This seems to be the writing teams knack and they're proving to rival the likes of Judd Apatow and Kevin Smith, which previously had the market cornered on intelligent yet crude and vulgar comedies that also prove to be well made and heart felt character studies as well.The duo, at least so far, have also centered on subject matter revolving around the social outcast 'loveable loser' finally winning out and succeeding in life (most notably by winning over the girl of his dreams, who's way out of his league). This is probably a really relate-able subject matter for their target audience which is why their films (at least the first two) have been such a success. Sort of the same area of expertise Smith and Apatow also have and have had great success in.This movie fits the writing team's known formula to a T and tells the story of a pretty average looking 'loveable loser' named Kirk (played by Jay Baruchel, a known Apatow collaborator) who manages to impress a stunningly beautiful woman named Molly (played by newcomer Alice Eve) with his kindness. Molly's on the rebound from a bad break-up with a cocky good looking pilot (played by Geoff Stults) and due to the fact that Kirk seems 'safe' and harmless she asks him out. The two actually hit it off but due to Kirk's lack of confidence (due in large part to his best friends' constant put downs and demoralizing abuse, which is probably a relate-able subject for a lot of target viewers as well – it is for me) he loses faith in himself and unintentionally sabotages his chances with her.The movie is actually a pretty smart and clever character study and it's definitely inspiring, although it is also pretty far fetched; that a ten would go for a five, as the movie's tag-line states. Despite the insight and heart the movie does deliver on all the low brow belly laughs that the previews promise and there's a lot of really clever 'Smith-esque' dialog as well.

17,thesar-2,A League of its Own,2,24 June 2010,"Yes. I agree. Totally. Absolutely. 100%. Never happen. Just as much fantasy here as in The Lord of the Rings. Republicans and Democrats have a better chance. Glenn Beck and Hillary Clinton have more chemistry.Let me get the positives out first, because, dammit, I hated this movie. OK, it had some good shots; the cinematographer was well paid. And I did chuckle, but not laugh, at a few scenes. FEW. Oh, and I liked them using ""normal"" guys for the nerds verses just throwing in the usual suspects: Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, et al.Whew, I'm glad that (and the movie) is over. Going back to my first observation, perhaps a 10 would go after (they say a 5+, I say a) 3 (THREE) and THAT is being generous, but there has to be something more. Is he funny? Is he wealthy? Is he self-confident? Is he interesting? Is he caring? Does he have a big member? Does he have, at least, ambition? This absolute DUFUS has absolutely none of those qualities. Seriously? Could they have written a worse off human being? Forget the ""looks"" or lack thereof; let's not be shallow, shall we? Give me something OTHER than the target it-girl (who looks too eerily like a young Ali Larter) using him to avoid heart break.Nope. On paper, he's supposed to be HILARIOUS! FUNNY! And a LOYAL FRIEND! I saw none of these displayed. Man, can he bore me. Dude, he's as loyal to his friends as Kramer is to Seinfeld. And the actor, Baruchel, didn't even appear like he was trying. Sure, he seemed happy he had a starring role, finally, but he read the script verbatim and went from point A to B without adding any heart or any desire to prove to the audience he was worth rooting for.Don't even get me started on the unoriginal script, bad ideas, thoroughly predictable story lines and terrible attempt at being gross – don't throw in a scene, such as the straight male shaving his best bud's pubes, simply to appeal to the American Pie crowd, when it literally does not fit in with the rest of the atmosphere.Here's my take on the synopsis: Boy, Kirk (Baruchel) meets Girl, Molly (Eve) at the airport where Boy works. He's still stuck on ex-girlfriend who broke up with him – and as bad as she is (duh, I said it was predictable,) she broke it off, rightfully so – two years prior. BAM, friendly Molly with a lot of male baggage enters the picture and falls for ""safe"" Kirk.Whew, good for him. And they date. Hilarity (yeah, right) ensues with all the secondary characters who simply try too hard at being, well, third-rate, and barely funny, characters.Let's just count the time down to the inevitable ""fight"" or ""lies-turned-truth"" all these movies always contains moments before the ""heartbreak"" song, soul searching and predicatible make-up finale.Do these people try anymore? I would give this turd a higher rating if anyone had a personality range above Keanu Reeves or humor even as minor as Adam Sandler. But, no. They weren't funny; they were as depressing as they looked.Little thought went into this. And less thought you should have in renting it. She's out of his league for good reason.

18,Robert_duder,"Shockingly fun, hilariously funny and surprisingly sweet",8,12 July 2010,"Having seen the trailers for the film I did want to see it but had no expectations of what it would be like. It looked kind of like the silly stereotypical gross out flicks that so often invade our theatres along the same vein as Superbad, or any other Judd Apatow movie. So I had mixed ideas of what I would see. Imagine my surprise when it turned out that indeed She's Out Of My League did have some of that silly slapstick teen gross out humour but also had heart, and laughs, and was essentially a romantic comedy that men and women could enjoy equally. Not entirely film of the year given a stunning woman falls for, and ends up with a guy who (no offence to Mr. Baruchel) is ugly and nerdy and everything else but that is the whole point of the film I suppose. The heart of the film is the friends and the slapstick antics of an 'average' guy trying to keep the most beautiful woman on the planet (in his eyes and the eyes of everyone around him.) Everyone is so likable and has such great chemistry with each other that you can't help but just go along for the ride and feel like these are the best friend you've ever had.How big will Jay Baruchel become? He is easily the new Michael Cera (and much more talented and fun to watch), and has some big roles under his belt and upcoming. He is just simply likable, very down to earth, geeky and nerdy in all the right ways and roles like this one are absolutely right in his ballpark so he carries the film easily. He isn't as out and out slapstick funny as you might think but he still is great to watch. He is also has impressively amazing chemistry with Alice Eve who plays the stunning '10' girl Molly. Despite being physically as different as beauty and the geeky beast the two of them seem perfect together and that is not a feat that should go unmentioned. Alice Eve is absolutely stunning (I have a HUGE crush on her) but outside of that her role as Molly is sweet, and cute, and simple. I say simple because there is certainly nothing that flexes any acting chops but for what her purpose is...it's perfect. I think you'll likely see her showing up more in the future as well (such as Sex and The City 2.) T.J. Miller is absolutely perfect as the crude, ignorant, slapstick best friend Stainer. I thought his entire purpose was to be crude and funny and then all of sudden they actually let him have some emotion and depth...weird. But still Miller is hilarious and fun and a perfect supporting role. Nate Torrence is sadly annoying as he usually is cast as the buffoon annoying fat kid and this is no different. Lindsay Sloane is terrific as the ex-girlfriend (who really isn't entirely unfortunate looking either) but is hyped as clingy, needy and way high maintenance so that his friends hate her, and we learn to do the same. Seemingly destined for the role of the lead girls best friend (Confessions of a Shopaholic) she is great in the role. She's sassy and crude and fits in well with the cast.Professional reviewers all had the same thing to say it seemed and that was that film makers often mistake gross out immaturity as humour and that is incredibly true. It annoys me to no end constantly. Toilet humour has gone way too far and She's Out Of My League certainly does have its share, don't get me wrong. The thing is I went in expecting a plethora of this toilet humour and while it was there the film also had heart, and good characters and it was funny and cute and crude so I guess it fills everyone's expectations because obviously people do enjoy crude gross out humour or Judd Apatow wouldn't have a career. All in all She's Out of My League is fun and light and silly and stupid and it will entertain and that is what matters. Its a film I would watch again and that is saying something. 8.5/10",She's Out of My League

He finds her cell phone and meets up to give it back. She's interested because she is tired of dating the ""perfect guy"" and wants to try something different. And Kirk can't believe she'll go out with him.The 2 grossest scenes are Kirk getting shaved by his buddy and Kirk having an ""accident"" the first time meeting Molly's parents.

The status quo of his fairly monotonous life ends when he meets Molly, a smart, kind and gorgeous blonde. Because she's way out of his league (she's a hard 10 and he is but a 5), Kirk knows there's no way on earth she's ever going to fall for him. Or is there...? She's Out Of My League was an above average comedy to be sure, that surprised me pleasantly with it's ability to induce laughter out of me. I've been treated to so many routine comedies these days; it's nice to see a movie once in a while that actually makes me laugh. Jay Baruchel needs some work as an actor in my opinion, but he fits the bill with his likability, and he helped carry the film well. Geoff Stults and Jay's interaction contain some of the funniest scenes in the movie for me. I also enjoyed the hockey scene down in the basement with Jay. This proves not all hot chicks prefer 10's.Performances. Jay Baruchel needs some work as a performer, but he's a likable fellow. He made me laugh a lot, and he definitely has some untapped potential. I'll see how he does in Sorcerer's Apprentice. Alice Eve is very pretty, and does well as the love interest. Chemistry with Baruchel had a nice flow of awkwardness, and realism.Bottom line. It's not bad at all actually; in fact it's rather good. Sit back, relax and laugh your stones off, at this fun, silly little comedy. Well worth a viewing.6 ½ /10",She's Out of My League

Unfortunately, Kirk's insecurities, his lack of self-esteem and his meddling friend's force him to sabotage the relationship.While it's in the vein of a raunchy sex-comedy, She's Out of My League rises above the standard foulmouthed fare by balancing the depravity with humour and humility.What's more, if anyone ever tells you someone is out of your league, you put down that bowling ball and you pick up that shuttlecock.

Due to the influence of his friends and his family, he starts thinking that he is not good enough for her and troubles arise.I liked this movie because despite its simple plot, it was interesting and funny. Many scenes were simply hilarious and the characters did their best in order to make this movie as funny as possible. Regarding the interpretations, I have to say that both the interpretations of Alice Eve who played as Molly and Jay Baruchel who played as Kirk were very good and they both did their best. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were T.J. Miller's who played as Stainer, Lindsay Sloane's who played as Marnie and Nate Torrence's who played as Devon. Finally, I believe that ""She's Out of My League"" is a nice, funny movie that I strongly recommend everyone to watch because I am sure that you will laugh a lot and you will have a great time.",She's Out of My League
24,Floated2,Surprisingly enjoyable!,7,6 July 2010,"She's out of my league is an interesting and watchable film, and I have to admit that I really enjoyed it. Possibly because I wasn't expecting to, but I also wasn't against giving it a chance. I think at first the trailers did not look very promising, and when it was compared to the hangover in one ad, I really wasn't expecting much. This movie is not the Hangover, completely different movies with different types of humour. Though I found the Hangover to be really funny, this movie was also great.This movie is not what it appears to be. Many will disagree, but I felt that there is more reason for watching this than for a constant need to be funny and outrageous. I also liked the character in this movie, and found they added a lot to the story. And it wasn't as ""shallow"" as I've heard, it was pretty decent and it in the end the true moral of the story happens. Another reason I liked this movie is because I felt there was a storyline that made up for most of the jokes I didn't find funny. Though some non-jokes weer quite funny, meaning they really weren't meant to be jokes but they were funny. Also this movie didn't try to be something it isn't.There will probably few people that will find it to be a pointless movie (and I guess it is to an extent), but I found it to be entertaining and worth seeing. I'm glad I wasn't expecting to be laughing throughout the whole movie, because I didn't, and because I found it to be a little more than what I was expecting from the plot. Overall it was a good movie, worth checking out",She's Out of My League

26,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Good writing and a pair of strong leads get countered by comedy clichés,5,25 July 2010,"According to his friends and himself, Kirk (Jay Baruchel) is a five out of ten on a scale of general sex appeal. Funny, because that's the exact score I give this film. Kirk's a decent enough guy. A bit scrawny, has some self-esteem issues, but he's funny at times, genuine and often charming. I don't know about those negatives, but the positives could also be said about ""She's Out of My League."" There are moments when the sweet-natured interior of this story of ""geek gets girl"" shines through a bit and I speculate ""Sex Drive"" writers Sean Anders and John Morris intended that more than the finished product would lead us to believe. But it seems as though a producer stepped in and said, ""this isn't Judd Apatow enough,"" so ""League"" gravitates between being a surprisingly likable romantic comedy and a direct-to-DVD stereotype. So much is hit or miss in this film that it's likely to be enjoyed or despised, which strangely reflects the thematic angle of how we perceive ourselves and the people we're interested in or dating. Molly (Alice Eve) defines ten out of ten in terms of looks, a well-paying job -- the whole package. Kirk, meanwhile, works at the airport for the TSA. By a stroke of luck they even interact with each other and once you get over that she asks him out, their relationship is the best part of the film. Eve impresses, maybe because she's written to be more than just boobs in a dress, even if the camera ogles her and every cast member is supposed to stare slack-jawed at her at some point in the film. After director Jim Field Smith establishes that she's hot, she gets a likable personality and Eve manages to create a complexity about her even though her character's motivation is ""you like Kirk because he's 'safe,'"" which I don't think is enough to defy laws of a attraction, but somehow she makes it work. Baruchel is a likable schlub and so the two manage to pull off the romance elements of the film. It's when they go back to their friends that the film goes back to being bad.You know them well by now, the group of friends in every movie who are nothing but cardboard cut-outs intended for humor, pop culture references and the like. In this case, because the movie is about this relationship and literally nothing else, they also serve to create a dialogue of the main characters' consciences. The two best buddies to Kirk and Molly respectively are Stainer (T.J. Miller) and Patty (Krysten Ritter). Ritter is quite possibly the least funny thing about this movie because she has no comic timing. Miller occasionally pulls off the sentimental stuff well, but his character is one of those typical stream-of-insults guys who's a mix between a Seth Rogen character and Napoleon Dynamite and sometimes he looks like he's just saying the funny stuff written in the script. One of Kirk's buddies is played by Nate Torrence, who proves why he's been in other films with his solid timing.The biggest source of problems for ""League"" is its director. Smith cancels out every good scene between Baruchel and Eve by putting in something that makes him seem completely negligent of the script, which is actually good. Whether its a cliché pan around Stainer's head as he tells of a sentimental memory or your typical slow-mo build up when Kirk and his brother are challenging each other to a hockey game in the basement, Smith provides plenty proof why he should probably be directing all those ""American Pie presents"" frat movies that get churned out twice a year. It's particularly painful when you can sense that there's some quality in a film and the director worsens it and it succumbs to the ""let's do what we think is popular"" machine.So ""She's Out of My League"" gets a five. Though it could easily be a seven or a three.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",She's Out of My League
27,DarkVulcan29,"I don't care about what the critics think, She's Out of My League was a lot of fun.",9,15 March 2010,"I mean She's Out of My League is right up there with The 40 year old Virgin(2005), and I Love You, Man(2009), a raunchy vulgar comedy that manages to have a heart to it. I mean Role Models(2008), hardly had anybody likable in it, and it was a big hit, and i'm still trying to figure that one out. But this film had two likable leads that you wanna route for.Kirk(Jay Baruchel from Knocked Up), works at at an airport, he's a nice guy, but painfully shy and insecure. His buddies that he works with say thats because women don't consider him boyfriend material, cause he is too safe. But all that changes one day when the ever so enchantingly beautiful Molly(Alice Eve) forgets her cell phone, while boarding a plane, she uses her friends cell phone to call her cell phone, and Kirk finds it and answers it, she asks him can he hold it for her. Kirk brings it back to her, Alice soon wants to spend more time with Kirk. But will Kirk insecurities ruin it? The critics are quick to bash this movie, but give Role Models a thumbs up, go figure. I liked Jay Baruchel and Alice Eve they where characters to route for, and where very enjoyable to watch, although Baruchel was more funnier then Eve, the comedy just happened around her. Lindsay Sloane(Big Red from Bring It On) is also good has Marnie, Kirks ex. Krysten Ritter is also amusing as Patty, Mollys friend. But the real scene stealer IS T.J. Miller has Kirks friend Stainer, who steals almost every moment when every scene he is in, he's like Jason Segal and Seth Rogen mixed together.I say don't listen to the critics, see this movie and form your own opinion.",She's Out of My League
28,dee.reid,"I think I found a new screen hero, and his name is Jay Baruchel",8,3 July 2010,"I guess I'd rate myself a 6.5. (By the way, I realize the futility of ratings systems, but I'm just using it for illustrative purposes in describing ""She's Out of My League."")I remember that for four years in high school, I was a high school nerd/loner, and I liked it. I was shy, I was socially awkward, and I was one of those guys who happened to have a thing for one of the popular girls (she played basketball and I wasn't exactly the most athletic guy at my school). If you'll allow me, I'd like to say that She Was Truly Out of My League. Sometimes I wonder: If I had tried to make myself over in some way, would she have liked me for the guy I was now, or the guy I was before?(I didn't get to date her, much to my disappointment, but to this day we're still good friends.)As movie after movie has told us, it pays to be yourself because if you're not, you're basically living a lie. And that is sort of the ""message"" of the new romantic comedy ""She's Out of My League,"" which tells us about the importance of inner beauty and inner sweetness, and not putting beautiful women on pedestals.Alas, in ""She's Out of My League,"" I've found a new screen hero in Kirk Kettner (Jay Baruchel, of ""Knocked Up"" and ""Tropic Thunder""), a lowly airport screener for the TSA (Transportation Security Administration). Kirk is all of the following: shy, socially awkward, broke, out-of-shape, uncoordinated, and has low self-esteem. He also lacks a college education, is stuck with a POS car, a dead-end job, and he is still reeling it in from the break-up with his obnoxious ex-girlfriend. To make matters worse, he also listens to his buddies' assertions that he's just a ""5,"" more or less, for better or worse, and that the most beautiful women are truly Out of his League. His buddies also have a habit of flirting with the pretty women that come through their checkpoint, and this brings up the chance for him to play the hero to Molly's (Alice Eve) damsel in distress when one of his coworkers lasciviously hits on her.She asks him out on a date and the two continue to see each other casually. It's easy to note that she is obviously interested in him because she's able to see beyond his many ""flaws,"" which he is too insecure to see are actually virtues, which is what Molly is most attracted to. To Kirk's buddies and his family, they're just as shocked as he is when he brings home this beautiful blonde (ugh, blondes just don't do it for me, so I have to fake it here), and that she's a ""10,"" more or less, for better or worse, and that she's smart, beautiful, and more or less financially stable. Eventually, Kirk's insecurities about her and himself get in the way of their growing relationship and he must learn to overcome them - bring out his inner ""10"" - and try to bring each other into their own ""league"" (if that makes any sense).""She's Out of My League"" is one of the better romantic comedies I've seen in recent years, largely because it has a truly likable main character in Jay Baruchel's Kirk Kettner. It is true that he is Out of Molly's League (director Jim Field Smith chose His Hero well), but he has many inner qualities that he many times overlooks. He is kind, considerate, polite, heroic (like when he came to her rescue earlier in the film), and he genuinely cares about her (when he's not worried about being a ""5."") He's one of the better portrayals of an Average Joe on the screen.For me and other Average Joe's and Everymen who may not be rich, muscular, confident and share many other ""ideal"" qualities that women may look for in men, a new hero is born here. He's someone that we Average Joe's and Everymen can relate to. It restores our confidence that even WE (""we"" is italicized here) can net a beautiful woman like Molly, and feel secure in our persons because of our ""attributes."" ""She's Out of My League"" restores my confidence in our chances of meeting the Ms. Right who will see us as we are, and not make an effort to try to turn us into their ideal Mr. Right.

29,MBunge,"So, this movie is rated ""R""...but Alice Eve doesn't get naked? Wha...?",6,25 October 2011,"Sometimes making a good movie shouldn't be all that complicated. If it's a comedy, make sure it has plenty of actual jokes so that even if you've got a 50/50 hit/miss ration, there will be plenty to laugh at. I f your story is about the paradox of a hot girl going out with a dorky guy, make sure the girl is super hot but make sure the guy isn't so dorky the audience doesn't feel comfortable connecting with him. If you're going to have a big cast, give everybody some funny lines and something to do. And if your film is meant to be nothing more than a lightweight diversion, don't belabor the plot or hammer away at any moral or social message. Making an effort while also having a sense of restraint shouldn't be that hard, but a whole lot of motion pictures can't manage to pull it off as well as She's Out of My League.Kirk (Jay Baruchel) is the sort of nebbishy guy who's not only still pining for the girlfriend who broke up with him 2 years ago, his parents make it perfectly clear they like his ex-girlfriend more than him. One day, while working at his airport TSA job, Kirk meets Molly (Alice Eve). She is a beautiful and charming woman and quickly starts throwing herself at the far less attractive and socially capable Kirk. Though his group of smartass friends tell Kirk that a ""5"" like him can't make it work with a ""hard 10"" like Molly, he throws caution to the wind and gives it a go. But his insecurity and the reason why a girl like Molly even looked at him in the first place turn out to be almost as tough a barrier to get past as his friends said.Comedies live and die on funny. I know that seems self-evident. It really isn't. I've seen many comedies that were energetically performed and cleverly written in other respects, but weren't all that funny. Sometimes it's because they think they're too smart. Sometimes it's because they rely too heavily on humorous premises with little follow through. Sometimes they're just mean or silly. She's Out of My League is more than funny enough to live. It has jokes based on characters, jokes that flow out of situation and random jokes thrown in just for the hell of it. And for every crude bit of humor there's another that's more family friendly, keeping you from getting burned out on the raunch.This movie's sense of restraint is best illustrated by what happens with Kirk, his ex-girlfriend and Molly. As mentioned, Kirk starts out so pathetic that he begs his ex to take him back two years after she broke up with him, even though she has a current boyfriend. When Molly comes into Kirk's life, though, he never even looks at his ex again. Now, I would bet there was a point in writing this script where the idea of Kirk remaining a little obsessed with his ex even as he gets closer to Molly had to have been awfully tempting to these filmmakers. It's a realistic emotional response for someone like Kirk and you could easily convince yourself that it would be hilarious on screen. But if they'd tried to put that in the movie, it probably would have ruined it.But, if the audience is supposed to want Kirk and Molly to end up together, it's not helpful to have Kirk not want that too. His inner conflict might appear to be a comedy gold mine, but it would only serve to distance or separate Kirk from the viewer. As strange as it is, Kirk being so shallow that he stops yearning for his ex as soon as something much hotter comes along, makes him a more relatable and enjoyable character to watch. Being able to leave this tangent well enough alone is precisely the sort of decision a good storyteller has to make if he wants to create something a lot of people will like instead of a few people adoring it.What keeps She's Out of My League from being a great movie is that Molly, though given as much personality as you could want by Alice Eve, is not much more than a plot device in Kirk's story. They're not equal characters. She's in his movie. Given that Kirk has both a funny quartet of friends, an annoyingly funny family, and ex-girlfriend and her new boyfriend while Molly has a bitchy best friend, a kid sister, a macho ex-boyfriend, her own parents and the kid sister's best friend, the cast should probably have been winnowed down a bit to give Molly a chance to connect with the viewer as a real person and make them care as much about her emotional issues as Kirk's. And if that time would have been spent with Molly in various stages of undress, all the better.And by the way, one of Kirk's best friends is played by Nate Torrence, who might as well change his name to Fat Nick Swardson because that's what he looks like. I don't know how many will care but if you want to see Swardson's overweight doppleganger, look no further. Just be prepared to be a little freaked out.",She's Out of My League

The film is pretty basic, with an average guy getting the attention of an above average girl. Of course, all his friends say it wont last, as do hers. Inappropriate family members, tactless friends, embarrassing situations, and comical exes are some of the predictable but reliable devices. There's a wealth of great supporting characters, especially T.J. Miller, who may start as a Seth Rogen clone, but soon evolves into his own persona. Torrence is a great lovable lug, with a penchant for Disney films.

Of course it transforms his character into a man whose self confidence is smaller than a pea. The movie runs slowly and don't catch us on the history. I got my mind out of the movie all the time and had to watch it back to pay attention in the scenes. The only part that satisfied me was when he introduced Molly to his jackass family and she showed that love doesn't require a bunch of items, only the feeling of being happy together. And showed that girls want they ex-boyfriends to keep wanting them hahah. Boring movie, I couldn't even laugh - just like any other romantic comedy.",She's Out of My League
35,Kamurai25,You're out of this movie's league,6,28 March 2020,"Decent watch, will likely watch again, and can recommend.The movie is funny enough: this cast has a somewhat stylized sense of humor, but the different personalities mix really well together on the friend side.The family side is another story: almost every aspect of Kirk's family is awkward at best.The movie also does the forced beauty thing with Alice Eve: every character tells us she's hot without the movie making me believe it first. And along side Krysten Ritter and Lindsay Sloane, I need some convincing.I'd care less, but this happens with her with MacDonald in The Decoy Bride (a better movie).",She's Out of My League
36,Matt_Layden,How can a 10 go for a 5?,6,4 September 2010,"Kirk works at an airport and is a 5. Molly is boarding a plane and she is a 10. She accidentally leaves her cell phone back in the terminal and he picks it up. As a thank you, she asks him out, sparks fly. But how can a 10 go for a 5? Well, I wouldn't call Jay Baruchel a 5 nor would I call Alice Eve a 10, but the characters in the film do, so let's go with it. She's Out Of My League is a date movie, not a raunchy comedy that some people expect. Except, there are two out of the ordinary scenes that seem to actually belong in a raunchy comedy film. Our lead ejaculates in his pants and a dog licks it, second he decides to shave his testicles, but gets a friend to do it. These bits seem straight out of an American Pie film and while they are funny, seem out of place here. Kirk's own insecurities are his downfall and that is what the antagonist is. Not the guy who tries to win her back, which is the way the film is advertised. This character is almost useless, he should have been more of a wedge between the two characters and create more conflict than what he did. The film suffers from no real conflict. The disputes they have in the film are easily fixable and seem way too minimal to really be used as a conflict in the relationship. The writing is funny at times, it mostly plays things safe. Which is why those two scenes still stick out like a sore thumb. Of course there is something that splits them up and then they have to race against time to get back together. He works at an airport, so I'll give you one guess as to what they are racing for. T.J. Miller, an unknown until that little film called Cloverfield came along, is the funniest part of this film. The guy has been in so many things since then and he really does have nice timing for comedy. He plays the friend of Kirk, one of three. The other two have smaller roles, but use their spotlighted time efficiently. She's Out Of My League is a mediocrely funny film. I didn't love it, nor did I really hate it. It's the kind of film that you have a good time while watching it, then almost forget about it the next day.",She's Out of My League
37,lewiskendell,A romantic comedy in disguise.,6,22 June 2010,"""Do you even know how hot you are?""She's out of My League is a fairly typical comedy. Jay Baruchel plays an utterly average guy named Kirk, who is nothing more than mediocre in every aspect of his life, career, and looks. When a chance encounter leads to him meeting Molly (Alice Eve), a nearly- flawless woman (seriously, she's gorgeous in this movie) who seems interested in him despite all odds, Kirk has to deal with the new experience of being a 5 who's dating a hard 10. So yeah, that's not exactly a fresh, new story. That can be forgiven in a comedy, as long as it's..well, comedic. The movie manages to be pretty funny at times, but a lot of the humor is hit or miss. Something hilarious would happen, and then you'll spend the next five minutes wondering whether what you're seeing is supposed to be funny or not. Jay has been much funnier in other movies, and the supporting cast wavers between humorous and annoying. Still, the jokes in She's out of my League succeed more often than they fail.The relationship between Kirk and Molly is a little hard to swallow at times, because she seems so determined to like him. Even though Kirk's personality in the movie isn't particularly remarkable. You actually start to believe their friends when they're constantly telling them that they're not going to work as a couple. The inevitable circumstances that cause problems for them seem extremely forced and predictable, as is their eventual reunion. There's little imagination involved in the story, that's for sure. It probably seems like I didn't particularly like the movie, but I did. It was quite funny in parts, and even the most generic parts of it weren't bad - just overly familiar. This isn't a bad comedy to check out, I just wouldn't go so far as to recommend buying it.",She's Out of My League
38,intelearts,My 326th Review: The most Perfect 5 film in search of more....,5,5 June 2010,"Kind of above average date movie - and that's a wrap folks. I don't know what to say - it's funny enough, and everything enough; here, there is no risk, no film, no reach for greatness it is just what it is a pleasant enough 80s style romantic comedy with the perfect girl falling for the dweeby guy.The family dinner was the highlight as it wasn't all out embarrassing but actually funny, but overall we were neither bored or thrilled.Like I say, you're going on a date and you want something that won't make you gag then this is it.Not bad, not bland just in no way anything you haven't seen before. It does get points for good chemistry and a fair measure of charm but plays it so safe that you'll have forgotten it the minute you leave the movie theater (we did).",She's Out of My League
39,Troy_Campbell,A surprising winner.,7,31 March 2010,"Expectations weren't exactly through the roof for SOOML. No big name actors, a director with no feature film experience and a screenplay by the same guys who brought us Sex Drive. It is with great delight then, that what we get is 100 minutes of laughter and light-hearted entertainment. Is it clichéd? Sure is. We've seen the 'underdog gets the girl' story repetitively since the dawn of cinema, but at least scripters John Morris and Sean Anders inject it with humorous variations to ensure we forgive their shortcomings in originality.Jay Baruchel was another unknown quantity. His supporting turns in Knocked Up, Fanboys, Tropic Thunder and Million Dollar Baby (remember the weakling who frequented the boxing hall despite his complete lack of talent – that was Baruchel) have provided laughs galore, but being the main star is different altogether. His geeky exterior and small frame isn't exactly leading man material however Baruchel's great comic timing and willingness to make a fool of himself if required makes him a likable headliner.On the opposite end of the gender pole is the drop-dead gorgeous Alice Eve who, like Molly, is a hard ten. It's not just her looks that makes her popular with the men though, she's genuinely cool and doesn't have a whiff of ego. Elsewhere in the cast you'll find the previously unknown T.J. Miller as Kirk's best mate Stainer – a character who resembles Napoleon Dynamite if he were on crack cocaine – who delivers a handful of memorable one-liners and plenty of laugh-out-loud moments.A charismatic cast and some hilarious jokes makes this a surprising winner.3.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",She's Out of My League
40,oneguyrambling,"Take another look at the poster. Now forget it – this film is not ""that"" film.",7,25 April 2011,"She's out of my League is no world beater but in the genre American Pie created a decade ago it is perhaps the most enjoyable sex-comedy that I can recall since The 40 Year old Virgin 5 years ago and way better than the lamentable American Pie.Kirk (Jay Baruchel) is a nice doormat of a guy. He is convinced that his skinny frame and odd look mean that he is destined for a women of similar external appearance, regardless of the fact that he is actually quite a nice guy. Hence he is distraught when his long time girlfriend Marnie dumps him and takes up with a doofus of a guy named Ron, who calls Kirk ""pirate"" (which for some reason I found absolutely hilarious). Why would Ron even have reason to talk to Kirk? Because Marnie gets along with Kirk's family so well that she continues to hang around them even though she has no real link anymore.Kirk works at airport security with a bunch of boneheaded – yet strangely realistic – guys who take every shortcut possible and indulge every opportunity to chat up anything vaguely hot that has the temerity to want to board an aircraft. Two of Kirk's buds are fun loving, foul mouthed party dudes, and the other a chubby married guy who quotes fairy tales and Disney films. Kirk's best friend is named Stainer, who looks like Napoleon Dynamite and sounds just like Earl from My Name is Earl, Stainer is crude, rude and bizarrely self confident, he provides many of the laughs in the film through his inane and ridiculous poorly thought out statements.Of course the title tells us that someone a little opposite will cross Kirk's trajectory – her name is Molly and they meet when Kirk saves her the embarrassment of an overzealous strip search from a desperate and opportunistic security dork. Later when she leaves her phone behind he has reason to meet again to drop the phone off. A series of coincidences later and she asks him on a date.Alice Eve plays Molly and she is indeed out of Kirk's league – and in fact out of the league of 99.78% of the known universe. There is no scene in this film when she is allowed to look anything less than a 9.87 / 10, and of course she is also funny, nice and understanding too, *SIGH*.So a couple of dates in and Kirk realises what he is up against, it seems that Molly is successful and well liked on top of being smokin' hot, and that almost every elite sportsman or good looking guy knows her better than Kirk.Of course Kirk has doubts that this will all work and keeps waiting for the other shoe to drop and for Molly to turf him. His friends and family don't help much either, his buddies count the seconds until he gets the arse and explain why in painstaking detail, and his family loves Molly more than they apparently love Kirk and openly wonder why she chose him.The movie is pretty formulaic and I grew frustrated at the usual dumb and inexplicable decisions and developments, but in the main the clever dialogue and realistic characters kept me from giving up on the film.Being a sex-comedy there are hijinks galore – nothing too graphic – although one scene has a fairly unpleasant *ahem* outcome and is particularly squirmworthy for all involved. The chatter is most definitely MA in tone and covers a wide array of off-colour topics, generally in an amusing and not too disgusting way.I've already shown my lit torch for Molly but the rest of the cast are well chosen and appropriate to their roles also, Kirk's family are a crazy hodge podge of nutbags and lunatics, Kirk's friends are crude but once again in a strangely realistic manner and Molly is effortlessly likable and understandably sought after.I watched this film as a concession to my wife, thinking she would get something out of it, in the end she went to sleep and I continued watching and waiting for Molly to get her shirt off to see how it would all turn out and hoping everyone would just be happy.Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. In general these films really aren't my thing, but an absence of loathsome and vacuous teens, the presence of some amusing banter, and an abundance of Alice Eve make this film worth watching, even if the poster screams ""avoid"".",She's Out of My League

He expects the hammer to fall at any time. In one of the great lines of romantic comedy moviedom, his friend says of a prior relationship ""I was a 6, maybe a 7, but she was a hard ten .... I just couldn't beat the spread"". The same is expected by Baruchel and the question becomes can he live with the fact that his girlfriend is much better looking (and successful) than him? Eve is great, Baruchel is great, his little ensemble of friends play well, including an old girlfriend reinterested in him given his success with Eve. There are the usual embarrassing scenes that are in every movie of this sort but I found this more intelligent and several steps above most of the entries in the American Pie/Porky's genre.

42,napierslogs,Enough good things going for it,7,25 June 2010,"""She's Out of My League"" has a number of good things going for it.Most of the funny lines are given to the less-capable, 'best friend' actors, their delivery of the comedy makes it somewhat funny. But this movie isn't about them, it's about likable loser Kirk played by Jay Baruchel. Baruchel's rise to the king of comedy is continuing right on course and he out-shines his co-stars. Although the beautiful Alice Eve was perfectly cast as his counter-part and she might get more notice too. ""She's Out of My League"" is your fairly typical comedic romance. I wouldn't say romantic comedy because its more male-oriented and is going for comedy first. For me the good thing about it is that the comedy is fairly tame. I was never grossed-out and it isn't childish either. I wasn't expecting to agree with most reviewers, but they did find the perfect balance between sweet and raunchy (on the mild side) and should be able to maintain both a teenage and adult audience.""She's Out of My League"" doesn't go over the top and has a wide appeal. Should be an enjoyable hour and 45 minutes. It's also the perfect vehicle that Baruchel needs to gain more popularity as he takes over the independent world and the Hollywood world.

The idea of a movie studying the concept of an incredibly attractive woman going for a normal guy is a grand idea, but it does have it's low moments. Jay Baruch's friends act as if they're stoned through much of the movie, their ideas and suggestions are idiotic, Jay's family is strictly trailer park and there's a lot of incessant swearing - no one in the real world talks like this. Jay's life is not only separate from that of Alice Eve, it's basically the Jerry Sprimger Universe highlighted by Lindsay Sloane playing a bitch - a major turn for everyone who liked her on ""Sabrina The Teenage Witch."" In the top role, Alice Eve is a delight; she looks like Reese Witherspoon with the DNA of Jessica Simpson whereas Baruchel looks like the lost love child of William Shatner and Demi Moore.

Considering the cast was made up of mostly unknowns, and considering I didn't remember a theatrical release(at least a successful one), I didn't expect much going into this one.About 10 minutes in I was still the skeptic, but the film started to make me chuckle. As the film went on all the dialog got even funnier. The lead, and his merry band of 'aviation' misfits started to absolutely crack me up. Dare I say that this films' dialog is funnier than 'Superbad', and one of the funnier and more enjoyable date movies I've seen since 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'.Jay Baruchel is what D.J. Qualls could never be. He's a geek, but he comes off as believable, he can actually act a little bit(Qualls is awful - I only brought this up because it's important to have a geek that can also act). It's also important to have the geek have some redeemable qualities. In this one, Baruchel makes Molly(Alice Eve) laugh. Eve is a perfect match for Baruchel - the chemistry which is so hard for a movie like this to pull-off - is actually quite successful. The script is strong, and the leads' family is as funny as his airport friends. The romance comes off as believable, and the film never loses pace. This is definitely good for the genre. I can recommend this to just about everyone except kids - as there are some risqué scenes and strong language.She's Out of My League is a great sleeper choice to grab off the shelf. 65/100Didn't expect any of this to work, but almost all of it does.You'll like it if you liked: The Girl Next Door, Mallrats, and Can't Hardly Wait.",She's Out of My League

Despite dating sites that can match up people based on their ""compatability"" with a lot of questionnaires and computer programs, it's either there, or it isn't. But nowhere is it more unexpected than between Kirk (Jay Baruchel), a scrawny TSA worker and Molly (Alice Eve), a blonde bombshell with a successful party planning business.There really isn't much of a story here; like the best romances, it's more about the characters than the plot. Speaking of, ""romance"" is the more prominent genre at play here. Although there are a few funny scenes, this isn't ""The 40-Year Old Virgin."" Jay Baruchel is probably the most likable geek out there. Michael Cera may have cornered the indie crowd, but Baruchel is less alienating.

52,CANpatbuck3664,Not a Masterpiece but an Underrated Rom/Com Gem,9,10 November 2016,"It would have been really easy to miss this movie. You tend to get a few different romantic comedies a year and most of them filter into static. Unless you're a really big fan of the genre, for me at least (romantic comedies are fine but they aren't my genre of choice) they go in one ear and out the other. Every so often one seems to stick (Morning Glory, About Last Night and Definitely Maybe would be my other picks from the last few years) and this was one of those movies for me. Some funny dialogue, characters that you can relate to and a genuinely sweet relationship go a long way and that's why I'm coming back to review this movie *Minor Spoilers Ahead* We join Kirk (Jay Baruchel) as he's rehearsing a speech to try and convince his ex-girlfriend Marnie (Lindsay Sloane) to get back together with him. Instead of being supportive, his group of friends: Stainer (T.J. Miller), Mike Vogel (Jack) and Devon (Nate Torrence) take turns roasting him on why it's a terrible idea. They mock Kirk for being unattractive and try to tell him getting back together is a mistake. Kirk's lonely since their breakup however and brushes his friends off as being resentful because they weren't big fans of MarnieThe movie flashes ahead to Kirk actually giving Marnie the speech and a crappy piece of jewellery. To Kirk's horror she not only turns him down but refuses to leave because she's grown attached to Kirk's family. She's got a new boyfriend who also hangs around Ron (Hayes MacArthur) and it turns out minus his mom (Debra Jo Rupp), his entire family are a bunch of jerks.Kirk heads off to work at the airport as TSA and a beautiful woman walks in. Her name is Molly (Alice Eve) and everyone starts to stare when she passes by. Despite her friendly demeanour she gets some unwanted attention from Kirk's boss. Kirk helps her out and gets her on her way. Once she boards she realizes she left her phone back in security. Kirk answers her call from her friend's phone and she promises to meet up with him once she gets back from her trip.If you read the plot summary, it seems pretty average. I would agree with that criticism but the characters pick up the slack. I found it easy to identify with Kirk, he's stuck in a dead end job and he wants more but he's just as confused as the audience when this beautiful woman pays attention to him. He's an average guy but he's also easy to root for. Molly is also a great character, you find out she has her own motivations for being interested in Kirk but she's impressive inside and out. She's cool and she's not shallow at all and she and Kirk are good for each other. The side characters like Stainer and Devon don't have much development but they're there more for the comedy than to add to the plot. I also think that the movie comes to a nice conclusion, sure it has the feel good aspect but they keep it funny and it achieves a good balance. She's Out of My League has a good message as well, it's nothing new but it has some relevance today about how the important thing is being self-confident and not underestimating your chances and who you are.Most comedies rely a lot on ad-libbing but they can't hold up over the course of the movie. I found that this movie did excel in that area. Having some great comedians like Jay Baruchel and T.J. Miller pay off for the movie, the dialogue whether it was scripted or not was hilarious. Comedy is subjective and there is some stuff here that won't work for everyone (there's some gross out humour but they don't overdo it) but I've seen this movie more than a few times and I laugh a lot every single viewing.When I talk about the cast, I look back on this movie and I struggle to see why this movie didn't lead to bigger things for the bigger stars of She's Out of My League. T.J. Miller is on Silicon Valley and Krysten Ritter is the star of Jessica Jones and they're both pretty good here. I think this movie shows that Jay Baruchel can carry a comedy by himself. He's often hanging out with Seth Rogen and the gang (This is the End is a crazy funny comedy) but he does a solid job as the lead in this movie. I also think that Alice Eve shines here, much like Margot Robbie or Emma Stone she's gorgeous but she shows a lot of charisma and she's funny in certain scenes. She might not be on their level but there are shades of that here. I would have thought she'd be grabbing higher profile projects but I can't imagine that most people would walk away with bad things to say after watching this movie. Lindsay Sloane is also a riot, she bounces off Baruchel and Miller really well and completely holds her own.I would never claim that this movie is a landmark in cinema or that it reinvents the romantic comedy genre but for me it's a really funny movie with a sweet enough relationship at the centre of it. I like the characters, the jokes, the actors/actresses and it's held up pretty well after multiple viewings. I can't ask for much more than that and if you're in the mood for something like this, it's definitely worth a watch.",She's Out of My League
53,johnnymonsarrat,"Better than the trailers... A typical romantic comedy, but solid & with a fantastic ending!",7,17 March 2010,"I'm a guy who prefers action movies and not quite the romantic comedy type, so I wasn't expecting much from She's Out of My League from the trailers, and the oddly touched up movie poster that leaves Jay Baruchel looking not quite human. However, I was surprised to find it an enjoyable comedy.The film centers around Kirk Kettner (Jay Baruchel) a man with self- esteem problems whom a dream girl (Alice Eve) fancies. I never really felt the chemistry between the two leads since the premise -- his anxiety -- kept getting in the way. In fact the premise is sort of beaten to death, making the film a little repetitive. I'm reminder of the film Forgetting Sarah Marshall, in which the premise is that a couple breaks up and runs into each other. But after a half hour, the film goes in new directions. She's Out of My League never escapes its premise. That being said, the supporting cast are all given something real to do and characterizations that are mostly real. I was particularly amused by T.J. Miller's performance as the best guy friend.There's some original toilet humor and plenty of laugh out loud moments, especially those involving Kirk's family. However, plenty of moments flop as well, such as picking a fight in a bowling alley. Alice Eve played her role a little too straight, in my opinion, unlike her best girl friend, played by Krysten Ritter, who was just wacky enough to keep the comedic momentum going. Do you know what I'm talking about? If the pain and conflict that keep plot tension going are a little too real, it's not as comedic. I'm thinking of the films ""Meet the Parents"" and ""Meet the Fockers"" in which the characters are all a little batty and we can tell that any conflict is cartoony and not going to lead to real pain.That being said, the film has a phenomenal ending, and this is why you should go to see it. Everyone's felt the frustration of flying through airport security and the film ends with a power fantasy of circumventing that, in a harmless way that involves the entire cast of supporting characters. It's even better than the airport ending of ""Love, Actually.""So yes, if your girlfriend wants to take you to see this, go! It's a solid comedy, not one for the ages, but worth your time.I'll give She's Out of My League a respectable 7 out of 10.",She's Out of My League
54,the-movie-guy,You can fulfill your dream and go for the gold,7,10 March 2010,"(Synopsis) Molly (Alice Eve) is a sexy event planner who is delayed by a sleazy airport security guard. Another security guard, Kirk (Jay Baruchel) comes to her rescue, and passes her through to catch her plane. Luckily, Kirk finds Molly's phone that she left behind, and from the plane, Molly calls her phone and invites Kirk to a party to return her phone when she returns. Kirk is smitten by Molly, but his friends point out to him that he doesn't have a chance, because he is only rated as a ""5"" and Molly is definitely a ""10"". And as everybody knows, you can only date a girl who is only ""2"" above your score, so that means Kirk can only successfully date a ""7"". However, Molly has something else in mind, because she has found that Kirk is sweet, amusing, honest, and different from the men she has been dating. Kirk, on the other hand, has one big insecurity problem; Kirk believes Molly will dump him as soon as she realizes her mistake. Under these circumstances, and everything working against Kirk and Molly, is it possible for them to build a relationship that will bloom and flourish? (My Comment) This is an unlikely love story that is a really sweet romantic comedy. You would think that it is a women's movie, but it actually is a guy's movie, because it gives the ""5s"" of the world the belief that they have a chance to catch and have a relationship with a ""10"". The trailers portray that there are a lot of raunchy sex scenes in the movie, but actually, it is more your imagination then the real thing. The story does show and prove that a person with low self esteem will have a hard time in life fulfilling his dream. Hopefully, people who saw this movie will take this lesson of life to heart and go for the gold, or in this case a ""10"". Jay Baruchel's performance as the quirky geek was right on target, and Alice Eve's portrayal of Molly made her very likable. Both actors characterization of the low self-image problem was very believable. This is one of those hilariously funny love stories that could be a sleeper hit. I laughed throughout the whole movie, and left the movie in a happy mood. (Paramount, Run Time 1:44, Rated R)(7/10)",She's Out of My League

56,scottshak_111,Funny yet romantic,7,28 August 2010,Jay Baruchel plays the character of Kirk who is a failure in the game of love and who is rated a 5 by his friends who also rate Alice Eve as a hard 10 ( dude she deserves it!). The movie is about a guy who thinks the girl is out of her league and that he won't be able to get her however the girl takes an interest in him instead. Kirk's lack of confidence (as Baruchel depicts himself as a total jerk) and of course the ratings of his friends lowers down his expectations and makes him question his self-esteem. He keeps on considering the fact that he did not deserve a girl like her in his life. There are some funny moments in the movie as well. The scene at the dining table and the one in the plane were really humorous. I fell of my seat at the spot when Jay Baruchel abuses his entire family after a long speech and tries to get off the plane but ends up sitting next to them with the middle finger of Dylan (his brother) at his face. I found Kyle Bornheimer really funny. His lines were great and I found myself laughing out loud. Kirk was at times pathetic with his demeaning acts but if you are in the movie you will definitely get used to it. The theme of the movie was good which I think carried the movie through. There were some great hilarious moments in the movie thanks to the presence of his friends like Stainer and Devon. Overall the movie deserves a 7 as a romantic comedy. I'd recommend all the movie lovers to go for it as the movie is really worth watching. Guys will definitely fall in love with Alice Eve which I think is a surety watching my case.,She's Out of My League
57,barrys82,Nothing special but worth give it a chance,7,31 July 2010,"She's out my league tells the story of An average Joe meets the perfect woman, but his lack of confidence and the influence of his friends and family begin to pick away at the relationship. It has a lot of influence from Judd Apatow's movies, following the same formula of the loser guy or a 5 having a crush for a perfect 10. The story is good but a little predictable, the plot is well developed. It has some funny jokes and situations but also some corny ones. It has a decent cast mainly formed by new faces but with decent performances.. In conclusion, She's out of your league is a movie which only purpose is to entertain, it isn't something great but it is pretty recommendable to watch it on a weekend with nothing to do in good company of friends, family or someone special",She's Out of My League
58,Jackpollins,This year's The Hangover,9,12 March 2010,"She's Out Of My League stars Jay Baruchel as Kirk, a socially awkward, but well meaning and nice airport security worker. Kirk is nice, and is the kind of guy who's really nice to hang around with but is kind of strange. One day, Molly (Alice Eve), a perfect looking woman steps into the airport. Molly leaves her I-phone at airport security, and after returning it to her, she takes him, her friend, Patty (Krysten Ritter, excellent in her role), and Kirk's friend, Stainer (TJ Miller, also excellent) to a hockey game. At the game, Patty explains to Kirk that Molly's into him. Thus begins a beautiful, sweet, and very funny relationship between Molly and Kirk. Kirk has a family of really mean-spirited people, except for his mother (Debra Jo Rupp). Kirk's family is probably the best part of the film. They are truly hilarious. The family also includes his deceiving ex-girlfriend, Marny (Lindsay Sloane), and her new boyfriend, Ron (Hayes MacArthur). This family is filled with truly mean people, and it's so much fun to watch them be so mean. Overall, Burachel, Eve, and the supporting cast gives this movie the sweetness and charm it needs to be one of my favorite films thus far this year, and as of now, this year's The Hangover.",She's Out of My League
59,Donatien3,enjoyable gross-out comedy,9,5 April 2010,"'She's Out of My League' addresses the fantasy of every socially awkward young man – hooking up with a hotter woman.Kirk (Jay Baruchel) is a typical Average Joe: he's scrawny, uncoordinated, has a menial job in airport security (where he hangs out with his friends), a crazy ex who has a close relationship with his family, and only rates himself a ""soft five"". Then he meets Molly (Alice Eve) – a ""hard 10"" - after she leaves her IPhone behind at airport security. Kirk offers to give it back and he and the grateful Molly bond, helped but a mutual love of ice hockey. Despite the disbelief of both Kirk's and Molly's friends, the unlikely pair hook up. Unilke Kirk, Molly seemingly has it all - the looks, the body, a nice car and a dream job as an event planner.The film doesn't stray too far from the typical formula, including a last-minute dash-to-the-airport finale, but that isn't a bad thing. It also borrows from the crude-yet-sweet Judd Apatow movies and some 'American Pie' style gross-out set pieces (the highlight being an unfortunate ""accident' from an over-aroused Jay). The film earns its MA rating with plenty of course language and sexual references.Baruchel fills the likable loser role recently filled by Seth Rogen, and his relationship with Molly (including all his subsequent self-doubt) is reasonably believable. Molly – by contrast – is surrounded with an almost angelic light in nearly every scene, and her friendship with the pretty-yet-bitchy Patty (Krysten Ritter) accentuates her seeming perfection.While 'She's Out of My League' may not provide anything too original, the sum of its parts provides an entertaining comedy.",She's Out of My League

Then one day, it's beautiful goddess walks into the airport and while she's being sexually harassed by his boss, he realizes that she's about to miss her flight and comes to her rescue putting his job on the line, and something just clicks. I don't want to give away any details that might make this a spoiler but we'll leave it at this, for the typical equation for a chick flick, they have there problems that pull them apart and bring them back together and pull them apart again, so the movie kind of drags at parts, but it's a really good feel good movie for a long boring day in where you just need to feel a little bit of sunshine.

61,Jerique,"She's Not Out of His League, but she's still hot.",8,24 March 2010,"Alice Eve and Jay Baruchel have good chemistry in this vulgar, raunchy comedy about a chance meeting and where the mediocre looking guy gets this super model-esquire type girl.I found a good portion of this movie to be somewhat similar to Knocked Up and Superbad kinda clashing together. There's a lot of good funny jokes in the movie and it's still romantic at times. I thought the idea was very inspired and it could happen.The downside and I suppose ultimate flaw of this movie is that it couldn't ever happen this way. Molly (Alice Eve) misplaces her phone and Kirk (Jay Baruchel) is the one who answers when her friend decides to call it. Although that this could happen, it's very unlikely that the person would hold on to the phone for a complete stranger but it's even more slim chances that the girl would date the friendly stranger.It's the basic Hollywood plot where something goes terribly wrong, separating the two involved. However, when watching this movie the part where everything goes wrong...kinda makes you go, ""huh?"" This movie's device to put space between Molly and Kirk doesn't seem to work here and I won't give it away but when you see it for yourself, you'll understand what I mean.It's not an elite A-list cast film, but then again 40 Year Old Virgin was a bunch of nobodies and it's one of the most acclaimed films now. It's not for younger audiences. It's also not for people who are easily offended. It's crude, vulgar and profane.

TSA security man Kirk played subtly by (Jay Baruchel) meets this dynamic and beautiful woman Molly (Alice Eve) at the security check-in and forgets her phone. The following day Kirk and his friend Devon (Nate Torrence) return it to her at an art exhibit party. From there the film goes into a spiral of sorts with weird scenes and not really comical timing, just a lot of cussing and ill placed one liners.

65,perkypops,It may be patchy but it is still entertaining,6,20 May 2011,"There is something charming about the central premise of this film that, in love, looks and many other things do not matter. It is connection that matters and no one but no one knows how it works. Just as we have over expectations so we may also have under expectations, and they all just get in the way of err, life.In scratching away the follies of expectation, under or over, the film also manages to barely negotiate self esteem, rather confusing it with self confidence which, although related, is not the same thing. But it is a nice attempt at dispelling the notion that only certain people are ever 'good' enough. The film also does a neat job with honesty too, but, as in all things fiction, it kind of doesn't entirely convince.The acting is generally okay, Jay Baruchel doing a fair job as the male lead Kirk, and Alice Eve, as Molly (who, if the title of the film is to be believed, is out of almost anyone's league, stunningly beautiful with her blue eye and green eye) very convincing too. Mike Vogel, as Jack, also does really well.The story is neatly told with the necessary meddlesome and irksome twists although I wasn't convinced the last two minutes of the movie were really necessary but that is probably just me.So a little uneven and mixed up psychology apart, it is a good film and does the job of entertaining in a pleasing way.A six out of ten which could have been more but for the patches.",She's Out of My League
66,colinrgeorge,"""She's Out of My League""",5,8 April 2010,"We both know ""She's Out of My League"" is a lame duck. The evidence is irrefutable based on the trailer alone. On the dystopian plane of teenage sex comedies, the product falls squarely in the hellacious center, with every shopworn semen gag and punch-out character archetype hitting their tired romcom marks in predictable sequence. It's bad. But there's one thing the movie has going for it that salvages the experience and carries it halfway to 'guilty pleasure' territory—star Jay Baruchel.He almost seems to have teleported into ""She's Out of My League"" from some better film, with an authentically charming take on its prototypical loser protagonist, Kirk. In the interest of full disclosure, I admit I've had a thing for Baruchel ever since seeing him alongside the comedic heavyweights in ""Tropic Thunder"" two years ago, and here he somehow manages to sell a film otherwise inundated with dislikable and unfunny characters. He brings an accessibility to the role that made following him breezily palatable, even when by every other conceivable measure, I should have been apathetic and frustrated.Kirk's friends are the worst offenders. They're not real people. We're talking about characters like ""Stainer"" (Stifler, anyone?), the arrogant, romantically successful one who turns out not to be all that romantically successful; Devon, a stocky married bloke whose single point of reference seems to be the work of Walt Disney; and last and least interestingly, Alice Eve as the ""hard 10"" love interest, Molly. The character is sold to the audience on her looks alone, presumably because there's nothing else remotely interesting about her. She's the personification of a plot device, and ""She's Out of My League"" wears its on its sleeve.At least in the grand gross-out tradition, the film follows through on a few comedic premises that risk making the audience uncomfortable, which is more than I can say for something like ""Hot Tub Time Machine,"" which has vulgarity to spare but wants too badly to be cool to even let its characters come off as situationally homosexual. A scene in ""League"" has Devon shaving Kirk's genitals in preparation for a hot date with Molly, which actually prompted a pick-up truck in the front row of the drive-in to turn the ignition and turn tail. In truth, the scene isn't particularly funny, but I do give it credit for taking that risk.Or there's the climax of the film, which also momentarily jukes convention, making for one of the more legitimately amusing scenes. Beforehand, Kirk and Molly have had a falling out that leads him and his bitchy ex to reunite for a family vacation. On the plane, Kirk makes the obligatory eleventh hour decision to abandon the trip and his unsupportive family in a profanity-laced tirade. He turns to walk off—But it's too late. He quietly retakes his seat.It's rare moments like those, along with the consistently relatable performance by Jay Baruchel, that kept ""She's Out of My League"" from getting on my nerves, even over the extent of the slightly bloated running time. It's a played story brimming with bad characters, but I make no apology for having had a decent time with it anyway.The evidence is irrefutable, though on second thought, halfway to guilty pleasure ain't bad either.",She's Out of My League

Don't get me wrong, I like this movie, the acting was good and the chemistry was fine but the issue is the ending which is just a mishmash of nonsense in which everyone breaks numerous air safety laws and in real life they would have been all arrested. This spoils what was an OK story and a enjoyable if not simple plot. The one real problem I have is the concept that Alice Eve is the pettiest girl in the world, all they keep doing is calling her a 10 through the whole film and although she is very attractive, she is not a 10, at least not to the point that every man is drooling over her. In fact her friend played by Krysten Ritter is almost as good looking. This is a fun night out for couples and should cause a lot of fights as to who is better looking out of the two of you.",She's Out of My League
68,blacklist-1,"Charming with heart and some good laughs, but not enough and with most of the character's acting very immaturely.",6,28 June 2010,"She's Out of My League certainly surpasses a couple of romantic comedies I've seen at the cinema this year and that is The Bounty Hunter and Killers. But it fails to be more than it could have been potentially and settles into the category of enjoyable escapism of your average American teen rom-com.The basic story is that geeky Kirk (Jay Baruchel) who works as airport security who dosen't think he's good enough for gorgeous Molly (Alice Eve) when she asks him out. He tries to keep her interested as much as his can while facing his friends, family her and his ex's trying to put him down. He's suffers from a lack of self esteem and believes Molly isn't good enough for him because she is so 'hot'. At first she only dates him because she dosen't want to be hurt again as she was by an ex boyfriend, so she dates Kirk because his different and she would be playing it 'safe' but she does fall for him. Where Kirk's low confidence comes from is his family and most of his friends who act like immature idiots and instead of helping him (though that is their supposed intention, they just get him down) like T.J Miller who plays Stainer and Mike Vogel as Jack. This is where the film is let down slightly as the moments where the family are meant to be funny, sadly they act inappropriately like when Kirk takes Molly to meet his family and they are eating at the table and they act like morons (and as a result, the intended laugh's are not funny). It's a wonder Molly just didn't walk out on them. One of his friends though Devon played well by Nate Torrence provides Kirk with consistently good advice in terms of Molly and just advises him to be his self, which articulates maturity on his part as he is married. Due to his maturity, he gets some laughs that are genuinely funny. I felt sorry for Kirk with the way most of his family and friends treat him like his ex girlfriend (no wonder he probably is the way he is), but there is a fine scene that had me cheering as it parallelled my own thoughts about them, where he is on a plane and tells his family and ex girlfriend what he really thinks of them and even better when he hits his ex girlfriend with a bag when he rushes to be with Molly and she chases him trying to hurt him was great! What does save this movie is some funny moments as described like those above though they are unfortunately to and far between, but the biggest strength, despite a bad script is the two leads who are likable with nice chemistry between them, particularly Molly who is so polite. Alice Eve radiates self confidence on the screen and settles into her role gracefully. She is someone with a great future and was a pleasure to watch. As her character she helps Kirk become more than he believes he can be, which makes her even more likable. She gives the film and Jay Baruchel as Kirk plenty of charm and heart. A nice rom-com but nothing special. With less immature supporting characters and more laughs this could have been a winner but it's still worth seeing for it's hour and forty five minutes, which are thoroughly entertaining.",She's Out of My League

70,Simon_Says_Movies,Try's to have its cake and have sex with it too,6,8 April 2010,"She's out of My League is the type of film that seems to suffer from a crisis of identity; is it a romantic comedy or an Apatow-esquire combination of raunch and insight? Jay Baruchel's first starring vehicle tries to have its cake and have sex with it too, and winds up splitting its resources to less effective result.Frankly put, She's out of My League is not funny. There is the scattered chuckle and a few moments worthy of a laugh but for the most part the narrative just hums along; never becoming outwardly awful nor achieving anything memorable. The films saving grace is the chemistry between Jay Baruchel and Alice Eve which at times is so strong it almost makes the movie worth seeing in spite of itself. If SooML had concentrated on the romantic efforts, I feel like something excellent could have sprung forth, but with its scattershot approach we have only the leads on which to lean.Perhaps the most refreshing thing about League is that Eve's Molly is actually a nice person. She is not manipulative, hot-but bitchy or using our nerdy hero for her own purposes. Usually in a movie like this we have the girl-best friend who unbeknownst to our swooning protagonist holds a flame, and after the hottie eventually betrays him, he finds love has been beside him all along, etc, etc. We don't have this here; there are now competing forces for Kirk's affections and the film and the audience win because of it.There is a lame ongoing gag where our leads are rated; Kirk is a '5' and whatever number you receive, the laws of nature inhibit you from deviating more than 2 'points' in either direction. Enter Molly, a hard '10' and after leaving her cell phone at the airport where our geeky Romeo is employed she becomes somewhat smitten (feelings which he immediately returns) to the astonishment of his friends who can't believe his luck. From there we get our normal rom-com story arch which as I stated is heavily bolstered by amazing chemistry and performances from the star-crossed lovers.Also like many movies of this ilk, the friends of the leads are jerks/bitches who more than once, accidentally or intentionally pull Kirk and Molly apart. I don't understand this resurfacing convention but it grows more distasteful with every film. Thankfully some of these characters undergo an epiphany so they do not remain totally repulsive characters. She's out of My League is unimposing and sweet, and is not above a watch on a date night or rainy Sunday but it certainly nothing to rush out to see in theatres.Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",She's Out of My League

76,C-Younkin,Surprisingly convincing,7,12 March 2010,"""She's out of My League"" is a solid 7, a romantic comedy that scores a few good laughs and does a nice job of being convincing. Jay Baruchel (Tropic Thunder) stars as Kirk, a pathetic dork with the build of Woody Allen who works a menial job in airport security. Through a cell-phone mishap, he winds up at a party being thrown by Molly (Alice Eve), a 10 on the very attractive scale. He knows she's way more attractive than him and she knows he's normally not the guy she would usually date but Molly looks deep down and sees Kirk for the nice, unthreatening guy he is and they hit it off. There are some funny moments here. Kirk's family is especially demeaning to him (they even embrace his bitchy ex-girlfriend as one of their own) and his friends are clueless match-makers, which leads to a very funny man-scaping scene between Kirk and one of them. What works best in ""League"" is just listening to people talk though. Kirk's friends (played by Mike Vogel, Nate Torrance, and T.J Miller) are identifiable idiots, too wrapped up in over-thinking things like the rating scale (both their number and womens) and Disney fairy-tales to really understand women. Their scenes with Kirk are enjoyably like a crude, vulgar, sexual ""Breakfast Club"". The way the scrawny, nervous, and unconfident Baruchel interacts with the beautiful and engaging Eve is also very likable and they do a nice job of handling the ups and downs of forming an honest, meaningful relationship (an almost foreign concept in today's star-packaged romantic comedies). The way they finally handle the elephant in the room is also very effective. This is feel-good stuff, but it works.",She's Out of My League

The scene were he delivers the line 'I ejaculated in my pants...' should have been a gut buster. Instead he blows the delivery and the joke falls like a lead balloon. And why use the awkward word 'ejaculate'? Why not use 'cum', said too low, and have the women ask for clarification, could have been hilarious.The scene were he shaves his bits for his date, I believe is a movie first, along the lines of 'There's something about Mary' and 'American Pie' which share movie firsts of other similar, 'crotch humor', should have been hilarious. Instead we are treated to a very suggestive gay scene with his married older friend going down on him with a razor. As if ANY friend other than a completely gay one would volunteer for THAT mission!The movie is full of these extremely unlikely events turned into jokes. I know I'm supposed to leave my plausibility meter at the door for chick flicks like these, but come ON!The lead is clearly not a total dwebe-geek. He is confident and humorous with the gorgeous girl right from the first scene. THAT IS NOT a dork! He has some marginal self-esteem issues, MOST GUYS DO! Finally, and perhaps fatally, the chemistry between the two leads is Luke warm to say the least.

It clearly falls in one of the most clichéd of all film genres and stars only one person I have ever heard of. But I went to see it anyway and I was glad I did.I think I liked it mostly because of the leads. I liked the guy because he never tried to impress the girl, he was just himself, even when it was painful and difficult to do so, and I liked the girl because once you got past her looks, you found an interesting person underneath.The other big reason I liked it was because it managed to take one of the oldest romantic clichés ever--racing to the airport to declare your love before that Perfect Someone leaves--and put a nice twist on it. Kudos to the writers on that one, that alone was worth several points on this scale.This is actually one of the better movies I've seen this year, I highly recommend it.",She's Out of My League

85,mephotography2001,Better Rom-Com Than Most,7,11 February 2014,"For as much as I can admit this is a relatively formulaic romantic comedy that kinda tells you most of the story in the title, I must say I enjoyed this one quite a bit more than the average rom-com, and not just because of Alice Eve's lingerie scene (though, WHOA...). Proclaimed on the cover as ""The funniest comedy since 'The Hangover' "" (again?), I found it significantly funnier and not worthy of the comparison. Besides the main story, there's a hilarious sub-plot about they guy's ex-girlfriend basically being adopted by his family and he has to endure not just her presence at every gathering, but her new boyfriend's as well. Plus there's that underwear scene. Lots of humor in the uncomfortable parts (and Jay Baruchel is uncomfortable pretty much all the time), the couple is believable for being worlds apart on the attractiveness scale, and the ancillary characters are enjoyable. There's a bit of raunchiness, but it is an R-rated comedy. And did I mention Alice Eve in her skivvies? 7/10",She's Out of My League

88,gorgonite,Nice,10,19 January 2014,"She's Out Of My League is a slightly over the top romantic comedy with a big heart.An hour into the film I looked at my watch! That however is a good thing because I didn't want it to end. Then 3/4 into it the inevitable happened, the obligatory boy loses girl.So really it should be a solid 7 or 8/10. However instead of a tacked on ending, we get to enjoy a great finale which turns it right round.The main characters are a rather weak looking and pathetically 'nice' Jay Baruchel with a rather pretty and adorable Alice Eve. Supporting Jay are a motley crew of pals who try their best to remote control him and get the girl who is most definitely out of his league!Supporting Alice is the straight talking Krysten Ritter, who doesn't have much to work with but sparkles. The same also applies to Nate Torrence who was great!Jay and his crew work in airport security whilst Alice is a party planner who is frisked through by Jay. Chaos and order ensues!Pros - Sweet, Funny, Rude, BootlaceCons - Too short!Overall - 11 out of 10",She's Out of My League
89,mjk280,Nothing special but it's definitely watchable.,5,7 February 2011,"(I apologize in advance for not noting the names of the characters and their respective actors. It's been a few days and there really wasn't anyone in this movie that had a great performance or had done much else I've seen in the past)I don't expect much from movies like this. Movies are so hit and miss nowadays it's hard to expect a lot from a comedy with a not so original premise and not much fanfare. Not that a movie needs to be hyped to be good (far from it) but I think you know what I mean.This movie fills the minimum quota of laughs and they're spread out pretty evenly throughout the film. It's somewhat juvenile but that should be expected going in. Regardless if you feel you're above that don't bother. The rest of the movie is fine it's just not very original.The answer to why this girl is going out of her way for the main character isn't really convincing. She's dated attractive meatheads her whole life and wants to go in the complete opposite direction. Okay that's cliché but I can accept that. The thing is there's pretty much zero chemistry between the two characters and no realistic arc of them getting together. She just picks him because he's not a gorgeous narcissist and that's it. She admits as much later on but it still doesn't explain why she puts up with so many strange things his family puts her through or his particularly unusual lack of self-esteem. I mean near the end of the movie it seems like it's been months since they started dating and for some reason he still can't believe she likes him and still isn't comfortable being around her. That's very hard for the viewer to believe and if he really was THAT devoid of self-esteem there's no way she would have ever even taken a shot at going out with him. I know it's just a comedy but a little believability on the part of the actors would have been nice. You get what you pay for in this case I suppose.The only other complaint I had was that the ending was not only a cliché that's been done a thousand times but that it was drug out for far too long. At least make it quick if you're going to make us sit through something we've seen a bunch of times before.The movie made me laugh and I was glad I watched it once. That's a success in my book. I just think with a little more polish it would have been a smoother ride.One minor note: One reason I wanted to see this is because I'm a native Pittsburgher and a big Penguin fan. I was a little disappointed they just made up player names like Reese and Fox. I mean come on: They got a bunch of Penguins to appear in that Van Damme movie Sudden Death. It would've been nice for them to get just one player, even a nobody, for the sake of a little authenticity. Very minor complaint though obviously. I have actually been to the Brillo Box, the place where the party near the end is held. I don't believe the inside is the same place. The actual place is much, much smaller.",She's Out of My League

91,wakemeup36,Sigh....,2,12 June 2010,"What is this? Am I stuck in a vortex of terrible movies or something? Or is it just that greedy men in business suits will feed the dumbed down population whatever crap they desire as the most of population will empty their wallets for it? OK then, let me start reviewing this movie. Firstly, the starting itself told me that this movie was going to be something I've watched a million times before. An overview of the city while a dumb song plays. How original. I'm sure you've read the plot if you're reading this review. A very good looking girl falls for a very average 'nice' guy. There are many things that are wrong with this movie. Firstly, the music. It's really annoying to hear a radio friendly pop rock song in every other scene in a movie that's not even related to music. Secondly, the humour. If you've watched any modern mainstream non romantic comedy you know what to expect here. It consists of swearing, more swearing and sexual innuendos. I do not find swearing at an elderly man who does not deserve to be sworn at funny. I don't see why anyone over the age of 13 would find premature ejaculation, which was supposed to be one of the funniest jokes of the movie, amusing at all. Showing middle fingers, pointless profanity, shaving pubic hair... I mean seriously? Do they really expect people to laugh at this? It's the same recycled bull we've been seeing for a long long time, started by movies like 'Revenge Of the Nerds' (These jokes sucked even then!)Other than the worthless humour we have tons of pseudo drama involved here. Just before the ending there is the formulatic 'sad' part, just like every other 'comedy' movie nowadays. There is a dumb moral to be learnt at the end too. And apparently, all people are rated by numbers (from 1-10, or something) and everyone, and I mean everyone, knows about this rating system. The characters are people I really don't care about. And the ending, well it's your typical Hollywood 'everything's fine and peachy' ending.What can I say? There is nothing smart, witty, entertaining, original or redeemable about this movie. It's just another pile of crap Hollywood has put out and will keep putting until people stop watching (or at least paying). So please, for the love of decent cinema, do not pay for this or other generic movies so those evil greedy men in business suits can realize that enough is enough.",She's Out of My League
92,db-beurylaw,"Take it from me, this is a very real comedy",9,20 May 2018,"I feel compelled to write a review after reading some reviews that stated that this film could never happen in real life. This film is pretty much my life story. 
 Kirk is an average looking guy who works at TSA at the airport. He meets Molly who is a beautiful lawyer who chooses to be a caterer. Twenty years ago, while working as a public defender I met the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. Blonde hair and blue eyes, the whole package. She was clearly a"" hard 10"", and I was seriously a"" soft 6"". Worse she was 25 and I was 42. She worked in catering, although today she works at TSA. She asked me out several times, just like Molly asked out Kirk. Like Kirk I did not believe this was a relationship, or if it was a relationship, it was not going to last. Like Kirk's co-workers they questioned her motives and the reality of him dating an amazing woman. One of my co-workers said, ""I am no where near as pretty as her, and I would never go out with you."" Ouch! I got the nickname of ""Carlo Ponti"". If you do not know who Carlo Ponti was, look him up on the IMDB. 
 When we went places together, my friends would ask ""Why is she here?"" Other men would hit on her, while we were holding hands! So many scenes are reminiscent of my courtship with this awesome woman. Especially the scene where Kirk takes Molly home to meet his father. My father just blurted out, ""She's so beautiful!"". I empathize what Kirk was going through as the insecurity was over-whelming. So twenty years later, we're still together.
 So I give this movie a 9. I do not give out ""9s"" lightly. I give it a 9 for realism. Ha! This is an above average rom-com. If they would have asked me I could have given them a lot of ideas. Being average and dating beauty is a real challenge.
 I do have some criticisms: The point of the movie is that Alice Eve is such a rare beauty that it creates problems for a regular guy. There is a scene at the Hockey game where Kirk believes that Molly is setting him up with her girlfriend, played by Kristen Ritter. Kirk can't believe Molly is interested in him, but he's Ok with Kristen Ritter? Ritter is a hard 10 as well. I love Ritter but casting an equally attractive woman ruins that scene and undermines the plot. Even worse Lindsey Sloane is cast as Kirk's ex-girlfriend and the plot is she is supposed to be so unattractive that the idea that she is not wearing underwear is cause for guys to lose their appetite. But Sloane is attractive, maybe not a 10, but the actress would turn heads in any bar in America. The casting director is afraid to cast average looking women even when that is what the plot calls for. This is a common problem in light comedies. The casting director wants to attract fans with an array of eye candy. But this works against the plot. How many times have you seen the ""nerd character"" played by a stud?",She's Out of My League

Watched it late night on a whim and had a decent time. But I wouldn't say it's good or recommend it, I didn't laugh, a lot of the humor is really dated (TJ Miller being the asshole friend, Facebook references, etc).The story is predictable and Molly is clearly what a guy thinks is a perfect woman vs her being a realistic human being.

95,K-nightt,Just nod if you can hear me...,2,13 March 2010,"This movie probably had some potential for something; my bewilderment is how these utterly prosaic unfunny themes keep making it to theaters, it's as if ideas are being recycled just because generations are. Truly the decerebrate oafs behind most films are like dogs, they return to ingest their own vomit. Well, they're 19 bucks richer now because of me. This was not at all imaginative, there was no redeeming moment, anything remotely funny was shown in the trailer (and nothing amusing was in the trailer), performances were strained (especially Molly's, totally unconvincing). What was theoretically supposed to be some comic relief was the homoerotic friend with a penchant for Disney films; none of his analogies hit home, his little moral speeches were flat, I was literally waiting for them to go on to say something meaningful, only to find out he was done. The so-called ""hard 10"" is the most insipid plastic creature there is (apart from having a horse-like face with a weird smile); I honestly found her friend Patty (referred to as the Hamburglar) to be much better looking than her. But then again, gentlemen prefer brunettes ;) Well, anyway, the whole premise is that society is superficial and if love is true it transcends all social facades; the way they showed this, with a dude shaving another's scrotum and the million-times-mutilated-and-beaten-to-death-horse premature ejaculation routine (with obvious allusions to American Pie and Happiness - the latter in the disgusting scene denouement involving the family dog). I feel as if the movie was like adjoining ridiculous jokes into an unformed wretched ball of raw sewage.

The acting is pretty effective and the story is not, like some suggest, totally unbelievable-just take a look at some of the couples walking around-except perhaps the ""I don't care what you do"" part.

97,davdecrane,Very funny well-written fantasy,7,22 March 2010,"The title's accurate and the movie does nothing to dispel the notion that ""hero"" Jay Baruchel would ever end up with ""10"" Alice Eve. But the movie entertains us as it tries its best to make the idea plausible, and the funny writing and strong acting make the fantasy worth enjoying. This is still the kind of contemporary R-rated comedy that keeps the F-word in the air constantly but shudders at the idea of showing us a sex scene where the woman isn't wearing a bra. But at least the cussing's delivered by a likable posse, most notably T J Miller, who carries the nickname Stainer, for which, unfortunately, we are provided an explanation. There are some funny set pieces involving two-man genital shaving and a dog's penchant for human ejaculate, but director Smith sometimes plays them out too long – something he repeats with Baruchel, letting the guy mug his way into Jim Carrey territory when that's not his forte. Indeed, Baruchel's a little soft as the core of this film – he's not even strong ""nerdy"" leading man material. But the writing is swift and funny enough for him to hold his own, at least until the drawn-out finale, which is handed over to T J Miller and the sprightly Alice Eve. She's definitely a ""hard 10"" but we might have more easily believed Miller's character could have landed her, than just delivering her to Baruchel. Still, these nerd-club comedies are fantasies, and when they're as likable and funny as this, we'll forgive them most anything. But let's burn those bras, bros!",She's Out of My League

I am glad I went to see it, but wouldn't pay to see it again. This is the kind of movie you either wanna see once in a group, take someone out on a date to see or rent when you have nothing to do on a Thursday night.

Funny & usual supporting actor, Jay Baruchel is hilarious in his debut leading role & Alice Eve just like Portia Doubleday did for Youth In Revolt, is an up & coming gorgeous star (can't wait to see more of her in the future, she's definitely a 10).Supporting players were excellent: TJ Miller (hud from Cloverfield) is the new Jason Lee, he's absolutely hilarious. Nate Torrence is excellent as the only friend of the group that's married and he steals a couple of scenes with ease. Mike Vogel (also from Cloverfield) has a couple scenes he steal. Krysten Ritter (Patty) steals every scene she's in as well & Kyle Bornheimer (Kirk's brother) as well.She's Out Of My League may not be original but it's raunchy, hilarious, very watchable & has good heart.

101,jusco15,jusco's review: She's Out of My League,7,24 December 2010,"How many romantic comedies sprinkled with vulgarity and obscenity have you seen that have been utter failures? Sure, there are a handful that have been successful especially the films involving Judd Apatow, but for the most part they drown miserably in their own pitiful pool of horrific filmmaking. But very surprisingly, She's Out of My League is one romcom that does work.The story is centered on Kirk, who has extremely low self-esteem and Molly, who is beautiful and constitutes a perfect 10 (Kirk, on the other hand, is only a 5 at most). They begin a relationship after a fateful encounter but along the way things go wrong. The typical ""average guy and perfect girl"" romantic story, but then again there are plenty of those guys out there ('raises hand') who can immediately relate to Kirk. That's right, I was cheering him on the entire way, which is probably why I enjoyed it so much.The romantic part outdoes the comedy part in this case – a few hilarious scenes, but on the whole it grasps the attention of millions of guys out there who felt it a duty to stand behind Kirk until the very end where, as we all guessed but was relieved to see come true, a happy ending awaiting, leaving the male audience sighing and losing themselves in wishful dreams for something similar to happen in their own lives. This is a film that manages to steer away from cheesiness and is unusually convincing. It's also notably not as raunchy as initially expected.

Instead, due to Jay Baruchel's clumsy and weak acting skills, the character was never more than charmless, boring and pathetic.
The blonde who played the lead was only that: blonde. Not funny. Not interesting. Not even truly pretty. Just blonde.
I never laughed once in the 22 minutes I suffered through. The plot was beyond predictable, but that would have been sufferable had the writing or acting been competent.

It lived up to it's mediocre trailer run, though that's saying nothing at all. It did absolutely nothing that any movie before it hasn't done, and it played out in such a cliché fashion that eventually I got to the point where I stopped laughing only because I was laughing with the audience, and instead let the humorless movie play out.So let's see... we have the less-than-spectacular main character that is trying to get back with his ex-girlfriend but he's not good enough for her, check. We have the three buddies that all have their own ""personality"" with one being the best friend who tries to get with the main girl character's best friend but is constantly rejected, another friend being the super awkward one that can't live down seeing the positive in everything 24/7 and is thrown in for the one-liners (which in this case is just a bunch of movie references, specifically from Disney), and the third guy whose name you won't ever remember but is there to complete the square and throw in consoling messages to whomever will care to listen... check. We have the girl's ex-boyfriend and her parents ****-block the relationship at any possible means when things are looking up, not to mention the awkward family members from the main character's side... check. We have the ex-boyfriend that is everything better than our main character, which makes him extremely jealous... check. We have the downer period an hour into the movie where everyone is depressed, check. We have the movie's ""funny"" moments come from incessant swearing, people falling down or being hit, scenes from the trailer, and homosexual innuendos... check. And dare I call it a spoiler, but we have an ending that unfolds exactly as one thought that it would unfold before even seeing the movie... check.Honestly, this could have... no, wait... should have been a PG-13 movie. All that needed to be dropped were any F-bombs. Honestly, it would have gotten much more publicity from the crowd that enjoys this kind of humor, would have gotten less media exposure, and thusly would have not been disliked as much from people like myself who should try and hold it up higher to the recent R-rated comedies like Superbad and Knocked Up. The humor in this movie is just so awkward that it doesn't fit in with what general people look for. I bet even the actors were often times unsettled with some of the dialogue and action they had to deliver on camera. Let's put it this way... in the theater, it will help you laugh because it's on the big screen and others are laughing. When this movie hits Showtime and you're checking it out at 2:00 PM on an off-day, you may be inclined to change the channel. The only thing that will keep you watching is Alice Eve's hotness (who is not quite a 10, but still very good looking).Aside from the main resolution, this film kicked a lot of subplots to the side of the curb and seemed to forget to write more story that they tried to develop in the beginning of the movie, where everything else pretty much flies out the window. So there is a main resolution, but what comes of it? It's never really clear-cut, nor does it allow the ending to be ""feel-good"" with the abruptness.There was only one thing worth noting in this movie, and that was the good soundtrack. Aside from the nice choice of 90's alternative rock songs, there was a nice upbeat score that would play in some parts of the movie (more so the beginning of it) that reminds me of something David Holmes would mix up/compose. I'll give them props for a great choice of sound.One last thing, this movie was probably filmed sometime late last summer, because the inadvertent yet proud Pepsi sponsorship showed the yellow bottle caps that they had during that Rock Band promotion. I just figured a lot of Rock Band gamers would catch onto that one if you saw it. But I say hold onto your money. If this was PG-13 and you were 15 years old on a Friday night with a group of friends, I'd say knock yourselves out. Otherwise, definitely pass. It doesn't try and compete with the R-rated movies of the past few years, and ideally it definitely isn't as good.",She's Out of My League

109,sharit_sinha,Hugely Lovable Cross of Sensible and Funny,8,9 June 2010,"Every year, there are 100-s of movies released in the romantic genre. Some are heavy on the sensitive and emotional stuff, dubbed as ""Chick Movie""-s by the male audience. Some are just think-less-laugh-more teen romances, containing majorly sex themes, which guys prefer more. Being a movie-lover guy, I will say, I enjoy both sides, if the movie has a decent story line, which has become a little repetitive or complicated over the years. Just when I was deciding to stop watching romantic comedies for at least a month, I watched ""She's Out Of My League""... and boy, did it change my decision! This is a lovely movie, which doesn't try to complicate things too much by focusing on too many perils in their love or showing too many parallel love affairs, though having the scope of it. It isn't a mindless comedy either, though having a few moments objectionable by a little section of the audience. The movie just emphasizes on one thing and one thing only - is super-sexy looks that important to look for in a relationship? Can a average Joe be called a pathetic dork, just because he doesn't have a glamorous job or highly-moisturized body or a gorgeous group of friends? Is all that even a factor in love? Is being a genuinely nice person not enough anymore in this flashy flashy world? The answer is a straight No and the movie shows it.The preview of the story - Kirk (Jay Baruchel) is a low self-esteem person, who is ridiculed by his bullying family and is recently ditched by his girlfriend. His self-confidence is low to such an extent that when a gorgeous girl Molly (Alice Eve) asks him out in an informal date, he doesn't even consider it to be a date. But slowly sparks fly between them and they hit it off. In spite of Molly's dashing ex-boyfriend, rich and high-class family & a very disturbing first family introduction, or Kirk's offending brother, insulting best friend & a bitchy ex-girlfriend, the only problem putting them down is the social rating of them, according to which Kirk is a mere 5, while Alice is a solid 10. Though we all know how love stories generally turn out in the end, the question that will keep the audience going is... How can a 10 go for a 5? Well, watch out for yourselves!!!

We do a lot of convincing to a girl we've broken up before. But is it that trouble-free? She's Out of My League gives you a peep on why is it that regretful relationship must go by itself. Predictable, yet quixotic comedy about Kirk (Jay Baruchel), a TSA security dealing with a remorseful relationship.The film gave a vibrant and epic glimpse on Molly (Alice Eve) to whom Kirk met in the airport. No doubt that she's probably the gorgeous chic in her role. Describing Baruchel's role, he is somehow odd on acting as a normal guy. Beside on his scrawny build or from the film bickering to Alice as a six, when they're getting laid on the second time, he is waggish on several ways. I don't know any other film that gives a plot on a forgotten boarding pass and a left phone in the security and met each other. But this film is more like it.The main twist of the story is about being honest to a woman and self-esteem. It is worth it if you tell a woman that you ejaculated in your pants after getting laid? It's a bit uncomfortable but it will make her laugh. Just blend it with absurdity. Don't ever compare yourself to your girlfriend's ex or to her friend because what a girl wants is the actual you.So, did I really enjoyed this film? Yes!",She's Out of My League

This one surprised me in that the main character, the ""hot girl"", was really kind and smart. She wasn't your cliché big breasted bimbo, that's for sure. I was really rooting for her the entire movie. I felt Jay Baruchel played his part remarkably well and realistic also. His friends were hilarious! Especially Stainer, who I find much funnier than Seth Rogen. Marnie was an annoying twerp who got what she deserved, many times over! This movie was so far beyond funny, and the story was just excellent! This is by far my favorite of the crude-humored movies that have been coming out lately.

I was expecting non-stop stupidity and it was not that at all. How many times have you seen a really hot woman with a kind of chumpy-looking dude? I've seen a few. But to make a whole movie about that, well that is some really good creativity.I loved the supporting cast. Great acting from them. As I said, all fresh faces. Maybe other people have seen these actors in other movies or TV shows. I know I've seen the actress who plays the Mom on ""That 70s Show"" but that's about it. The beautiful young actresses in this movie were all great actors and very good looking on screen all the time. And they were funny. They played their parts really well.The lead actress comes across as being like really out of that guy's league, but you start to look at her and say, yeah she's not so high up there to settle for the guy who works at the airport.The situations that the main actor gets himself into were all hilarious and very believable. Good warm humor written through-out this film. Friggin' funny! I did see this on video so it does have an R rating and that is for the really stupid parts that in my opinion were totally out of place for this movie. Like the creators didn't have enough confidence in their movie so they had to put in some dumb scenes that just were not funny.But hey, those parts of the movie are not the whole movie.

The reason for this is not just the silly moments that can make one laugh out loud but the relatable characters. The film deals with finding ones worth. Kirk (Jay Baruchel) is not the typical leading man. He often doubts himself which can lead to problems but he stays true to who he is. In my opinion one of the best lines in the film, and a may be paraphrasing, comes from Molly's friend. ""No one in their right mind would tell you something like that if it wasn't true."" Now you have to see the film for yourself to know the moment I'm referring to and although it may seem silly it is a heartfelt moment.

Thank God. If I had to pay for this movie I might have rated it much lower, and been angry for wasting my money. I actually thought it was going to be a funny movie like Knocked Up, and aside from about 10 funny scenes, it was hard to watch. The main character is a side kick at best, he should not get his own movie yet. It was awkward watching him for 2 hours. The curly haired actor that cussed a lot in the film was not convincing. He looks like Napoleon Dynamite almost exactly, so he should act accordingly, or shave his head. Then there was the Stifler of the group, ehhh. The jolly Mormon was pretty funny, but I wish they called him Mormon and not just implied it. The blond ""10"" was bland, and had no screen personality. The plot was the same story as every other boy meets girl story. I liked the basic premise on how the human rating system is ridiculous, but it could have been told much better.

There were many times when the theater full of people burst into laughter, and I even found myself crying at some points I was laughing so hard! The actors all do a fantastic job with their parts, and you can easily identify with most of them. (No ""over the top"" characters ever do a hostile takeover of the plot.)

This is the first movie, which i watched without any research on IMDb. To be frank, my experience was not bad at all. The name of the movie to appalled me, as i thought, may be may be,i can get some insight into break ups. The movie is about a guy named kirk, who thinks himself as a 5, for his date Molly. Who gives her a score of a perfect 10. Kirk was also in a affair with Marine,and in the start of the movie,he asks her to come back but doesn't. And the story is all about, how Molly and Kirk, meet each other, and fall for each other and finally how they meet. its a simple love story. The movie is all good except the last scene shot in the airport, where, i thought, it was unnecessary. may be the story tellers, would have thought of a better scenes. And the scene, where, Kirk's friend shaves Kirk's pubic hair, it was awful. I don't think, it is a good comedy. It was really gross.Apart from that, this is a good movie to watch, a decent comedy. And a good time pass movie over the weekend. But if your expecting some hardcore romance, its not for you.

Possibly because I wasn't expecting to, but I also wasn't against giving it a chance. To me, the commercials did not look very promising, and when it was compared to the hangover in one ad, I really wasn't expecting much. First of all, when I went to see the hangover, I was ready to laugh like crazy due to how funny everyone said it was. Personally, I didn't find it very funny at all and I always felt the writers/actors were trying too hard make a joke out of everything. The only thing that kept my attention was the semi-interesting plot.I found the ads for She's Out of My League to be promising a ""hangover clone"" (in terms of the type of humor). Thankfully this movie is not what it appears to be. Many will disagree, but I felt that there is more reason for watching this than for a constant need to be funny and outrageous. I also liked the character in this movie, and found they added a lot to the story.Although this movie offers nothing we haven't seen before, I found it at least to be enjoyable. Another reason I liked this movie is because I felt there was a storyline that made up for most of the jokes I didn't find funny.I know that most will find it to be a pointless movie (and I guess it is to an extent), but I found it to be entertaining and worth seeing.

A male Poodle is a guy that hangs out with a hot girl, she dresses him, shows him to her friends, take him shopping, cinema, and so on, However he never, i repeat NEVER gets to do the dirt with the hot girl, he, the Moodle, is just another accessory. Yeah I got called Moodle... Great :(In fairness this is a thoroughly enjoyable film. T.J. Miller is ace as the arse-hole best friend, coming out with some great one liners. Alice Eve is definitely out of Jay Baruchel's league and plays the hottie in a way that makes her very likable not just on the eyes but as a character. The only downfall is maybe she's too perfect, beautiful, caring, money, and makes you a better person. I suppose her perfectness makes it all the more too-good-to-be-true for Jay Baruchel's character. Baruchel himself is alright, I personally think he plays the character too awkward, which makes it awkward to watch at times. His physical appearance is so pathetic that you feel he is going to blow it at any moment and Molly ( Alice Eve ) is going to realise he is a massive loser.It's a classic tale, Kirk ( Jay Baruchel ) as been told so many times that he's worthless that he's started to believe it and given up on his life. It takes a beautiful ray of light in Molly to show him he still has something to give. I don't have to tell you the ending because you already know it. Everybody does the best they can with a predictable plot to keep you second guessing. The film, unlike most Rom-Coms these days, does have some outrageous scenes and I give it a thumbs up for daring to try them. Again T.J. Miller was the standout performance, who if I remember right is super frickin' annoying in Cloverfield so good recovery from him. I can see him getting some good comedy roles in the future. Alice Eve is an actress I've admired in Starter for 10 and Big Nothing and she's certainly more than just a pretty face, hopefully others will see that too.More of my stuff at jamesgwall.com",She's Out of My League

So, when 2 of my closest friends started blabbering on how this movie was so funny and the female lead (Alice Eve) was smoking hot, it aroused my attention.I ran to the closest Blockbuster and put the sucker in my DVD player. When I knew the Molly character was coming on screen, I prepared for a beautiful, sex-appealing woman. Did I get her? No. Molly was pretty--not beautiful and no sex-appeal (to me, at least). So, the humour was good--laughable but immature. One line was said to tickle friend uno's funny bone quite a bit, ""IS THAT A DOG OR AN EFFING HORSE?!"" did fall flat in my book. The male lead did seem promising and my type. I didn't know if I liked the good ol' cliché 'nice' guy. Molly didn't RUIN the movie, but I had a problem: She was a 'Sue.

141,paulwatts,America is a funny place,6,19 August 2010,"The choice of actress to play the ""perfect 10"" is rather interesting and says a lot about this movie's intended audience. Certainly Molly is gorgeous, she's ultra-blonde and more often than not wears white. She is just about the epitome of the American dream woman. She somewhat resembles Ann Margret in Viva Las Vegas, made almost half a century ago, but not quite as tall or leggy, although its hard to be sure. Margret in 1963 in fact showed considerably more than Alice Eve does here. Rarely do you even see her knees, let alone anything more controversial. My feeling is that the nerd isn't really all that nerdy (he just looks the part- real nerds have never had a girlfriend- and his ex herself is quite cute), while the 10 is really a 9 and a half. If she were not quite so blonde, like her best friend, she might rate a 10.What you've got here is plenty of profanity, premature ejaculation, a girl who says she isn't wearing underwear, in fact just about anything smutty you can think of is talked about, but none of it is seen. This seems to be the way it is in Hollywood these days.Anyway the movie itself is reasonably entertaining, if lightweight by absolute necessity. Clichés abound (both ex-es seem like they are straight out of a book of clichés), it has a happy ending, and it really is just a piece of Hollywood fluff that will just float away to be forgotten.",She's Out of My League

144,betybobety,SPOILER ALERT!! She's Out of My League gets it right.,8,15 March 2010,"First, just a thimble full of bitch'n. You will never see the reversed doppelganger of this movie. You will never see a movie about a geeky, relatively unattractive and unsuccessful, yet funny and sweet, woman getting pursued, wooed and appreciated by a handsome, successful, yet unpretentious man and having it turn into true love. Men are too shallow and dense. Wonderful characteristics, in women, are viewed as matter-of-fact and completely undeserving of that ""can't believe my good luck"" awe that comes with finding anything resembling wonderful characteristics in men. Combine all these hypocrisies, double-standards and arrogant wishful thinking into one spit-bucket and it'd be deep enough to drown any movie called He's Out of My League. I mean, Christ! Even cartoon wives of cartoon, overweight, uncouth oafs are hot (ala Family Guy). And we all just nod and accept it as the lazy, apathetic, complacent, unquestioning audience that we are. Excuse me while I puke until I dry heave. Okay. Better. On we go.....So, went to see She's Out of My League over the weekend. It was stereotypical, out of touch with reality and followed a tried and true formula. Kirk (Jay Baruchel, of Undeclared fame) is geek without dork, sweet without sap. He meets Molly (Alice Eve, some chick I hadn't seen until now) and the clichés begin and they just keep coming in well-timed allotments. His friends are vulgar, but caring; diverse and yet, great friends. His family give their allegiance to his ex, an uncomplicated harpy so devoid of compassion and what I like to call snuggle-buns. His job, an un-fulfilling waste of his time. No one, but the audience, sees him for the diamond in all this rough.Molly is beautiful and well-adjusted. She makes a lot of money, loves her job, is beautiful. And yet. The very attractive, accomplished man she was dating cheated on her. She has only one friend, apparently (the full-lipped Krysten Ritter), and Patty is obligatorily bitchy, supportive and colorful, alternatively creating tension and offering support, depending on the film's need.This is not original film-making.That said, it's not bad film-making, either. Just unoriginal. But, I challenge you to find originality in a film environment that recycles more old ideas than television these days. That's evident in this this film, but hardly matters. The laughs are genuine, the performances inspired, fresh. At the end of the movie, you may, still, not care if these two get together; you may not believe the entire scenario, but you find yourself laughing, having a good time, liking who you've spent the last 2 hours with.

145,JHalimii,Funny.....but not the best,6,21 March 2010,"Shes Out of My League is a comedy film that had me laughing.....sometimes. It's a mediocre date movie that brings along Kirk, a quirky character who scores a chick much hotter than him. Overall, the movie was pretty funny and it had me laughing a lot at moments (especially Devon's character who pretty much made every scene with his Disney references), BUT the movie was quite dry. I wanted a juicy movie, and didn't get it at all.The story goes very fast and throughout the movie, even until the end, you get the feeling that this romantic couple really doesn't know each other well at all. This created a story that was not believable, and throughout the movie you just sit there and say ""Wow this is so fake."" Also, we get another character, Stainer (who is pretty much a carbon copy of Stiffler), his jokes are not too funny, but the way he says them makes you laugh, which is where story lacks and acting shines a bit. At the end, we get a super cheesy, cliché, and unemotional ending message to the story that was totally forced and obvious.Please don't get me wrong, this movie is good, and it made me laugh, but it had a lot of flaws that could have been fixed. Comedy movies are my favorite films, but this one really was quite cheesy, like seriously some swiss and cheddar up in here.",She's Out of My League
146,felliott1,"Surprisingly Hilarious, Uplifting, and Heartwarming",9,18 April 2020,"Just as I was getting pretty down with all the bad news recently, I found this gem of a movie. I laughed heartily every couple of minutes almost all the way through it. A slightly depressed younger man with a good job, but few upward mobility prospects, meets a beautiful, caring, funny, entrepreneurial young lady and helps her out of an embarrassing situation at an airport security check point. He's a TSA agent and his male co-workers are making fools of themselves over this beautiful young woman. She's also a beautiful human being. He helps with wit and a caring, considerate attitude. She's grateful, but forgets her cell phone in the bin where we have to leave electronics. He finds it and Molly ( the young lady) calls him.They arrange to meet when she's back in town to get her phone. He's that same caring and witty person that sparked her interest back at the airport. From then on, despite funny, off-beat, hilarious setbacks they grow closer. The family introductions are just ""fall down on the floor laughing funny"". It's almost a ""beauty and the beast"" story. Really though, its brain, heart, sense of humor, and personalities meshing. I hear that there may well be a happy ending. I've not watched the last 25 minutes yet, but this movie reminds me quite a bit of John Candy's ""Uncle Buck"". I go back to that movie when I need a humorous lift every so often. I'll add this one to my list of very special ""uplifters"". It found me and I found it at just the perfect time. I really needed a lift tonight.",She's Out of My League

I ,at first, was skeptical with the plot premise but as the movie went on I found myself chuckling quite a bit at a few scenes. I thought that this would be a raunchy gross out comedy but it was completely surprisingly a good movie. Some parts are a tad draggy and unnecessary to the plot of the movie but in all the humor is funny with a tidbit of raunchy, with great one liners.

152,minez01,I'd never have thought....,8,1 October 2013,"When 'She's Out of My League' was released, I had never heard of it. In fact I only heard about it three years later when I saw the first 10 minutes on TV. After that 10 minutes, I was interested so I bought the DVD primarily because I dislike not seeing movie endings, and was very pleasantly surprised at the outcome.I thought 'She's Out of My League' was excellent. For a movie that has taken so many used ideas, it manages to blend everything together perfectly into a semi-crude but always cheerful romantic comedy about a regular Joe named Kirk and his struggles when he meets and dates Molly, a girl who is seemingly way higher up than he on almost every scale.I think the main strength of this movie was the characters - prior to seeing it, I'd never heard of any of them, nor seen any movies they'd been in, and I was able to get into the story much better than had it been filled with Hollywood A-listers. The writing was sound, though the ideas were all very formulaic and horribly predictable, however in the end I found that it didn't matter anyway. The withdrawn and kind nature of Kirk, combined with the idiocy (and loyalty) of his mismatched group of friends meant that I couldn't help but love the transition Kirk made from bumbling loser to confident boyfriend of a woman likely to be the hottest girl in the city.Some people seemed to have issues with the vulgar nature of some of the movie, though personally I didn't. I thought most scenes were very funny, and though swearing occurs here and there I thought that most of the comedic scenes were clever enough in construction that they didn't actively detract from the love story going on around them.All in all I was very surprised after watching this movie. I expected that it might be another average romantic comedy that I'd watch a couple of times and then it would wear off, but instead this movie is full of emotion and offers a lot of heart and feeling, something sorely missing in many other films. I'll also specially mention the soundtrack which I personally consider to be one of the best I've heard to date (well, using songs that weren't made for the movie). Yes, the airport scene at the end is horribly cliché, but I can't help but smile every time I hear the opening guitar of Jet's 'Cold Hard B****' as Molly goes chasing after Kirk. Great Stuff.",She's Out of My League
153,TJNyada,http://reelpopcorn.blogspot.com/,6,28 March 2010,"I saw the movie, She's Out of My League, a couple days ago and to be honest it did not disappoint. It's from the production company, Mosaic Media, the same people who brought us, The Breakup and Talladega Nights:The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. My expectations for it weren't sky high, but I did expect to laugh out loud a few times based on television spots I'd been seeing for a couple weeks.The movie's tagline is, ""How can a 10 go for a 5?"" and the way that this happens in the movie isn't too far fetched, but certainly doesn't happen often in the real world. Jay Baruchel plays the leading role as, Kirk Kettner, a dorky looking airport security worker who somehow finds his way into Alice Eve's character, Molly's good graces.The movie had a bunch of really funny scenes, especially the pool scene where Molly meets Kirk's brother and ex-girlfriend, also, a scene on an airplane where Kirk gives his family a piece of his mind and probably the funniest scene involving Kirk and Molly and an untimely drop-in from her family. The dialogue between Kirk and his TSA buddies is basically what makes this movie enjoyable and T.J. Miller's acting as, Stainer, Kirk's best friend, pretty much steals the show. I could've gone for a bit more screen interaction between Stainer and Patty, Molly's best friend acted by Krysten Ritter, their on-screen hate for each other was outstanding.A lot of people have called this movie a romantic comedy or a ""RomCom"" as one of my friends cleverly calls them. But, I think it weighs much heavier on the comedy side, there are romantic scenes, I'm just not sure how well it would go over as a date movie. I say see it while it's still in theaters, but to all of you ""5's"" and below out there don't let it give you false hope about landing a ""10"", this is Hollywood.",She's Out of My League
154,Swear_To_Me,Formulaic but funny,7,12 March 2010,"She's Out of My League is nothing we really haven't seen before by any means. The hot (and I mean WOW) girl likes the nerd, nerd can't believe it, they have an awkward date, fall in love, the awful family members who are embarrassing, experience major conflict, overcome conflict with the help of their friends, live happily ever after. The difference between this and many like it is this movie is actually pretty funny. It's not afraid to be a little bit and some very raunchy. This is laugh out loud humor, not pretentious ""clever humor."" I'm not opposed to clever humor but I've always believed clever isn't always funny and funny isn't always clever and this is a prime example.If you want a good laugh with a familiar theme this is a good movie.

155,doug16,Filthy and funny!,9,11 March 2010,"Raunchy movies must out-do previous raunchy movies. (They must have made that a rule!) This one certainly accomplishes that. This movie is very, very funny and packed with comedy and romance - from the airport to the pool to the dining room meal to the basement hockey to 500 Park Avenue and on and on. It's extremely dirty mouth, too. It has all sorts of filth - the foul language and new catch phrases were hilarious: at Kirk's job, his home, in the restaurant, at the bowling alley, in the airplane; it didn't matter where. The sexual jokes and sexual situations were so raunchy and over the top that they appear to have been accepted by all. Everyone was laughing so hard and so often that you missed parts of the movie. This movie probably would not have done as well if it had been rated NC-17, so I think that's why it received the R rating. Keep your young children out of this one. But if you want to laugh your frog off for an hour and 44 minutes, go see it.

I could not because I just sat there wondering why the events were happening or what the significance of some of the scenes were. Just bad! And what is up with the curly haired guy, is that the replacement for Seth Rogan from knocked up cause it was a poor excuse his stupid hall and oats tribute band sucked and wasn't used as it could have been funny. The lead girl is hot and should have been the lead role the lead role guy is at best a supporting character, never a lead. Hes like that stupid Kristen Steward timid and mumbly. This movies should have been the very first version and then watched and then re shot in order to make everything fit together correctly. The movie just seemed jumpy and not clean. See it for free and be drunk it might be better. By the way what is up with music playing at almost every scene of the movie. I want to hear dialogue and not fricken the latest pop hit playing at an uncomfortably high level compared to the characters voices. It like that OC and Gossip Girl crap.

Not the biggest and most popular actors, but they were quality. A bit vulgar throughout, and the repetition of a few words used in important bits (such as the word ""amazing"", which Baruchel used non-stop) were a bit annoying, but you can get over it. TJ Miller did a perfect job as Stainer, and Kirk could not have been played better by anyone but Jay Baruchel. Even though it is a bit predictable, still a great movie.

The movie focuses on some very real issues that plague society and have no doubt affected most people at some point in their life.

I sat and watched and was totally absorbed into the film and characters who were brought together so well that you really felt you knew everyone. It was a little awkward when I watched as the ""couple"" came together but you soon forget the ""Adam Samdler movie feeling"" I had.. but it moved quickly past.Why I picked this film was because of the ""Almost Famous"" character played by Jay Baruchel.

I am so glad I didn't pay to see this movie and that I didn't sit in a movie theater for this one. Where to begin on this movie, the acting in this movie was average, the humor was terrible and just the overall storyline of this movie wasn't special. I thought that this movie was suppose to be great, but it wasn't more than a cheesy waste of time. I think that the acting in this movie was terrible no of the actors in this movie had chemistry, it just wasn't there. I think that if maybe we had a different actor play Kirk than Jay Baruchel it might have been better but the entire time I watched this movie he looked high and I didn't get the feeling that he wasn't acting in this movie. Now, Alice Eve did a great job as an actress but, there was no chemistry between her and Jay. All the actors in this movie were no names and had very little affect in this movie. The humor in this movie was not funny at all, there were a few one liners in this movie that were OK but nothing worth saying to your friends that they would understand. I think that Jim Field Smith had a hard time with this because he couldn't decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy. I honestly think he needs to stick with the Burger King commercials. I think that this movie could have been better if the writers would have gone to a different director. The storyline of this movie is just like every other hot girl just OK guy love storyboring I think that it would have been better if it had more originality, but what a letdown nothing.

176,mhollifi-847-253978,She's out of my League Review,7,17 September 2010,"This movie is about an average man, Kirk played by Jay Baruchel. Kirk works at an airport with a few of his friends. One day he meets a beautiful woman who they consider to be the perfect 10. Molly (played by Alive Eve) and Kirk eventually start dating. Thinking that Molly is out of his league Kirk threatens to jeopardize the relationship with his lack of confidence. There was one scene in the movie where Molly's ex-boyfriend Cam (played by Geoff Stults) told Kirk that Molly wasn't so perfect physically. He told Kirk that he wouldn't tell him what it was, but he would have to find out for himself. So the night where Kirk and Molly were staying with each other, Kirk kept looking all over physically for something wrong with her. Although this movie isn't something I would normally pick, I must say it was a funny movie. Kirk kept trying to find flaws with Molly because he thought she was too good for him. As the editing I think the scenes ran together nicely and it was easy to follow the story. I didn't have to re-run any parts in my head to try and figure out where a scene came from or what was the point of them putting it where they did. I think the acting in the move was done really well. I wasn't confused over any of it wondering if I missed something. The lighting in the movie really played an important part. The fact that a lot of the scenes were outside just made the movie some more natural and real. I think the acting in the move was done really well. The actors were funny when they were supposed to be, but also it was easy for them to get series. It was easy for me to believe in what they were doing. Some parts of this movie reminded me of ""She's All that."" In the movie, Freddie Prince Jr. makes a bet with his friends that he can make any girl at the school a prom queen. In the process of doing so, he falls in love with the ""dork"". Rachael Leigh Cook, who plays the ""dorky"" girl he has to make over, doesn't believe him when he says he loves her because he is cool, popular, and good looking. Just like Kirk, he doesn't believe that Molly could really love him because he is only a ""5"" and his friends tell him that you can only date a girl who is ""2"" above your score. So dating a perfect ""10"" like Molly made him question why she was with him.",She's Out of My League

I was pleasantly surprised as I found the film to be heart warming and better than a lot of recent love comedies I have seen. I thought Jay Baruchel is either a geek in real life or his acting is absolutely spot on. He plays the low self esteemed kirk who got lucky with a hot chick, and he made me laugh throughout the film.I agree with some of the reviews who thought the film was more a 'guys' romantic comedy and that there is nothing new they haven't seen.However, I thought the film came together very well and the plot was well written and directed as I did not find a lapse or boring moment during the film.Alice Eve (Molly) was convincing and had her moments in the film, but I thought credit had to be given to TJ Miller (Stainer) who stole the show. His crooning of the 80's hit 'Every time you go away' by Paul Young had me in stitches as he belts out his awful cover version, trying to impress the girls.This is a feel good romantic comedy that is better than a lot of the recent romantic comedies.

It's not just that she's more good looking than him. Jay Baruchel is actually handsome when he's not mugging like an idiot. It's that she's superior to him in every possible way. I don't mind a guy dating up, but he has to bring something, anything to the table. The movie features an inactive protagonist and makes the poor woman who would have no interest in him in real-life do all the work.

The blonde star's parents in the movie are her parents in real life! The supporting cast comes through just great. The airport scenes are familiar with us all. Making fun of average guy who is liked by the gorgeous girl is a little different than when the guy almost always likes the girl he cannot have. The uncut version has a lot of foul language, the only downside I could find. I'm watching on E television and the language is gone....No special effects, just clever writing and skilled workers and actors. It made money for the investors. They should make more movies like this, a message like 60's television series always had.",She's Out of My League
