0,TheLittleSongbird,A kingdom that doesn't completely rise but doesn't fall,7,22 July 2018,"The original 'Jurassic Park' still is a personal favourite, it is an enormously fun, thrilling (with some nail-biting moments) and brilliantly made film, with one of John Williams' most memorable main themes and scene-stealing dinosaurs. 'The Lost World' has its admirers, but for me it was a major step-down and one of Spielberg's weakest films, and 'Jurassic Park 3' was even more disappointing.'Jurassic World' was not a patch on the first 'Jurassic Park', but for all its faults and uneven parts it was a massive improvement to me on the previous two sequels and was an entertaining film in its own right that did more right than it does wrong. Seeing the bigger, bolder, darker (generally) and grimmer 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' a few weeks ago but have been behind with film reviewing and with being busy it has taken until now to review it, personally found it to be a better film but can understand the mixed critical reception.First things off, 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' is an incredibly well-made film, it's beautifully shot with scenery that's both colourful and atmospheric and the dinosaurs look wonderful. The dinosaurs also steal the film, not just their designs but also that they're lots of fun and are scary, their scenes are great to watch and there could have been even more than there were. This is especially true with the Indoraptor, who is chillingly bloodthirsty, when attacking it's enough to be glued to one's seat and then jump out of it. Blue's role also has a lot of touching heart. Michael Giacchino's music score is positively stirring, and even includes themes from Williams' score for 'Jurassic Park', which was just a lovely homage and fits within the rest of the scoring beautifully.'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' has a nostalgic quality, some of it is savvy and funny and while not as much as the original there's still a good amount of thrills and fun dinosaur action (especially the scary opening sequence) to be had. Parts are thought-provoking in primarily the first half and the darker and grimmer tone is handled mostly with a good amount of suspense. The direction is neat and while the acting is uneven there are charismatic performances from Chris Pratt and particularly Bryce Dallas Howard, as the film's most developed and evolved character in a film that expands on themes and ideas from the previous 'Jurassic World' and Isabella Sermon like Blue provides some heart. Liked the relief characters, especially Zia and James Cromwell and Jeff Goldblum are nice in small roles.Sadly, the film is not without its drawbacks. The villains are underdeveloped pantomimic stereotypes with confused motivations. Ted Levine is especially wronged as a mere underused cartoon, while Rafe Spall is completely flat and Toby Jones is wasted.The final third, after such a great opening sequence and intriguing first half, has suspense but also gets repetitive and silly with behaviours so face palm-inducing that the character is begging to be eaten (Levine's character especially). Furthermore, the story could have done with a less is more (with elements that over-complicate the proceedings with inconsistent motivations and plot points and ideas not used to full potential) and less rushed approach. Some of the dialogue was less than great with some cheese and verbosity going on.In summary, decent and entertaining but not mind-blowing. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1,Leofwine_draca,A bland hodge-podge of ideas,5,26 December 2019,"FALLEN KINGDOM is the JURASSIC WORLD sequel that seems to have been patched together from a few different ideas that fail to gel properly. First off, you have a volcano vs. dinosaur set-piece that appears to be rushed through at great speed; everything is polished off in an hour leaving gaping plot holes throughout and rushed characterisation. The second half's idea is dinosaurs in a house, which plays out with all of the CGI destruction you'd expect.The end result is a senseless movie with embarrassingly bad scripting and some awful performances from the main players, not just the returning main stars: wooden Chris Pratt and cheesy Bryce Dallas Howard. Rafe Spall once again puts in the blandest performance in the film (it's something he makes a habit of) while new characters, like the wisecracking black kid, are just awful. So what did I enjoy about this? The FX aren't too bad, a nice mix of animation and CGI, and the dinosaurs do get plenty of screen time, which is something. Blue was a welcome return, and even if the whole thing is predictable, at least it's not boring - just bland. And at least it's better than THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
2,SnoopyStyle,"many small issues and some Jurassic ones, too",6,4 August 2018,"It's three years after Jurassic World. The dinosaurs are threatened with extinction by the pending volcanic explosion. Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) is working to save them with her NGO. Zia Rodriguez (Daniella Pineda) and Franklin Webb (Justice Smith) are two of her workers. She receives a call from the Lockwood estate. Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell) with his assistant Eli Mills (Rafe Spall) plan to relocate the dinosaurs to roam free on another island. Ben is caring for his granddaughter Maisie. Claire recruits ex Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) to find his raptor Blue.This movie is basically divided into two sections. The first section is similar to a Jurassic Park sequel. It's been done before. The Claire Owen pairing improves a little if only she's no longer wearing heels. There are a lot more nagging tiny issues. I don't think the morality debate serves much for the movie and sounds quaint in the present environment. It should be taken out of the tired congressional hearing forum. Even with Goldblum, it can't help but be tired. It's really questionable that the trio remained free after crashing the truck onto the ship. Time and time again, the bad guys ignore the obvious move to kill them for some unknown reason to let them live. The motivation to find Blue is also problematic from the start and it does not stop being problematic even after the twist. That brings the second section which is a monster in a house movie. As a monster in the house story, this has some thrilling action sequences and horror scenes. Looking behind the facade, there are the silly dino for military side track, the weird unconnected clone story, and one obvious tranquillized twist. Both these sections work to some extent, but all these issues and more contribute to dampen any enthusiasm.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
3,Prismark10,Back to life,4,29 July 2018,"Dr Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) was right at the beginning of this movie. Let dinosaurs be extinct for a second time. In a similar vein the Jurassic Park franchise has run out of gas.Set three years after the destruction of Jurassic World. Isla Nublar is facing catastrophe as the dormant volcano becomes active and threatens to destroy all the creatures on the island.Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) is fighting to save the dinosaurs by trying to get political support. She is hired by a wealthy former business associate of John Hammond to rescue the dinosaurs and place them in another island where they could live in an isolated environment.However the company's chief officer Eli Millis (Rafe Spall) has another plan up his sleeve to auction off the rescued dinosaurs and create genetically enhanced dinosaurs as military weapons.Owen (Chris Pratt) is persuaded by Claire to return to Isla Nublar for the rescue which quickly goes wrong.Whereas Jurassic World was a retread of Jurassic Park, this one has the basic story of The Lost World: Jurassic Park which was never that good.The first half is set on Isla Nublar, the second part is set in a country mansion that looks like it is in England than California.The plot is just plain daft, it makes no sense whatsoever and contradicts previous films.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
4,nogodnomasters,"If I don't make it back, remember, you wanted me to come.",6,17 June 2018,"This over priced Godzilla film starts out with a T-Rex in scene one and maintains the action all the way through. In addition to fighting and avoiding rogue dinosaurs, our heroes must also deal with volcanoes, evil military types, evil venture capitalists, while protecting a little girl (Isabella Sermon Isabella Sermon.) This can only be done by the carefully choreographed moves of Chris Pratt.Jeff Goldblum has a cameo at the beginning and end and says ""man made cataclysmic change"" and ""welcome to Jurassic World"" which would be a better title for the next Godzilla production as this appears to be a poorly thought out connection film...like Star Wars 2 but without Jar Jar Binks. There are a couple of light humor lines, but it could have used a few more. There are a couple of times for ""human on the half-shell"" remarks but it never created that type of terror as we saw in the initial film.Bryce Dallas Howard provides our tough female lead because Jessica Chastain would have been too expensive after they blew the budget on special effects. Justin Smith gives us the stereotyped scared geek.It was an okay film but I wouldn't blow my budget to see it.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
5,kosmasp,Again and again and again,5,18 October 2018,"People critisize Marvel and/or other big time studios for rehashing/doing the same movie over and over again. I would argue, at least in Marvels case, they do change things up as much as possible (all within the confines of the universe they created, the MCU). But Jurassic Park (in this case World number 2), is literally the same thing.Aother scientist, another let's bring them here, another evil individual trying to get rich off of them ... and people went in like crazy. Sequel is coming, though hopefully they will change the tune a bit. I mean I hope they do. Because if you can just do one thing, with better effects every time and get rich off of it, be honest, wouldn't you do it? I thought so.Chris Pratt makes it fun, even if other characters are uneven at best and even if it's like the fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice ... actually how many times have I been fooled now? Anyway, if you care more about effects than (rehashed) story, you won't mind either way",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
6,classicsoncall,"""You're making this look totally normal.""",7,1 November 2018,"Right out of the gate the movie introduced a puzzling question mark. When the men in the underwater bathysphere located the skeleton of an Indominus Rex, I immediately recalled the way ""Jurassic World"" ended; the I-Rex was swallowed up and eaten by that huge sea monster dinosaur, whatever the heck it was called. Since there was only a single genetically modified Indominus Rex on the island, how could it's skeleton have survived in one piece, especially since the larger sea monster made a guest appearance in this one? I guess we're not supposed to ask.Well, I think some of the magic is leaving the Jurassic Park series. I recall the very first movie and how thrilling it was to see a dinosaur stampede. One was reintroduced here but it didn't create that ooh-ahh factor I'm looking for in films like this. Much of the story in fact had that 'been there, done that' feel to it, which is never a good sign for a formerly successful franchise. Not that they couldn't try again, as the ending here leaves open the idea for yet another sequel, but at some point it will simply expire from exhaustion.Above all, the thing I couldn't believe most, was ten year old Maisie (Isabella Sermon) releasing all those dinosaurs right after the adults in the room came to the dire conclusion that letting them die for the good of mankind was the right thing to do. I think if it were me (as the adult), I would have been pretty miffed at the kid for throwing a monkey wrench into the whole humanity dynamic at stake. But she did look a little bit like my granddaughter, so I'll catch her a break just this one time.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
7,jboothmillard,Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,5,15 June 2018,"The first Jurassic World, made twenty-two years on from the original Jurassic Park, was well received by critics and fans, and became one of the highest-grossing movies of all time, so anticipation was high for another instalment in the franchise. Basically it has been three years since the events at Jurassic World, the theme park on the island of Isla Nubla, near Costa Rica, has been abandoned. A mercenary team arrive to retrieve DNA from the remains of the Indominus Rex, which lies at the bottom of the Mosasaurus lagoon, a piece of bone is cut and sent to the surface, but the team are attacked by the Mosasaurus and Tyrannosaurus Rex, the team barely escape, and the Mosasaurus escapes into the ocean. On the mainland, a U.S. Senate hearing debates whether the dinosaurs of Isla Nubla should be saved from an impending volcanic eruption. Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) argues that they should be left to die, to correct nature and the mistakes made by John Hammond cloning dinosaurs and bringing them back from extinction. Meanwhile, Jurassic World's former manager Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) has created the Dinosaur Protection Group to save the dinosaurs. After the Senate reject to rescue the dinosaurs, Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell), Hammond's former partner in creating dinosaur-cloning technology, contacts Claire, she meets him at his estate in North Carolina. Lockwood and his aide, Eli Mills (Rafe Spall), are planning to move the dinosaurs to a new island sanctuary where they will live without human interference. Blue is the last living Velociraptor on the island, Mills is concerned finding him will be difficult, so Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), Jurassic World's former Velociraptor trainer, is convinced by Claire to join the mission. The rescue group arrive on Isla Nubla, Claire and former park technician, Franklin Webb (Justice Smith), reactivate the park's dinosaur trackers in the command centre, while Owen, head mercenary Wheatley (Ted Levine), paleo-veterinarian Zia Rodriguez (Daniella Pineda), and the mercenaries search for Blue. When Blue is found, he is shot, then he and Owen are tranquilised, while Zia is forced to keep Blue alive. Claire and Franklin survive a Baryonyx attack, they reunite with Owen as the volcano erupts, using an abandoned Gyrosphere to flee from the pyroclastic explosion, but it plummets off the cliff and into the ocean. Owen rescues Claire and Franklin from the sinking Gyrosphere, and they sneak aboard the mercenaries' ship, and reunite with Zia, the ship is filled with many captured dinosaurs, it departs from the mainland while Isla Nubla is destroyed by the volcano. At the Lockwood estate, Benjamin's apparent granddaughter Maisie (Isabella Sermon) learns that Mills is secretly working with auctioneer Gunnar Eversol (Toby Jones) to sell the captured dinosaurs. There is also a new hybrid dinosaur, the Indoraptor, created Dr. Henry Wu (B.D. Wong) using the Indominus Rex and Velociraptor DNA, Wu plans to use DNA from Blue and the retrieved Indominus Rex bone to create improved versions of the Indoraptor. Maisie tells Lockwood what she has learned, Lockwood confronts Mills about the auction, before being murdered by him. Owen and Claire are caught and locked in a cell at the estate, while Zia and Franklin evade capture. As the auction begins, Maisie is found by Owen and Claire, she shows them the auction as the Indoraptor is sold, despite Wu warning that the creature is too dangerous. Owen manages to influence a Stygimoloch to break out, freeing itself and them, and to disrupt the auction, Wheatley attempts to retrieve one of the Indoraptor's teeth, but it escapes, killing him and Eversol. Mills reveals to Owen and Claire that Maisie is actually a clone of Lockwood's deceased daughter, John Hammond was against human cloning, so this is why the partnership with Lockwood ended. The Indoraptor hunts the group throughout the mansion, but Blue, who was freed by Zia, saves them, the Indoraptor falls from a glass roof and is impaled and killed on a displayed Triceratops skull. The remaining unsold dinosaurs are trapped, while there is a hydrogen cyanide leak, Owen warns Claire that if she frees the dinosaurs there is no going back, but it is Maisie that presses the button to release them, being a clone herself she feels for them. Mills attempts to escape with the Indominus Rex bone, but is eaten by a Tyrannosaurus and a Carnotaurus. At a new U.S. Senate hearing, Dr. Malcom says that humans must now coexist with dinosaurs, saying ""Welcome to Jurassic World"". Also starring Geraldine Chaplin as Iris, Robert Emms as Tech Merc and Peter Jason as Senator Sherwood. Once again Pratt and Dallas Howard are great, Spall and Jones are fine as the hissable villains, all Goldblum gets to do is sit and sound intelligent, but once again it is the dinosaurs that are the real stars, brought to life by more amazing CGI. There are fair action scenes, and some clever moments paying homage to classic horror, but it does not have quite the same bite, flair and entertainment as the previous movie, but it is reasonable and sets you up for what's to come next, a watchable science-fiction adventure. Worth watching!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

9,paul_haakonsen,But it had all been seen before in the other movies...,6,29 June 2018,"Right, well it is officially time to let the ""Jurassic"" franchise go to a well-deserved slumber. And yet I rated this movie 6 out of 10 stars you might think?Well, yeah, I gave it 6 out of 10 starts because this movie was entertaining for what it was. And what was it? Well, it was a mixture of all the previous movies compiled to make this movie. So if you have seen the older movies, both the ""Park"" and World"" movies, then you have essentially already also seen ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"".The visuals were astounding, as to be expected from a movie such as this, and let's be honest here, the action and the CGI is what kept ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" afloat. The CGI was, as it has always been in this franchise, realistic and visually beautiful to look at. The dinosaurs are realistic - well, as one would assume dinosaurs would be - and that is pleasing on the eyes.""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" was almost totally void of having a solid storyline. Again, everything here has been seen before, and it made no sense why they did the things that they did in the movie. Yeah, let's move the dinosaurs from the isolated island and bring them in on the mainland, whoa, wait a minute, haven't we seen that before? Check. And running away amidst a herd of stampeding dinosaurs and not get trampled, haven't we also seen that before? Check. Taking the DNA from dinosaurs to clone and genetically alter to make a super dinosaur, ring any bells? Check.Actually, that last bit with them creating the new hybrid was so ridiculous. They knew what happened with the Indomitable Rex at the Jurassic World resort, so why on Earth make something more powerful, dangerous and just downright nasty? It made absolutely no sense what so ever.The acting in the movie was adequate, as it has been throughout the numerous movies in the franchise. However, don't bet your money on any outstanding and award winning performances here though.""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" suffered terribly at having a rather watered down and poor script and plot, but was shamelessly salvaged by the grandiose special effects and CGI.You know what you are getting here when you sit down to watch a movie in this franchise, so take that as you might - a warning, an advice, or just a flat out statement of truth. This movie will not challenge you intellectually in any manner, so just unstrap your helmet, buckle in and enjoy the ride.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
10,Quinoa1984,What the hell,4,25 June 2018,"The positives:Ted Levine is back! (In a movie I mean. I know this is his first Jurassic Rodeo). Always love seeing Levine being as slimy as possible and he doesn't disappoint in his screentime. The particularly schlocky bits in the third act (and maybe a little in the first) that had me holding back laughing so loudly in a packed theater.Some of the horror movie parts look good.The negatives:uh... Did you see that Colin Trevorrow wrote this?Heres the deal with Jurassic World: Live at Pompeii (and then later Jurassic Castle) - this is even within the scope of one of these movies so patently unbelievable and ludicrous. This involves people who were already fairly dumb in the previous 'World' rushing in the final days (nay, the *FINAL DAY*) of a volcano erupting on this island to get all the dinosaurs off because oh look one perdy Brontosaurus and... It is so brain-dead that one feels partially lobotomized in order for this to be alright. It's lazy and idiotic script and even quality of acting I'd expect in Mega-Croc vs Octosaur or whatever on SyFy channel, not a Steven Spielberg produced joint (but on the other hand, the man does have his name on Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. So...)So when the premise is already too far gone, the rest follows... Well, there's a heap-load of Evil Corporate Business assholes, and a little girl who is (gasp) much more than she seems, but not in any ways that makes her too extraordinary, which... Is alright actually, as I could see good chunks of this - when Bayona is present and choreographing the horror set pieces - traumatizing some children, which is fine, and she's the point of empathy.... And then that ending happens, which.... What? WHAT? The Critic parody of Jurassic Park 2 was as real as a friggin' Maysles doc compared to this. Theres schlock, and then there's lameness and illogic Roger Corman would say is too much. JurASSic World.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
11,tavm,Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom continues Universal Studios' tradition of making great Monster movies!,9,5 July 2018,"Owen and Claire from the previous Jurassic World is back but not before we hear from them what happened to them in between that last one and this one while they have a beer together. When that character development gets resolved, we're treated to non-stop action when they have to deal with plenty of dinosaur chaos as well as with many people doing stuff against their policies concerning those lizards. This Jurassic series entry has even more thrills than before and it seems pertinent that Universal is the studio that does these movies as that company has done monster movies for nearly 100 years now from Lon Chaney Sr.'s Hunchback and Phantom of the Opera to Bela Lugosi's Dracula to Boris Karloff's Frankenstein Monster to Chaney Jr.'s Wolf Man to The Creature from the Black Lagoon to Jaws to the recent versions of King Kong to these now-iconic dinos. So on that note, I highly recommend Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
12,BandSAboutMovies,"Finally, a great sequel",8,24 June 2018,"There's a moment where Isla Nublar sinks as a volcano destroys what was once Jurassic World - no real spoiler, the film's tagline is ""The island is gone"" - and a brontosaurus stands in the smoke, unable to escape, where real emotion came out of me. It's like that moment when I was a child, when we went to a Mystery Spot near Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio. They had a dino tour that had statues of different creatures and sound effects, acting like they were real and at one point of the tour, encouraged you to shoot at them with fake M16 machine guns. I ran up and down our little train and begged everyone to please stop shooting the dinosaurs.
I have a troubled relationship with Jurassic Park. This film makes the same mistakes as nearly every other in the series. One, never go back to the island. Two, every kindly inventor of the park has a younger successor who only cares about making money and has hired mercenaries who are never there to help. Third, BD Wong is always up to no good.Yet I found myself really enjoying this movie much more than previous films in the series. Maybe it's because so many of this iterations set pieces play out more like a horror or disaster movie than a blockbuster, starting with an attempt to retrieve the DNA of Indominus Rex from what is left of Jurassic World, which ends with a spectacular attack by the Mosasaurus.Throughout the film, the question is often posed - should these creatures live or die? During a Senate hearing, Dr. Ian Malcolm (a welcome Jeff Goldblum) opines that they should go extinct again to make up for the mistakes of John Hammond. Meanwhile, Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) from the last film has started a group to save them. Late in the film, it's posed that she - by authorizing Idominus Rex in the first place - is just as responsible for where the world is as the bad guys. Malcolm may have said the same if asked - he feels that mankind cannot handle the power of evolution, a trait that holds true to his character in the original film.Of course, we have to go back to the island. And Claire is lured, just as everyone has been, by the chance to fix her mistakes and save the creatures that are left. She's contacted by Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell), Hammond's original partner, and asked to help save what's left of the species on the island. There's another reason to go back - a chance to see her one-time (twice now?) boyfriend Owen Grady (Chris Pratt, making a very real run for man of summer between this and Infinity War) and rescue his dino daughter, Blue the raptor.There are secrets, though. Eli Mills, Lockwood's aide, has a secret agenda. If this seems like a rerun of The Lost World: Jurassic Park, well, it totally is. And if Ken Wheatley (Silence of the Lamb's Ted Levine) is the same merc as every other merc in the series, so be it, although his trait of taking teeth from every dinosaur is a neat character tic.That said, there are some thrilling moments here, such as the aforementioned destruction of the island, an auction where the viewer cannot wait for the chaos that the dinosaurs will eventually cause and a horrific sequence where the new Indoraptor stalks Maisie, Lockwood's granddaughter (kinda sorta - there's a reveal here). There's some fun character interplay between techie Franklin Webb and Dr. Zia Rodriguez, a paleoveterinarian who has never seen a dinosaur for real. And the end - where the question is asked once again if these creatures should live or die - hit all my emotional buttons.Look - it's a big dumb summer blockbuster. Sometimes, that's all you need on a Friday night after a long week of work. Sure, we've seen everything before in this series, but the end of this film, which finally takes the dinosaurs away from the park and loose in the world for the final part of this trilogy cycle, sets up something brand new. And that's actually the most exciting part of this film.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
13,michaelRokeefe,No time to sweat the small stuff,7,24 June 2018,"This fifth installment of the Jurassic Park series, takes up several years after things at the Jurassic World theme park on Isla Nubar really went amok. The now- decimated island is about to fall victim to a billowing volcano in the process of erupting. After the hybrid dinosaurs created by scientists broke free during the park fiasco, some of the cloned creatures were left behind to roam freely on the island. Former park operations manager Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) has talked former Navy veteran and ""dino whisperer"" Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) to return and rescue the dinosaurs and take them to a new sanctuary. They have been hired by a greedy and corrupt member of the Lockwood estate, who wants to cage and shackle the gnashing and chomping creatures to auction them off to shady ""high rollers"".Terrific CGI, especially during rescue, auction and escape scenes. The story line and main dialogue are a bit mundane and don't quite equal the creativity of the elaborate sets. Most of the acting is also much of a letdown, but hey, the dinosaurs are the real stars of this lizard spectacular.

14,hitchcockthelegend,Cover Version 2,5,23 March 2019,"It was 1993 when Jurassic Park was unleashed upon the film loving public, spawning a blockbuster franchise and pop culture thunders in the process. Sadly we now find ourselves suffering cover versions of what was once a great and thought provoking premise with high octane thrills into the bargain.I guess once they started personalising the Velociraptors, making one of them a friend of man, it was the beginning of the end. But we accepted it - sort of - jumping into 2015's Jurassic World with carefree abandon. More dino carnage we wanted, a bright cast fronted by the ever likable Chris Pratt and Bryce Howard drew us in, but it was merely ok, a franchise entry that was just a quick fix but nothing more. But of course box office talks and the franchise lumbers on to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom...Plot returns to Isla Nublar which along with all the dinosaur inhabitants is about to be vanished from the planet by the mother of all volcanoes. Cue mankind jostling over whether to save a species that was once extinct whilst others have nefarious motives for financial gain.Off we go then, stock characters that are over familiar are performed by different actors but go through motions we have witnessed before, whilst the writing strains for a sort of human empathy factor that never hits the mark. There is nothing remotely fresh (well Howard has at least changed her footwear to something more credible) or exciting on offer here, it's a tired cash cow that's in dire need of extinction itself.Naturally another instalment will come along, and naturally it will make money, with myself and the other millions of Jurassic zombies filing in to view what we hope will be a return to the heady days back in 1993. But it's most likely a forlorn hope, so maybe, just maybe, it should be enough now, enough? 5/10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
15,CinemaSerf,Jurassic World - the Fallen Franchise,6,5 June 2020,"I actually quite enjoyed this, but it ought, definitely, to sound the bell on last orders at the Saloon Isla Nublar. I like Chris Pratt - he comes across well as the decent, well meaning, slightly dense, hero figure with his tongue in his cheek. This film is no exception as he revises his character ""Owen"" from ""Jurassic World"" (2015). This time ""Claire"" (Bryce Dallas Howard) lures him away from his rural idyll to rescue the last of the Jurassic creatures from a volcano that threatens to wipe them all out. Were it only that simple... Rafe Spall (""Eli"") who works for James Cromwell (""Lockwood"") who has taken up the mantle left by the now deceased ""Hammond"", is also aware and has despatched a team of mercenaries to collect as many living samples as he can so that they can be sold as beasts of burden/weapons etc. Once Pratt manages to seek out and rekindle his relationship with velociraptor ""Blue"" on the island, the line between the conservationists and the exploitationists is drawn and we have a battle royal! There is loads of action, the effects are great - but the story, even by ""Jurassic"" standards is a bit far-fetched and tired. Aside from ""Owen"" the characters all a bit weak (especially the really annoying Isabella Lockwood as ""Maisie"" who could easily have been eaten/trodden on much nearer the start of the film. Just because a film is aimed at a younger audience doesn't mean it has to feature them on screen!! ). Sadly, like so many of these types of series, the merchandising revenues are just too tempting for the studio to hang up their cattle prods, but now is the time...",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

The long dormant franchise that started like gangbusters with ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) and then its superior sequel ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" (1997) lost traction with the dreadful ""Jurassic Park III (2001). Fourteen years would slip away before Universal Studios would revive the franchise with the uninspired ""Jurassic World."" Keep in mind, director Steven Spielberg's first two films adapted Michael Crichton's bestsellers, but ""Jurassic Park III"" appropriated only Crichton's characters instead another of his literary endeavors. Tragically, Crichton's death in 2008 halted his extraordinary literary output, but Hollywood is far from done with his characters. Not only did Tinseltown bring back the dinosaurs for ""Jurassic World,"" but HBO also revived the ""Westworld"" (1973) as a mini-series. ""Westworld"" dealt with a theme park with robots, while ""Jurassic Park"" concerned a theme park with dinosaurs. Now, a Pompeii-like volcanic eruption has the dinosaurs on the fictional island of Isla Nublar running amok. In ""Orphanage"" director J.A. Bayona's ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" this calamity prompts former park operations manager Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard of ""The Help"") to persuade 'raptor wrangler' Owen Grady (Chris Pratt of ""The Magnificent Seven"") to accompany her in a highly publicized effort to save the doomed dinos. Incredibly enough, the fifth entry in the franchise surpasses both ""Jurassic III"" as well as ""Jurassic World,"" but doesn't top the first two entries. For the record, two characters from the original ""Jurassic Park""-villainous Dr. Henry Wu (B.D. Wong of ""Family Business"") and heroic mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum of ""Independence Day"")-reprise their roles in ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom."" The suspense, the screwball thrills and chills, and the outlandish machinations of the latest villains give ""Fallen Kingdom"" a refreshing but formulaic spontaneity. ""Kong: Skull Island"" scenarist Derek Connolly and ""Jurassic World"" director & writer Colin Trevorrow have penned a lively, above-average screenplay that fills its two-hour plus running time with not only surprises galore but also comic cliffhanger shenanigans.""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" opens at night during a eerie storm as a two-man mini-sub scours the floor of the gloomy, three-million-gallon lagoon at Jurassic World. Searching for the skeleton of the dreaded Tyrannosaurus Rex, they snap off a specimen and float it to the surface for a helicopter crew. The two are worried they may encounter the rapacious T-Rex. Apparently, they have forgotten about the cloned Mosasaurus maximus. If you saw ""Jurassic World,"" this aquatic predator ate the shark. No sooner have they bagged the specimen than a Mosasaurus materializes behind them like an apparition out of nowhere. A solitary technician on land orders the submariners to exit the lagoon so he can seal it, but he gets no response. The helicopter lands with the valuable specimen, and the crew urges the technician to join them. Not only does the technician fail to hear them, but he also fails to spot the ravenous T-Rex stomping up behind him. Screaming, the technician flees for the helicopter with the colossal lizard nipping at his heels. The helicopter abruptly lifts off, but the crew deploys a rope ladder. The desperate technician seizes the ladder, while the T-Rex snags the other end. Basically, the technician is caught between the chopper and the T-Rex in a tug of war. Fortunately, he escapes from the T-Rex, but the Mosasaurus surges up from the deep with its enormous jaws agape to feast on this ill-fated human. ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" contains several scenes of cloned dinosaurs munching the innocent as well as not-so-innocent guys.As the plot unfolds, we learn a fireball belching volcano has the dinosaurs scrambling to escape its wrath. Meantime, Ian Malcolm urges a Congressional committee not to undertake an evacuation. ""These creatures were here before us - and if we're not careful,"" Malcolm warns, ""they're going to be here after us."" Nevertheless, a private corporate interest intervenes to relocate the creatures to a nearby, uninhabited island. Mind you, they have no sympathy for the cloned dinosaurs that face extinction. Hilariously, they want to harvest dinosaur DNA to weaponize these creatures! ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" introduces several new characters. Chiefly, we're told that the late John Hammond, who dreamed up ""Jurassic Park,"" shared his goal of a lifetime with billionaire benefactor Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell of ""Babe""), but the two clashed over something (which cannot be divulged without spoiling things) that sabotaged their friendship. Since Hammond is dead, Lockwood wants to help out. Actually, Lockwood's chief executive officer, Eli Mills (Rafe Spall of ""Life of Pi""), has arranged for eleven species of dinosaurs to be saved. An ecstatic Claire rushes off to Isla Nublar via helicopter because only her handprint can reboot the Jurassic World computer system, so the dinosaurs can be rounded up, specifically Blue, the Velociraptor with the shrewd intelligence of a canine. Owen Grady joins Claire because he has a special bond with Blue. Paleo-veterinarian Zia Rodriguez (Daniella Pineda of ""The Vampire Diaries"") and geeky computer technician Franklin Webb (Justice Smith of ""Paper Towns"") accompany them. Unfortunately, our heroine discovers that deceitful Mills wants to leave them behind once she has rebooted the park. Spanish director J.A. Bayona doesn't let the lunacy lapse in this outlandish hokum. One audacious but suspenseful predicament tops another until the finale surpasses them all. The jaw-snapping opener rivets your attention. Skillfully, Bayona alternates exposition and action. Despite all the munching going on, the ""Jurassic World"" sequel remains immaculately bloodless. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard radiate charisma as hero and heroine. They survive several close-calls with the dinosaurs. In the Lockwood Manor sequence, a pugnacious Indoraptor chases Lockwood's granddaughter, Maisie Lockwood (newcomer Isabella Sermon), around the premises in a sidesplitting comedy of errors. Watching this fearsome dinosaur negotiate the halls and stairs is a hoot. Happily, ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" shuns credibility because anything can happen in a fantasy.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

While filmmaker JA Bayona keeps things moving at a brisk pace the clunky machinations of the pedestrian script (humans on island, running, yelling, screaming, dying; rinse/lather/repeat) by Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow may have buried the series for good.

19,view_and_review,Lazy,4,5 July 2018,"Lazy, lazy, lazy. The only people who gave any effort in this movie were the CGI folks--and really, how hard did they have to try considering they probably had everything they needed saved on a hard drive somewhere. I can't believe how bad this movie was. Almost immediately I was shaking my head in disapproval.Jurassic anything is no longer original and no longer unique. That's OK though. We're willing to watch so long as you can bring an interesting enough plot. Well, that didn't happen.The premise is that the dinosaurs have to be rescued from Isla Nublar because of an active volcano that's going to destroy them all. We could just let them die but where's the movie in that? We have to rescue them but we also have to have some other nefarious plot in play to make it interesting. At the core of it all was an ethical dilemma: allow the dinosaurs to die or rescue the dinosaurs. Ethical dilemmas is part and parcel of Jurassic Park/World. From the very beginning it was an ethics issue by recreating dinosaurs, so there is no reason to stray from ethical dilemmas now. And I agree with that. In fact, that was the only interesting thing about this entire movie. After that it was just a replay of the first Jurassic World: you know, catastrophic failures, harrowing escapes, bad guys getting eaten, a kid right in the middle of it all, etc. The whole thing just annoyed me.How one dimensional can you make these characters? Almost every character was a walking cliche: the macho shoot first henchman, the smart witty doctor to show brains are better than braun, the shady child-yelling antagonist, the genius kid and other character types that wore bright neon signs letting you know their role and their fate.I was rolling my eyes the entire movie as I just watched the first Jurassic World play out before me as they tried to convince me this was different. They will make a third, fourth, fifth and so on because as long as they have sharp toothed prehistoric beasts and evil gullible homo-sapiens they have a formula for hundreds of millions of dollars. Yuck.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
20,ferguson-6,this can't be the DNA from JP,5,30 June 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. While I will never tire of seeing really cool dinosaurs on the big screen, I'll probably never avoid frustration from a poorly written and poorly acted film. On the bright side, I got to see this at the Grand Opening of the beautiful new Alamo Drafthouse in Denton, Texas. A 66 foot curved screen with the best available sound system made the dinosaurs that much more impressive, while simultaneously exposing the acting for the disappointment it is ... especially the almost impossible to watch Bryce Dallas Howard.J.A. Bayona directs this follow up to the 2015 JURASSIC WORLD, but he's saddled with a subpar script from the writers and director of that previous entry, Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow. The creatures of the late, great Michael Crichton deserve better. In addition to the aforementioned Ms. Howard (as Claire Dearing), Chris Pratt also returns as the smirking Owen Grady, and this time he flashes some fighting skills that would make Jean-Claude Van Damme proud. Not sure how his experience training baby dinosaurs and building a cabin in the mountains prepared him to single handedly take on an army of armed mercenaries, but such things are possible in a cartoon ... which is exactly what this plays like: a live action cartoon with high dollar special effects.We have a spoof of a villain in Eli Mills, played by an over-the-top Rafe Spall, a quivering techie played by Justice Smith (PAPER TOWNS), a tough Paleo vet in Daniela Pineda (MR ROOSEVELT), a dying billionaire former partner of John Hammond played by James Cromwell, a greedy capitalist who should be twirling a mustache in Toby Jones, a big-gun toting badass by Ted Levine, and a good-hearted housekeeper played by Geraldine Chaplin. Mr. Cromwell and Ms. Chaplin add a touch of class in their all too brief scenes. BD Wong is back doing things with dino DNA, and sadly, Jeff Goldblum probably filmed his two courtroom scenes in a couple of hours. One nice addition is young Isabella Sermon, in her screen debut. She is part of the only decent twist in the story.Despite the disappointments, it remains awe-inspiring to see the dinosaurs on screen. If only those moments weren't ruined by such superfluous bits such as a close up of Ms. Howard's footwear to prove that she's not wearing high heels in the jungle this time. Director Bayona has three very fine movies under his belt: THE ORPHANAGE (2007), THE IMPOSSIBLE (2012), and A MONSTER CALLS (2016). He's likely to make more good films during his career, and this will surely be a box office smash because people love seeing the dinosaurs, and are willing to overlook the people. As a frequent movie goer, I'm just unable to cut slack to a mega-budget film that expects us to overlook shoddy writing and laughable acting. We don't expect to recapture the (25 years ago) magic of Steven Spielberg and composer John Williams in the stunning JURASSIC PARK, but we do expect a better effort than this.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
21,Wizard-8,An okay viewing experience under the right circumstances,6,13 April 2019,"I put off for quite some time watching this movie in part because I had been ""dinosaured"" out after watching the previous entry in this series. By that point, the series seemed to just be repeating itself. While this latest entry in the series does continue to do that to a degree, it's clear that at the same time there was some decent effort to put in some freshness. For one thing, only a somewhat limited portion of the movie takes place on the island - most of the movie takes place in a much different location. Also, there are some more original characters with more original (for the series) motivations. Some of these motivations are somewhat hard to swallow, given it's clearly extremely difficult to control the dinosaurs. And there are some plot turns that are pretty predictable. But the movie doesn't have any dull spots, has a lot of action and good special effects, and surprisingly ends on a somewhat dark note for a major Hollywood studio production. If you were entertained by the previous entries of this series, you'll probably find enough to enjoy here, though to be safe I would recommend that you wait for a viewing experience that doesn't cost you any money. I though the movie was okay, in part due to me finding it at my local library for free.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
22,bombersflyup,We are not compatible.,6,28 September 2018,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a good film, despite not being to the level of those before in the series.High quality for a while, but once they get off the island and back to the estate it goes downhill. I liked the addition of Franklin and Zia and the humour throughout the film's on point. Rafe Spall's terrible again and I didn't know who the old guy was suppose to be, with all the sequels, different actors and such. Creating hybrid dinosaurs, throw in a cloned girl and they're going to keep going with that ending. That BD Wong guy must have cloned himself, cos he hasn't aged a day. Bryce Dallas Howard isn't really giving it her all I feel. The plot and footage with Blue was splendid, but it needed to be more so to have any lasting impact.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
23,FlashCallahan,Life doesn't find a way....,3,16 July 2018,"Three years after the destruction of the Jurassic World theme park, Owen Grady and Claire Dearing return to the island of Isla Nublar to save the remaining dinosaurs from a volcano that's about to erupt. They soon encounter terrifying new breeds of dinosaurs, whist uncovering a conspiracy that threatens the entire planet.....I was so happy with Jurassic World when released in 2015. It somehow caught some of the magic that was so crucial to the ground breaking first movie. So despite the maundering trailers, the poor one sheets, and an air of excitement that seemed as sparse as when JP3 was released, my expectations were pretty high for this.And why shouldn't they have been? Here we have a great director, the chemistry between Pratt and Howard made JW much more than just a reboot to a much loved masterpiece.But no, this has to be one of the most disappointing films not just of this summer, but of any summer since that magical one of 1993. It just takes everything that worked with JW, and extracted it and added elements that just made the film almost unbearable to endure. Yes, the efects are amazing, and the opening scene is decidedly quite effective, but when we get to the charachters proper, you can see the lack chemistry that was so important in the last chapter.Pratt looks bored on the verge of saying 'Am I the biggest star in the world yet?', and Howard is resorted to nothing more than a bolshy babysitter for the children in the film.The film has a gothic element to it toward the final act, when we meet Jones and his prehistoric auction. But one couldn't help but hark back to 2008's 'Taken' where we see Neeson compelling his next victim to bid for his daughter.It's a crying shame that the film goes for the lazy route and resorts to nothing but the cast running away from clouds of smoke and panicking dinosaurs.And if you didn't already know, if you've seen the trailer, you've seen Goldblum's appearance.A turgid, lazy film, easily one of the worst of the year.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
24,Aaron1375,Plot dooms this entry into the Jurrassic Park series,5,31 July 2018,"A lot of people did not care for the last entry into the Jurassic Park series, but I thought it was pretty good as it was the first film of the series to feature a fully working park with tourists who get caught up in dinosaur chaos. This one, is kind of a retread of Jurassic Park: The Lost World, which to me was not a very good film and this one is also not very good. Take away some pretty good action and some good effects and you are left with a plot that must of been written by a twelve year old whose dream is a big budget movie featuring some sort of dinosaur wars, where man rides dinosaurs into combat. Characters in this one act completely different than they did in the previous movie; meanwhile, the only one who seems to have a brain is Jeff Goldblum's character who is only in the film for two minutes.The story has the dinosaurs living on the now abandoned park; unfortunately, a convenient long dormant volcano is fixing to erupt threatening the lives of the dinosaurs on the island. For some reason, people want to save these creatures that should be extinct and spearheading this movement is Claire, who now loves dinosaurs and talks about the first time she saw a dinosaur. Kind of different from the stiff person in charge of the park in the previous movie that only cared about making a profit. She is convinced by a man who was friends with the old guy in the first film and who wanted to make dinosaurs too before having a parting of the ways to help save the dinosaurs and get Blue the raptor off with the help of her old flame Owen. Of course, the old man put an obviously dastardly man in charge of everything so the whole thing is a way to get the dinosaurs off the island and to auction them off for ridiculously low sums of money to evil bad guys who get totally unraveled by one small head butting dinosaur. Meanwhile, a new super raptor is being made and I cannot help but think what is the obsession with raptors? When I was growing up never even heard of the things, now they have upended the way more awesome t-rex as the main dinosaur in these films. Soon there is a bit of chaos in this mansion and the film has a really cheap vibe and it plays out more like Dino Crisis the movie than Jurassic Park. The plot is just too bad to make up for the fact I did enjoy the eruption and a few other action sequences. That anyone would be in awe of this movie makes me think people are truly less intelligent or they are studio shills. Lets see, there is an old man who had a parting of the ways with Hammond in the first film. This parting of the ways had to have occurred before the opening of the first park. Well we find out, they parted ways because the old man here cloned his daughter! Gasp! Except the kid is like 12 years old max and seeing as how the first park was in 1993, I am thinking this was just a cheap way to get a brat into the movie. The whole dinosaur for military purposes is getting stupid, I don't care how much natural armor your dinosaur has, it would be blown up quite easily by today's weaponry. Also, I am pretty sure a one of a kind dinosaur is going to fetch more than a mediocre NBA player and quite frankly, that mansion was probably worth more than the 127 million that dude was getting at the halfway point of the auction. Dude was hired cause he was good with numbers, but apparently not really!So, I would say this is a popcorn summer film and that you must turn off your brain so you can enjoy it, but just too much did not work. Chris Pratt apparently ingested some of Captain America's super soldier serum to survive some of the stuff he did and fight off a number of mercenaries and Claire must have received brain damage from the previous film to now love dinosaurs so much. Honestly, this is a case of a movie doing well by name alone and the fact kids still want to see dinosaurs, but I found the Dwayne Johnson action film with monsters, Rampage, way more enjoyable than this. It was not super great, but it had a much more action packed conclusion than watching dumb clone brat hiding from super raptor who is easily killed by regular raptor in her bed. Not under it, which I can see, no, just under the covers. Yet, this movie left some of you guys in awe?",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
25,Wuchakk,"More dinosaurs, Opie's hot daughter, Dracula's castle and Indiana Jones",8,17 September 2018,"""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" (2018) revolves around Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Owen (Chris Pratt) leading a team back to Isla Nublar to save several species of dinosaurs after an active volcano threatens all life there. The plan is to relocate the dinosaurs to a new island sanctuary, but that's not the way it works out.My title blurb pretty much says it all for this fifth film in the franchise. I mention Indiana Jones because the movie has a ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) vibe more so than the other movies. The reference to Dracula's castle is due to the fact that the entire second half takes place at a cool, gothic chateau in Northern California and there's a scene with a genetically-enhanced raptor acting like Dracula.Curvy Bryce is just stunning throughout and easily blows away any other woman in the series. Meanwhile Pratt seriously upped his game as leading action hero (I wasn't overly impressed with him in the previous film, although I didn't dislike him either). At the end of the day I'd have to rank this installment as my favorite, followed by the original 1993 movie and 2015's ""Jurassic World.""The film runs 2 hours, 8 minutes and was shot in Hawaii and England/Scotland.GRADE: A-/B+",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
26,trashgang,always the same moving further away from the original,6,25 April 2020,"Far away from the original which is normal of course but the difference is that the first one was men against dino's. The further we move into the franchise the more we move into going away from th ecreatures and more towards dino's helping out the good guys against the bad boys.And it's there where this fails a bit. Selling dino's, regenerating them, becoming friends with 'blue' again helping them. Nah, not for me, the further this franchise goes the more we enter a Disney feeling. Okay, the attack and do eat people and the effects are stunning and playing with shadows did work too. Childish isn't the exact word but I guess you know what I mean.It took me 2 years to finally watch it, I was afraid, afraid it would let me down, and it did.

Grab a crew! Different characters sub stories developm etc. What did not work: The usual movie industry cliche and stereotypes. The bad guys are the template of Older white guys who look like the brutal old gym teachers from high school along with mercenaries who look like evil pirates. The good guys look like P B S 70's series the blood hound gang. Similar to the computer club which got pick on in high school! Becoming old an predictable. A evil plot twist with evil male old money business people just like the old Bond bad guys who have a evil plan. The inevitable Michael Creighton script of a technology meltdown disaster movie. Not bad but entertaining. Jeff Goldblum strongly argues Fallen Kingdom's social message of Natural Law vs Man's interruption of nature. What will happen when new technology is unleashed on nature. New genetics, people, different animals, bugs being introduced to places nature did not intend could have negative results. What happens to the environment, the genome, killing bio diversity, and the eco-system! Funny, a usually P C script, with a social message which contradicts the P C culture.

The plot is reminiscent of The Lost World: Jurassic Park - our protagonists try to save the dinosaurs and let them roam free in their natural habitat, while dealing with corporate officials who want to exploit them. A somewhat exciting plot, but much of the action - both dinosaurs and humans - were overkill or overly done. The acting was OK, with Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard delivering for the film, while newcomers Justin Smith and Daniella Pineda gave overzealous and crappy performances. Jeff Goldblum gave a new reprisal of his Ian Malcolm role. There were some nice heartfelt moments with the dinosaurs as well. Overall, again, an entertaining film, but overdone.

In this sequel Owen Grady and Claire Dearing return to the abandoned Jurassic World theme park, in order to rescue the dinosaurs there from an imminent volcanic eruption. 'JURASSIC WORLD's writers, Colin Trevorrow (who also helmed the 2015 film) and Derek Connolly, returned to script this entry as well, and J.A. Bayona took over directing duties. Steven Spielberg (the original film's director) returned as an executive producer once again. The returning cast this time (from multiple other installments) includes Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, B. D. Wong and Jeff Goldblum. While Rafe Spall, Justice Smith, Daniella Pineda, Isabella Sermon, Ted Levine, James Cromwell and Toby Jones joined the cast. It's received mixed reviews from critics, and it's another gigantic hit at the Box Office as well of course. I loved it.A volcanic eruption is set to destroy Isla Nublar, and the United States Senate is holding a debate on whether the dinosaurs there should be saved or not. The Senate disapproves doing anything to save the animals, so Claire Dearing (Howard) creates the Dinosaur Protection Group, and she receives financial support from Benjamin Lockwood (Cromwell) in order to go to Nublar and rescue the dinosaurs. Claire also enlists the help of her former lover, Owen Grady (Pratt). Things get complicated when Lockwood's aide, Eli Mills (Spall), double-crosses the team in order to sell the dinosaurs for a huge profit. The movie is spectacularly entertaining! There's definitely some really cool creature attack scenes in it, and an awesome volcanic eruption escape scene as well, involving a drugged hero narrowly fleeing his death (in a totally classic scene in my opinion). There's also a great animal liberation message throughout the film too, that I love (being a vegan and Animal Rights activist). I really had a great time watching it, and I think the movie is an important animal rights film (for everyone to see) as well.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

I'm certain this fallen kingdom's script was written in under a weekend and never edited.So, you liked the nostalgia from Jurassic World? Well, let's shove an unwanted ten times more down your throat. You like environmental messages? I believe you still have room to shove more down your throat. And you love that young, Spielberg-type comic relief that'll ensure laughs even in the tensest of times? Oops, sorry, the ""comic relief"" in this movie is criminally unfunny.""Taking dinosaurs off this island is the worst idea in the long, sad history of bad ideas. And I'm gonna be there when you learn that,"" predicts Dr. Ian Malcolm from The Lost World: Jurassic Park. And, boy was he right, in many different ways, but in regards to bad ideas, take the volcano.You seriously built the second park on a potentially island-ending volcano? Or was that just a convenient plot device for Part V...oh. Never mind.The fourth Jurassic movie ripped off the first one, so naturally, the fifth installment would rip-off the second Jurassic sequel. It's all about the same characters tricked into going back to the island they barely survived previously and the most obvious evil businessmen who want to take the dinos off the island.I spent a good 60% of this movie viciously shaking my head at actions/reactions that would surely never happen and even going as far as to say outloud, ""Nope. Nope. Nope."" I understand you should have to suspend your disbelief for a movie about genetically engineered dinosaurs, but I'm talking about the impossible stunts, simple physics and increasingly dumb mistakes no human would make but these characters did oh so frequently.This movie was so horribly written, edited and paced, overlong to the point 20-30 minutes could've been cut, darker and yet more dumbed down for kids and not a single character stood out or had an ounce of chemistry with each other. Oh, okay, I'll give the character of Zia Rodriguez some credit. I did like her character.And I loved the special effects in the first third, which is what you would've seen in the trailers. It's just the last two-thirds that progressively fell-apart with the worst message to give. In fact, I kept refuting that dumb environmental decision and added that to my head-shaking exercise throughout.Well, I can say, if you're impressed with what you saw in the trailer, come, stay for the first third and just leave then. Nothing else is worth staying for.***Final thoughts: Can't believe I'm saying this, but Jurassic Park III is no longer the worst movie in the franchise.

And yet ""inept"" kept creeping into my thoughts as I watched, even though ""lazy"" is probably closer to the mark.The basic premise is Jurassic World is about to sink and people are conflicted about whether to save them. When the chance to save a bunch of them arises, Claire - that lady who ran around in high heels in the last movie, but seems to have developed some sense in this one - persuades dinosaur wrangler Owen to come to the island to help.Of course, if good people are risking their lives to save monsters, figure bad people will too. The reasons for this are pretty nonsensical, and the bad guys have that incompetent indifference that is just what you don't want in people handling dinosaurs. They make the first of the movie's many, many unforced errors; people are really stupid in this movie.The director seems to wants to mix excitement with humor, like Guardians of the Galaxy, but instead manages to pit the two against each other, with weak humor diluting the suspense. The movie desperately wants to make you laugh, and cry, and scream, but it can't pull off any of those.The story is predictable and bland. The director sometimes fails to make clear what instigated a situation, so I often felt vaguely puzzled by why things were unrolling as they were. And while the series has always been about vast jungles full of dinosaurs, most of this movie takes place in a guy's mansion. If the writer had a secret vendetta against the series and wanted to kill it off, setting a dinosaur movie in a house is pretty much the perfect way to do it.There are decent moments, like one capping an otherwise rather uninteresting opening sequence, and the special effects are excellent, but I wouldn't say this film is remotely worth watching.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
34,FeastMode,darker and scarier,7,26 July 2019,"The first time i watched this i was disappointed and gave it a 5/10. after giving it another shot, i'm not really sure what happened. a possible combination of high expectations the first time, and knowing what to expect the second time (especially with regards to the first half being much more action packed), and preparing myself to ignore the endlessly annoying techie character. but i really enjoyed it.the first half is fantastic, including the best scene in the movie. the second half is a terrifying horror film. if you put yourself in the shoes of these characters, you will be on the edge of your seat.the entire movie is filled with suspense. lots of great scenes and beautiful shots. there is still some stupid stuff but i would definitely watch it again (2 viewings, 2/14/2021)

35,MOscarbradley,The best of the series since the original.,8,12 June 2020,"While it may not quite be in the same league os Spielberg's original, ""Jurassic World; Fallen Kingdom"" is certainly the best of the sequels. It's got a better than average plot, a funny script, excellent special effects and a good cast. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are back. Jeff Goldblum makes an appearance and Rafe Spall, Toby Jones and Ted Levine are excellent villains. The director is J.A. Bayona who has already proved his mettle with the likes of ""The Impossible"" and ""A Monster Calls"" and he certainly knows how to make a monster movie. In fact, as monster movies go this one has classic written all over it, (there's even a nod in the direction of ""King Kong""), and, of course, yet another sequel seems almost certain. It may play to the gallery and perhaps it's a little too in awe of the first film in the franchise but you don't go to a movie called ""Jurassic World; Fallen Kingdom"" expecting high art or even too much originality. I loved it.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Another aspect when the truck was left outside standing straight in front of ship. Like serously? What odd is this happening? The next aspect when the girl decides to hide from the dinosaur by hiding in the bed under sheet? She always acts very thoughtful and suddenly she decides to do this crap?

37,Pjtaylor-96-138044,There are flashes of greatness but a majority that pull those down.,5,10 June 2018,"'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018)' brings the suspense back into the series, with some genuinely tense sequences almost reminding you of the franchise's roots. It also brings several surprises that ultimately make for a rather refreshing experience that unfortunately puts hurdles in its own path, by way of unnecessarily nonsensical plot-points and dull political-intrigue elements, and proceeds to stumble over them just when you start to settle into its rhythm. It is certainly an improvement over its immediate predecessor. In general, the characters are given a little more care and are allowed some room to breathe. Still, they don't really change and aren't great lenses through which to view this world. The most believable is the new character played by Justice Smith, who's panicked demeanour is unique yet honest and who's ability to act in situations he clearly (and rightfully) finds incredibly scary is admirable. The structure of the piece isn't conventional, either. This causes a lax pacing in the midriff that makes the movie feel a tad too long. As I mentioned, the scares are the best part. They are constructed like scenes from a perhaps more traditional horror movie, which is unsurprising considering the genre-confident director. Without a solid foundation, though, there's little to keep you engaged once the suspense inevitably falls away. It does so on multiple occasions in favour of your basic 'blockbuster' schlock that's only slightly better than average. The flick unfortunately doesn't really provide the pure entertainment, or even engagement, that should act as a net to catch all the fragments of its more successful elements. That's why it works so well at times, and so poorly at others. Instead of being mediocre throughout, there are flashes of greatness and a majority that pull those down. Still, at least it's interesting. 5/10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
38,ThomasDrufke,Jurassic Mansion,4,5 July 2018,"So let me get this straight, they decided to make follow ups/sequels/reboot/requel/re-imagining/whatever you want to call it to the original Jurassic Park movies, title them Jurassic World, and then not have the films take full advantage of that title by keeping the stories contained and derivative? Well, yep that's exactly what they did. Where Jurassic World stayed on the island for the entire movie (showcasing the park in all its glory or the first time), and about 65% of Fallen Kingdom takes place in a mansion. WHY are these films called Jurassic World if they take place in a confined space? And that's just the premise, the film itself is a big waste of time. Admittedly, the first 30 minutes sucked me in with the thrills of seeing the island go up in flames in a big action set piece, along with some unexpectedly emotional beats mixed in. But it's far from enough in what is slow building, lackluster thriller, with some seriously questionable character choices made in the 3rd act. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are perfectly fine, with the ladder having much more to do this time around, but I can't help but think this film needed more bold choices and something different. There's so much repeated in the script, ""scares"", and laughable 3rd act. Seriously, it takes place in a mansion?! Do we seriously have to wait for a 3rd film to get the dinosaurs out into the real world?4.3/10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
39,MLDinTN,one of the worst adventure scripts ever written,2,11 March 2019,"I don't know how this script got a go ahead. It's terrible and this is by far the worst movie in the Jurassic Park franchise. The action scenes are awful because they are so unbelievable. Like in the beginning, when Owen and Claire go to the dinosaur island and the volcano explodes. First Owen is paralyzed, yet comes around right when the lava is mere inches away. Then when he is running from the volcano blast, some how he can out run it, when the dinosaurs can't. And he can hold is breathe long enough to get Claire and Franklin out of the bubble. Then the launch of the truck to make the boat as its leaving. That was impossible. Then you have the one dimensional villain whom wants to sell the dinosaurs. And of the course the ending, no one would have made that decision. I guess in the sequel the US mainland will be a dino kill zone.FINAL VERDICT: Even the special effects can't save this movie. It's too bad. If you are over the age of 12, don't watch this.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
40,ericstevenson,"First half was good, second half was bad",6,24 June 2018,"Here we are in the fifth entry in the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise. It's easy to say that none of them will be as good as the original. The movie's basic plot is that the island the last dinosaurs are living on is about to be consumed by a volcano, so scientists try to get some specimens off the island. Halfway through the movie, the entire plot however, is changed. Now, it's about these villains who want to auction the dinosaurs off. It really does help that Chris Pratt is a good actor.The problem is that in the second half, they just re-use the plot from the previous film! They create a new dinosaur as a weapon and it's smaller than the first one and we don't even see it run in the wild! The best part is probably how we still get a nice relationship between Owen (Chris Pratt) and his raptor, Blue. It was nice to see Jeff Goldblum come back...and he's on screen for only a few minutes. In my opinion, you can just watch the first half and leave the theater. Hey, this is the first movie I saw using Fandango! **1/2",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

43,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews,5,12 September 2018,"Jurassic World: Fallen KingdomThe big difference between a Disney and a Jurassic theme park is that the workers inside of the dinosaur mascots were eaten.An active volcano, like the one in this sci-fi movie, would be another disparity between the parks.Three years after Jurassic World was abandoned to its reptilian inhabitants a volcanic eruption threatens to wipeout the cloned species unless Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), the previous operations manager, and Owen (Chris Pratt), a Raptor wrangler, can save them from extinction. However, the solution to move the creatures to a private sanctuary may not be in the beasts' best interest either.While the visuals continue to dominate in this obligatory sequel to the blockbuster reboot of the franchise, Fallen Kingdom falters when it comes to telling a compelling or innovative story to accompany those eye-popping effects.

44,851222,Real dissapointment,6,19 May 2020,"Greetings from Lithuania.Since i really liked ""Jurassic World"" (2015) i was looking forward for this movie, yet haven't chance to see it upon its release. Then i heard it was pretty bad, and kinda lost my interest in it. So now i finally saw it on Blue Ray, and i can say that ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" (2018) is a real disappointment. The first thing that i kinda disliked was the story, and more the second half of this movie. First half has one good action sequence involving water - i won't spoil, seemingly done in one shoot. And the premise was also pretty involving. So the first half of the movie was pretty OK. But then the second half... i won't go into details but boy did that was a disappointment. Why is this movie even has words in its title like ""World"", ""Kingdom"" when basically its a monster flick with one very bad monster trying to kill few people in one location! That is it, that is the whole second half of this movie! And it all was so predictable, without a single more original idea.Overall, creators clearly left space for more movies, but after seeing this monster slasher flick, i just don't care anymore. First ""World"" was truly spectacular and had that sense of ""wow"". This one is just a very average at its best monster / slasher flick. Big disappointment.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
45,ironhorse_iv,"Although, this movie is still watchable, even with its flaws. It has really fallen out of favor. It's not quite rex.",7,15 August 2018,"The original 1993 movie ""Jurassic Park', based off, author, Michael Crichton's 1990 novel of the same name, tells the cautionary tale of playing God by cloning extinct animals & its dangers. The story was so well told, that maybe it should had been, a one off thing. After all, how many times, can you honestly, tell the same repetitive story about genetic engineer dinosaurs, before the concept run dry or become a parody of itself!? Well, Universal, haven't scratch the bottom of the barrel, yet. Therefore, they made sequels includes, 1997's 'Lost World: Jurassic Park', 2001's 'Jurassic Park III', 2015's 'Jurassic World' and this one. Unoriginal written by screenwriter, Derek Connolly with help from producer, Colin Trevorrow; the film has the characters from the 2015 reboot, go back to Isla Nublar, in order to save the dinosaurs, from a disaster, only to find out, that the employer, who hired them, have more sinister plans for the creatures. Without spoiling the movie directed by J.A Bayona, too much, the whole idea of dinosaurs being sold as military weapons is just stupid. No military would take that seriously. After all, large war animals would be an economical and logistical nightmare to manage, especially when a random enemy soldier could kill it with simpler, cheaper firearms and explosives. They're really not useful in warfare, unless it's for biological diseases, which the film, never mention. Seeing them as weapons is just as absurd as building a theme park on active volcano. While, those scenes were indeed epic & in the original book. I really couldn't buy into the idea that carnivore animals would still hunt, while the entire island is being engulfed. It was really out there, unrealistic. Even if, they are extremely hungry, while, they could, very well, had been, most animal would still behave in a matter of flight during such an intense natural hyperarousal environmental moment. The T-Rex coming for the save was poorly written deus ex machina. The same with the loose science of convection of paralysis, wearing off. The idea that a man can not only survived, being shot by a tranquilizer dart, used to capture large creatures, but also have the strength to outrun, a few minutes later, from a very fast pyroclastic cloud, really took me out of the movie. Don't get me wrong, the director does know how to handle faithful large-scale destruction with gothic horror with confidence; but this story really needs requirement of suspension of disbelief to get through like overlooking the fact that the heroes didn't know about the monster in the basement. I wish, the movie had more build up or crescendo to the action set pieces. Even, mysteries like the whole twist toward, the end, with the kid was badly set up. Revealing it, during an action scene was not the right decision. It was disclose, a little too late. The shocking information did not have room to breathe. The audience couldn't take it all in. No wonder, why the potential emotional climatic decision of letting the dinosaurs live or die didn't seem so genuine. We hardly got to know, any good, grounded reasons for her, allowing those creatures to survive. After all, just a few minutes, earlier, that person was about to get eaten by them. So, the decision seem a bit loose, and made little sense. In truth, I would had love a lot more ambiguous ending, over this downer note. Another problem with this movie is that, it relies too excessively on the past tropes from this franchise. Thus, parts of the story become very recycle, predictable, and paper-thin. Don't get me wrong, I like some of the homages and nods to previous films like, seeing the Brachiosaurus & the rebirth of Site B; as they were emotional and heart-tugging great symbolism of birth and death. However, it's a bad sign if some of these, so-called new supporting characters are starting to seem like cartoon caricature of past characters, a little too much. In truth, none of them are that well-written. Most of them, comes across, as annoying, given their how much, time, the main personnel have to babysit them & the outrageous stuff, they say. If that wasn't bad enough, the acting from these performers are artificial fake. Because of that, these characters will make you wish, they get eaten, as soon as they're introduce. Even the main cast was not that great. Chris Pratt kinda works as Owen Grady, but the movie gave him, little to work with. He felt like a tediously infallible, dead-eyed action figure with hardly any complexity. As for his co-star, Bryce Dallas Howard, she was given less to do, with Claire Dearing. While, Claire wasn't quite a stick-in-the-mud as the last movie. She's inoffensive and unremarkable. Still, it was bit jarring to see her, care for the dinosaurs, now, after exploiting them in the last movie. Shouldn't Claire be in jail? After all, it's pretty much, all her fault that the theme park went into chaos. As for Jeff Goldblum returning as Ian Malcolm. It was just a tease, nothing more. Despite that, the movie still delivers where it ultimately counts: the dinosaurs. The movie has a vast collection of species, appearing on screen. Other redeeming qualities is the fact, that the movie pacing is pretty fast, and straight forward. There weren't hardly any slow moments. Also, it's cool to see that the movie does have more horror elements than the previous film, even if, some of them, seem too unrealistic plan-out like the bedroom sequence. The use of shadows were very well done. Practical effects and CGI are also merged seamlessly here. It was somewhat convincing. This movie also spared no expense with the music. Michael Giacchino's score was fine for what the movie was trying to say with its darker atmosphere. Overall: Regardless of all the faults. I still kinda enjoyed this movie. This is one dinosaur movie, somewhat worth digging for.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
46,Platypuschow,Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom: Time to go back to the drawning board,4,2 August 2018,"Critically slammed by the critics but praised by fans, so what did I think of it?I've soured on Chris Pratt, like really quite badly so. From him simply being in too much and being the ""Current big thing"" to his vocalising his love for trophy hunting like a mentally deficient human being to his recent magical cloud man speech at an awards show. I'm burnt out on his presence and detest seeing such a vile human being on my screen, so understandably that did damage Fallen Kingdom for me.With yet another excuse why they absolutely had to go back to an island full of man eating dinosaurs this standard cliched Hollywood tripe see's our heroes trying to save the giant reptiles from a volcano. It's big, it's flashy, it's loud, it's dumb, it's predictible and it's a genital slap around the face that they paid over 170 million for something so entirely devoid of originality.For me the order of JP films from best to worst would now be 1, 2, 4, 5, 3 and I'm under the firm belief after seeing this that they badly need to go back to drawing board and either rethink the strategy or cease making them (As in REALLY cease, not wait a few years and reboot).Seen it all before and though the finale is interesting, it raises questions that ultimately make the whole concept unbelievable.The Good:A couple of interesting ideasBlueThe Bad:GoldblumThat one scene when the Volcano erupts, screw you writersNo originalityGeneric Hollywood nonsenseChris PrattThings I Learnt From This Movie:Acts of god are the will of god and therefore we won't do anything about them............except all the times we do, but then it's different.If you need to kill something for pleasure, start with yourselfEngage with reality, there are NO gods.

48,The-Sarkologist,Pretty Much More of the Same,4,9 June 2020,"Apparently there is a sixth movie in production, though I'm not sure if the time line is still as it was previously. Anyway, this is the fifth movie in the franchise, and it turns out that there is a volcano about to destroy Isla Nubla, and there is a debate as to whether to rescue the dinosaurs or not. Mind you, there is no mention whatsoever about Isla Sorna, where I believe there were also a number of dinosaurs located, and sort of wander why it is that if this second site existed, why would the destruction of Isla Nubar result in the second extinction of the dinosaurs.Well, that aside, it turns out that there are a number of people who sort of want to rescue the dinosaurs anyway, but not for the reason that our heroes think to be the case (noting, of course, that Claire has certainly changed significantly since the previous film, and of course Owen Grady returns as well, though I should point out that, not surprisingly, they didn't end up continuing with their relationship).So, they go and rescue the dinosaurs, only to find themselves trapped on the island, except that they do manage to escape, despite the escape attempt being rather dubious and why the people on the ship didn't pick up on the fact that this extra truck managed to jump off the jetty and into the back of the boat. Anyway, as it turns out they are taking the dinosaurs to auction them off to the highest bidder, and surprise, surprise, they have once again made another genetric mutation to turn these dinosaurs into weapons of war.Yeah, I felt that this film dragged on a bit, and it really wasn't all that exciting, but then again I didn't really feel that any of the previous films were all that exciting either. In fact, many of them just seemed to be the same old story with a slightly different theme, and of course more powerful dinosaurs being created to have a somewhat intense ending. Further, there is still the idea of some guys trying to weaponise these creatures, though I do note that this wasn't the case in the third film.In a way it would be interesting to see how the sixth film turns out, though a part of me really isn't expecting too much. It took me a while to actually get around to watching these versions and I'm not in too much of a hurry to go and see the final installment, though now that I have watched the five that have been released, I suspect that I will eventually go and see the sixth, and hopefully final, installment.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

'The Impossible' - directed by J.A Bayona - is one of my favorite films. What happened with this Jurassic World installment??? I'm not sure whether this was intended to be a spoof or a comedy, or whether it is just so bad that it is comical in a non-humorist way. Or maybe the writers are to blame for such a preposterous script. I can't believe professionals in the industry concocted this idiotic film. The original 'Jurassic Park' - way back in 1993 - had a simple premise and it was filled with action and suspense and was just really awesome. In this film, they tried so hard to give it a complex premise with a few twists that it ruined the entire film. I mean, there's this 'big reveal' at the end - spoiler - where the daughter, Maisie, turns out to be a clone. So what??? This doesn't affect the film in any way an no-one cares about her or what she is anyway, so what does it matter? The suspense - if you can call it that - was forced for most of the film. The humor was annoying. Even the visuals were not all that great considering the modern age of CGI we live in. (Again, the visuals of the 1993 film by far surpassed this!). The acting was so bad! The dialogue was terrible. There's nothing credible here. This was a Jurassic comedy!! There are just so many plot flaws that I won't even go into them, because I think I can write an entire manuscript on it. This movie was killing my brain cells so badly that I couldn't wait for it to end. It felt like a Playstation simulation. If the film was not called 'Jurassic World' with any reference to Jurassic Park, I'm certain it would have been a box office flop. It's like a B-move for crying out loud!

53,tomgillespie2002,The dullest entry since Jurassic Park III,4,15 September 2018,"Everybody's favourite mathematician, Dr. Ian Malcolm, warned misguided entrepreneur John Hammond 25 years ago of the perils of playing god and re-awakening dinosaurs from their extinct slumber. Of course, he was right, and the result was a personal childhood favourite. What he didn't foresee were the increasingly numbing sequels that would follow in the wake of Steven Spielberg's 1993 classic, which serve as a reminder not only of Spielberg's magical touch (let's pretend he wasn't responsible for The Lost World), but that general audiences will happily hand over their money to watch the same thing again and again. Jurassic World was unbelievably stupid, but its slightly schlocky attitude managed to scrape it a pass. Somehow, it became the third highest-grossing film of all time, so a sequel, or a trilogy (why not?), was quickly set in motion. Despite attracting a fantastic director in J.A. Bayona, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is the dullest entry since Jurassic Park III and manages, once again, to somehow make dinosaurs boring.In the wake of a devastating volcanic eruption on Isla Nublar, Jeff Goldblum's Ian Malcolm is back to warn the U.S. Senate that rescuing the soon-to-be-lava-toast dinosaurs could have devastating repercussions for humanity, and once again states his belief that such unnatural tampering should have never been attempted in the first place. Protesters have gathered across the country in an attempt to convince the government that these creatures deserve another chance, and just when you think the film will serve as an allegory of our own mistreatment of the planet, the action zips across to Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), who has set up a fundraiser to rescue the animals. The efforts of Claire and her cronies Zia (Daniella Pineda) and Franklin (Justice Smith) have failed to raise enough cash, but things look up when Claire is invited to the estate of Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell), John Hammond's former partner. Lockwood and his slickly-dressed aide Eli Mills (Rafe Spall) reveal a plan to rescue as many dinosaurs as they can and transport them to another island facility, where they will live in isolation and peace.As soon as you set eyes on the mercenary team led by Ted Levin's Ken Wheatley, you'll have figured out exactly where the story is going and what everyone's motives are. Mills' combination of slicked-back hair and friendly demeanour is a dead giveaway, and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom continues Hollywood's recent obsession with the amoral corporate bad guy. Wheatley's is Pete Postlethwaite's character from The Lost World, only without the gravitas and sense of backstory. Of course, their plan is to steal the dinosaurs and sell them on the black market, backed by Toby Jones' millionaire auctioneer Gunnar Eversol. They've also been working on their own little project, the Indoraptor, the genetically-modified brainchild of mad scientist Dr. Wu (BD Wong). Thank God then, that amidst all of this mess emerges the lovable face of Chris Pratt, dressed in manly clothes and building a manly house. Pratt's Owen Grady and Claire ended Jurassic World as a happy couple, but they have since drifted apart, presumably because Owen only plays by his own manly rules. They are reunited because Claire wants him on Isla Nublar, and we remember what little chemistry they share. But Pratt is charismatic and hugely likeable, a true movie star should he ever find a decent role outside of Guardians of the Galaxy.What makes Jurassic World: Fallen Kimgdom so unforgivably dull is the sheer lack of care taken with the set-pieces. One thrilling struggle under water - shot with one impressively long take - aside, Bayona and writers Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow don't seem particularly interested in exploring fresh ways to pit man against dinosaur. The opening scene, shot in near darkness, sees an unfortunate soul stalked and gobbled up by one of the predators, but the piece is crafted with such lazy editing and unimaginative build-up that it barely raises the heartbeat. For a director who conjured such wonderful atmospheres in The Orphanage and A Monster Calls, Fallen Kingdom is glaringly hollow, and the whole thing reeks of movie-making by committee. The dinosaurs relocation from jungle to Mills' underground laboratory - a labyrinth of corridors, control rooms and difficult-to-close dumbwaiters - is the only thing that really passes for invention, and it's a relief not have to watch the characters hunted in the jungle once again. The ending leaves the future of Hammond's dinosaurs as something to be explored in the next film, but there is little doubt that this franchise will strut on for many years to come. My investment in it, however, has all but vanished entirely.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
54,Thanos_Alfie,Not as good as the first Jurassic World...,6,21 November 2018,"""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" is the sequel of Jurassic World in which we are three years after the Jurassic World theme park was closed down. Owen and Claire return to Isla Nublar in order to save as many dinosaurs as they can while they will try to avoid a volcano which is ready to erupt on the island and destroy all life there. Another thing that they have to keep in mind is that a conspiracy has taken place that can disrupt the natural order of the entire planet.I have to admit that I expected more from this movie and since I was not a fan of the first one, I have to say that this movie is just an average movie and nothing more. The plot was a bit boring and in some points, it was just like we were watching hide and seek. Regarding the interpretations, I have to say that Chris Pratt who played as Owen Grady was once more amazing and very funny. Once more the interpretation of Bryce Dallas Howard who played as Claire Dearing was average and I believe that she did not rich her potential. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned is Rafe Spall's who played as Eli Mills and he was very good at it. The direction which was made by J.A. Bayona was not as good as the first one and since I am a big fan of the first trilogy and especially to the first Jurassic Park movie I believe that Jurassic World cannot even reach it.Finally, I have to say that ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" is another average movie with dinosaurs and nothing more. Unfortunately, this time some good interpretations and good CGI's cannot overcome the bad and boring plot. If you are a fan of dinosaur movies I am sure that you are going to be let down by it and if you are a fan of the first movie or the first original trilogy of Jurassic Park then I am completely sure that you are going to waste your time watching it.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
55,cruise01,"An uneven plot, but still a fun exciting adventure that opens the door to a new direction.",8,23 June 2018,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (4 out of 5 stars).Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom brings another fun filled science fiction adventure into the franchise. This time expanding the story out of the island were prehistoric dinosaurs inhabited. All started with one brilliant mind of John Hammond (from the original Jurassic Park movie). Scientist is able to recreate dinosaurs from dna they recovered. And make a theme park were it went awry and dinosaurs took over. Now, from the speech of Ian (Jeff Goldblum) in a brief appearance in this film. The island of Jurassic World is about to be destroyed from an active volcano. And the debate if the dinosaurs should be rescued or left to perish in the volcano. Ian's speech if they do not let nature recorrect the course in making dinosaurs extinct. Humans will be facing a bigger threat of extinction if dinosaurs inhabit the planet. That is the theme of this movie. A human's greed on weaponizing dinosaurs for there own personal use. The plot follows a few years after the last movie. Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) needs Owen's (Chris Pratt) help in finding blue. She is recruited by Eli (Rafe Spall) who works for Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell) who wants to rescue several dinosaurs on the island and bring them to a safe haven island. Once on the island, Claire and Owen discover there is more to the rescue ops when Eli and his paramilitary have another agenda on bringing the dinosaurs back to Lockwood's estate. What worked great with the movie? The film does have a lot of action sequences that will keep you entertained or on the edge of your seat. The opening scene was a mini submarine facing against Mosasaurus (the dino that swims under water). It does set the tone with its suspenseful direction. It is directed by J.A. Bayona (who works on most horror movies or suspense). Then, the first hour of the movie picks up with Claire and Owen being on the island trying to find blue and escaping from the volcano. The sequence with the volcano blast having the dinosaurs stampede away from it and Owen, Claire, and Franklin (Justice Smith) running with them was spectacular. And will put you on the edge of your seat. Then, the second hour of the movie slows down and takes place on Lockwood estate. Which swirls away from being a blockbuster film and turns into a suspenseful direction. When dinosaurs are being auctioned off. And a newly created raptor escapes, killing anything in its path. Owen and Claire and Lockwood's granddaughter Maisie (Isabella Sermon) try to escape and stop the new raptor from escaping. Maisie also plays a central character into the plot. Which kind of throws a new direction on were this franchise might be heading. Isabella Sermon is a talented bright young actress. New additions like Justice Smith who has a phobia almost about everything is comical and fun. And Daniella Pineda playing a hipster doctor that accompanies Claire is fun too. The visual effects are great as always and also there is more practical animatronics work with the dinosaurs. What was not good about the film? I feel like the direction of the story changed a little too much in the third act of the movie. Went from being an adventurous fun exciting movie to a horror suspense film. With characters hiding from a newly created predator with lots of shadow appearances or dark tone lighting. It was entertaining but the climax was a bit short lived. Plus the story taking place off the island was not as exciting when it was focusing on Eli orchestrating an auction and showing the evil side of people's greedy side.But Blue at least makes an appearance delivering the emotions of being an intelligent raptor and being an aid to Owen when facing against the bad raptor. Overall, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a good science fiction film. If I was to list the best films in the franchise to the worst. I will say the best starts with the first Jurassic Park, Jurassic World, The Lost World, then Fallen Kingdom, and last the third film. Still a fun sequel and I am excited to see were a third Jurassic World goes next. Also, there is an end post credit scene which may not be as important. Just a fun few second scene.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

This sequel is much of the same but does lesser than the original. There is some interest towards the end but as a whole the story is quite bland, and the new characters aren't as interesting. Also the film is quite predictable and doesn't provide much of anything new or special.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
57,eddie_baggins,This newest entry into the beloved Dino-series lacks bite,5,22 June 2018,"There was a lot of love in everyone's heart's for the reimaging of the Jurassic Park franchise in 2015, when the Chris Pratt led Jurassic World made its way into cinema's and into the top tier class of Box Office behemoths with over 1.6 billion in takings world-wide.Most critics loved director Colin Trevorrow's take on the dinosaur's come to life plotline, while Pratt doing his best incarnation of Star Lord the Dino Whisperer alongside some well-designed CGI carnage got the audiences approval but after 3 years between drinks, it's hard to see the same type of love being afforded to The Impossible and A Monster Calls director J.A Bayona's newest entry into the long standing franchise.There's little doubt the tills will be filling up with audiences keen for more Jurassic action but Fallen Kingdom lacks the spark, creativity and spectacle that has been found in the best of the Jurassic films and ends up becoming a dino-filled experience that lacks the enthusiasm and bite needed in a series that is now in its fifth instalment.Bayona has made a name for himself with a visually powerful catalogue of film's that also includes the great horror flick The Orphanage and few could ever forget his amazing representation of the Boxing Day tsunami in The Impossible but despite some early set-pieces and a thrilling extended sequence on the island of Isla Nublar where an active volcano decides to explode, Fallen Kingdom fails to deliver the thrills and dino-chills that have been found in the best of the series.There's no trembling cup of water, no velociraptor chases through long grass or bike v dinosaurs which makes Fallen Kingdom feel rather plain and boring, especially when considering that Bayona has a clear divide in tone, as the attention of the film shifts in its second half to a more odd take on the gothic monster tale as a genetically created dinosaur known as the Indoraptor comes into the picture in a human infested mansion in the woods that's supposed to be more horror orientated than action focussed.It's an odd shift of tone and while it's nice to see Bayona try to shift the focus away from previous films, it doesn't fully work, especially when the human players in the film fail to connect also.If you've seen the first Jurassic World then you know what to expect from its returning stars Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, even if both performers have a lot less to work with this time around, but most of the new additions, bar the comic relief of Justice Smith as nerdy IT guy Franklin, fail to make any form of a mark.A problem stemming from the last film, the series in particular has failed to find a genuinely good human big-bad and that's the case again here with new villains, Rafe Spall's slimy businessman Eli Mills and Ted Levine's grizzled tooth-collecting gun for hire Ken Wheatley, both so generic and bland that you'll forget they even existed come the end credits, while the newest addition of ""lab-made"" super-monster is just as tiresome as you'd expect.It's all good for a film of this nature to give itself to its dino-creations, but when the humans get such short-shift, there's only so far the film can go.Final Say - With a weakish script and a bunch of poorly developed new characters, Fallen Kingdom is a rather so-so affair and its divide between two distinctive halves is a move that doesn't pay off, as its much better (if rushed) opening half gives way to a 2nd act that fails to inspire like the best of the Jurassic franchise entries.With a planned trilogy finale scheduled for a few years' time, the next Jurassic World entry has its work cut out for it should it wish to get viewers excited again after this middle of the road offering.2 ½ goats out of 5",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
58,filipemanuelneto,A casino machine.,2,9 May 2020,"There are bad and good directors, but there are also those who make bad decisions. Personally, I don't know how to qualify what I just saw, reflecting a little on the career of J. A. Bayona, who proved to be skilled in films like ""The Orphanage"". I think a film like this may not be the director's strong suit.The script is a sequel to the precedent 2015 film: after the closure of the ""Jurassic World"" and the death of Masrani, the world witnesses the eruption of the volcano on Nublar Island, which puts the laboratory-made dinosaurs in the imminence of a new extinction. So, millionaire Benjamin Lockwood makes an effort to save some specimens and take them to a sanctuary, away from humans. What nobody knows is that there are people interested in the animals never reaching this sanctuary.Again, we are witnessing a remake of the old formula of the franchise, with dinosaurs on the loose and the failure of all security measures to contain or transport them. Again, we see situations that are very similar to what we have seen in previous films. Again, we feel that everything is empty, meaningless, lifeless and that there is no danger or emotion.Again we have an irregular cast, but in a worse shape than in the previous film, where the feeling of newness helped to refresh things: Bryce Dallas Howard looks worn and with nothing new to give us, but she is competent in what she does; Chris Pratt did a good job, however he is very much like an Indiana Jones determined to save everyone and everything; James Cromwell is a veteran and does his job well but only appears on time, just like Toby Jones, competent as another opportunistic character. Rafe Spall sounds fake and never seems fully committed, Isabella Sermon exists only to be in danger and to help at the last minute, Ted Levine looks like a sergeant in the military recruit and Jeff Goldblum makes a honour cameo but that's all.Again, and as a standard of the franchise, the bet goes to the action and danger scenes, as well as technical details, effects and production values. However, even at these points it is not convincing or capable of impressing us. The lack of life and emotion removes the sense of danger from the most intense scenes and the technical details and CGI seem worn out. There is a lot of money involved, but there is nothing really new. The incredible soundtrack is still present and the sets and props are very good. Cinematography is also good, but the color we admire on the previous film is missing. This one, being darker and with many essential scenes in low light environments, looks more foggy.Betting on the continuation of exhausted franchises, like this one, is usually a mistake that is justified only by the good it usually does to the coffers of the industry and film companies. Thus, there are films that turn out to be true casino machines, ready to take money from the audience in exchange for very little, almost nothing. This is one of those films, and I don't recommend it.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
59,leonblackwood,Not that different from the earlier movies in this franchise! 5/10,5,10 January 2019,"Review:
When will they ever learn! Once again, people are trying to control dinosaurs, even though they have been gobbling up humans for over 16 years, so you can imagine where this film is going. I must admit, I wasn't that impressed with this movie, after anticipating this sequel for some time, mainly because the storyline was weak and there were way too many coincidences throughout the movie, which made it totally unbelievable. I know that a film about dinosaurs is supposed to be fantasy, but when a group of people go to an island to save the dinosaurs, and on the same day a volcano erupts, that's either bad luck or bad script writing. I pick the latter! The acting was also a bit poor, and the so-called wit, especially from Chris Pratt, was more annoying than funny. With that aside, the effects were brilliant, and when the dinosaurs took a chunk out of the humans it did look gruesome but I was expecting more, especially with Steven Spielberg in the executive producer chair. Anyway, the movie kicks off with a U.S. Senate hearing in Washington, were Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) testifies that the dinosaurs should be allowed to perish to correct John Hammond's mistake of cloning them. Meanwhile, Jurassic World's former operations manager, Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) has established the Dinosaur Protection Group to save the animals. After the Senate rules against rescuing the dinosaurs, Hammond's former partner, Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell), summons Claire to his Northern California estate. Lockwood and his aide, Eli Mills (Rafe Spall) reveal a plan to relocate the dinosaurs to a new island sanctuary, and they ask Claire to help reactivate the parks dinosaur tracking system, to locate the animals. They are more interested in Blue, the last surviving Velociraptor, so they ask Claire to locate Jurassic World's former trainer and Blues alpha, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) to capture her. On Isla Nublar, Claire reactivates the online tracking system, and a mercenary team, led by Ken Wheatley (Ted Levine), search and find Blue but the encounter escalates, resulting in a mercenary soldier shooting Blue. Ken shoots a tranquillise gun at Owen, and they take Blue and one of the specialist so they can treat Blue's injury. With the volcano erupting, Ken loads there ship with the captured dinosaurs and departs to U.S. mainland. Claire and Owen sneak onboard, even though the volcano is causing mass destruction, and they spend time-saving Blue, by using Tyrannosaurus Rex blood. They soon realize that the captured dinosaurs were never being transported to a new island, and are for another purpose. At Lockwood's estate, Lockwood's granddaughter Maisie (Isabella Sermon) overhears Eli and auctioneer Gunnar Eversol (Toby Jones), secretly planning to auction the captured dinosaurs on the black market. They will also unveil the Indoraptor, a new genetically-modified dinosaur created by the geneticist Dr. Henry Wu (BD Wong) using Indominus Rex and Velociraptor DNA. The dinosaurs are transported to Lockwood's estate and caged. Ken finds Claire and Owen, so he locks them up next to a Stygimoloch, who helps to break them free. They find Maisie, who leads them to the auction, where the Indoraptor is being sold, despite Wu's protests that it is a prototype. Owen disrupts the proceedings by luring the Stygimoloch into the room, causing chaos in the Lockwoods mansion, and the Indoraptor hunts for Owen, Claire and Maisie, which is finally killed by Blue. Although it's full of intensity, you just know that Owen and Claire are going to save the day, and a lot of the scenes have been duplicated from the older movies in this franchise. The ending was also a bit weird, with the dinosaurs free to roam earth, but it does make you think about how they're going to contain the situation. From an entertainment point of view, it does tick all the boxes but I still was hoping for some fresh ideas. As the Jurassic World was made as a 3 part series, I can only hope that the final instalment goes out with a bang, but we have to wait until 2021 to see what the dinosaurs gobble up next. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by J.A. Bayona, who also brought you The Orphanage, The Impossible and A Monster Calls. With such little experience behind the camera, I'm surprised he was chosen to direct such a massive project, especially after the success of Jurassic World. Although the movie made a hefty profit, and it's 12th in the highest-grossing film of all time chart, and 3rd in the highest-grossing film in 2018, it received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Pratt's and Howard's performance but they thought that the screenplay lacked innovation and the franchise had run its course. It would be great to see Spielberg in the directing chair for the finale, and Jeff Goldblum in a much bigger role, but I can't really see that happening. In all, I can't see this film making an impact like the original Jurassic Park but it's a watchable movie, that could have been better if it was in the right hands.Budget: $170million

60,TheMovieDiorama,Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom injects blockbusting life into this prehistoric franchise.,8,7 June 2018,"I'm going to start off with a bold statement. I believe this is the best sequel since the original. Take a moment, let that sink in. Want to know why? Simple, J.A. Bayona. Set after the events of 'Jurassic World', the island is left in a desolate ruin where its once dormant volcano becomes active. Owen and Claire are sent back to rescue the endangered dinosaurs from extinction, but not for a justified cause. We all know what to expect from this franchise. Fantastic visuals, engaging characters and some thrilling tension. All that exists, the narrative structure remains unchanged. However, what Bayona effectively embeds is a subtextual layer of melancholy (as with all his films). Tackling connotations of animal cruelty, environmental issues and the all important theme of ""mankind destroying Earth"". These dinosaurs are no longer the invincible predators of the animal kingdom, they've been subjugated to a world fuelled by greed. After the volcanic eruption, which is absolutely phenomenal by the way, there is a scene that evoked pure empathy as you watch these genetically created species perish in the ferocious flames. Selling dinosaurs like poachers trading ivory. Identifying characteristics in order to weaponise them. This is what humanity has become, this is what we are doing to our own ecological system. Bayona sidelined the standard ""runnnn! It's a dinosaur!"" and ensured the humanitarian construct was at the forefront. It worked! He proves you can have enthralling set pieces and elevate them through acute subtextual details. His directing technique is consistently engaging, with a standout one shot take where the Indoraptor unlocks a door. He was rotating, flipping and zooming in simultaneously. I muttered ""that was beautiful"" where the couple next to me glared at me and whispered. It's true, this comes across as unoriginal as it takes strands of DNA from previous iterations. However the blend of meaningful context and exciting set pieces makes for a roaring sequel that many will judge unfairly.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

No humans needed anymore in making movies.This is really a movie on autopilot and belongs to the dominion of Hollywood's tomb of boredom. The only reason why this product gets no 1 from me - solid acting, solid CGI.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
62,Ed-Shullivan,"Well Ted Levine, now you really know that Hollywood will eat you up and spit you out...literally!",8,4 July 2018,"Mrs. Shullivan, son #2, and I watched the film this weekend in 3D only because these were the only seats available in the theater. I personally dislike the 3D format. In my humble opinion 3D cheats the audience out of watching (any) big budget film for its quality acting and expected crisp cinematography. Instead, the director relies on cheap tricks, a slight of hand, and having our eyes focus solely on some stupid object as it pops out in front of us rather than on a film's plot, acting, and/or film content. In this film the two main stars Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt work well together with their on screen presence and they are an appealing couple while conversing one on one. Granted, neither the film, nor these two stars can compare to bonafide stars like Katherine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart in the 1951 film classic ""The African Queen"", nonetheless I enjoyed both of their performances.What I did like about the film was Ted Levine's performance as the smarmy Dinosaur wrangler Ken Wheatley who likes to yank a tooth out of each dinosaur species he captures to add to his necklace. Ahhhh, but Hollywood can be cruel to their actors sometimes and Mr. Levine who was looking for a big payday both as his character in this film, and in real life for starring in this feature film was in for the biggest surprise. He must have re-read the script several times to verify if he really was expected to go into the cage that houses the genetically enhanced most vicious dinosaur predator on the planet to try and extract one of this bad ass dinosaurs front teeth to add to his collection.There was sufficient interaction amongst the cast to keep our interest and the dinosaurs were well imagined. My only real complaint is I wish the studios would stop pushing the failed 3D format down our proverbial throats and to add insult to injury jack the admission fee by 20 percent for the privilege (puhhhhleassssse) of watching their latest big budget film in an inferior film format. Oh how I wish the original Technicolor format was re-instated!I give the film a decent 8 out of 10 rating",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

64,SAMTHEBESTEST,"Same Monstrous Entertainer, Nothing Special.",6,7 June 2018,"JURASSIC WORLD FALLEN KINGDOM REVIEW :-
The park is gone, creatures have been captured, humans are selling them in an Auction and they survives with the help of our heroes. Done with the brief story, no spoilers at all, all these stuff were shown in the promos and Film fulfiils all the expectations built by promos but what about showing something else? Something more? We're used to it now, dinosaurs's freedom, human's interruption in their lives, human's wanna be rich nature by using natural miracle creatures, some good people saving them and bla bla. Get over it and show us something else, how long you gonna make movies on the same stuff?Keeping those personal thoughts aside let's come to the review. Fallen Kingdom is another entertaining film in the franchise but there is nothing to be remembered. Half the film takes place in the park, 2nd half happens in a Bungalow. There are some terrific scenes but some moments too typical, cinematic and are too slow, test your patience litteally. No loo breaks unless you have seen enough monster scenes already and feel boring watching it again cause for some people this franchise is all about those terrifying scenes. Visually this film is Rich, the technical team has done a great job. Unfortunately i couldn't watch it in 3D otherwise i would have talked more deep on that. Talking about minuses, the first one is, the high note ending is missing. Raptors and a little girl are shown smarter than others, unacceptable. I don't want more films on dinosaurs, enough with this now and even if they make it then I'll make sure that i won't watch it in theatre.As a whole, Fallen Kingdom is Good watchable film for the monstrous and explosion reasons but just don't expect anything else. I fear this one might fail to catch its predecessor at box office as people can't show interest for the same thing again and again. I give 6/10* to this one which is less than Previous Jurassic World film (7/10*).",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
65,matthewssilverhammer,The Jurassic kingdom has certainly fallen...,3,29 June 2018,"Jurassic Park is at its best in its terror and humor, and pulling either of these off requires an element of surprise. Fallen Kingdom is so lacking in surprises, anyone who's seen more than a handful of movies will foresee every little thing. The amount of series clichés is staggering: some forced reason for going back to the island, recklessly dumb militarized villains, rich men making ineptly evil decisions, some dangerously upgraded dinosaur, the T-rex's last-minute rescue...it's a slapdash mix of familiar (non)awe and (non)terror. 
The ethical concept is a decent: what obligation do we have to save once-extinct creatures from annihilation? Unfortunately from there, very little time is spent on actual plot and character setup, opting for annoyingly blatant exposition in order to get to the forgettable action quicker. The film is covered in poorly-written character making inexcusably bad decisions, and corny story-beats leading to laughably ill-advised emotions; at one point, I swear I saw a dinosaur tear up. 
I honestly had high hopes for this one with director Bayona (Monster Calls) at the helm, and he does manage a couple of strong visuals (roaring dino being engulfed in ash) and mildly tense thrills (underwater Gyrosphere). But with writing this bad, there's only so much one can do to save it. 
I get that making these movies is like printing money; of course studios are going to continue the series. But after 25 years and 5 movies, we've yet to come close to the greatness of the original.

It's not a bad film, competently made with excellent effects. The actors are all OK, if all of them playing characters that you're familiar with them playing before, maybe the chemistry between Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas-Howard is a little less sparky this time but it's all drowned under a sea of ideas and scenes that you've literally seen this series do before.

69,Vartiainen,It's... fine,6,4 July 2018,"The first Jurassic World was okay in my books. It was nice to see the park finally open, the two main leads (Pratt and Howard) were enjoyable and while the special effects could never compete with the groundbreaking grandeur of the original Jurassic Park, they weren't that bad. Sure, the plot had at that point been recycled so many times that it was as brown as brown can be, but it was serviceable and at least the movie had the sense to spice it up towards the end.This sequel is more of the same. Add another layer of brown and a one big hurrah for recycling. And that's this film's biggest flaw. Because to be completely honest, many of the minor flaws of the previous film are in fact improved upon. The special effects are more convincing, the locations are more interesting, the two leads are still very good and even the mandatory Jurassic Park kid who needs to be rescued (TM) is miles better than the two brats Howard's character had to look after previously.But the plot is the worst. It is the exact same plot that we have already seen in the previous four movies. There are dinosaurs, there are evil, greedy people who want to use those dinosaurs, the dinosaurs have to be saved, while at the same time the dinosaurs themselves pose a threat to everyone around them. The same ""nature good, military and money bad"" paper thin ethos we have already chewed through so many times before. In fact, this is chewing the cud. We are cattle, regurgitating and eating the same stuff over and over again.But what else did you expect? For what it is, it's not bad.

Claire played by Bryce Dallas Howard teams up with Owen played by Chris Pratt and the two must try and save a dinosaur from (what I believer) are poachers called Blue. Can Owen and Claire save Jurassic world? Overall I found this better than Avengers Infinity War mainly because it was easy to follow. The real star though in Jurassic World is the special effects on the dinosaurs. Both Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were likeable as they team up with a young child who's grandfather used to be involved with Jurassic Park as he has a museum about dinosaurs.

As the movie opens, we are on ""Isla Nublar, 120 mi. off the coast of Costa Rica"", where the previous movie was set, and site once again of all kinds of problems. We learn that a volcano threatens the entire island, including its dinosaurs. Should they be saved? Dr. Malcolm testifies before the US Congress about it. Meanwhile, we learn that Claire is now president of the Dinosaur Protection Group, and determined to save the dinosaurs no matter what... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: the movie is directed by Spanish director J.A. Bayona, who 5-6 years ago brought us the terrific Tsunami disaster movie ""The Impossible"", Here he goes even bigger, working from a script by Colin Trevorrow (who directed ""Jurassic World"") and Derek Connolly. When ""Fallen Kingdom"" works, it is sheer fun. This is particularly the case in the first 45 min. of the movie (dealing with the active volcano). After that, not so much. You can just sense the filmmakers working way too hard to try and come up with a story line, ANY story line, for the last 75 min. of the movie. But what they came up simply does not work all that well. Not to mention that the movie is simply too long: cut about 20 min. of non-essential stuff, and we'd have a better film for sure. Bruce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt are fine, but frankly we go see this not to see them, but to see the dinosaurs. Apart from the overall weak narrative, the dinosaur action scenes are terrific from a technical perspective, with ever-more life-like details.""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" opened wide this weekend and over-performed at the box office. The early Sunday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was sold out to the very last seat. The viewing public's appetite for dinosaur action is seemingly insatiable... Already the next sequel is being planned and in the works.It will be released in June, 2021, yes like clockwork, every three years. If you are a fan of the ""Jurassic"" franchise, you definitely will want to check this out, warts and all, and hopefully in the theater, as a movie like this begs to be seen on the big screen. If you are new to the ""Jurassic"" franchise, this should be your last point of entry in the franchise..",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
72,subxerogravity,I think the kingdom fell off a little from the last flick,7,11 July 2018,"Like with The Lost World: Jurassic Park, Fallen Kingdom takes the dinosaurs out the park, although happening much faster here with actually very little of the movie taking place in the destroyed theme park, which is a key element to making this movie far different from Jurassic World.Fallen Kingdom is not as exciting as Jurassic world, in fact it was one of those dark sequels. Not super dark, but it's definitely not the fun thrill ride the first Jurassic World was sporting. There was too many real life human issues going on. The whole movie is basically about was man kind right to bring the dinosaurs back and sometimes man kind's attempts to advance itself have lead to disasters because All we know how to do is exploit stuff. A marriage of messages that was in all the other films in the franchise, but did not feel so knife in the gut as this one.Though I loved Jeff Goldblum's cameo as Dr. Malcolm, cause it was cool seeing him there, I admit it was preachy, and set that grim tone.I feel like Chris Pratt did not get to shine the way he's good at. Did not use his humorous personality as mush in this film, same with Bryce Dallas Howard. They still have what they have in the first film, but unusual for a sequel it seems more tone down than boosted up.Overall, as cliche as it is to say Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is not as good as Jurassic WorldIt looks like the franchise is going the way of the rebooted Planet of the Apes franchise, in that case I am looking forward to seeing the next movie.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
73,jtindahouse,Better than the first but has very similar problems,6,19 August 2018,"Upon finishing 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' I went back and read my review of 'Jurassic World' to see how I had felt about that one. What I found was that I could've pretty much copy and pasted my review for that film onto this one. My biggest gripe with these films is how predictable they feel. I guarantee that if you had paused the movie once every character had been introduced I could've given you an exact list of which characters would live and which would die. Hell, I could've even told you which characters would have the most brutal deaths. That to me isn't good enough. I'm aware that these films are probably meant to be more about the visuals and the action than the plot twists and turns and unexpected events, but it still feels like if they want to be something great they could chuck something into the mix. They just play it far too safe for my liking. There are some great action sequences in the film, the visuals are again amazing and I think the humour worked a lot better in this film than the original. All of these aspects make this a more enjoyable experience than the first one in my opinion. I do have a soft spot for the dinosaurs coming back to civilisation too I have to say. At the end of the day though I can guarantee I will have almost entirely forgotten about this film by this time tomorrow, and until they change things up and decide to be a little more daring, I fear every film in this series is going to be just like that.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
74,DarkVulcan29,The dinosaurs are the only thing good thing here.,6,6 July 2018,"I loved Jurassic World(2015) that brought back the Jurassic Park series, but every good series has it's fallbacks and Fallen Kingdom is it. 
The effects with the dinosaurs make this only enjoyable, they seem to have more characters too them then the humans. Chris Pratt does okay with he is giving, but Bryce Dallas Howard is a blank slate, and she usually gives better performances then this, she was better in the first one. There is a sub plot with a young girl that goes nowhere. Other characters who try to funny, but fail cause they come across like they try to hard. Not even Jeff Goldblum reprising his role in a small cameo can do much here.
See it only for the dinosaurs.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
75,Stevieboy666,A Sci Fi Channel type movie but with a much bigger budget,5,14 August 2020,"Can't say that I really enjoyed the previous movie in this reboot of the Jurassic franchise, not a patch on the the first three, however this one did start quite promising. A small submarine, then a helicopter are attacked by a huge dinosaur, this I imagine would be potentially quite scary for some viewers, it was well done. The CGI are good but sadly the plot and script let the rest of the film down, I found it somewhat silly and a little boring. It reminded me of some of the bad movies made by the Sci Fi Channel, only this has better actors and a far bigger budget. Admittedly I watched this on a 32"" TV rather than on a big cinema screen so much of the effect would have been lost or weakened but I find it incredible that such an average film became the 12th highest grossing movie of all time (at the time).
Decent enough family entertainment, possibly too scary for very young kids.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
76,stevendbeard,Summer Popcorn Movie,8,23 June 2018,"I saw ""Jurassic World:Fallen Kingdom"", starring Chris Pratt-the Guardians of the Galaxy movies, The Magnificent Seven_2016; Bryce Dallas Howard-Pete's Dragon, Spider_Man 3; Rafe Spall-The BFG, Hot Fuzz and Isabella Sermon-this is her first movie.
This is a summer popcorn movie-lots of action, more dinosaurs and never boring. This one takes place about 3 years after the 2015 Jurassic World movie. The park is closed down-more like abandoned-and the dinosaurs are just roaming the island care free when disaster strikes in the form of an active volcano. It seems that the dinosaurs are heading for extinction-again-unless Bryce, who heads an organization that wants to preserve the creatures, can do something about it. Rafe plays a guy that calls her an says he has a plan to relocate the doomed dinos to a safe island, with no tourists in sight. They put together a team headed by Chris-the dinosaur wrangler-to save as many animals as possible. The problem is that Rafe has not been totally honest about his intentions for the dinosaurs and the plot thickens. Isabella plays the granddaughter of one of the original men that started all of these genetic shenanigans. There is a new and improved dinosaur making his debut here, too. He is a genetic mixture of several breeds of dinos and he is called an Indoraptor. Jeff Goldblum makes a cameo appearance at the beginning and end of the movie-not much screen time but it is important and there is a scene after the end credits that might make you salivate for the next installment-yep, you can bet there will be another one. 
It's rated ""PG-13"" for intense sequences of sci-fi violence & peril and has a running time of 2 hours & 8 minutes.
I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
77,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,7,20 July 2019,"7/10 - doesn't reach the heights of its predecessor, but still makes for an entertaining movie-going experience",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
78,robfollower,It did its job an I was entertained .,7,3 March 2019,Fans of this series might find something to like here (I did) . The 3-D conversion was great . It did its job an I was entertained.,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
79,alindsay-al,A Poor addition to this franchise,3,6 June 2020,"After watching the previous films in this franchise I have come to watch the newest Jurassic Film - Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees the island being destroyed by a volcano which causes Claire and Owen to return and try and save the dinosaurs.
Main Character
Chris Pratt is back as Owen Grady for this film and he is fine here, he mostly has the charm and charisma that he usually has and it makes him likeable enough. It's just hos character has no development over this film after the last film, his motivations at first are pretty poor and you wonder why he really goes on the journey.
Supporting Characters
Bryce Dallas Howard is back as Claire and the one thing I can say is that her character actually had some development here, she is a more loving person for the dinosaurs then the previous film. But she does spend plenty of this film just screaming and I just don't feel her and Pratt have any real on screen chemistry and that continued in this film. Rafe Spall plays a really generic character here and you really won't care at all, you know what his motivations are and you know where is character is going. Also if you are watching this film because you saw the trailer and saw Jeff Goldblum back as Dr Ian Malcolm then don't because he is literally in two scenes that are both in the trailer which was hugely disappointing.
Story
The story is where the film really falls down, the characters motivations for going to save the dinosaurs is really mixed and you find it hard to believe. All the characters who seem like villains are and they all have really poor motivations and basic performances. There is also this story involving this young girl that feels really tacked on and there is a twist involving it that is absurd and even worst it literally plays no part in the story at all. The ending sets up an interesting idea for future films but it also feels silly and over the top and after watching the plot you have checked out by then.
Script
The script is really poor too, the romance between the two main characters is really poorly written and it feels like we wasted our time dealing with it in the previous film. Plus characters are written to do really stupid things and the humour doesn't work especially with a couple of characters that are literally in there to try and be funny but they just fail.
Style
The style of the film is where the film kind of improves, the dinosaurs look great here and there are some fun action sequences. Plus this film maybe does the best job in the franchise at building tension and focusing on the more horror elements which is a nice thing to see. But also this film is pretty slow and its pacing holds it back, the slower parts of the films aren't interesting and it holds the film back.
Overall
Overall, I was really disappointed by this film, it is much slower then its predecesor and the film isn't as exciting. It is a poor film and not worth a watch even if you are a big fan of this franchise.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
80,Fluke_Skywalker,Fun is extinct,5,24 September 2018,"Plot; When the surviving dinosaurs of the now defunct Jurassic World park are threatened by a volcanic eruption, the question for mankind becomes; Save them or let them go extinct?Jurassic World was, in many ways, a re-do of the original Jurassic Park, capably (more or less) hitting many of the same beats and delivering a reasonably entertaining 2 hr. popcorn diversion. What it couldn't recapture, however, was the sense of wonder of that first Jurassic film. But I suppose that's to be expected. Not only is Colin Treverrow no Steven Spielberg, that sense of wonder kinda went out the window for good once the dinos started rampaging in the first one. If Jurassic World is basically a re-do of the original JP, then Fallen Kingdom is, in many ways, the same to The Lost World. There are a lot of similarities there, not the least of which is that it's not as good as its predecessor. Fallen Kingdom is a murky, muddled and joyless mess. At times it threatens to kick into gear, but director J.A. Bayona and the witless script he's saddled with quickly stall it out. Newly introduced characters fail to make any impression and I've seen more compelling villains on episodes of Scooby Doo. Even the dino f/x, which have been the highlight of even the series' worst entries, don't impress much.The ending sets up a sequel w/some potential, but w/Treverrow set to return as writer and director, my hopes for it are extinct.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
81,sauravjoshi85,An action packed entertainment,7,28 April 2021,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is an Sci-fi action adventure movie directed by J. A. Bayona and stars Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rafe Spall, Justice Smith, Daniella Pineda, James Cromwell, Toby Jones and Isabella Sermon.The plot of the movie might be repetitive and nothing fresh is been offered in terms of story but still with good execution and strong CGI makes the movie quite watchable and entertaining.This time a volcano has got active on Isla Nublar a group of people are chosen to save the dinosaurs from extinction.Acting is great and Chris Pratt again shines in his role of Owen Grady the velociraptor handler and you will start liking him more and more. Bryce Dallas and Rafe Spall were equally impressive, Justice Smith and Daniella irritates in some scenes.Screenplay is predictable but still entertains, the director has been successful in getting sympathy for dinosaurs irrespective of their type and how brutal they can be because they have been created due to the greed of human.The CGI of the movie is certainly praiseworthy. The climax of the movie is predictable but still gives a satisfying feeling with giving a glimpse of now confirmed sequel in making. The movie is brutal in some parts but still this is a typically family movie which can be enjoyed with everyone. Typical Jurassic park lovers will love this movie for normal viewers this movie will not disappoint you if not been able to fully entertain you.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
82,kirbylee70-599-526179,BIG MISTAKE,8,15 September 2018,"You would think by now that crazed scientists meddling with Mother Nature would realize that thing are more than likely not going to turn out as they planned. In the very first film character Ian Malcolm warned them that they were messing with things best left untouched. But no one seems to listen.As a matter of fact in JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM the film opens with Malcolm (again played by Jeff Goldblum) offering that same warning once more. At the end of the last film, JURASSIC WORLD, the concept of a theme park filled with dinosaurs once again crumbled with the dinosaurs attacking and people dying. Isla Nubar, the island where it took place, was left to the dinosaurs and those that survived left. Here we are a few years later with a volcano about to erupt on the island and activists are trying to save the dinosaurs.Leading that cause is Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) who worked on the island and survived. Not wanting these creatures to return to extinction she pleads her case to anyone who will listen. That would include Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell), a billionaire and ex-friend of the park's original creator John Hammond. With the help of his right hand man Eli Mills (Rafe Spall) he plans on rescuing the dinosaurs at his expense. He does so to honor his friend and to please his granddaughter Maisie (Isabella Sermon). They need Claire for two reasons. The first is her handprint for security reasons. The second is to recruit Owen Grady (Chris Pratt). It seems Blue, the velociraptor, has evaded them and they know he is the only one who can bring her in. He argues, relents and the next thing you know the two of them along with two other members of Claire's group are on a plane headed for Isla Nubar. When they arrive things aren't quite what they expected. The team in place is not just scientists but mercenaries led by Ken Wheatley (Ted Levine). Trying to work together his men bypass Owen's demand to back off when he finds Blue and they tranquilize the dinosaur and Owen as well, leaving him behind for the lava coming down the mountain. Claire and one of her group are left behind as well, only the doctor among them kept on hand to insure Blue survives. It's a double cross and the saving of the dinosaurs is not the intent of this group. Their safety is important for one reason only, their survival until they can make it back to the mainland at Lockwood's mansion. Crosses and double crosses follow and soon the real reason for their rescue is learned. Fortunately Owen, Claire and her friends have survived, made it onboard with the dinosaurs and may be able to save them from the plans in store for them.Like the films in the series before this one the main eye candy here is the dinosaurs. The ability of CGI has boomed since the first film released in 1993. Not only are the dinosaurs that amazed all of us when first seen on board, like the brontosaurus, the geneticists have once more created a new dinosaur that is more dangerous than the last one they created. Ever notice they only create killing dinosaurs and never a cute little dinosaur? The effects with the dinosaurs aren't the only ones to witness either. The destruction of Isla Nubar via volcano, the dinosaurs that were left behind and the effects of the flowing lava also create some stunning and disturbing visuals.Perhaps the only thing skimped on in this film is the lack of character development. Certainly after the last film we know the two leads but what about the rest? They're given short shrift here and we get to know them in bits and pieces which are few and far between. Even Goldblum in his return to the franchise is only on hand for a brief moment at the beginning and in voice over towards the end. Lockwood is glossed over as well and clues about his granddaughter are nowhere to be seen. But this is a summer blockbuster type film and the important things are the dinosaurs, explosions and action sequences. Trust me when I say this film has plenty of those. They more than compensate for the lack of character development. The freshness of the movie is beginning to wear thin but it still provides a solid piece of entertainment that many will enjoy. Will I watch it a second or third time? Yeah, I think I will. Maybe a marathon weekend. A theme party. The movie is a lot of fun and will fuel the imaginations and nightmares of children who watch and give parents a good bit of action. I highly recommend this one for watching this week and down the road as well.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Listen its about entertaining it's not about scripts, boring ass character development, these films are about the DINOSAURS YOU IDIOTS!! Blue and Rexy(trex) are the REAL stars so they dont have dialogue you pompous stuck up pricks!!, if you give this anything under a solid 8 you dont understand movies or life in general. This was a motion ride of brilliance and the 3d just adds to the absolute brilliance of this gem the animatronics are so real I've grown to be attached to them especially BLUE!! And if you dont tear up in that scene where they leave the brontosaurus on the island you're a grinch!!

84,davispittman,"I had fun, but there were mistakes",7,1 July 2018,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom has both positives and negatives. I purposefully stayed away from the trailers for fear that they might would give some stuff away, glad I did cus they really did give away too much. I thought this film would be completely on Isla Nubar, I thought it was going to be all on the island, I was kinda surprised by the second act. I wasn't necessarily disappointed that the second half took place in Lockwood's estate just surprised. Ok so I and a lot of other people are irritated by some characters in this movie. I'll tell you the character I really hated in this movie..... MAISIE!!!! Omfg.... I hated this character so much, she is mind numbingly stupid. I can't even have any sympathy for her. Normally I would sympathize with a character like her but her last minute decision at the very end is so stupid and will have cataclysmic consequences for so many people. Anything that happens in the 3rd movie will basically all be her fault because if wouldn't have done what she did.... There would be no dinosaurs loose. The third movie better not try to make the audience feel sympathy for this character..... Cus I have NONE. Ok I'm off my soapbox... That was my major negative, the other is the villain. The main villain is kinda boring and just bland, would've appreciated a little more creativity there. Some positives would for sure be the opening sequence, that was a very cool and well done opening. Also, Howard and Pratt's characters... loved them and I like that Claire came to her senses at the end.... before Maisie did the dumbest thing ever done in cinema history. The action sequences are well done, the island scenes are cool, I liked the character of Franklin, and the other vet girl that I can't remember the name of rn. Those are some positives. All in all, it's so frustrating because I had fun and did enjoy the film, but there were some pretty disappointing negative aspects too. I do recommend it but just know it's got some frustrating things. 7/10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
85,Pairic,A good fun adventure film. 7/10.,7,14 June 2018,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom: My favourite Raptor, Blue is back! So is Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) and now leads an NGO dedicated to saving the Dinosaurs because a Volcano is starting to erupt but Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell) and his trusty CEO Eli ills (Rafe Spall) spring to the rescue. Lockwood will provide a new island home for the Saurs, away from tourists. Dearing inveigles Owen Brady (Chris Pratt) into joining the expedition to round up the beasts. But dark forces are also at work and have other intentions and destinations planned for the rescued Dinosaurs.The screenplay won't win an Oscar but the acting is generally OK, especially the joshing between Pratt and Howard which is nicely offset by the tensions between Howards sidekicks Zia (Daniella Pineda) and Franklin (Justice Smith). Ted Levine is also convincing as Wheatley the mercenary leader who has a predilection for collection Dinosaur teeth. At times his behaviour is reminiscent of Slim Pickens in Blazing Saddles. Toby Jones has a small part as an auctioneer who tries to sell off the animals to elite customers.Some good fight scenes between Dinosaurs but Blue battling a new Indoraptor stands out. J.A. Bayona does try to put his own stamp on JWFK but is perhaps hampered somewhat by the demands of the franchise. Still this film is darker than the previous JW as the idea of weaponising Dinosaurs is introduced. Also scenes such as the talons of the Indoraptor crawling along a bed towards Lockwood's granddaughter (Isabella Sermo) brings to mind Bayona's A Monster Calls. A good fun adventure film. 7/10.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Blame that on a writer guild so poor on talent for so many years, and movie makers so poor on talent for so many years, that now the clueless are giving the instructions and deciding which scripts to use. The words spoken sound like someone just randomly picked words out of a dictionary, not big words, just words and phrases no one uses naturally.Then there's the sound. It goes from whispers of characters to the loudest bangs, up and down, and you'll spend the entire movie turning the volume up and down if you can.Then, there's the muddled directing and editing.

It extends the story but pardon the pun, ""there's not a lot of meat left on the bone"".The films shortcomings show through glaringly, in the predictable, emaciated story and hackneyed narrative, that pulls together a lot of ideas we have seen in previous films from the franchise. It does progress the overall tale but the telling feels repetitive. What does work, as always is the dino CGI and yes the action sequences are exciting but hey, its dinosaurs, right? I will add the acting is solid too but the actors are constrained by the limited narrative, which is overshadowed by lots of exposition.Perhaps this is to be expected but that said, there is no harm in having clever, thoughtful narrative, to help flesh out the story.

94,jadepietro,Dinos Soar,8,18 July 2018,"GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Dinos versus the human race. Guess who wins!JIM'S REVIEW: It's them vs. us again! Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom has more dinosaurs to meet, more destinations to visit, more scary moments of dino-chomping, more self-depreciating humor from our anti-hero and all-around good guy Owen (Chris Pratt, still charming as ever), surprisingly more sensible foot ware for his love interest, Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), and more-of-the-same escapist entertainment any moviegoer can expect from this series. This chapter follows its successful formula and then verges off into new territory under the more than capable direction of J. A. Bayona.Yes, it's the hunter getting captured by the game as the many breeds of dinosaurs are nearing extinction on their island. Volcanic activity threatens to put an end to them in an ironic close encounter of their kind. Both Owen and Claire want to help them and evil forces want to use them. Greed, big business, and hefty dollar signs are involved in this messy food chain. The dinosaurs (and their human prey) never saw it comin', although any moviegoer beyond the age of 7 surely has.The problem with all this danger and peril is that the creatures whose brain is small and disproportionate to their bodies seem to be better equipped at survival than their human counterparts. It's always dinnertime and we foolish mammals have no real smarts! Logic always loses itself to the simplistic plot. If one can accept that factor, moviegoers will enjoy the set-up and thrills to a higher degree. Otherwise, it's idea-fatigue that is on display.All in all, the CGI dinosaurs are first-rate and their realistic details of sharp talons, scaly textures, and drooling teeth are state-of-the-art impressive. These monsters bring the chills and scares. Some set pieces ratchet up the tension quite nicely (I loved the monster in the bedroom motif.) and the film's violence is refreshingly not gory in the least.The screenplay by Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow takes awhile to stage the two-pronged story of island danger and creatures running rapid in an old Victorian mansion. Fortunately, they never take their subject matter too seriously and add some humor to the narrative. (At times, I was as giddy as that inner 60's teenager enjoying at a Saturday matinee serial, thoroughly entertained and laughing out loud at the chases and far-fetched dangers. ) The villains are of the cardboard variety and one watches for their dastardly comeuppance, which you know will occur and one savors those moments. After all, the film is straight formula with a little flourish and a lot of strong production values. But it is the director who truly saves the day. He paces his horror film with an onslaught of memorable images that make this one of the better installments in the franchise. His use of lighting and shadows reigns supreme and he keeps the action moving and the tension high. Mr. Bayona brings on the gravitas with a light touch of tongue-in-cheek humor. It's a wonderful balancing act from a skilled director.Back again are Mr. Pratt and Ms. Howard, very likable actors who add some nuance to their stock parts. Daniella Pineda and Justice Smith are the younger mismatched couple and Isabella Sermon is that child actor in jeopardy. They play their roles well. In close pursuit as possible human hors d'oeuvres are Toby Stephens, James Cromwell, Geraldine Chaplin, Ted Levine, and Rafe Spall. Even Jeff Goldblum makes a welcomed visit to bookend and warn us of all the genetic tampering that will be the death to us all.Jurassic World: Hidden Kingdom is mindless big budget fun. As escapist fare goes, chomp away!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

In the 90's Jurassic Park reigned supreme in this genre, and brought Crichton's novel to life in ways we could not imagine. Nearly three decades later, the technology continues to push the dinosaurs animation to new heights and potentially make the carnage all the sweeter. Robbie K here, bringing another review on the last silver screen smash to grace the theaters this week. Let's get started as I review: Movie: Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018)Director:
 J.A. Bayona
Writers:
 Derek Connolly, Colin TrevorrowStars:
 Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rafe Spall 
LIKES:Animation: Let's face it, the 90's brought an incredible baseline of work, and the advancements in animation make these extinct creatures shine like no other. Computer animation brings fluid movements of running, mangling, and hunting, while the robotics creates the realistic sheen that hooks you in. A nice balance between the two styles really crafts the piece together. The Acting: Pratt is still great, a blend of sarcasm meeting heroic cowboy that sharpens him into a great lead to keep the series alive. Howard dropped most of the edgy, monotonous tone (and the heels) and with it brings that more dynamic, caring approach to life to round out the roguish nature of Pratt. As for the rest of the crew, they play their parts well, though I can't say they were the best approaches direction of the characters I anticipated, primarily Toby Jones who somehow played a stiff, one dimensional character with little bite. The Pace: Like the stampeding herd in the trailer, the movie moves at a good pace, always moving and at times trying to keep the action/suspense nature alive. It shifts easily from one dynamic to another, attempting to keep the drama down and the chaos high. More Dinosaurs: The movie manages to expand their collection of thunder lizards to terrorize and amaze. Both carnivores and herbivores will stomp into the group with majestic prowess, or perhaps stalk in with nightmarish grins as they attempt to obtain their next meal. Regardless, the repertoire is impressive and many get their shining moment to actually warrant their inclusion. The Originality of New Direction: We've understood the cliché of Jurassic Park movies and how a band gets put on an island, forced to pit their instincts against the prehistoric predators. Jurassic World 2 decides to deviate from it and take a more moral dilemma approach. The movie honestly has a lot more discussion of ethics vs business, mercy vs. survival, and selective vs. global compassion. Much of the movie is geared towards these tug at your heart issues and trying to pick a side of the two extremes. While political, the movie will certainly stir up emotions you might not expect in this series. The Character Development: Surprisingly, Jurassic World 2 manages to beef up the character development of some of its leading groups. Chris Pratt's Owen really gets under the microscope to examine the connections to Blue, bringing with it a deeper connection to one who was so shallow in the previous installment. As for Claire... she too gets a little more depth, but surprisingly took the back seat in this movie compared to Pratt, I guess her family was the driving point for evolving, and without them she lacks the motivation. As for the rest of the crew, there are some decent looks into their lives, but haven't quite gotten to the multiple layers you might want in a leading role. The Nostalgia: Got to love when your childhood memories and references come back into the screen, and this installment is happy to bring back a few of these moments to have you smiling. They haven't quite mastered showing some of the bigger, iconic references, but they got enough for a good start. 
DISLIKES: The New Characters: I don't know whose direction or decisions it was, but the new characters are a little too modernized for my taste. Very emotional, angsty characters, the younger cast is a bit too extreme for me and felt like a forced comedic ploy that failed to pick up steam. The villains themselves lacked much dimension as well, falling into stereotypical, boastful blowhards who have little beyond bragging rights. Why such extremes? I don't know, but they failed to impress me given some of the other baddies to infiltrate the parks. The Twist: There are a number of these in this film, but one in particular about a character will bring with it a new level of soap opera dynamics. By doing this they help establish some more motifs to all the madness at hand, but it really didn't stand and hold place in a movie about creating and unleashing the torrent of dinosaurs. Sorry guys uniqueness gets an A+, but in the grand schemes not needed. Predictable/Pushed carnage: Since Lost World, the series has been more about the kills as the main source of thrills. Jurassic World and World 2 were still on that gimmick, not so much setting it up to go with the suspense and storytelling element. The movie sets up obvious ploys for killing and often relying on stupidity and foreshadowing to set up their kills with little regards to necessity. I miss the suspense of that first movie and grow tired of the focus of how to make it gore fest, no matter how justified they are. The Inhumane Moments: The director wanted to elicit emotional responses and he managed to succeed very well. However, in this installment, those moments are sometimes a little too inhumane for my taste and a little unnecessary at times. Fallen Kingdom is going to continue passing the baton of who the real monsters are, but for me this director has a little more sadistic side to the cinematography and plot elements he wants to show. Being an animal lover, no matter how savage they are, it was hard to see some of these moments come to fruition and enjoy the film. If you're like me, steel yourself, because there are going to be some over the top moments to punch you hard and leave you feeling depressed. Didn't Fell Jurassic: The movie held so much potential for another island adventure that showed danger, mystery, and more of that great survival of the fittest we thrive on in the series. However, this part was rushed, simplified, and very lacking until the big run from the volcano scene. The movie missed all that suspenseful, thrilling moments for the ethical debates, and the though the second act turned out stronger than I expected, it still didn't hold the elements (or the bite) of the movie I longed for. The VERDICT:  In truth, Jurassic World 2 is a decent sequel that tries out some new things to try and evolve the dinosaurs' reign on the silver screen. Given the new morale dilemmas, the character development and increase in gimmicks like more dinosaurs and better animation, the movie is obviously worth the trip to the theater. However, the movie still does not quite have the feel of the movies proceeding it, lacking the thrilling adventure of defying debt, for more soap opera and convoluted antics. In addition, the twist and heartbreaking moments may deter you from enjoying the movie at full potential. As for it being appropriate for kids... it depends on their ability to handle the cruel treatment of animals, adult themes, and darker moments (Endoraptor is nightmare inducing) that are often loud. So targeted age is probably 12 and up. My scores are: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 7.0

97,Movie-ManDan,Ignore The Haters. Just Read This Review.,7,24 June 2018,"The second instalment of the 'Jurassic' continuation saga is one of the most dividing films of the year. Some find the dopiness overshadowing the good while others are too impressed with the visuals to knock it. Well I am here to say all the people that bash this are simply wrong. Trashing a movie with such great qualities like great visuals and exciting danger just makes you sound more like an idiot than a film expert. Those that gave it a warm or normal thumbs down for this are more trustworthy.Back in the fun are Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt. We have grown to love them since the first, so we really don't want anything to happen to them. Rich evil scientists try to take the dinosaurs off the island (which is in really bad shape) and make money off of them, but Howard and Pratt want them to live in peace. Right away, this is a pretty dumb storyline. All the other instalments deal with the fact that humans and dinosaurs cannot coexist. Dinosaurs can cause so much destruction and can easily extinct humans. Pratt and Howard don't want any of them to die? Give me a break. The scientists wanting to make money off of them is downright silly and the most annoying element. And that is mostly who we deal with aside from the two heroes. So yes, there are flaws that prevent this movie from being great.But there are true redemptive elements that are a ton of fun. Like all the others, the dinosaurs look real. That alone is a plus. Here, they run rampant and cause way more mayhem than usual. The look and style of some of the dinosaurs have been made to look more badass and simply more awesome. Anybody that does not like to see realistic dinosaurs in action, I ask this question: ""Are we at that point in society where seeing a dinosaur is as trivial as seeing a dog?""A spark of originality in these dinosaurs is that they are basically anti-heroes. There is a total of three characters in the entire movie that we like (Howard, Pratt, and James Cromwell's granddaughter) other than that, we would rather see these prehistoric creatures open up a can of whop-ass on the cast. When they do, it is awesome. Annoying characters we want gone are destroyed by amazing creatures. Is that not great? Is that not what you wanted? As long as they leave the three alone, seeing them cause carnage to dopes we don't like is a real treat. And all of which is done in very impressive feats. NOBODY can deny how amazing these prehistoric creatures looked and how awesomely directed the entire thing was. The mayhem on the rise caused further excitement and even admiration for the crew in just how impressive this sheer creation was.So is 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' great? No. There are simply too many heavy flaws that prevent this from reaching an overall high quality. However, I ask you to please not overlook the strengths this movie has. Many of them cleanly overpower the weaknesses.3/4",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
98,rannynm,Genuinely entertaining! Great performances and outstanding visuals.,8,21 June 2018,"I've never really been a huge fan of the Jurassic Park franchise. I felt it went on for way too long and it needed to end. But, I was surprised by how much I liked this movie. It is genuinely entertaining and, I think it's a good way to conclude the franchise, even though I know it probably won't be the end. The story takes place three years after the events of Jurassic World. When the island the dinosaurs inhabit is about to be destroyed by a volcano, Claire and Owen go to rescue the remaining dinosaurs. So first I want to talk about visuals. It's not really a surprise that the visuals are really good. The dinosaurs look great. Combine that with great sound and the fact that, you can essentially feel the scale and weight of the dinosaurs. It feels as if they are actually there. Along with some really cool shots of the island and the Lockwood Mansion, the presentation of this movie is fantastic. The shot that was used in the trailers of Owen running from the volcano with the dinosaurs and being encompassed by ash, looked really compelling to me. It is one of my favorite shots in the movie and the presentation helps a lot. But, there is one particular scene that they hold on a brontosaurus that really tugs at your heartstrings. It probably wouldn't have been as good if it wasn't for the way the shot was directed. (J. A. Bayona) The actors in this movie are also really good. Chris Pratt as Owen stands out to me, but that's mostly because I really like Chris Pratt. But, Chris Pratt is still very good. He has great comedic timing and he is really funny in general. However, he's the second best actor. Hands down, the best actor in the whole movie is Isabella Sermon as Maisie, the granddaughter of Benjamin Lockwood. This girl is absolutely amazing in this film. Talented child actors are hard to come by and wow, this girl is really fantastic. Her scenes are very compelling and she clearly is very invested in her role. I really felt for her, especially during the emotionally terrifying scenes. This is Isabella Sermon's first role and she is great. I genuinely look forward to what she has next in store. She has a bright future ahead.Now, I mentioned earlier that I felt this movie would be a good conclusion to the franchise. The Jurassic Park franchise has been around since the 90s and the series is still going. I feel like it's been going for too long and I hope it doesn't continue for much longer. I know the series is very popular, but a lot of franchises have worsened from going on for a long time just because of their popularity.I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18.

99,Kamurai25,...Where'd the park go?,7,10 June 2020,"Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.Look its not ""Jurassic Park"", its not even ""Jurassic World"". Its hard to have a dinosaur park movie without a park.Yet they still managed to make this pretty exciting, allow corporate greed to again be the catalyst, and allowed a question that is FAR too deep for this movie, which I can't reveal without a spoiler.Even the real action of the movie is behind the spoiler curtain, and yes that concept is ridiculous, but it was equally ridiculous to ""train"" raptors for combat or create the I-Rex in the first place.I'm just happy they're continuing the trilogy at least as well as they are, and like Jurassic Park 2, this will be setting up a 3rd movie that franchise fans will love.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
100,justin-fencsak,The weakest of all the Jurassic films...,4,23 September 2018,"25 years ago, Jurassic Park changed the way blockbusters were made in the 1990s and made an impact on computer animation. Flash forward to now, and it's everywhere. With Fallen Kingdom, they have come too far. The first half is good, but the second half is not. I think the third Jurassic World will fail miserably.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
101,Easygoer10,WOEFUL,2,25 April 2019,"Before I trash this, I want to give a shoutout to Geraldine Chaplin; daughter of Hollywood legend Charlie Chaplin. She has seen more in her lifetime than anyone in this film, bar none. That noted, this is as bad as it gets. You couldn't pay me to watch these sequels with Chris Pratt. Now we have James Cromwell, for me, a very talented actor and smart man (met him in the doctor's office once). Unfortunately, he typically plays the US President, or some other more or less streotypical roles. Same here, except I can't believe how terrible his faux British accent is (actually supposed to be Scottish). Anyway, there are no surprises, everything is predictable, etc. Only ""Boo! in the dark"" type of jump-scares. How many is this now? The original was in 1993. This is #5, I believe. It's the same thing with all the comic book based pablum fed too the masses today. I hate it. The worst of the worst is the Fast & Furious baby food. They had the nerve to continue a series after the key actor died in a car wreck in which he was a passenger (in a very fast car with a guy who couldn't drive a fast car). Out of respect they should have stopped. No way. It's all about money. There will be a F & F 10, 11 & 12 probably very soon. Same thing with Star Wars #9, or Halloween 18, ad infinitum. There are very few great directors left. I think the best director out there today is Denis Villeneuve, hands down. Ridley Scott has got to stop soon, unfortunately as he is 81 years old. He really bombed with Alien: Covenant, too. I am a huge fan of him and the original film ""Alien"" (1979)"", which I saw opening day at the theater. I went 3 days in a row, dragging all my friends with me to see each one. It is still 1 of the 2 most terrifying films I have ever seen; ""The Exorcist"" (1973) being the other. Ridley's ""Prometheus"" (2012) was great; & appropriately enough, Rafe Spall, (a good actor) who was about 15th down on the cast list in that film, is in this film as the primary antagonist. Please skip it. You'll thank me.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
102,Rob_Taylor,Jurassic World: Fallen Standards (of writing),5,1 August 2018,"Oh Boy! I had heard bad things about the level of stupid in this movie, but I admit, I did not think it could be as bad as people said.I was wrong.Fallen Kingdom is very nearly so bad it is a comedy, which I am sure is not what JA Bayona was going for. However, hampered by an awful script penned by (among others) Colin Trevorrow, I feel there was little he could do to make it seem less dumb than it is. No amount of ""thrilling"" music will disguise a dumb scene, or nonsense writing and dialogue. So let's begin with the dissection, shall we?From the start, the dumbness of the plot is apparent. The park from the previous movie, now an abandoned ruin, is assaulted by generic bad guys determined to get a sample of the DNA from the Indominus Rex that was eaten by the Mosasaur. They enter the pool containing the giant sea reptile in a submersible through a convenient sea door that...wait...what? A sea door? Seriously? A sixty foot,ocean going reptile has a single door separating it from freedom. No kind of lock system. A huge door, big enough to sail an aircraft carrier through.Never mind that in the previous movie, the creature's pool was shown in the centre of the island on a map. Inconveniences like that are ignored in favour of what was presumably thought to be a great visual.I won't even get started on how the creature is still alive after all this time with no food supply, but... hey. Visuals!We are then introduced to Howard's character and her new retinue of followers - cowardly nerd, and feisty (annoying) veterinarian. Not just a vet, of course, but a paleo-veterinarian... who has never seen a dinosaur. Gotta wonder if her qualification was from one of those online ""universities"" that are essentially ""insert money to graduate"" kind of deals. How do you become a dinosaur vet if you've never even seen a dinosaur!To cut a long story short, our heroes (now including Chris Pratt's character) travel to the island to save the dinos from extinction due to erupting volcano. A volcano that erupts and sends pyroclastic flows hurtling down the mountainside at a brisk walking pace for the dinos. A pyroclastic flow that mysteriously stops at the water's edge. An aquatic dinosaur is seen standing on the edge of a pier as the clouds engulf it, even though it merely needs to take a step forward to enter the water and have a chance to survive. You know, like a panicked animal would actually do in that instance. But no, it stands there and is overwhelmed because.... visuals!At one point, Howard and coward get ""trapped"" in a bunker by the bad guys and look doomed to cook as the volcano erupts. I say ""trapped"" because, despite being locked in and spending a stupid amount of time trying to unlock the doors, they escape by the simple means of a ladder to a roof hatch which they apparently did not notice before.There then follows a nonsense second half involving a dinosaur auction in the giant underground basement of John Hammond's rich (and hitherto never mentioned in four movies) partner in Jurassic Park. We're led to believe that this worthy individual was unaware of the dozens of bellowing dinosaurs in his basement, despite his room having a convenient dumb-waiter that leads right down to that level.Of course, there's a super-dino. There has to be a super dino every movie, because....visuals! This one, however, despite being considered the ultimate killing machine, routinely fails to kill anyone that has the basic instinct to run away. It can't even catch a small child. That's how ""ultimate killer"" it is.Oh...I forgot to mention the risible sub-plot involving the child who is revealed to be a clone. This entire sub-plot exists for the sole purpose of allowing the child to free the dinosaurs at the end and utter the terrible line ""They're alive, just like me.""I just... I can't even describe how awful this writing is. There are countless ""homages"" to the previous movies. Little scenes that are included to remind the audience that this is, in fact, a Jurassic Park movie and not the terrible knock-off version that it feels like.SUMMARY: A movie so aggressively stupid that it must have been written by the velociraptor of dumbness. It is so stupid, that I laughed at many inappropriate moments and gave myself a headache from all the scowling I was doing. Not recommended. No, no...stay away.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
103,eric262003,One That Depicts An epic Battle Between Dinosaurs and Corporate Hacks,7,12 July 2020,"It was 27 years ago that the first ""Jurassic Park"" film was released. Cut to twenty-five years later with the fifth installment of the series and the second part of the ""Jurassic World"" series. The sequel ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" was released and what makes this film stand out from all the other films of the series? For one thing, dinosaurs draw people into the theatres and secondly, it's also great for marketing purposes to sell, toys, mugs, t-shirts, wall posters and so much more.Even though it follows down a path in the traditional scheme of things like the other ""Jurassic Park"" movies, this time things are a little bit different in the world where dinosaurs are recreated and the messing around with science is coming back to haunt. In the quest where scientists are playing God, they created a new breed of dinosaur that functions like no other of its species. This reptilian manifestation has the ability to inflict carnage, has the capabilities to think cognitively and can even embody facial expressions.Like other films that continue from where we left off, the flock will scurry back to check in on our giant lizard friends, as they were relocated on another island only to discover that once again their lives are in danger and could be at the threat of becoming extinct again if they are not rescued. Only this time instead of a giant asteroid crashing down, a dormant volcano has awaken and is tearing through the giant lizards, covering up the island with hot molten lava.This is where Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) comes in who after three years after the events that took place from the previous ""Jurassic World"" movie, she has made the transition from running the place for the capital gain, to being a vigilante activist to protect these creatures and to relocate them before it's too late. Claire is joined by two scientific researchers for this search and rescue initiative. We have the determined and energetic Dr. Zia Rodriguez (Daniella Pineda) and computer techno brain Franklin Webb (Justice Smith) who'll help Claire in her mission.The only person who might be the key in saving the dinosaurs were the creators who specialized in cloning them to begin with. An aging, ill millionaire named Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell) who once worked with John Hammond, might know the way protect them. Claire tries to get ex-boyfriend Owen Grady, who specializes in training Velociraptors onto the island and rescue his fellow dinosaur pal Blue and the other dinosaurs off the island.Sadly, this search and rescue mission doesn't run that smoothly as corporate shills are after the dinosaurs, not for biological research, but for capital gain. They want to use these giant lizards and sell them to military bases so they could train them to be used as weapons. Granted it seems hard to choose who want to root for in the clash between good against evil as there are no clear heroes here. On the one hand we're made to take sides with the dinosaurs because their lives are on the line and because they're naive as to what we're up to just adds more reason to be sympathetic towards them. However still, they are still dangerous and carnal and can still attack and annihilate. As for the corporate villains, it's obvious we're programmed to hate them because they're corrupt, greedy, selfish capitalists. To contradict that analogy, they are still human beings, with families and they need to provide for them and put food in their kid's mouths. And though they may deserve their comeuppance in some sort of way, it's still hard to swallow (except for the dinosaurs) seeing another person getting their hands bitten off.Under the direction of J.A. Bayona who has directed a trifecta of great films like spooky horror film ""The Orphanage"", the visual eye-candy disaster film ""The Impossible"" and the impressionable family film ""A Monster Calls"" takes a bit of inspiration from these three films, along with many scenes inspired from Steven Spielberg's films (rear-view window scenes from ""E.T. The Extra Terrestrial"".To add dimension to the story, Bayona added some levels of emotion by having a scene where the rescue mission leaves the danger-zone island and a young Brachiosaurus left behind as it cries while the smoke and heat takes over the island killing all living things in its way. It's a sad scene, but it shows how not all rescue missions go all as planned.For the nostalgic pop, it was great that they brought back Jeff Goldblum to reprise his role as mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm. and his words of philosophy from ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park II"" (1997) to make it out as legitimate in this installment. To paraphrase his theory about messing with playing God by bringing back animals from extinction, ""if you make your own bed, you must sleep in it.""In other words just because resurrecting something back from the dead or creating life via test tubes and DNA may be a scientific milestone, doesn't make it a good idea. Just like when Victor Frankenstein made his creation, seemed like a good idea, but it soon backfired as it caused fear and destruction in its path.The biggest weakness to this movie is the lack of decisiveness in terms of its subplots and with the many rewrites and scripts that was possibly given to them, they just crammed bits of them in as a way so no one feels hurt or neglected. At times several scenes to tend to drag a bit at times. There were many scenes where characters would annoyingly stare as the giant lizards are running around loose destroying things in their new found freedom and we could do very little about it.While this may have more baggage than the average ""Transformers"" movie, this sequel to the ""Jurassic World"" series still falls in the trajectory of sequels don't measure up.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

109,moviexclusive,"A masterclass in tension, suspense and dread, this continuation of the 'Jurassic World' series takes the thrill ride out of the theme park and sets up a brave, new, exciting W",8,7 June 2018,"How many times can you resurrect a theme park filled with dinosaurs, especially given the number of human casualties each iteration has incurred? So wisely, this latest instalment of the 'Jurassic Park' franchise doesn't try to revive yet another park; instead, it decisively and definitely bids goodbye to its predecessor's prehistoric attraction by obliterating it with a jaw-droppingly intense and realistic volcanic eruption. Not to worry though, to paraphrase two of the film's taglines, ""life finds a way"" even though ""the park is gone"".Returning to pen the sequel's script with his former writing partner Derek Connolly, 'Jurassic World' director Colin Trevorrow boldly choreographs a sequence of events that will see the dinosaurs transported off their isolated little island paradise of Isla Nublar to the mainland, which also sets the stage for an all-out man versus dinosaur showdown in the next chapter to follow. That journey will see park manager-turned-animal activist Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) reunite with raptor expert Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), as the couple join an expedition to save the surviving dinosaurs that happens to be the former business partner Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell).of the original 'Jurassic Park's' misguided entrepreneur John Hammond. Not surprisingly, that expedition is but a façade for a more sinister business venture involving Lockwood's right-hand man Eli Mills (Rafe Spall) and geneticist Dr. Henry Wu (B.D. Wong), precipitating a series of things-gone-awry that will result in the animals being unleashed on civilisation at large. Although most of the action is pretty much contained in one of two locations, namely Isla Nublar and Lockwood's sprawling gothic mansion, there is plenty of creative space between them for director J.A. Bayona to pull off some genuinely white-knuckle edge-of-your-seat set pieces. Oh yes, more than the plotting per se, the 'Jurassic Park' movies were always about the scenes of tightly-wound tension, and we dare say Bayona not only equals Spielberg's flair for such roller-coaster thrills, he even manages to top the first two movies from the latter.The pre-opening is in itself demonstration of that - two pilots in an underwater pod in the cordoned-off seas around Isla Nublar run into the park's Mosasaurus, while his counterparts on land are greeted by a T-rex. That is only but warm-up for the film's piece de resistance, which sees a thunderous stampede down the slopes of the volcano as it blows up, threatening to crush Owen, Claire and her scaredy-cat tech nerd colleague Franklin (Justice Smith). Having depicted the horrifying 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami in his 'The Impossible', Bayona exercises the same disaster-movie sensibilities here, crafting a breath-taking sequence of genuine visual awe. It would have been difficult to top that, and wisely enough Bayona never tries; rather, he moves to a more confined playground, opting for intimate scenes of well-tuned dread and suspense.Within the tight corridors and stony basement of Lockwood's residence, Bayona plays to his strengths in his previous horror films 'The Orphanage' and 'A Monster Calls', unleashing the new genetically engineered Indoraptor on his lead couple and Lockwood's bright young granddaughter Maisie (newcomer Isabella Sermon). There are plenty of nail-biting moments here, some of which like the tap-tap-tapping claw are in deliberate homage to Spielberg, while others like the romp through Lockwood's private national history gallery of bones are bound to be classic. To be sure, this second half is on a much smaller scale than most audiences would expect the action in a 'Jurassic Park' movie to be, but equally it is precisely this change in tone, character and atmosphere that makes this entry more refreshing, engaging and stimulating than the other sequels.Just as uncharacteristic is its intellectual musings about conservation and evolution. Now that mankind has brought the dinosaurs back to life from the dead, should we make an effort to conserve them given the impending extinction extent on Isla Nublar, as we would any other endangered species? Or should we accept our actions as an aberration of nature, and therefore let nature take its own course henceforth? That conundrum forms a running theme throughout the film, underlining the difficult choices that our heroes are faced with and bookending the brief but effective appearance of a bearded and greying Dr Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum doing his signature staccato brainaic thing for the series).Nevertheless, the 'Jurassic Park' movies have always been about taut human-versus-dino showdowns, and 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' has plenty of that to spare. Like we said, this is a masterclass in tension, suspense and dread, punctuated by moments of campy humour by Owen and Franklin and enlivened by the hearty chemistry between Owen and Claire. Just as significantly, this chapter finally takes the thrill out of the theme park, switching up the usual scenery and setting up a brave new world for the trilogy's final chapter. Sure, it doesn't have the same nostalgia as its predecessor did coming some twenty years after the last movie, but this one is actually even better, even more thrilling, thought-provoking and tense. It's right on top with the first as the best of the series.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

111,Abdulxoxo,Entertaining,7,29 January 2021,"One of the best things about this movie is the little horror feel. The tension created in one scene where a dinosaur is creeping up on a child was fantastic. There were a few other moments inspired by the horror genre. I wish there'd been even more. I enjoyed the action sequences in Fallen Kingdom. The frustrating thing however is that the use of CGI was still too often an unwelcome distraction. Not all of the dinosaurs were convincing. As far as the storyline is concerned, that was a real let down. Enough time wasn't spent on the island. I think the idea behind the conspiracy was not very convincing. There was a subplot involving a little girl that I didn't think was necessary; but given that it was included, I'd then say that enough time wasnt spent on it. The creativity of the writers as for the need to create a brand new dinosaur to be the big threat is questionable. Creativity in general was kinda lacking actually. The performances were definitely better. Howard was better than last time. Chris Pratt also improved. There was a scene where he was coming out of paralysis, his physical performance was hilarious. He was also great in any of the scenes that involved Blue, his pet-like velociraptor. It shared a little similarity with the relationship between Dwayne Johnson and George the gorilla in 'Rampage'. As far as the villains are concerned, they failed to make much of an impression. Rafe Spall was ok at best. Toby Jones was sinister, but in more of a cartoonish villain sort of way. Also Ted Levine looked like future dino food from the moment you met him.
In conclusion, this movie was slightly disappointing. However, there were some individual moments that's enjoyable. There were some really impressive action sequences; and most of the dinosaurs looked great. the acting much better; and most of all, the elements of horror in the movie were fantastic. These darker scenes were the highlights.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
112,Terryfan,Welcome to The Fallen Kingdom,8,24 June 2018,"Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom is the sequel to Jurassic World and the fifth movie in the Jurassic Movie series. I went to see the movie opening day with my brother and it was a near packed theater for this movie. As a long time fan of the Jurassic Park series it felt like they wanted to take a different route then the other films in the series.After three years since the demise of Jurassic World Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) must team up again to help a team hired by Eli Millis (Rafe Spall) and lead by Ken Wheatley (Ted Levine) to recuse the surviving dinosaurs before the island is destroyed but as the mission goes on there is more to the mission than meets the eye.
The story prove to be dark as promised it would be and it prove it for sure. While some points in the plot could've been change in my opinion.
Chris and Bryce performances were in my opinion the best acting from the whole cast because their characters changed over the years to help make you understand their motives for being in the story.There are plot twists you won't see coming that will make your jaw drop as you didn't expect that in a Jurassic Park movie.The score like always is important for Jurassic movies because it is the key to the success of this series. There is new music along with the theme song for nostalgia fans.It's really cool to see the film makers use animatronics again it actually made you believe you're seeing a dinosaur instead of all CGI.The movie does have some issues like the side characters are either going to be like or dislike along with some of the darkness in the movie just proves that the movie was lucky to get PG-13 rating.But over all if you're a dinosaur fan and a fan of Jurassic Park then you will enjoy this movie.I give Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom an 8 out of 10

114,Troy_Campbell,"Enjoyable enough, but still too formulaic.",6,24 June 2018,"After 2015's Jurassic World proved an enormous success ($1.6bn worldwide box office!), it's a surprise to exactly no one that Universal has returned for a second bout of four-quadrant thrills and claw-tapping chills. With the usual eye-rolling plot contrivances and ludicrously thin character development, this sequel won't garner many new fans. But talented Spanish filmmaker J.A. Bayona (replacing out-of-favour Colin Trevorrow) adds a bit of spice; his horror roots coming to the fore in the final act to craft some tense and exciting mansion-bound set pieces. It's a clever move shifting the action-after an unexpectedly enjoyable first-act disaster sequence-to a more confined space, the physical limitations helping to ratchet up the tension. There's a healthy spattering of humour and tongue-in-cheek knowingness, but the repartee between Chris Pratt's Raptor-whisperer Owen and Bryce Dallas Howard's Dino-lover Claire gets stale in a hurry. Bayona's zest behind the camera, and his willingness to veer towards the scarier side of the franchise, makes this a decent enough sequel, however Fallen Kingdom is hamstrung by its reliance on formula and penchant for silly moments.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
115,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Dinosaurs everywhere! And everyone's even stupider than last time.,5,24 July 2018,"Jurassic World has that old-timey disaster movie vibe where all the characters whom inhabit the movie are there solely to be killed (with the exception of the sacred main characters of course). This movie is populated with set-piece puppets who serve no other purpose other than to be killed in rather dumb fashion or shown to have outright questionable 'sense' of things ultimately leading them to their deaths. 
Fallen Kingdom is an unnecessary continuation of a nostalgic franchise because who would want to continue preserving creatures who'd threaten the fabric of our modern society? At least Star Wars had the logic of having remnants of an old empire reform generations later as opposed to scientists playing god for failed theme parks!Fallen Kingdom isn't terrible but it's not really all that good either. While it's got some nice effects throughout, the overall package equates to boring characters who don't compare to the interest we have in the dinosaurs at all.2.5/5 stars.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

All the prior ones were pretty good, even the 3rd one, but this one was horrible. The only saving grace was the graphics which were of some pretty horrible fights. The plot starts off ok but then descends into ridiculousness.

118,Stephen_A_Abell,Some Franchises Should Be Left To Extinction... Where's A Meteor When You Want One...,3,11 July 2020,"What we have in this film are the two dinosaurs of the movie industry... Story and Spectacle. In a respectable picture, like the original Jurassic Park, these behemoths work together to create an entertaining story full of memorable scenes. Such as the beaker of water, the severed arm, raptors in the kitchen, breath on glass, and caught on the toilet.However, in this film, the titans appear to be fighting each other for the top spot. And both fail... miserably.The minimalist synopsis of the story is sound. The volcano on the island is erupting. Do you save the dino's or let them die? Simple. Derek Connolly and Collin Trevorrow add a double-cross, which you can anticipate coming. They even have the gall to rip off the original film's dominant storyline. However, if you can't get the DNA canisters, then you need the dinosaurs themselves. The trouble with this comes if the audience possesses a brain-cell apiece. Because the person who is nicking the dinosaurs owns the company who created them. Why the hassle(?) Just run off a fresh batch of the buggers?Don't get me wrong, I understand why they want ""Blue"", the raptor with a heart and a mind. She is a unique specimen amongst the Jurassic throng. But why the rest? Especially when you realise they're already messing about creating hybrids with the DNA.The answer is simple. To keep the franchise running and to achieve the conclusion the producers wanted.The one thing which made me laugh, unintentionally that is, was Ian Malcolm's appearance. He's participating in a court hearing to decide the fate of our old-age pets. Unintentionally reflecting life, the court hearing appears pointless. Because at the film's finale, we see Malcolm's still in court. This is for the poignant and haunting ultimate words of the film. The icing on the cake is he's dressed in the same suit - Oh, Stinky Malcolm. This, in itself, is an excellent idea, but just like the rest of the film, it's poorly presented.This could be thanks to the writers or the director, J A Bayona, who isn't without similar faults. In truth, Bayona nicks quite a lot from the previous movies. I know he does this to keep the audience in a reminiscing mood. Giving them a sense of familiarity and taking them for a trip down memory lane. Though it doesn't work. I felt swindled. I wanted imaginative and new, not this regurgitated mess.How many times are we going to witness the victory roar and stance of the T-Rex? At least another two times it would appear. Not satisfied with stealing the iconic scene once, Bayona does it twice. Do you guys not know that by doing this you are actually lessening the effect and power of the original moment? This is lazy. God, I would've loved the T-Rex to make the kill, whip out a top hat and cane, then dance off-screen singing ""Ragtime Gal"". If you will ""borrow"" stuff, at least make it interesting... or funny.We're given another reworking of the ""Run with the Dinos"" scene. Granted, there's an erupting volcano and a pyroclastic cloud is chasing them, but in essence, it's the same scene. Bayona even has two of the cast joyride in a gyrosphere, which was used in the previous movie's ""Run with the Dinos"" scene. Well, if you will be unoriginal... You gotta go all the way.These are two scenes, there're more throughout the film.Though I don't believe the writers or the director did their best work, the worst thing is the effects. They are superb and beautifully rendered. However, they failed to excite. The majority of the monotony is down to the directorial issues above. However, even the newer elements are badly presented. When the heroes have to race the volcano you want excitement. But the CGI artists give us too much eye-candy, and this kills the thrills. I wasn't sitting on the edge of my seat; I was fighting off the snooze.One of the principal elements in creating excitement is having characters you believe in and can relate to. The last film brought us the annoying and cocky... and unlikeable, Owen Grady. And, the boring and dumb, irrelevant (how did she get such an important job) Claire Dearing. The writers do nothing to expand their persona's. Even Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard do little to improve them. Had the Raptors or the T-Rex dined on these two, I wouldn't have shed a tear.In fact, the cast, like the story and direction, are wasted in their roles. I admit it was amusing to have Englishmen playing Americans and an American being English. I also admit James Cromwell was much better than Toby Jones and Rafe Spall in the portrayal stakes.The actors and actresses, and their characters, are under-used and appear to play third fiddle to the CGI. What the writers should have appropriated from the original movies was the strength of its characters. It was their unique attributes and moral principles that strengthened the story. The originals had meat on their bones and fire in their bellies. Their interactions helped the movie immensely.The director should've nicked the atmosphere and originality.I'd recommend staying away from this movie. If you love dinosaurs and an enjoyable story, this is not for you. Go back to the magnificent original Jurassic Park and the two sequels, both of which are better than these last two films.Ratings:

122,one9eighty,Dino-doneitalready.,5,10 July 2018,"It's back to Dino Island with Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, as Owen and Claire get mixed up in a plot to save the dinosaurs from extinction, or re-extinction. The island which was previously a home to Jurassic Park, or Jurassic World, or the theme park that had dinosaurs is about to blow up - a volcano is set to erupt and wipe out all life on the island. One of the original investors in the island wants to save the species so sets in motion a plan to save as many dino variants as possible. While he's working from his sick-bed, his assistant takes the reigns in the rescue plan, but with his greedy and loft motivations it soon turns out that not everything is as it seems, and the rescue plan isn't all about saving the dinosaurs. The film follows Claire and Owen's adventure as they try to rescue the dinosaurs while rescuing themselves along the way. This film felt like it could have been split into two parts, events on the island, and then events - well, not on the island. The first part of the film alone would have been beautiful and the plot would have been enough. The second part of the film kind of muddies everything, it makes the plot a bit more messy and it detracts from the beautiful scenes and CGI from part one. It feels a little like the film gets lazy, as it practically borrows the same scenes as the previous film used, mutant dinosaurs, heroic dinosaurs save the day, greedy villains, and repeated comedy which wasn't actually that funny in the previous film but it passed as it was a bit charming. There are a lot of 10 out of 10 reviews on here, I cannot seriously give this a 10, don't get me wrong, it wasn't a terrible film, but no stretch of the imagination did it do enough to warrant top marks. It wasn't really creative, it didn't give us anything new, it didn't expand on characters that much, it's not as good as the previous film, and it's nowhere near as emotive as the original Jurassic Park films from the 90's. I guess this film poses some morality questions about creationism and survival, but by the end of the film those questions seem to have been hypocritically put to bed and forgotten. The chemistry between Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard seemed decent enough, but at times felt slapstick and more akin to a cartoon than a blockbuster film. All in all, I liked the film, I didn't completely love it, I didn't hate it, but there were times I was frustrated. 5 out of 10 from me.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
123,educallejero,Well..that's forgettable,5,11 August 2018,"Agree with the majority here. Mediocre, fine film. A bit boring there, a bit dumb here, fun overall and forgettable.The dinos are (barely) the only thing that the movie gets right, really.
Bad characters:
-She (Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing) didn't care about Dinos; she shouldn't want to go back to the Island.
-He (Chris Pratt as Owen Grady) LOVED them; he should be ready to go back to the Island.
Somehow the movie used the ""offscreen"" time between movies to put them on unearned arcs that make them the opposite of what they were. Because the writers needed them to.
-Then we have the comic relief characters (Justice Smith as Franklin Webb and Daniella Pineda as Zia Rodriguez), which are both terrible and annoying.
-And the villains: the militar; the greedy man.Its so shallow and quite worthless.But again, I loved all the set pieces with Dinos and Chris Pratt/Dallas Howard are just too good anyways. Mediocre film of a, mybe not that great of a franchise at this point?I'll be there for the conclusion though.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
124,phubbs,Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,5,18 September 2018,"K so this happened, the legendary Spielberg franchise churned out its fifth movie and actually turned into cheesy B-movie schlock. Did I say turned? I meant deteriorated. So here we go again. The island of Isla Nuba is gonna be destroyed by a pending volcanic eruption and there is a debate about whether the dinosaurs should be saved or not. Naturally despite the US Senate deciding to allow the dinosaurs to perish some do-gooders take it upon themselves to try and save them anyway (must be part of the 'resistance'). But low and behold the people who claim to want to save the dinosaurs for a new sanctuary actually mean to sell them off to the highest bidders. These naughty humans have also created genetically modified dinosaurs too which will bring in even more money. And needless to say, the people who to buy these dinosaurs are all evil (and probably Russian, I dunno). Could you get more schlocky??Alright so like some previous reviews I've done for these huge popcorn flicks I'm just gonna basically bullet point my thoughts because there is literally so much I could write it would go on forever. So straight away one of the key political narratives in this movie is the argument about whether the dinosaurs should be saved because they are living animals and deserve protection. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) believes mankind should allow the dinosaurs to perish because nature has once again selected them to die off and that they were originally man-made so they shouldn't have been around in the first place. An opinion he has generally held throughout the franchise, that the whole idea was a bad one. Personally I agree with this because as said these creatures were man-made. Without our science and interference they wouldn't be alive in the first place so essentially letting them die off via natural disaster is a good way to end the 'project'.What bewilders me is the fact that our two protagonists, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), still want to save the dinosaurs and put them in a sanctuary somewhere...because that's worked out so well up till now. They both think these giant lumbering creatures can be looked after like regular animals despite ALL the trouble thus far. They just don't seem to understand that dinosaurs cannot be contained and some will eat you. This is a huge flaw in the characters and it's annoying.Isla Nuba: The volcano erupts and we officially enter the schlock zone. Grady and Dearing manage to outrun the pyroclastic cloud. During this time the soon-to-be bad guys are off catching dinosaurs to 'rescue'. We never actually see how they do this, they just arrive at the ship with lots of captured dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes. Its also at this time we get our first (overly used) T-Rex money shot as it roars after inadvertently saving the protagonists (how many times guys? How many times).Sir Benjamin Lockwood: Who? Well alas Richard Attenborough died in 2014 and obviously director J.A. Bayona wanted another elderly character to oversee the new dino project. So now we have a John Hammond-esque character again, hurray! Turns out back in the day this duo worked together on Jurassic Park but fell out, hence we haven't ever seen him before (and not because he was just created for this movie).Northern California Estate: Jump to Lockwood's sprawling Addams Family-esque mansion in northern California complete with a moody wood-paneled Victorian-esque interior, a creaky dumbwaiter...oh and an underground lair with cages big enough to house large dinosaurs. It's basically a freaking castle. This is where the highly illegal activity of selling dinosaurs goes down in some ridiculous evening event for...Bond villains? And yes I actually think some of these dastardly people were actually Russian.It seems these people want to buy dinosaurs for various reasons such as hunting, but the main reason is, of course, the old weapons notion. Yep apparently these guys think that dinosaurs would make great future weapons, 'the perfect weapon'. This literally makes no sense to me, how the flip is a dinosaur the perfect weapon? Why go to all the trouble of trying to train a deadly man-eating dinosaur (possibly with attached weapons?) for the purpose of warfare when you can just use highly skilled men. You can't rely on the dinosaur not killing you. You can't rely on the dinosaur not running off on a mission. And although a dinosaur can probably kill lots of people, surely men with guns can kill more? And surely a dinosaur isn't exactly invincible either, its a living creature, it's not bulletproof.Its here we also get introduced to the new genetically-modified dinosaur with all the bells and whistles (but still not bulletproof, although apparently tranquiliser proof). Naturally said dinosaur eventually gets out and kills everyone as we proceed to the second half of the movie, 'Resident Evil: Dino Hunt'. Yes it's around this point that the movie legitimately becomes a monster B-movie as the dinosaur chases people around the dark mansion (and on the rooftops). Cue lots of near misses as the dinosaur goes for the kill (always an object in its way).To really double down on the whole 'Resident Evil' theme we see that Lockwood has a young granddaughter. Spoiler alert, turns out she's a clone. It seems Lockwood got carried away with the whole replication of DNA and cloned his dead daughter, which in turn caused the split with Hammond. Towards the finale the Velociraptor known as Blue (transported from Isla Nuba) is released and helps Grady and co by attacking the new modified dinosaur. Cue lots of furious CGI and the second money shot in the exact same pose we've seen before with the T-Rex, only this time with the Velociraptor (Jesus Christ!). In the end both dinosaurs fall off the roof and through a window whilst fighting. Luckily the evil dinosaur is impaled on a statue, phew!Oh and then in the end when everything has settled, Dearing has a chance to free the remaining dinosaurs into the wild (of America) otherwise they'll get gassed to death (the results of the aftermath of the dinosaurs breaking free under the mansion). Thankfully she hesitates and doesn't, realising that would be a bad move. But then Lockwood's cloned daughter calmly does it anyway because she's a stupid kid. So all in all its a pretty surprising drop in quality really. This used to be an epic franchise, a Spielberg franchise, a step above the rest. But now its been dragged through the mud with multiple sequels that have gotten worse and worse until we are left with a cheesy monster movie that wouldn't look outta place in the King Kong universe. The effects are impressive of course but its a drab looking movie loaded with annoying callbacks to the original movie. The dinosaurs are now free in the US so one can expect a very familiar third movie soon. I'm guessing the only thing they can do now is round all the dinosaurs up and move them back to site B? (remember that? Its still out there).5/10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
125,bettycjung,The Jurassic franchise lives on...,8,25 June 2018,"6/24/18. I love dinosaur movies, so hands down, this is right up my alley. I looked forward to seeing the latest offering of the Jurassic franchise, and was not disappointed. I loved all the Jurassic movies to date. This will definitely perpetuate the franchise for at least another sequel... or, two. This one reminds me of the classic sci-fi/adventure movies in which fleeing an island to escape an erupting volcano provided all the suspense and excitement of wondering whether or not they will survive (e.g., Journey to the Center of the Earth, with Pat Boone). IN ADDITION to that plot line this movie gives you fleeing dinosaurs and evil men who want to save them just to make money. Decent story line with fantastic special effects make this a must-see for summer fare. Pratt and Howard were great, as was the supporting cast.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
126,rockman182,Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018),7,24 June 2018,"I've heard really mixed reviews from people about Jurassic World, despite it being a gigantic box office success. I loved it and thought it was a really fun and nostalgic theater experience. The trailer for Fallen Kingdom got me nowhere near as hyped for the film as its predecessor but I still wanted to see it as quick as I can because of my love for the series and dinosaur goodness. I was wary about the very negative critic reviews that were coming out. Never listen to them, because I had a lot of fun with this film. There's plenty of stupidity all around in the plot, but the action, directing, and dark tones were welcome.The film takes place a few years after Jurassic World. The park has closed down and there is a volcano on Isla Nublar that is near imminent eruption and Owen Grady and Claire Dearing are tasked with getting some of the more valuable dinosaurs off the island. Little do they know, the purpose of the mission is to capture these dinosaurs and sell them off to the highest bidders while also unleashing a brand new engineered Indoraptor, the ultimate predator who also serves as a dangerous weapon. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard return in the title roles.First let me get through what I didn't like. I thought the plot was at times weak and shallow. The film doesn't feel as rich in plot as the original and some of the decisions are stupid. Especially character decisions. I found the subplots (especially with that of Maisie Lockwood), felt extra. There's also a predictability in sequences because of familiarity with the series. Its definitely weaker than the original Jurassic Park and I'd say Jurassic World, although I know many people will disagree with that. The villainous plot also reeks of standard cookie cutter villain actions. Also, there are so many impossible survival scenarios that occur that you would think this is a heightened version of Indiana Jones.The film is well acted, and Chris Pratt continues to show that he works as a leading man. The mix of animatronics and CG is good. I like J.A. Bayona's style in filmmaking as you can see darker tones and the use of shadows is prevalent. The film feels darker and more mature at times as there is a dilemma of needing to save these dinosaurs and also considering the implications of letting dinosaurs out into the world where humans live.I had a fun time with this film. Its not an amazing effort but its really not as bad as what I hear about it. Sure, the film franchise is showing signs of wear but I was able to enjoy the film and the action it brings. Visually, the film is a joy to look at on the big screen and I still feel like the film brings good dinosaur fun. I think the series should end for good with the final film in the Jurassic World trilogy though. I'd like for some of these blockbuster series to bow out when the time is right instead of going on forever.7/10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

128,jon.h.ochiai,"The Eyes of the Child Saves ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom""",7,25 June 2018,"The glaring narrative loophole for all the ""Jurassic Park"", now ""Jurassic World"" movies is singular. What would possess anyone to think: ""Hey, let's use prehistoric DNA to clone the unstoppable killing machine!"" When is that ever a good idea? Well, never. Director J. A. Bayona's sequel ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" inherits its own faulty DNA in the perpetuating premise. Yet, J. A. along with Writers Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow manage to navigate the repetitive narrative sideways. We actually cheer for the vicious dinosaurs against mankind. Mostly, because mankind occurs as stupid. Human creators played God, and were arrogant enough to think that they could control the Raptors and other creatures. Perhaps, messing with evolution. Creating a brave new order? No.""Fallen Kingdom"" opens with the familiar face from ""Jurassic Park"". Now elder scientist Ian Malcolm, surprisingly humbled Jeff Goldblum, testifies before the Congressional Committee. The cataclysmic volcanic eruptions on Isla Nublar threaten the second extinction of DNA cloned dinosaurs on the Island. Ian advises Congress to let the creatures all die in the volcanic aftermath. He says that this may be Nature's way of ""self-correction"". Of course idiocy prevails: Congress orders the military rescue of at least 11 species of dinosaurs for the sake of having a movie to make. The Government enlists passionate idealist Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire, now dinosaur preservation activist, as part of the operations extraction team. Claire seeks out her estranged ex-lover Owen, whimsically aloof Chris Pratt, to join their mission. Owen has a unique affinity for Raptor named ""Blue"". He's like the ""dinosaur whisperer"". Predictably, reluctant Owen joins Claire for the helicopter ride to Isla Nublar. In the clandestine background, Jurassic Park co-creator Benjamin Lockwood, played by weary wise James Cromwell, suffers over his precarious legacy. His estate executive Eli, played by cool calculated Rafe Spall, has more mercenary intentions for Lockwood's legacy. Lockwood entrusts the care of his innocent young granddaughter Maisie, played by bright strong Isabella Sermon, to Eli. Maisie also has strange affinity for her Grandfather's dinosaur creations. ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" is nonstop action eye-candy that overwhelms any semblance of character development. The fierce Raptors and T-Rexs are visual effects marvels. Chris is charmingly game as Owen, and delivers martial arts skills along with flip one-liners. Bryce is intense, yet light-hearted resilience as purposeful Claire. I loved Director Bayona's ""A Monster Calls"", which is the greater movie. ""Fallen Kingdom"" benefits from his amazing visual style. In ""A Monster Calls"" Bayona's authentic gift is his endearing connection of childhood. I believe that gift resuscitates ""Fallen Kingdom"" in the story of young Maisie. Resisting the overplayed child in peril scenario, Isabella's Maisie sees both the wonder and terror of ""The Fallen Kingdom"". There's a very touching scene midway through as frightened Maisie hugs Owen. He holds her close. He promises that everything will be all right. Maisie holds hope for the brighter day to come. Hope that the evil that men do shall come to its end. That glimmer of childhood idealism revives ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" above the state of the art action movie fare. We see the hope through the eyes of the child.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
129,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A franchise that once again needs to go extinct.,4,8 March 2019,"While I have loved the original Jurassic Park (1993) for its ingenious special effects, taut and thrilling plot, and entertaining characters, none of the sequels have been able to live up to its high standard. Sure, all the same elements of the first film are usually present in each subsequent movie, but the magic seems to have been all used up in the first go. Each version is only a slight variation to a story that never ends well.Now in the fifth installment of this franchise, I'm a little surprised that this storyline hadn't appeared yet. Sure, we had dinosaurs making their way to the mainland in The Lost World (1997), which was probably why Jeff Goldblum had an extremely minor (and entirely unnecessary) cameo in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018) to act as a framing bookend to the film. Sadly, many of the mostly hidden weaknesses in Jurassic World (2015) came to light in this sub-par sequel. Like I said in my review of Jurassic World, I don't care about these characters, even if their relationships seem to be written to elicit a response from the audience.Furthermore, while the plot of Fallen Kingdom seemed like low-hanging fruit (which is probably indicative that they're scraping the bottom of the barrel for plotlines), none of the twists were surprising or unexpected. Heck, the biggest twist was already obvious almost at the beginning. While I will praise this film as having quite a few neat bits of CGI and special effects, most of them felt like they were part of a demo reel for a college final. It didn't help that the dinosaur mayhem didn't even take place until the last quarter of the movie. By that point, I had lost all suspension of disbelief as children were outrunning velociraptor-type dinosaurs with ease. Nobody felt in danger, even if I really wanted the annoying and obnoxious ""tech support"" character to be eaten as soon as possible (it didn't help that he only appeared to conveniently move the plot along).A franchise that once again needs to go extinct, I give Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom 2.0 stars out of 5.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
130,RforFilm,"Jurassic Park: Fallen Kingdom is just...to quote Jeff Goldblum, ""That is one big pile of sh*t""",2,22 June 2018,"What I loved about Jurassic Park was that it was more then a ""lightning in a bottle"" blockbuster with a blend of physical animatronics and computer animation. The movie was also morale about the dangers of scientific genetic creation. It presented several sides about making new animals and even whether they should exist among humans. It was a Frankenstein story along with dinosaurs. When it came out in 1993, it was one of the biggest movies of all time. Even today, in 2018, it still holds up as an awe-inspiring adventure that was both terrifying and optimistic.When Jurassic World, a long awaited sequel, came out in 2015, audiences were split on it. While a lot of people, including myself, phrased it for giving the story a proper push into its story of gene manipulation and the business behind it, many people also felt they just got a copy of Jurassic Park with dinosaurs that were majority computer animated. I'll admit that I can understand that as even I can see further how fake the dinosaurs looked. I still support that film for at least being a fun blockbuster that I could enjoy. Will Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom take a step forward or backwards? A step backwards.Following the events of Jurassic World, the former theme park as been abandoned. A volcano is also about to erupt, endangering the entire dinosaur population stuck there. While the U.S. Senate, along with Dr. Ian Malcolm (Played by Jeff Goldblum), feel like the creatures of instinct should be eradicated, several dinosaur-rights activists, including former operations manager Claire (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) wants to save them. Claire is contacted by Banjamin Lockwood (played by James Cromwell) and Eli Mills (played by Rafe Spall) with plans to move the dinosaurs to a sanctuary (guess they forgot about the other island from The Lost World and Jurassic Park 3). Claire agrees to help and brings along systems analyst Franklin (played by Justice Smith) and dinosaur veterinarian Zia (played by Daniella Pineda). Knowing that securing the last remaining raptor will be difficult, she also gets former trainer Owen (played by Chris Pratt) to come with them. When they arrive, they see that time is limited as the volcano is about to erupt and a team has already been securing various species. When they do successfully get off, Claire and Owen realize that the company gathering the creatures is going to sell them on the black market.Like the title, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom shows how far things have fallen from grace. I guess we can begin with the story and plot which messes up right from the beginning. It wants to make an ethical case on why the dinosaurs should live, but given how the previous Jurassic Park movies have stated that the creatures and humans cannot coexist. Plus even if they were all killed, don't the companies have instructions on how to simply recreate them again? There's really nothing at stake. Jurassic Park, and even Jurassic World had some memorable moments with action and the dinosaurs. I cannot think of one memorable sequence with the dinosaurs, and the ones that do stick out are stupid or unexciting. I can say that the majority of the movie is off the island. That's right. Much of it is either on ships, in offices, or a mansion where the second half of the movie is set. So things either feel familiar or, especially with the house, feel like a disappointing downgrade, given that it becomes a ""monster in the house"" plot. How about those dinosaurs? Eh...there in the movie. You get your pterodactyls, raptors, t-rexs, brontosaurus, pretty much stuff you'd expect and want. I will say there is a greater effort at using a mix of animatronics and computer animation...to a point. Sometimes, they can look good, but they also seem less fluid and more transparent, given some of the designs and color choices. Without spoiling anything, I'll say the ending does bait a potential sequel. It wants to take a different direction, which is fine, but the decision on how they get there is so stupid, that you still fail to understand why dinosaurs need to live. You can't make the situation scary and compassionate! I'll give this two wrecked Jurassic Park trucks out of ten. If your looking for simple dinosaur action, you'll get more of it here, but minus the memorable characters. This makes me realize that I doubt we'll ever capture that same magic of the Spielberg classic that will remain a masterpiece. But as with Jurassic Park: Fallen Kingdom, the series looks to be heading for extinction.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
131,Hollywood_Yoda,The Ending Flatlines,7,21 September 2018,"This film had some good points, but many of the plot points make no sense. I feel that having a new director again was a downfall for the franchise, as happened with Jurassic Park III. Colin Treverrow should have returned from the previous film.The ending was by far the strangest part of the film. If you haven't seen this installment, you should; that way you'll understand what is meant. However somewhat thought provoking, the ending diverges from the rest of the series; but I will not go into detail. The best part of the film is the cameo by Jeff Goldblum, which itself was too short. I hope he has a larger role in the next Jurassic World.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
132,petra_ste,Ten things about Fallen Kingdom,4,14 June 2018,"1) It's bad. I didn't like Jurassic World, but this is worse. It's got broad characters, lackluster set-pieces, a noisy score and the kind of script which should be punishable by throwing its writers to sharks. At least Jurassic World, mediocre as it was, had the good sense to copy the first Jurassic Park. Fallen Kingdom foolishly imitates The Lost World instead, with a semi-watchable first half on the island and an abysmal last act with dinosaurs wreaking havoc back to civilization.Kudos to the late John Hammond for building his park on a volcanic island. Also, I hate to ask but, since it's a plot point that dinosaurs will face extinction (again!) if they are not rescued from Isla Nublar... what happened to Isla Sorna (Jurassic Park 2 and 3)? There were dinosaurs on it as well. I'm sure some novelization or website makes up a lame excuse, but the movie doesn't.2) Stop overcomplicating blockbusters. Jurassic Park featured a smart sci-fi premise, but the actual plot had an elegant simplicity to it. Fallen Kingdom is the opposite, dumb but convoluted, tossing in betrayals, cloned little girls and evil corporations selling dinosaurs to warlords.3) Speaking of that, enough with the ""dinosaurs as military weapons"" nonsense! This is a concept which appealed to all of us when we were kids (""I want to ride a T-Rex! With a rocket launcher mounted on its back!""), but you cannot have War Dinosaurs in anything that wants to be taken seriously by adults.You know why Navy SEALs don't have trained lions? Why no army breeds rhinos to ride them into battle? Because nobody in modern warfare would spend millions for a huge beast which would be an economical and logistical nightmare to raise, train, feed and manage, especially when a random enemy soldier could blow it to smithereens with a 100 $ grenade. Someone should tell writer Colin Trevorrow that war elephants aren't a thing anymore, while firearms and explosives are.Note that the dinosaur boogey of this movie, the Indoraptor, is so ineffectual that it repeatedly fails to kill its unarmed preys in the endless climax. Some infallible weapon: there is a scene where three characters are pinned under a tree and the Indoraptor manages to... scratch one of them in the knee before they escape. You know what could have killed them more efficiently than your War Dinosaur? One guy with a pistol!By the way, the Indoraptor is trained to attack targets after you point a laser at them and emit an audio cue. Wait a second - if you are already pointing a gun with a laser beam at someone, can't you just PULL THE TRIGGER? It's a 30 cents bullet versus a 30 millions dinosaur. Bad guys, do your math.4) Fallen Kingdom assumes you are really, really interested in Blue, the Chris Pratt-trained Raptor from Jurassic World. This is understandable, since Owen's relationship with his Raptors was one of the few bits from the previous film which at least felt novel. However, the script retcons Blue into a sympathetic, heroic creature which displayed diligence and empathy since it was young; funny, I recall her killing several innocents in the previous movie and attacking Chris Pratt himself with no provocation in their first scene.5) Since we mention Pratt: much like Jurassic World, this movie doesn't know how to use him. Pratt is ideally cast not as a badass, but as someone who *thinks* is a badass - a character who is capable but still out of his league. He works so much better as a slightly comedic, self-deprecating protagonist than as a tediously infallible, dead-eyed action figure.His Owen never changes. There is more character development implied with a small prop in Jurassic Park (the Raptor claw Grant uses to scare a kid at the beginning and then throws away after bonding with Tim and Lex) than in all Owen's scenes in Fallen Kingdom.6) Howard is inoffensive but unremarkable as Claire: she is just kind of there, blandly good-looking, doing no damage but adding little value, like a lettuce in a sandwich. Her two sidekicks (Scared Nerd and Tough Latina) are insufferable though.(By the way, how is Claire not rotting in jail as the aftermath of Jurassic World? She is directly responsible for the dozens of casualties there, poorly handling the Indominus' escape and refusing to evacuate the island. She must have one hell of a lawyer.)7) Poor Rafe Spall, a competent actor (see The Ritual, a much better monster movie), plays Greedy Corporate Guy, an antagonist so flat and obvious that I was disappointed he didn't get an Evil Laugh Scene... you know, he throws his head back and bellows ""Bwahaha!"" while the camera cranes up.I love how Rafe Spall builds a containment facility for dinosaurs under James Cromwell's mansion. Cromwell plays Old Sick Naive Rich Guy. Sorry, I don't care how old, sick and naive you are: you have no excuses if you don't realize someone is HIDING DINOSAURS IN YOUR BASEMENT. Really, Trevorrow? Is this some kind of spoof?8) CGI is fine but overused. It's a visually busy movie.I'll give them credit for making the Indoraptor more visually distinctive than the Indominus. At least they sort of splashed some yellow on it.9) While Bayona's direction is competent (certainly better than this script deserved), I didn't care for most of the set-pieces. Remember how Spielberg took his sweet time with the T-Rex breakout or the Raptors in the kichen? Here most action beats are over right after they begin (the Baryonyx, the Carnotaurus...). There is no build-up, no crescendo. It's the cinematic equivalent of premature ejaculation.It's not just a matter of screentime though; the Dilophosaurus appeared in the first film for two minutes and is more memorable than any of the new creatures here. You have to do something creative and unique with your movie monsters. For example, the bunker attack could have been carried out by any carnivore; if you wanted a Baryonyx (which was possibly a semi-aquatic predator like the Spinosaurus), why not put it in the sinking gyrosphere scene?I did enjoy the prologue with the T-Rex and the Mosasaurus, although... why would the Jurassic World engineers build a giant door which allows the Mosasaurus to reach the ocean? What kind of scenario were they envisioning where the escape of the humongous sea monster would be a positive outcome?I mean, come on. I'm not usually a nitpicker, but this movie seems to be trolling anyone giving it a minimum amount of thought. A plot hole doesn't automatically ruin a story, but the cumulative effect of all this nonsense conveys a staggering lack of thought and care.10) The silly ending sets up another sequel. I guess we'll finally get the inevitable War Dinosaurs.*sigh*4/10To people asking ""What were you expecting in a film about dinosaurs?"", I answer: ""Something maybe not on par, but at least in the same league as Jurassic Park, one of my favorite movies of all time"".",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
133,juliankennedy23,Dino Crisis,7,11 March 2019,"0: The fifth in a series of Jurassic Park movies and the second of the soft reboot trilogy, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom borrows from both the second Jurassic Park film The Lost World: Jurassic Park and the Resident Evil series of video games. Owen and Claire (Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard) are back as the bickering love interests set to rescue the dinosaurs from Jurassic World as a volcano threatens to destroy the island and make the dinosaurs extinct again.Although very well directed (by J.A. Bayona) and with good special effects, the story simply fails this sequel as the premise of the film it doesn't make any logical sense and the characters (particularly Pratt and Howard) do little to engage the audience throughout the silliness.In all fairness, the first Jurassic World had a pretty flimsy premise as well. The idea that people are tired of looking at dinosaurs is laughable. I mean look at all the cruises to the Galapagos to see turtles, Antarctica to see penguins, whale watching tours to see well whales, or even bloody dog shows. A Saturday afternoon at an Everglades alligator farm will quickly put a lie to the idea that people don't like seeing dinosaurs eat chickens.Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom's premise is that we need to save the dinosaurs from extinction because the island they all live on is blowing up. The first flaw in this masterpiece is that there is another island far away from this one also filled with dinosaurs.Jurassic Park Site B island is not some piece of trivia. It was the location for both The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III.Okay so maybe the current characters didn't know about this secret island on might say? Jeff Goldblum (who is wasted in this film by the way) was the star of The Lost World: Jurassic Park. I certainly would expect that during his congressional testimony he might bring it up. Plus it was the T-rex from that island that ate San Diego. I don't think it is a secret.There really is a bigger problem with the plot than just the what about that giant other dinosaur island the film series is conveniently forgetting. The dinosaurs are man-made creatures (notice the lack of feathers and the fact the velociraptors are not eighteen inches in height and 33 pounds like the real ones were.) Which means we can just make more dinosaurs. We can make them any size and color and disposition we want. That is kinda the theme that has run throughout the entire series after all. These dinosaurs are simply not extinct if we can make more.I like both Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard as actors but their characters have no chemistry in this. Pratt leaves most of his charisma in his trailer when he tries to go full action star and Bryce Dallas Howard acts like she should be running a PTA bake sale. The two millennials they bring along on this trip grew on me but a wiser script would have had them eaten.The relationship between Pratt and the velociraptor Blue in this film also has some issues. They took away the Blue may turn on Pratt angle from the first Jurassic World and retconned her as an adorable pet. Pratt calls Blue the second most intelligent creature on the planet and she is the focus of the rescue. I am not buying it. Blue can open doors, is an intelligent and ruthless hunter, and responds to treats and laser lights. If the velociraptor slept eighteen hours a day it would be my cat.I credit the film for trying something new in its second half. Cribbing heavily from Resident Evil, Carnosaur, and the movie Taken of all things the adventure in the mansion certainly wasn't what I was expecting when I saw the ads. (what I was expecting was giant aquatic dinosaurs eating surfers and yes I waited for the whole movie for that and yes I am still upset.)The second half of the movie really is straight from the Resident Evil videogame right down to the little girl who (I am calling it here) probably has velociraptor DNA. Honesty it sticks a lot closer to the plot of Resident Evil than any of the Paul W.S. Anderson movies managed to. I love the twist I just wished I liked the characters and the movie more. The opening bit with the guys trying to get the bone underwater in the dark rain is excellent as is the final montage (Where my surfer eating dinosaur finally makes a too-brief appearance.) The rest of the film is fun but somewhat disposable.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
134,bankofmarquis,"If you liked the first 4 films in this series, you'll like this one",7,23 June 2018,"Did you watch - and enjoy - the other 4 films in the JURASSIC PARK series? If so, then you'll enjoy the 5th installment, for it is more of the same - man's hubris causes giant animals to run amok and chaos, death and destruction ensues.The plot of this film is simple enough - the island where JURASSIC WORLD was built is now in trouble as a dormant volcano is now dormant no more. The debate rages - should Man go to the island to save the Dinosaurs trapped there - or should they let nature take it's course (again). Some nefarious fellows - who's intentions don't seem to be as pure as we are led to believe - convince our heroes from the previous film, Claire and Owen to help ""save"" the dinosaurs.But, of course, the plot is just an excuse to get some pretty awesome looking CGI Dinosaurs on the screen - and to put our heroes in peril. And on that score, this film succeeds wonderfully well.I remember back in 1993 how awed I was at the spectacle on the screen. The CGI Dinosaurs were LIFE-LIKE! I was blown away by it. Today, I have come to expect the CGI will be top-notch - and I was not disappointed, to the point where I forgot that I was watching CGI.As for the action and acting, Director J.A. Bayona (A MONSTER CALLS) keeps things moving along at a sprightly pace, not letting us catch our breath - or more importantly - stop to think of the plausibility or logic of decisions being made. His mantra seems to be ""move our heroes from peril to peril"" - and he does that well.Chris Pratt is back as Owen, the ""Raptor handler"" and his charm and charisma on screen is in full display and really carries the weight of this film. He is able to charm his way into the audiences heart, so you end up rooting for him fully from start to finish. Bryce Dallas Howard (daughter of ""Opie Cunningham"" Ron Howard) comes into her own as Claire, the Dinosaur ""Scientist"" and quasi-love interest for Owen. She is able to avoid (mostly) the cliches of ""damsel in distress"" or ""kick-ass chick"" and gives us a rounded character that I rooted for just as strongly as Pratt's character.The rest of the cast - save two - are pretty much throw away that are set up to be Dinosaur food. The two that stood out are the great James Cromwell as an aging Billionaire who has a connection to the originator of Jurassic Park, John Hammond. Cromwell is his usual, solid self. And...the funniest character in the film...computer expert Franklin Webb (played by Justice Smith) who, of course, is asked to do more than just ""computer stuff"" that he is ill-equipped to handle.Going into this film, you know what you are going to get - and this film delivers that entertainingly enough. As I stated at the top, if you like the first 4 films of this series, you'll like this one.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
135,Anurag-Shetty,A sequel that pretty much matches up to its predecessor.,9,9 June 2018,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is set three years after the events of Jurassic World(2015). Isla Nublar, the island that's home to all the dinosaurs, is about to be engulfed by a massive volcano. Owen Grady(Chris Pratt) & Claire Dearing(Bryce Dallas Howard) join forces again, to go back to the island & rescue all the remaining dinosaurs, before they get wiped out. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a highly entertaining film. Director J.A. Bayona effectively takes over directorial duties from Jurassic World(2015) director Colin Trevorrow. The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. The visual effects are flawless & the CGI'd dinosaurs look super realistic. This sequel is as good as Jurassic World(2015). However if I had to choose, I think I like Jurassic World(2015) a tad bit better. The set pieces just get slightly repetitive in this one. I'm not complaining though. I guess in the previous installment everything felt a little more fresh. Chris Pratt is spectacular as Owen Grady. Bryce Dallas Howard is outstanding as Claire Dearing. Rafe Spall is awesome as Eli Mills. Daniella Pineda is amazing as Zia Rodriguez. Justice Smith is hilarious as Franklin. Toby Jones is great as Gunnar Eversol. James Cromwell is good as Benjamin Lockwood. Ted Levine is impressive as Ken Wheatley. Isabella Sermon is adorable as Maisie Lockwood. The dinosaurs are the real stars of the show.

136,fernandoschiavi,"With J.A. Baoyna, ""Fallen Kingdom"" leaves the characteristic of adventure to embark on a science fiction that, even with light moments, gains aspects of horror thriller",7,21 June 2020,"In ""Jurassic World"", Colin Trevorrow managed to revitalize the Jurassic franchise with great competence by bringing an original script to a certain extent, being able to explore novelties, without ignoring what was previously told and still paying several tributes to the classic of the 1990s. After the astronomical box office of the fourth film in the franchise, making it the fourth most profitable in history, it was reported that the Jurassic World sequel was already in development. For the sequel, Trevorrow is only a screenwriter and executive producer alongside Steven Spielberg, leaving the Spanish J.A. Bayona in charge of this second part. Chris Pratt, Bryce Dallas Howard, B.D. Wong and Michael Papajohn reprise the roles that brought life to Jurassic World, while Rafe Spall, Toby Jones, Ted Levine, Justice Smith, Daniella Pineda, Isabella Sermon, Kevin Layne, Geraldine Chaplin and James Cromwell arrive at the franchise.In Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, three years after the closure of Jurassic Park, a volcano about to erupt puts life on Nublar Island at risk. There is no longer any human presence there, with the dinosaurs living freely. Given the situation, a decision needs to be made: should one return to the island to save the animals or abandon them for a new extinction? Determined to rescue them, Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) summons Owen (Chris Pratt) to return to the island with her.The series tries to circumvent the danger of exhausting the theme. ""Fallen Kingdom"" is the return of the franchise to its greatness, without relying only on its past. In the hands of J.A. Baoyna, the film quickly leaves its characteristic of adventure to embark on a science fiction that, even with light moments, gains aspects of horror thriller. The photograph gets darker and leaves aside the tacky moments that existed in the 2015 film. The director brings a new look, closer to the fantasy horror, but the repetition of situations and the frank precariousness of the dramaturgy again indicate that the series has difficulty reinventing itself. The director's ability to deal with the dimensions of a catastrophe film, already attested in ""Lo Imposible (2012)"", guarantees the necessary pace and urgency in all sequences on the island. In the same way, the sensitivity to terror exhibited in ""El Orfanato (2007)"" results in some scares and moments of decent tension. In addition, the filmmaker manages to give personality to many of the scenes, which represents a considerable leap in relation to the bureaucratic direction of the previous chapter. The advance, however, is only from a technical point of view - however competent he is, Bayona is stuck with a weak script. Although he does not have the same obsession with the self-referring fan service of Jurassic World, this sequel cannot escape the consecrated turns in previous films. When the film builds on its original trilogy, Jurassic Park, bringing features like Jeff Goldblum's or quotes from earlier times, she makes sure not to leave the new audience out. Everything is quite explained, although the film takes time to start.Here, the director is competent to show the arrival of dinosaurs in the world of men, as seen in The Lost World. The entire first half of the film takes place with the exposures of the motives and the capture of dinosaurs on Nublar Island, about to be hit by a volcano of enormous magnitude. This first part yields great moments of tension. The initial scenes showing a T-Rex chasing one of the employees who was sent to the island to obtain the DNA of the Indominus Rex, being preceded by a suspense created by a clever lighting game in the vegetation that revealed the T-Rex's sneaky approach phenomenal. Subsequently, the flight from the island of the protagonists and the dinosaurs also yields exciting moments, especially in the scene of the fall of the movement capsule, seen in the first film. The sensational aquatic sequence-plane that occurs during the volcano's eruption, proof of how comfortable the director feels with his camera for manipulating the images. And tributes to Spielberg's classic, of course, are not left out.After capturing the animals, when the action leaves Nublar Island and is transferred to the world of men, the film manages to maintain its suspense and the viewer's interest. The mansion's climax setting is reminiscent of a medieval fantasy castle - complete with large windows, parapets, an almost dragon and the moon's backlight on a cloudy night - and Bayona once again performs a contemporary horror that dialogues with European horror fables. The happy choice to combine animatronics and computer graphics makes the animals more convincing than in the previous feature. The care in the design, however, as well as the submerged sequence shot and the bold upside-down cameras, are not enough to denote the lack of subtlety in some moments: it must be the first time in the cinema that a dinosaur cries. The filmmakers dedicate their attention to symptomatic issues and not to fundamental problems, making gender and generational dynamics more current.The script tries to create a breakthrough in the evolution of the protagonists in a less likely way. Right away it is understood that the characters of Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, for example, are not the same. The directors seem to believe that Chris Pratt's charisma is enough to push the protagonist, who has no dramatic arc: from the beginning of the previous feature film to the conclusion of the new one, Owen remains the same. Claire, in turn, is undergoing a transformation as radical as it is unlikely: from workaholic who refers to dinosaurs as ""items"" to the activist in favor of the rights of creatures. At least the flirtations between Claire and Owen, something that stopped The World of Dinosaurs, here is relegated to three or four scenes, which even allows Bryce Howard to get rid of the shadow of the figure of Pratt, taking a more active position in the script.The arrivals of Justice Smith and Daniella Pineda bring new, fun and effective characters to the feature. Ted Levine also looks great on the scene. Even with light scenes, this time the children's participation, characteristic of Steven Spielberg's films, is much less cliché. The participation of the young Isabella Sermon is much better justified than just a commercial issue, and the issues surrounding the discussion about family run away from the clichés found in most Hollywood films and would gain a much deeper aspect if the script knew how to explore better. Unfortunately, the film still wastes talents such as Jeff Goldblum, Toby Jones, James Cromwell and Geraldine Chaplin, in brief and unimportant appearances.It depends on the level of abstraction of the audience and nothing else, some flaws in the script, specifically in the development of the characters, are notorious. In addition, although the scenes are well done, the danger does not seem extremely real. Some humans run more than dinosaurs, but this time, they are at least not in high heels. Nothing that will hinder the use of the feature to the general public, but a more demanding spectator may end up bothering with the ""armor of protagonist"". No moment in the film is really surprising, but that is not uncomfortable. After the last twist - a subplot that the film overvalued from the start with the mystery of photography - is delivered by the villain without any consequence to the plot, it is definitely clear that this Jurassic World 2 is not a character film (human).There remains hope for new looks with some particularity, such as that of Bayona. On this hook, the film even makes some ethical reflections about endangered species and humanity's responsibility for animals, bringing, above all, scores about the consequences of genetic advances and the risks of the lack of legal regulation on the subject - even for it is a new field of science - which makes changes in the image beyond the possibilities of monitoring and inspection by the authorities, leading private institutions to extrapolate barriers without a previous analysis of the moral perspective.Spielberg's dinosaurs, unfortunately, have not yet found the renovation they are looking for, and even though this new adventure does not pass with indifference (and it is the first to achieve such a feat after the original), the smart and economical way is still needed, without that excess of noise and lights, with which Spielberg brought Michael Crichton's book to life. Jurassic World continues to fulfill all the requirements of past franchise resurgences, and has a lot of fun during its two hours.However, ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" is an entertaining film, which entertains in a much more mature way than Jurassic World. Dynamic, when the feature gives you time to breathe, it is usually to move you. The problems of the previous film are gradually erased and its novelty is not only the aesthetic change, but also the script and its future implications, which should give an even more new face to the franchise. Even those who are not excited to know that Jurassic World would win a sequel, should end up hoping that the franchise does not end there. And speaking in sequence, the end of this film is very open, and makes it clear that we will have a sequel, which will probably show a planet where humans have to learn to live together and, who knows, compete for space with these new / old species.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Unfortunately for Fallen Kingdom that is no longer the case and the movie really seemed to be stuck abiding by the same formula as all the Jurassic movies.The one thing that is different in Fallen Kingdom is the total lack of suspense throughout the movie. This is a distinct step backwards from Jurassic World which was all together more entertaining. Whilst the leads, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, do their best there is no getting away from the clunky plot that we've seen before.

I don't do spoilers but why if in the previous film you fight to survive are you now fighting for..........????Personally I felt let down, enjoyed it but personally I feel something was missed, with a slight tangent (the girl) this could been taken in a whole new direction.But unfortunately it is same-o-sane-o.For me Jurassic Park 3 will always stand out as the one to beat where the T Rex was brought back to LA and it ran riot to find its baby (whatever happened to the mom and baby because since then we have only ever seen one T Rex)?Kids will love this film (another Rampage) but as an adult I'm not too sure.

The over-the-top incessant wide-eyed screaming by a lot of the characters seemed contrite and forced. In fact, except for James Cromwell, all the characters were so bad that it'd would've been a better film if they all had been killed by the dinosaurs and pterosaurs. The best thing about ""Fallen Kingdom"" were, of, course, the animals, but then again, because you've seen most of them before, this was really just a rethread of the same old, same old. In other words, nothing to see here folks. Move along now. Not recommended viewing. I only suffered through this because I'm a completionist. This was my punishment.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
143,bob-the-movie-man,Greedy men + Dinosaurs = Lunch!,7,12 June 2018,"I've really had a rollercoaster of emotions on this one. As a general fan of dinosaurs running riot, since I saw the brilliant original in 1993, I was pretty disillusioned by the teaser trailer for this one: all over-the-top CGI. But as the lights dimmed and the Universal logo faded to ominous sonar sounds, the hairs stood up again and I thought J.A. Bayona (""A Monster Calls"") *might* deliver something really special here. Ultimately though, I left the theatre disappointed... but only slightly so.With extreme topicality given what is happening on one of the Hawaiian islands at the moment, Isla Nublar - home to the now derelict Jurassic World theme park - is in serious trouble due to a volcanic eruption. Swayed by chaos theory expert Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), a US senate committee decides to do.... absolutely nothing, letting the dinosaurs face re-extinction. This is much to the fury of our heroine from the first film, Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas-Howard), who now runs a ""Save the Dinosaurs"" group. When all seems lost, help comes from the wallet of philanthropist Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell, ""Babe"", ""LA Confidential"") and his ops manager Eli Mills (Rafe Spall, ""The Big Short"") who propose to fund a private rescue mission: a mission that requires the involvement of Velociraptor-wrangler Owen Grady (Chris Pratt, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", ""Passengers""). But are their motives truly honourable?The film has its moments, with some well-executed action scenes, some nice munching of bad people and a few scenes that are truly touching: shots of a brachiosauruses' last moments is a memorable piece of cinema. But that said, the film is extremely patchy. An exciting (but not particularly logical) pre-title sequence seques into a very wordy and action-free first reel, headed up by Goldblum (always seated: did he have his legs chewed off by a raptor?) droning on no doubt for a huge fee but not for much purpose. The early part of the movie is good however at introducing new characters: specifically the geeky Franklin (Justice Smith) and the pre-requisite 2018 'Times Up"" kick-ass female character Zia ( Daniella Pineda), who is actually very good. As a whole though it's not terribly engaging, leading to even the reveal of the derelict theme park - which should have been a high point - falling somewhat flat.The much trailered volcano scenes that follow are impressive but should have been left to impress in the film. Things ratchet up again though when the action moves to the more confining environment of Lockwood's estate, bringing in arch-villain Gunnar Eversol played by Toby Jones (""The Snowman"", ""Atomic Blonde""), who really should have taken the stairs, and Lockwood's granddaughter Maisie ( Isabella Sermon) who is excellent as the 'child in peril'. Some of the character's actions don't make a lot of sense but they do generate some memorable scenes, supported by Michael Giacchino's stirring soundtrack.So, it pretty much works as an action film, but in terms of character development it doesn't go anywhere in particular: Claire and Owen come out in about the same condition as they came in. I was expecting something deeper from Bayona (with his ""A Monster Calls"" being my personal No. 2 film of last year) than just a 'running and screaming' film.It's also difficult to avoid the fact that after five of these films there's nothing much new under the Isla Nublar sun. Some of the plot here is a retread of the genetic shenanigans of the last film, mixed with the 'off-island' antics of ""The Lost World"". And most of the action scenes are just stripped and re-painted from the earlier films. By the way, staying through the endless credits is worth it not just for getting the full force of Giacchino and Williams' majestic themes: there is quite a nice end-credit scene, illustrating that gambling might involve more than just money in the future!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

In the informative ""The 15 Geniuses Behind The Lens: How The Greatest Film Directors Shaped The Movies We See Today,"" the book details the first ""Jurassic Park"" in detail, describing the pioneering technological breakthroughs with Computer Generated Imagery the 1993 thriller created. With John Williams' soaring music and a script that admittedly placed the dinosaurs before humans but still solid, the production was a breathtaking tour de force.""Fallen Kingdom"" is an amazing visual experience to sit through. However, lost in all the roaring taking place on the screen is the direction--and the incredibly poor dialogue--that this series is steering towards. Sometimes I wonder if the art of placing weighty words for the characters' dialogue is becoming a lost art in these CGI films. It can't be that difficult to come up with some witty and emotionally thought-provoking sentences emitting out of the actors' mouths, but here I felt I was watching robots saying sophomoric statements that made me cringe. If writers Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly had as much creativeness and imagination as the special effects visual team of David Vickery, Neal Scanlan and Alex Wuttke, then ""Fallen Kingdom"" would have been a more complete movie. Alas, without a decent narrative, this picture is all show and no substance.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
147,kjproulx,Do We Need More Of These Movies? Maybe.,6,22 June 2018,"The Jurassic Park franchise hasn't really been anything to praise, at least since the release of the original film back in 1993. The two sequels to follow that film were fairly weak in my opinion, but I was actually pleasantly surprised by its return in 2015 with Jurassic World. Many fans dislike that film for being nothing but nostalgia, but I thought they did a solid job in bringing people back into this world (so to speak). For that alone, I have been anxiously awaiting the next chapter, but the trailers made me a little nervous. Sadly, if you've seen any of the trailers for this movie, it gives away the entire film, so I would recommend staying away from all promotional material. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom isn't really the follow-up I was hoping for, nor that I believe many were hoping for, and here's why.For obvious reasons, the park is now deserted, with the only living things being the dinosaurs themselves. For reasons that I won't disclose in this review, especially for those who have chosen to stay in the dark about the plot, the volcano on the island is erupting and the plan is to get as many dinosaurs off the island as possible. Bringing them back to land (which is not even the dumbest plot point throughout this film) makes for some very big consequences that may or may not be a plan for future instalments going forward. Personally, I did enjoy watching this film, but the plot itself really had me thinking I was watching a spoof at times. The real plot doesn't kick in until about halfway through, which I found to be very stupid, so if that description turns you off, then this movie definitely isn't for you.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard both reprise their roles and are easily what makes this movie as enjoyable as it is. There are quite a few annoying new side characters that will have many people cringing at their intentional mannerisms and characteristics. Although, the addition of the Isabella Sermon as Maisie. Not only did she act circles around most of the newcomers, but this young actress has easily one of my favourite arcs throughout the movie. Some viewers may find her character to be quite strange towards the end of the movie, but I thought she was a nice surprise for the film and the Jurassic Park universe in general.Something that has always been a staple of this franchise is the fact that some of the most memorable dinosaur moments come from the fact that practical effects are used. While this film definitely showcases a lot of (solid) CGI, the numerous sequences that feature practical effects were absolutely a breath of fresh air. From that aspect to the great direction by J.A. Bayona, this film feels far more like a cinematic experience than its predecessor, but that's also a slightly odd decision, as the rest of the franchise has different looks and tones to them. For this film though, it's a huge plus.Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom will absolutely not win over any newcomers and definitely won't make you change your mind on the franchise if you haven't liked any of the previous movies. That being said, there are some exciting aspects to this film and the core characters are as likable as they were in the previous film. The way the plot moves along is very, very slow, and I almost got bored at times, so I had more of a frustrating experience than anything. This isn't a bad movie by any means, it's just not really all that great, either. The way this film ends gets me excited for the next film, but that's not really enough to warrant a big recommendation, at least in my eyes.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Not to mention a HGV that can travel across water. A little girl (and I am watching the movie during lockdown and typing) is proving to be the potential heroin of the movie, but this really isn't one for the grown ups, the kids are more used to seeing dinos eating humans than we are. These dinos aren't fussy either about the colour of their victims skin",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
149,Carycomic,"Not bad on its own merits! But, the franchise might be starting to run out of steam.",8,23 June 2018,"I mean, let's face it. The moment the audience sees that two-man sub at the beginning of the film, approaching the skeleton of the Indominus Rex (InGen's home-made version of a Deinocheirus), in the old Mosasaurus pool, you know there's going to be a nasty surprise. One that might as well have been heralded by the theme from JAWS! But, at least, they jumped right into the middle of the action. Using that BBC World News simulation to inform us that the formerly extinct volcano on Isla Nublar has come back to life. Instead of, you know, trying to be methodical with stock footage of an erupting volcano combined with seismograph needles going haywire on the Costa Rican mainland. True! That might have been because Amblin Entertainment, Legendary Films, and all the other co-production companies might not have had enough money to be that methodical. But, it still serves to hasten the opening act of the film.  And, believe me, that's a good thing. You see, as action-packed as the rest of the film is, most of the action scenes are pastiches hodge-podged from the first three films! The dino stampede from the first stage of the final, island-killing eruption being inspired by the Gallimimus scene in the original movie. The T-Rex almost getting loose aboard the not-so-good ship Arcadia (a nod to the RESIDENT EVIL franchise, perhaps?) being inspired by the set-up for the San Diego sequence in the first sequel. And the identity of the dinosaur attempting to get Frank and Claire, in the maintenance bay, being Suchomimus is apparently inspired by the initial misidentification of Spinosaurus in the second sequel. Even the cameos of Jeff Goldblum and B.D. Wong don't do much to enhance this flick. The only noteworthy plot twist is the true identity of Maisie Lockwood. Played by relative young newcomer Isabella Sermon, she has some touchingly cute scenes in this film. Like the debate with her nanny (played by Geraldine Chaplin, daughter of the legendary Sir Charlie) on how to correctly pronounce the word ""bath!""  {Note to Ms. Chaplin: when in Rome, pronounce it like the Romans.} In short; if you're already tired of summer re-runs on TV, this movie will be an entertaining time-killer. But, if there proves to be any truth to the rumor that there will be a JURASSIC WORLD 3, circa 2021, I won't be too surprised if that's the grand finale for this franchise.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

This is all the more disappointing when you consider the filmmaker involved. I'm unsure why they went with this storyline and potentially leaves this series a bad spot.

This has a bond style rex of an opening to see what happened three years on from last hybrid Indominus Rex so we have this time a new one called indorapter a cleaver dino just like the ones in the first jurassic park and we have a cameo from Jeff Goldblum character doctor Malcom So we have the build up to this one where the volcano is awake and the scientist are working on a escape plan for the animals on the island so Owen and claire round up the the team to launch a rescue mision of sorts 
this part of the film has every one in action hero mode so we have elli mills funding this mission from hammonds mansion in the forest but all is not what it seems here as the mission goes south quite litterly .so this film has a beaten heart at the center. So this film comes off the island by boat then things take a turn for the worst this is wear the films turns on its head which is fabulous becasue it goes all dark and genuinely scary in parts and you will jump in scenes with the new hybrid I like what the new director done here JA bayona he made a film thats clausterphobic in nature. blue also steals parts of this film to there is a stalking hybrid indoraptor and with Ben lockwoods granchild her she steals the show in this part as she figures out mills plan and there is an auction of dinos of sorts a new army to build so 
plan and freedom is the ultimate word her so with life finding away to the freedom of the dinos can they co exist this is what the next film theme will be put this one is huge and the fans of the jurrasic film will love this but none fans wont . this is worth the watch and 2hrs long stay for end credits ,but is not great but the young star in this one is for the future instalments.enjoy its a great summer blockbuster.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

153,msbreviews,Rating: D+,3,19 September 2018,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)If you don't know by now, I am a huge Jurassic Park fan. It is one of my all-time favorites and Spieldberg's influence on movie history, especially sci-fi, is undeniable. A lot of people forget this, but he directed Jurassic Park AND Schindler's List in the SAME YEAR! How crazy is that?! A lot of fans don't know this, and I think this is part of the reasons why fans' expectations for these Jurassic World films are misleading.Jurassic Park is a masterpiece. It established itself as a classic. You can't get better than that! You can never expect a sequel to an A+ to also be an A+. That is saved for some of the best sagas EVER. The Lost World - Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III didn't stand a chance and couldn't recreate the original's success (even if The Lost World is not as bad as people might think). So, when it was announced that Jurassic World was going to resurrect the franchise, I was a bit skeptical.Nevertheless, the first one was released, and I genuinely had a blast. Yes, it has some flaws, namely some of its characters, but otherwise, I really liked where they were going with the saga. They created two new protagonists (Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard) who I can definitely get behind, even if we all agree that Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) is right about the moral dilemma of bringing back to life dinosaurs or not. Therefore, my expectations for Fallen Kingdom were that it continued the success generated by its predecessor...Worst. Movie. Of. The. Franchise. I am sorry. I rather sit and listen to the talking raptor from Jurassic Park III than watch this one again. It ruins so much of what I loved about the original and of Jurassic World. My biggest issue is that it turns a classic saga into a generic, boring and even cartoonish flick. The villain is paper-thin and extremely cliche (money, money, money). The supporting characters can't even be forgettable because they are so annoying that it is impossible to forget all of the screaming and crying. Even our protagonists lack some of the characterizations given to them in the previous installment.The actors are fine. Chris Pratt is likable as always, but his character barely gets any development. Bryce Dallas Howard's character (Claire) thankfully doesn't get to make stupid decisions again, and she actually has some good moments. However, when you replace her occasional stupidity with a whole new character that has such a silly subplot only to provide an even more absurd ending ... This is just horrible writing.The screenplay is full of logical flaws that question the events that happened in previous films. Midway through the movie, something happens that completely changes the entire film. It went from a good idea to one of the worst scripts of the year in an instant. I have no idea what went on Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly's minds, but they didn't write a single good script. Character or subplot, they are all terrible.I have talked about trailers and their danger for years. I stopped watching them since 2016 and my cinematic experience exponentially increased. Once again, I didn't watch any Fallen Kingdom's trailers, except for an image or a few seconds here and there. I always complain about two significant things trailers do that may ruin anyone's movie experience: spoiling some key plot points and showing too many awesome sequences since it takes away that feeling of watching something amazing for the first time. It is just not the same after watching it in a trailer.Fallen Kingdom stands alone as the only film that I know of, able to accomplish those two things. See, I never watched a clip or image from the final trailer, only from the first one. So, I just saw images of the dinosaurs on the island and the volcano erupting. Basically, I expected a rescue mission for the entire runtime which I thought was a good concept for an entertaining but also an emotional movie. However, and this is not a spoiler since it is in the freaking trailers, this film is only a rescue op for less than an hour.The second half is a tedious and cliche story about a cardboard villain trying to sell dinosaurs. Because money is cool. Of course, everything from that point on is awful. From the well-directed yet ridiculous action sequences inside a mansion to some cringe-worthy lines of dialogue, this is NOT a Jurassic Park sequel in any point of view. It is just a flick that Trevorrow needed to write in order to write the actual movie he wants to do in a few years to complete the trilogy. Absolutely despicable.I don't even know what to write anymore. I am so disappointed that not even the mind-blowing visuals can save this. I don't understand how Bayona can direct the hell out of this film but not see the gigantic flaws of the screenplay. As good-looking as the movie is, it is not enough to change my mind: this is one of the worst films of the year. Jaw-dropping CGI (contradicting my expectations that it would be excessive) help to produce some terrific set pieces, but when both the story and its characters fail, no technical aspect can save such disaster.Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is one of the worst movies of 2018 and one of my biggest disappointments of the last few years. An excellent cast, some mind-blowing CGI and a great director ... All wasted due to an extremely flawed screenplay and paper-thin new characters. Trevorrow and Connolly turned a classic saga into a dinosaur-monster film, with so many irrelevant and unnecessary subplots that only led to an even worse ending. The fact that the trailers show 95% of the movie also doesn't help, but the disappointment was due to happen. I'm sorry Steven Spielberg. Maybe one day, you'll be avenged.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
154,virek213,The Dinosaurs Are Out...FOR REAL (And Maybe For Forever),8,25 June 2018,"JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM (2018)When writer Michael Crichton and legendary director Steven Spielberg collaborated on the film version of Crichton's 1990 dinosaur novel ""Jurassic Park"", they likely had no idea of what they would eventually unleash onto the unsuspecting public. But then upon its release to theaters in June 1993, JURASSIC PARK proceeded to gross nearly $1 billion at the box office; and the 1997 Spielberg-directed sequel THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK, while it didn't quite equal that total, was, at $600 million, hardly a box office flop either. 2001's JURASSIC PARK III, directed by Joe Johnston (OCTOBER SKY), while Spielberg was directing A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, was a comparatively moderate hit, but again hardly a flop. Then fourteen years went by with no new films about genetically engineered dinosaurs scaring people left and right, until director Colin Treverrow (SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED) stepped up to the plate for 2015's JURASSIC WORLD (Spielberg again serving as executive producer, while out directing BRIDGE OF SPIES). And in 2018, Spanish-born J.A. Bayona, whose credits included 2007's THE ORPHANAGE, took the directorial reins with the fifth film of the franchise, JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM.In this entry, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are called back into service by Benjamin Lockwood (Cromwell), the brother of the now-dead Jurassic Park creator John Hammond, to rescue the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar, whose very existence is being imperiled by the increasingly violent eruption of the Mount Sibo volcano. Pratt is especially concerned about one of the dinosaurs, named Blue, that he trained as a behavioral specialist three years before, and he needs to find it. With the help of two very worthy dinosaur experts (Justice Smith, Elia Rodriguez), they manage to get most of the species, including Blue, off the island before the volcano incinerates the place. But to their horror, they find that their efforts have all been part of a set-up instigated by Cromwell's son (Rafe Spall) and a nefarious mercenary (Toby Jones) to sell the dinosaurs to the highest bidder as weapons of war that are far more lethal than biological, nuclear, or chemical weapons. Cromwell's dream of actually finishing what his brother had started, of putting the dinosaurs on an isolated island to fend for themselves and learn to live away from human beings, is thus totally shattered with this set-up and his young granddaughter (Isabella Sermon) finding him dead in the bedroom of his Northern California compound. As can be expected, the dinosaurs, once introduced into interaction with those underhanded war profiteers, cause an innumerable amount of terror for all concerned. Pratt, Howard, Sermon, Rodriguez, and Smith the only ones that make it out alive...and now that those dinosaurs themselves are out in the world for real, life, as Jeff Goldblum (returning as Ian Malcolm) testifies before Congress, life has found a way, and there is now absolutely no turning back.Spielberg once more stayed on as a co-executive producer (along with Treverrow, who co-wrote this film's screenplay with JURASSIC WORLD co-scenarist Connally), being involved in directing both READY PLAYER ONE and THE POST. Bayona, however, shows himself to be fairly good at supervising the dinosaur mayhem and the spectacularly violent eruption of the volcano, which, in this film's most poignant moment, forever engulfs the last dinosaur that Howard and Pratt were unable to save. Some of the acting, especially by Jones and Spall, is a bit ripe, but that may be due to some of the quirks that Treverrow and Connally carried over from their JURASSIC WORLD screenplay. Pratt and Howard, despite some reversion to their initial bickering in the first film, still make for an appealing couple, as to Smith and Rodriguez as the young scientists who help them. Goldblum's return as Ian Malcolm, as well as B.D. Wong's return as Dr. Henry Wu (who has been co-opted by Spall and Jones in creating more genetic monstrosities), also do good turns, although Goldblum's appearance is just a bit too brief.Despite a few bumps and grinds, there is apparently still quite a bit left to be made from dinosaur DNA terror, as evidenced by JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM (and a third ""Jurassic World"" film to come, in 2021). Michael Giacchino's score is suitably ferocious and bombastic, while also retaining many of the musical calling cards of John Williams' two original JURASSIC PARK scores. The end result, while not out-and-out masterful, is better than most 21st century blockbusters by a fairly wide stretch.

Genre: Sci-Fi/MonsterOr: ""You know they just rebooted The Lost World, right?"" or
I absolutely LOVED the first Jurassic World! After landing this franchise as well as Guardians of the Galaxy, you know Chris Pratt hit pay dirt with KDRT (hope you caught the Ford Fairlane reference...otherwise that would not make any sense). From the giant veggiesaur to the itsy bitsy raptors, I was giggly with anticipation as I ran in to the theater. Did the T-rex do the damage it was supposed to, or did it not think things through because it had a big head and little arms (Meet the Robinsons...tell me you saw that!)? Well let's watch them in the side mirror as we drive into a Lowedown...remember before I start that objects in the mirror are closer than they appear.
Cast=10
It looks like the ones that survived the first movie (except he kiddies) are all back for the fallen kingdom. You got Chris Pratt for three points, Bryce Dallas Howard and enter Jeff Goldblum for two each, Ted Levine and James Cromwell add one point...and then a special two point bonus to BD Wong for being the mad scientist throughout this entire franchise. Ten points awarded right out of the gate.
Acting=7
What can I say here? There is not an Oscar worthy performance in the bunch; except for Blue but she was totally CGI. OK for this scene there will be running and screaming...wait I have to lie down. It does not take a whole lot of chops to do these films, but it was good for what it was. I therefore award seven count them seven points for this aspect.
Plot=8
When the island's dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen and Claire mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event. I give some props to the plot, as it resembled one of my favorites ""Congo"". The movie will not make you wait...you will not see the plot to late...that means the score will be an eight.
Ending=6
It's not that the ending wasn't great (well I guess it does mean it wasn't great), It just seemed like they had no idea what to do for an ending so they just threw something in there. It's like making waffles and then after realizing it needed to be sweet you added strawberries. Still it was a fine ending...it wasn't a giant prehistoric crocodile jumping out of the water but it was decent. So I'll add six whole points to the total.
Story=6
Despite the plot, I felt the story was more of a reboot of ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" than it should have been. Was it an accident or on purpose with the addition of Jeff Goldblum? Well I will probably never know...just have to stick to my suspicions. There was a beginning, middle, and end...plus they left an opening for a turd...er I mean third film. Another six points for the fallen kingdom.
Favorite Quote: ""If I don't make it back, remember you're the one who made me come here.""Genre: Sci-Fi
CGI=9
If you are giving me a modern Sci-Fi movie...I have to have some great CGI. There were a couple minor blurs, but otherwise some great CGI. I expected a full ten points here, but was a bit disappointed. That puts it at a not so excellent but still great nine points.
Pace=8
A great Sci-Fi movie needs a steady pace...if the story drags you can lose interest. I felt it was a bit slow in the beginning, but you kind of needed the character development with the addition of the new characters. Unfortunately, I felt Jeff Goldblum was not even needed here. I loved to see him, but I think the word I'm looking for is superfluous. But hey...eight points is a solid score.
Violent=9
""Genetic power has now been unleashed...you can't put it back in the box. Well I will be putting it back in its case every time I watch this...I fully expect to watch this many times at home. Just like a good action movie, I want violence...lots and lots of violence. There is an insane amount of running and screaming (hence the acting score), but ultimately I cannot give a PG-13 movie full marks. Yes my friends that means nine points is the most I will hand out.Sub-Genre: Monster
Monster=10
I mean it's Jurassic Park...er World...of course there are some great monsters! BD Wong's character is a sick puppy sporting them turtlenecks, but he can sure mix a mean dinosaur milkshake. Full marks for the monsters they put in here and how they reference these creatures with what we know about them. It would not be as good if there were some more fantastical monsters...it's important that they're more believable.
Twist=7
Ah the twist...that special drizzle of caramel on top of your cheesecake that will change the whole flavor of the dish. Now There is a twist here and it is somewhat surprising...trouble is that I didn't care for it as much as I wanted to. I think six would be too low for this movie and eight is too high...so that means seven points go to the Fallen Kingdom.
My Score: 8.0
This was a sequel that couldn't possibly match up to what the first one did. Once you build a bridge (so you can get over it....ha ha ha I kill me), you'll realize that this was a good movie. With a total worldwide gross as of July 22 of 1.2 billion dollars, it seems that others thought it was a good movie as well. Could you wait for video? Sure you can, but either way you slice it this is worth a watch.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

159,0w0,Significantly worse than the previous film due to having a different director,4,1 May 2020,"'Colin Trevorrow' directed the 2015 Jurassic World movie, which was very much better than this film, and for some reason they chose to not use him again... well, that's what you get then... this film is a MUCH worse film than the previous one, despite using the same cast and having the same budget.This movie is supposed to be a 'comedy adventure', yet I didn't laugh a single time in the whole movie. 2hours and not a single laugh. In the previous movie I laughed a couple of times, but in this one not once.I KNEW 100% who the 'hidden bad guy' in the movie was the very moment that I saw him... what's the point of casting someone as the 'hidden bad guy' if the audience knows exactly who it is the moment they see him? A 'hidden bad guy' is supposed to be able to remain hidden until the time is right, and then when he/she is finally revealed, then the audience is supposed to be shocked and amazed by the revelation... in this movie that obviously didn't happen... that comes down to poor casting, and poor acting by said actor.The characters also make idiotic decisions all throughout the movie which disadvantage themselves and others, as well as placing themselves in danger repeatedly. This comes down to poor writing.There's also a couple of plot holes: In one scene, they steal blood from a dinosaur, and they fill a HUGE blood bag to the brim in only like 2minutes... now anyone who has donated blood knows that it takes 6minutes+ to fill a standard size blood bag... but this bag that they filled was massive, and it honestly would have taken at least 20minutes to fill, not just 2minutes... that's a big plot hole and super unrealistic.There's also once scene where a character is murdered, but the character didn't yell or scream or call for help, which makes no sense and it a big plot hole once again. This character would have lived if only this character called for help.Another plot hole is that the 'good guys' never pick up guns. Throughout the entire movie there's probably 4 times that they could have used guns to defend themselves, yet they don't and that results in them being in danger constantly.Overall this movie is bad and a complete waste of time. It's also an insult to the previous 4 Jurassic movies. Hollywood greed or hollywood stupidity... this movie was really bad",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
160,Min111,Jurassic World is still better,5,28 June 2020,"I think the sequel is watchable, but I still think 'Jurassic World' is the superior or better movie. Both these movies sort of reminds me of 'Jurassic Park' and it's sequels. The first movies (Jurassic Park and Jurassic World) are great, but the sequels that followed aren't as great. I'm not surprised! I still liked 'Fallen Kingdom'. Why is that? It tried to be different from the first movie, and this is where I think the movie succeeded. The action starts immediately at the beginning in 'Fallen Kingdom'. That's something I liked about the sequel. This is something 'Jurassic World' is unable to provide. 'Fallen Kingdom' made more than a billion in box office, but it still fell short of the figures Jurassic World made. That tells you something. I was actually surprised that 'Fallen Kingdom' still made so much. The demand must be high for these Dinosaur movies. I'm expecting that there will be a third movie; I won't be surprised if there is. 'Jurassic Park' had three movies. The third movie (Jurassic Park III) was worse than 'Jurassic Park II'. I expect the exact same for Jurassic World. I'd be surprised if that wasn't the case. Anyway, 'Jurassic World' is still better than 'Fallen Kingdom'. These are great movies to watch if you're a fan of Dinosaurs. I don't know nothing about Dinosaurs, but that still didn't stop me from watching these movies. It's a great place to start. Though 'Jurassic World' is better, 'Jurassic Park' is more better. What's next? Jurassic Universe? I won't be surprised. I wouldn't have minded if these movies were just simply called as 'Jurassic Park IV' and 'Jurassic Park V'. It's still the same thing. It's good to see some of the cast from the first movie in this sequel otherwise the sequel would've been poor.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

162,MrDHWong,Offers more of the same dinosaur action and destruction that one would expect from this popular series of films,7,21 June 2018,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is the sequel to 2015's Jurassic World and the fifth film overall in the ""Jurassic"" franchise. Directed by J. A. Bayona (The Orphanage, The Impossible), it offers more of the same dinosaur action and destruction that one would expect from this popular series of films.Three years after the events of Jurassic World, the now abandoned Isla Nublar and the remaining dinosaur inhabitants are in danger of being destroyed in a massive volcanic eruption. Determined to save the last dinosaurs from another extinction, former employees Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) form a team to rescue the creatures from the impending disaster and ensure their safety.Thankfully, the film does not completely rehash The Lost World: Jurassic Park but instead expands upon the story first established in its 2015 predecessor. Dinosaurs still roar loudly and at some point a T-Rex will eat somebody. The film's visual effects were more convincing this time around and most of the CGI was tolerable, which I took issue with in the 2015 film. As usual, most of the human characters, especially the villains, were flat and predictable with little personalities outside of wanting to exploit dinosaurs for money, with the main exceptions being Owen and Claire, who proved to be generally likeable protagonists. The film is self-aware that it does not expect us to take every plot point seriously and for the most part this adds to its fun factor, so I suggest sitting back and enjoying the dinosaur action for what it is.I rate it 7/10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
163,meydiana-65242,I'm As Surprised As You Are...The 2nd Best Jurassic Park Film To Date,9,20 November 2020,"It's very much worth noting that I absolutely hated the original Jurassic World. Colin Treverrow's 2015 reboot suffered from undeveloped and uninteresting characters, a lack of emotional stakes, hideous CGI and, above all, a distinct lack of any style or atmosphere. So how is it, pray tell, that its sequel, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, is one of my favorite films of the year and my 2nd favorite film in the franchise, surpassing even the 1993 Steven Spielberg classic? (For my money, nothing beats Spielberg's terrible and beautiful cautionary tale of nature, The Lost World: Jurassic Park) Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is the rare modern franchise reboot with identity, sole and purpose, the rare reboot that genuinely succeeds with flying colors in re-capturing the lightning in a bottle that made the original great. It's not rehashing the original film and condescending the rest of your franchise legacy with awful meta humor like Halloween (2018), it's forging your own unique identity and breathing new life into the series. And Fallen Kingdom does that wonderfully.If you asked me to describe any of the characters in the original Jurassic World beyond their one-note personality quirks, I'd come up completely blank. If you were to ask me to describe the characters in Fallen Kingdom, however, I could go on forever. Claire Dearing is the Dr. Frankenstein of the film; passionate, proactive and blinded by her own ambitions, hubris and sense of righteousness. Her entire reputation, everything she's grown into since the events of Jurassic World, any chance she has at personal redemption for the lives lost on Isla Nublar 3 years ago, hinges on her saving the animals she once viewed as nothing more than corporate assets. She is driven by her emotions (Particularly her deep seated personal guilty), passions and code of ethics rather than merely plot convenience or cold, unconditional logic as was the case in the original Jurassic World. This makes her character far more relatable and human and her errors in decision making a lot more forgivable and understandable. Her arc from self-tortured and arrogant martyr to willing and humble hero is handled with a surprising degree of subtlety that not many critics have given her credit for. Owen Grady also benefits from a stronger characterization in Fallen Kingdom, we get to see more of his relationship with Blue and understand why and how he formed such a strong relationship with her. Fallen Kingdom does an excellent job establishing Owen as a man outside of and uncomfortable with the civilized world, exhausted with the pretensions and self righteousness of his fellow human beings. The honesty, trust and unconditional love he's shared with Blue since birth means the world to him and his love for her is the one thing he has left that's truly worth fighting for. Because the cast is playing actual characters this time around rather than merely hollow archetypes, the performances improve tenfold. Bryce Dallas Howard is allowed to be confident, fervent and passionate in her vocal delivery. Chris Pratt is allowed to be emotionally vulnerable and nuanced in his facial acting.Even the dinosaurs have more character here than they had in Jurassic World; Blue's mini-arc of feeling distrust and abandonment from Owen to repairing their broken relationship is certainly more character development than any terrible lizard of Jurassic Park movies prior and the Indoraptor has both an odd sense of tragedy and unique, slasher villain-esque aesthetic that give her a real sense of identity that the Indominus Rex lacked.Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom possesses possibly the most striking and memorable aesthetic of any Jurassic Park film to date. The tone feels deliciously Gothic horror inspired with some beautifully chilling and dark imagery that really captures the feeling of terror and majesty held in the Crichton books. In an age where so many Hollywood blockbusters are so unbearably dull in their visuals, Fallen Kingdom retaining the style of a Gothic monster movie is as refreshing as it is gorgeous to take in. Also, it's definitely worth mentioning than the effects have improved significantly from Jurassic World, in large part due to the combination of CGI and animatronics and the darker pallete.Finally, I wish to discuss the film's ending and the character of Maisie, both of which have been under heavy scrutiny and both of which I loved. Isabella Sermon is one of the most endearing, ranged and talented child actresses I've seen since Danielle Harris and she does a phenomenal job handling her character's slow and methodical unraveling or her traumatizing origins. Maisie also brings real weight to the film's ethical question and a legitimate argument for why humanity shouldn't let the dinosaurs die. Maisie's creation as a clone was by all means unethical. However, this does not mean that killing or abandoning her would be the responsible decision to such an ethical mistake. This is why Maisie has to be the one to set them free into the world; she understands the ethical mistake behind their creation, but also that the murky ethical circumstances behind them is not necessarily their fault. She has an empathy for these creatures that none of the other humans do. The dinosaurs in Fallen Kingdom having much more in the way of characterization and personality already established the foundation for this argument and Maisie makes that argument all the more difficult to answer.If you had told me a year ago that I would be praising a Jurassic World sequel as the 2nd best in the entire franchise, I would have called you crazy. But, lo and behold...Here we are. I love this film to the point where I could defend it for hours. I love the themes, I love the performances, I love the characters, I love the effects. I loved it. I loved it. I'll keep saying it if you want me too.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
164,Alexander_Blanchett,Missed Opportunities,7,6 June 2018,"My most anticipated film of the last years and it was a let down. While ""Jurassic World"" was a great reboot/sequel and an absolute nostalic flashback this sequel had nothing of that and was just more or less milking the cow. Now don't get me wrong, its far from an awful movie but it is sad that it had so much potential and opportunities and missed a lot of that. 
The opening scene was absolutely AMAZING. I was thinking, wow this one will be stunning. Unfortunately that did not last long. The first half of the film was really rushed. No time for character development or even action development. It was like ""okay we have done this stunt, now the next one ... quick!"" The second half was better and served a nice setting for a Dino film ( kind of ""Night at the Museum"" atmosphere) One of the biggest reasons for why the film is not perfect is the really terrible screenplay. So many logic errors, so many loose ends. Not even a c-movie suffers from that. The only saving grace of the writing was the great development of Bryce Dallas Howard's character. While she was rather annoying and useless in the first part she really got something to do here and had some nice material to work with. Also her performance was quite tolerable. Chris Pratt however was boring and really uninteresting here. Justice Smith was a nice addition, while he appears to be annoying at first he really had some scene stealing moments. Daniella Pineda was also fine and it was good to see James Cromwell. Ted Levine was an absolute underdeveloped stereotype. Isabella Sermon was the absolute MVP in the acting area. Rafe Spall gave us an awful villain character. Poor performance. Toby Jones and Geraldine Chaplin were totally wasted. And dont get me started about this short and forgettable Jeff Goldblum cameo. 
Now to the most positive aspect: J.A. Bayona. He made the best out of the material and created a really amazing atmosphere. His images were absolutely great and he was able to create a true old fashioned monster movie. Really scary at times with some unforgettable scenes. 
The effects were also very good. I was a bit disappointed that the music score had almost no references to the original and not even to the first ""Jurassic World"" theme. That would have helped a lot. The editing was sometimes off. But the ending was really good and shows in what (potentially great) direction the third film will go. Its a nice watch and quite entertaining but missed the characteristics that made the other films so great.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
165,CANpatbuck3664,The Spectacle is Still Fun but Fallen Kingdom's Problems are all Self-Inflicted,5,23 June 2018,"Instead of another theme park, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom takes us in a new direction. The movie centres around the debate on whether these dinosaurs should be saved from an extinction level event. This is an interesting idea and an appreciated twist on the Jurassic Park formula. I did have issues with the idea that the dinosaurs should be saved (Jeff Goldblum returns as Dr. Ian Malcolm and he summed up my line of thinking in an all too brief appearance) but I did my best to keep my mind open. We do spend some time on the island but most of the movie is set on the mainland. The mission to save the dinosaurs isn't what it seems (which is obvious to everyone but the characters in the movie) and things spiral out of control from there. They also explore ideas in weaponizing these dinosaurs and what the implications of that would be (the original Jurassic World dipped their toes into that but Fallen Kingdowm dives into the pool). So as much as I didn't agree with the line of thinking the movie promotes, I did appreciate the attempt to bust out of the formula. Director J.A. Bayona comes from a horror background and one of the reasons I was rooting for this movie (he made A Monster Calls which was one of my favourite movies of 2016). One of the best aspects of Jurassic World 2 is that they do a good job of showing a more horrific side of these dinosaurs. The film is impressive between the visual effects and the cinematography and there are some really nice shots where the dinosaurs are presented like a monster in a horror movie. There was an interesting sequence where a carnivore is creeping through a tunnel and the light is flickering in and out. The movie is surprisingly violent for a film that you can bring your kids to and it had the right idea to bring the focus back to the potential danger that these creatures could possess. We all love watching dinosaurs but the context of what they would mean to the world is more accurately presented here.One of the things that makes Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom so disappointing is that the cast is so good across the board. Chris Pratt is charming and fun to watch even when he's dialed back the funny banter that you're used to seeing from him. I'm a fan of Bryce Dallas Howard and while despite the problems I had with her character from the first entry, she's just as good if not better in a more sympathetic turn as Claire. Rafe Spall comes out of the gate strong and just avoids descending into becoming a cartoon by the end. Danielle Pineda was so strong that one of my biggest disappointments about the movie was we didn't get to spend more time with her. James Cromwell is surprisingly warm as Benjamin Lockwood, Toby Jones is underused but effective and while I found his character unbearable, I credit Justice Smith for giving it his all as Franklin Webb. It was hard to stomach so many things in this movie. The pacing is all over the place, the first act is so slow and the 2nd act moves so fast that its here and gone (its especially disappointing when the trailer features so much of that surprisingly short sequence). While many critics praise the 3rd act, I thought it just fell into nonsense. There's some nice shots and the ideas that drive the plot are fresh for this franchise. But there's plot hole after plot hole and stupid sequence after stupid sequence, I was honestly shocked that someone didn't fix these problems while the script was being written let alone when it was filmed. One of the characters expects the villain to call the police on himself when there is no logical reason to do so (that's just one example of many). I saw this with a friend and over the course of the ride home, we must have come up with 10-15 separate issues. There's a bombshell dropped that's so bizarre and its never addressed again. Plus, there's a decision made at the end that could cause the deaths of so many people and it's the good guys that put these people in jeopardy. I can't go into it more without going into spoilers, there are movies that can distract you from logical leaps, but Fallen Kingdom just couldn't do it for me and it left me shaking my head.This is the most conflicted I've felt about a movie for a long time. There's plenty of good reasons to go see this movie. The big names in the cast all perform capably, there's some really creative cinematography, the action is decent, and they swung for the fences by taking the plot in a different direction. But I can't excuse the gigantic plot holes, the poor decisions by so many important characters, pacing problems and Fallen Kingdom can't hurdle the problems with the premise, let alone the ones that crop up over the course of the movie. If you can't stand the latest entry of the Jurassic Park franchise, I understand that line of thinking and if you can get around some of the obvious problems with Jurassic World 2 and enjoy it for what it is, I can see why. I have to split the difference and give this a 5/10. I can't recommend this though; the movie had become so unbelievable by the end that I was having to avoid snickering and laughing on the way out to the parking lot.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

This movie is terrible. Not tolerably terrible. Awful. Poorly made, laughable situations, and the silliest set up from a Frankenstein of other movies done better. Who is this J.A. Bayona tool?

169,dilipbts,Jurassic world fallen kingdom,8,19 June 2020,"It's probably too late to mention this, but do NOT watch the trailers. They spoil way, way too much. Many of the movie's best sequences, or at least fragments of them, are shown in the trailers. Several times I found myself thinking while watching the movie, ""I know where this is going because I saw a clip in the trailer.""Now I'll give a quick plot overview of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.After witnessing the carnage, chaos and death that ensued during the theme park's meltdown in the last movie, you may be wondering why any human would ever set foot on the island again. It's a very reasonable thought.In brief, all the dinosaurs on the island are going to become extinct after the island's volcano erupts. Nature is clearly trying to tell us something, right? Just let nature correct the mistake humans made in bringing back the most dangerous predators to ever exist. While we're thinking about the volcano, I'm also curious about why the founders of the park ever chose to build on an island with an active volcano that could wipe out all nearby life. Seems like poor planning. Also poor planning, is endangering human lives with a rescue mission to an island with an erupting volcano.Against all logic, operation: Save the dinos has its supporters. An animal protection group, headed by a less steely and less robotic Clair Deering (Bryce Dallas Howard), convinces a billionaire to fund a mission to rescue the dinosaurs.But, oh no! The team needs help tracking Blue, the last surviving raptor. Cue raptor trainer extraordinaire Owen Grady (Chris Pratt). Those two are joined by a paleo-veterinarian (apparently a real thing) and an annoying tech guy who is afraid of absolutely everything, including bugs and planes. As you can imagine, he does not hold up well around dinosaurs.I'm not sure why the scaredy-pants character was ever written into this movie. He's meant to provide comic relief, but isn't that why Chris Pratt is here? Pratt is actually funny, and he's wasted in this movie, relegated to a puppet of a character, who showcases none of the charismatic cool he demonstrated in the prior film.Beyond the obvious character development flaws, there is one unavoidable issue: I don't agree with their mission. How can I root for these heroes if they're doing something indisputably foolish? I love animals, but these particular animals have killed countless humans and will surely kill more. I cannot support risking more human lives for this mission.That's not the movie's only problem. For one, the directing is spotty. A few sequences will wow the viewers, as long as they haven't already seen these clips in the trailers. Director J.A. Bayona has a background in horror that becomes evident in this movie. He creates dingy lighting and makes clever use of shadows as dinosaurs approach their victims. When the dinosaurs fully reveal themselves, Bayona knows to focus the camera on teeth, claws and eyes--the scariest parts of the creatures.Some of the action is legitimately scary. Other times, it's cartoonish. One scene in particular feels like something you would see in Scooby-Doo.The issue with the action, other than being occasionally cartoonish, is how often in leans on callbacks to past Jurassic movies. Sure, the concepts are fun and well-executed, but we have seen them all before.Here we are at the fifth movie in the franchise, and the filmmakers are clearly out of fresh ideas. They're banking on fans flocking to see the movie solely because it has dinosaurs. I demand something more from my movies, and you should too.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

175,sweidman-28016,Really Disappointed,5,28 October 2018,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom Review:This is the new installment in the Jurassic Park series following Jurassic World, a movie that I thought was fine and entertaining but not amazing. I wasn't really excited to see the movie based on the trailers and I was right. This movie was a mess, but I'm going to save all of my problems for the end. Chris Pratt did a good job like he did in the last one. Same with Bryce Dallas Howard. She got a little more development which she definitely needed. The visuals were amazing. The sound was great except sometimes it was just loud for so long. It was entertaining sometimes. This movie was so disappointing. The director, J. A. Bayona, is such an amazing director. Some of his films included The Orphanage, A Monster Calls, and The Impossible. Naturally I was a bit excited for his directing. The directing was fine, it was just the screenplay. There were at least 10 different conflicts happening. If you've seen the latest trailer that is the movie. The first act was them deciding if they want to save the dinosaurs, which they end up going to Isla Nublar to get while the island is literally blowing up. As everybody knows, the people they were working with are bad and then there's another conflict. There was a really nice scene with them trying to run away with the dinosaurs while the island is blowing up. The second act slowed down a bit like the beginning of the first act. The main antagonist, who was such a bad character, is trying to sell the dinosaurs and made a new dinosaur which is bad just like in Jurassic World. Meanwhile there's some drama with his family and this little girl who loves dinosaurs. The little girl, played by Isabella Sermon, was good except I hated her character. The third act was probably my favorite because that's when the director got to show his horror skills like he did with his movie The Orphanage. That act just reminded me of Luigi's Mansion. I found it to be tense and I got invested a little. There was a part during it where there was some weird ass plot twist with the family that I thought was dumb. The very end was horrible. A dumb choice was made just to set up for the next one. And that's it. The plot just reminded me of Jurassic Park: The Lost World like there wasn't much effort in the script. There was one character named Franklin Webb, played by Justice Smith, who was the worst character. He's literally scared of everything and that's it about him. He did literally 2 things in that movie to help with the plot. This is just me being picky but the title sequence was dumb and looked like it was made by a YouTuber. I don't want to go into spoilers so I'm just going to end it here. Fallen Kingdom is a movie with some good characters, a good director, amazing visuals and sound with a really messy screenplay that ruined the movie.My Grade: C",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

So I wasn't particularly excited about Jurassic World, though it was well done and felt like a nice almost reboot, but still did not live up to the original. I came back mostly for Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt, who are good leads. This movie feels like it has some parallels to the original trilogy, and looks great/is well done. It's very tense, and there are some attempts at new stuff, especially with the volcano eruption. Mostly though, the ending got me more excited for the future. The original trilogy felt like it was teasing Pterodactyls at the end of the first but they didn't actually show up until the third movie.

178,rocknrelics,Junk!,1,7 June 2020,"Thought I'd give this a go on TV tonight. Well, what a dreadful film, made for those with a short attention span, just a noisy series of flashy CGI visuals, with a weak plot. Utterly awful.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
179,Offworld_Colony,I'm sorry to say that it's immediately obvious that this film does not even feel as if it belongs in the same universe as Jurassic Park...,4,12 February 2020,"...with cheap, poorly constructed set pieces with none of the tension of a well built Spielbergian sequence and crass and dodgy exposition-filled dialogue. With the first Jurassic Park, Spielberg allowed exposition to come through character moments, it was very elegant, even when it was obvious it was fun, when the action needed idiots for fodder it was motivated but not such here.
The set design is possibly the only thing this film has going for it, and I suppose I'm a fan of the two leads and Justice Smith, there's good chemistry even if there isn't any good characterisation at all, the new characters are dropped in as if this is season 2 of a show and we already know who they are entirely.
The music is awful and the visual effects are mostly terrible. The script feels like it was written by someone with English as a second language. And there are so many glaring plot holes and inconsistencies and stupid and contrived decisions that it's impossible to enjoy even the littlest bit.
I mean this with the greatest respect to the medium, but Fallen Kingdom is every bit like the cutscenes of a Jurassic Park videogame. It's as if the license has been given to an inferior third party. I could almost see the HUD overlay.
And I'm not even going to touch the utterly lore-shattering and franchise-imploding use of cloning. Oh dear.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
180,Dragonborn64,The Worst One of the Franchise,6,2 September 2020,"The set up to the next movie is interesting but this one in itself is definitely the weakest link of the entire franchise.

181,alcantaraj-16594,AN UNDERRATED GOOD FILM,7,8 September 2018,"I really think that this good movie, ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"" should've been titled ""Jurassic Mansion."" Here's whyThe movie is divided into two. 1.)The good part - the part where the dinos need to be rescued from their island's volcano. (I loved this part despite the fact that its outcome was sort of spoiled by the trailers) 2.) The part in the mansion. I actually liked this second half but I do think the filmakers thought that this was A+ material when its actually a B material. I'd also like to say that the part where the brachiosaurus died broke my heart. IT GOT ME! Also, Franklin the comic relief is mostly composed of boring dialog. Do I recommend it? YES!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

184,stevenrotherforth,The Lost World with better special effects?,6,10 June 2018,"Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom Is it just me or are many franchise movies copying the recipe of their original classic?
The Force Awakens bared a uncanny resemblance to the original Star Wars. 
Jurassic World had a similar formula to Jurassic Park.
This latest instalment entitled the Fallen Kingdom could be the long lost twin of The Lost World.
Let me explain.
Heroes reluctantly need to go back to the island with dinosaurs on it. There's lots of running and screaming, people get eaten before the dinosaurs are taken from the island.
They're transported back to the mainland where more carnage ensues. I'm pretty sure that was the plot of The Lost World and it definitely is the plot of this latest offering.
However this doesn't make JW2 a bad movie. There's lots of fun to be had here.
The opening sequence being one of if not the best openings of the entire franchise.J.A. Bayona was an excellent choice to direct this movie but you kind of get the feeling he has been kept on a leash by the Studio and forced to make their kind of movie rather than his own.
A shame as there's hints of his brilliance peppered throughout.Fallen Kingdom follows the Lost World in terms of the best part of both movies take place on the island.
When the dinos are brought back to our civilisation that's when both movies fall apart.
There's elements of the script that just don't work.
Caging dinos under a mansion to then auction them off is a positively ludicrous idea.
As is the idea to weaponise dinosaurs. This plot point is carried over from the first Jurassic World. It's a silly idea. Have we ever tried to weaponise Great White sharks or tigers?
Also the premise of taking the dinos from the island and transporting them all the way back to the USA seems ludicrous to me when there's a perfect habitat for the creatures on the neighbouring island.
After all they were bred there!
JW2 goes from hyper exciting thrill ride to ludicrousness.
Despite this the entire movie is still an immensely enjoyable experience.
Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are superb together and additional cast members are all worth their paycheques.
The plot maybe stretching the realms of believability but hey ho just shove some popcorn into your mouth and go along with it.
There's a volcano on the island that was dormant and now for the convenience of this story it's now active again.
I'm sure a multi billion dollar corporation would have checked this out before spending millions on putting a Dino theme park there but whatever just eat more popcorn.Never have the dinosaurs looked more effective than in this movie.
We have reached a point with CGI that if your budget is big enough then anything is possible.
The texture of the creatures skin, the lifelike glint in their eyes convinces the audience that what they're seeing is real.
This movie is worth watching on a IMAX screen just for the first fifteen minutes.
JW2 is a stunning achievement in terms of technical effects.
Both CGI and Animatronics have reached a new high.
Shame then that more attention wasn't given to the plot.
It's a tremendously silly film but one I thoroughly enjoyed.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
185,LloydBayer,Fallen Kingdom lacks the heft to stand out in the franchise but has enough bite for a monster movie.,6,6 June 2018,"It's no coincidence to say that around the time Michael Crichton conceived the idea of bringing dinosaurs back to life, a sheep was born at a biotech institute somewhere in Scotland, but without biological parents. Asking which came first is as debatable as the chicken and the egg conundrum but the fact remains that 25 years on, the concept of cloning is as progressive in the real world as it is in cinema. In that line of thought, Crichton's 1993 cinema adaptation - Jurassic Park - finds itself cloned for the fifth time but as it turns out, what was once artificially magical is now organically ordinary. Fallen Kingdom's basic setup is to take the audience back to Isla Nublar, where after the pandemonium in the last film Jurassic World, dinosaurs now roam freely in a theme park decimated and reclaimed by nature; and nature is very angry. With the island now volcanically active, all the dinosaurs face extinction from the imminent eruption. Not again! That satire is kicked up a notch with a grand cameo from Jeff Goldblum, who besides cutting the ribbon for this 25th anniversary celebration, adds a bit of franchise nostalgia and insight into what is about to happen. The plan is to relocate the dinosaurs to a new island and who better than John Hammond's chum Sir Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell) to hire Claire and Owen to get the job done. Simple as it sounds but where's the fun if everything goes according to plan? There's more to the story that's best left for the audience to discover but that's all you need to know about the plot. What follows is an action packed first act followed by a sluggish middle section topped off in a finale that's a bit dark and whacky. Has anything changed since the last film? Not much but Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire isn't trying to outrun dinosaurs in stilettos anymore. On the other hand, Chris Pratt reprises his charming role as Owen but is nowhere near as funny as Star-Lord. Together, and like the last film, their onscreen chemistry is as palatable as a dollop of ice-cream on a sizzling steak. The real meat, literally and figuratively, is the dinosaurs and they've never looked better. From the terrific underwater opening montage, to Owen's fully grown raptor friend Blue, to the film's new and ferocious hybrid called 'Indoraptor', Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is at its best when there's a dinosaur on screen. To that effect, a staggering scene where a Brachiosaurus looks at the audience while the island implodes on itself is worth mentioning as the film's most memorable moment. As much as there's a lot of mayhem and fun in the film, Fallen Kingdom lacks the heft to stand out in the franchise. That's a bit of a letdown for anyone expecting a worthy homage to the original. Having said that, the introduction of a new character, along with and an interesting plot development suggests vast potential in giving the franchise a new twist. If Dolly the Sheep went on to deliver six lambs, then there's no reason Crichton's beloved dinosaur epic won't see a sixth installment. For now, it suffices to say that although Fallen Kingdom isn't anywhere near extraordinary, it still has enough bite to officiate the 2018 summer movie mania.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

187,p-jonsson,Meh!,5,2 November 2018,"As a kid dinosaurs was one of my great interests. Thus I was so thrilled by the first Jurassic Park movie, which I thought then, and still think today, is a great movie. Sadly the following movies have been a mixed bag to say the least.This movie falls in the ""that was disappointing"" category I am afraid. It is obviously that however wrote the story was a lazy bugger that simply rehashed old bits and standard Hollywood cheap concepts and then added some frustrating preaching to it.The two scenes, one at the beginning and one in the end, where Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) was just sitting and ranting on and on was enough by itself to drag down the movie a star or two. We get it, however wrote that crap do not like gene science. Then go and write a piece in a science journal or something. Oh wait, it would not have been excepted since there was no science in it, just ranting mixed up with poorly hidden religious beliefs. So instead you had to go and ruin a movie which was meant to simply entertain.The we have the rest of the story. The best, or should I say the kindest, word for describing it would be ""predictable"". How many times are we going to do the big company captures animals for profit story? At least try to put some intelligence in the plot if you have to rehash it over and over again. It has even been done before in the same franchise for Christ sake!I would lie if I did not say that I found, at least, some entertainment watching the movie though. But pretty much all of it came from watching the scenery and the special effects. They at least were pretty good. But then I do like big monsters stomping around wreaking havoc and eating people, especially when it is the bad guys.There were some parts that was rather funny. I think Christ Pratt, and most of the other actors as well for that matter, did a fairly good job out of the lousy script. The idea of using a Stygimoloch to break free was quite cool and the havoc he wreaked somewhat funny. The part where Wheatley stop in the middle of all the chaos to extract a tooth as a bloody trophy was just silly though.The end scenes was just frustrating. However wrote that ought to be shot. A few dinosaurs escape and then the conclusion is that humanity have to live side by side with dinosaurs from then one. What a load of rubbish!Sadly, despite the genre being a favorite of mine and the special effects being pretty good, this film did not make it for me due to the unintelligent and lazy script.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
188,room102,"Borefest, only for the fans of the series",4,7 June 2018,"I was never a fan of the Jurassic Park series. I didn't even think much of the original. Each of the movies in the series has the most basic plot you can think of - and it's rehashed here for the 5th time.Dinosaurs are in danger, humans try to rescue them, they escape and chase humans, happy ending.All the rehashed elements are here: Dinosaurs run, dinosaurs roar, dinosaurs chase humans. Plot is kept to a minimum.Bryce Dallas Howard can't act if her life was dependent on it, she's simply the most generic actor possible. Chris Pratt, usually a charismatic actor, is flat and almost transparent here - I really got the feeling he did it just for the money.There are endless possible drinking game with this movie: Drink every time someone is in danger so he stops and slowly looks at it instead of running; drink every time someone says: ""run""; drink every time someone is raising his hand to control/slow a dinosaur.So... boring... and so long. During the movie I looked at the clock and couldn't believe there's still a full hour to go. I think the people were happy this movie was finally over.The theme seems to rip off Joseph LoDuca's theme to ARMY OF DARKNESS (1992) (which was also ripped off in GODZILLA (1998)).",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
189,Mike_Devine,A fall from the 'Jurassic' glory days,5,14 July 2018,"Three years after things went south at the wildly popular 'Jurassic World,' we get to experience a new adventure with Owen Grady and Claire Dearing in J.A. Bayona's 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.' While this was billed as one of the event films of 2018, it quickly becomes clear that 'Kingdom' is inferior to its predecessor in many ways.We quickly get sucked back into the perils of the park in the opening scene, and from there a new story is born. Many wondered where things could pick up after the events of 'World,' and so the concept in 'Kingdom' is probably one of the most logical options they had to work with (rescuing surviving dinosaurs before Isla Nublar blows its core). However, once we're about halfway through the film, we reach a jumping off point that's hard to recover from. It's fair to say the events that take place on the island are the highlights of the film, and everything that happens thereafter is a major disappointment.Sure, the wonky chemistry between Chris Pratt's and Bryce Dallas Howard's lead characters makes up for some of the ridiculousness, but it's not enough. Even the cameos from Jeff Goldblum's Ian Malcolm are kind of ""meh."" The new cast introduced here - Justice Smith and Daniella Pineda as two dino-loving sidekicks, the former being more comic relief, James Cromwell as the wealthy financier of much of the research responsible for events since 'Jurassic Park,' Rafe Spall as the estate custodian with ulterior motives - are not all that impactful. Isabella Sermon makes her debut as the granddaughter of Cromwell's Lockwood, and is one of the bright lights in an otherwise dark story.But it's the dinosaurs who really run the show here, from everyone's favorite raptor, Blue, to the unassumingly lovable stygimoloch to pretty terrifying lab-created beasts like the indoraptor. The scenes that feature these creatures are definitely engaging and are worth the price of admission, as the CGI is on-point and one of the highlights of 'Kingdom.' But again, this is rarely enough to carry a movie.Despite a lot of hype and expectations, 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' falls far below where it should be, as its predictability doesn't do it any favors. Although there is setup for further adventures, it's hard to see a case where we can get back to the glory days of this franchise.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

191,thomasjay-2201,A bit bland,6,8 March 2019,I'm about and hour fresh off watching this film and to be honest I'm struggling to recount what happened. As a film it's better than the initial 'Jurassic World' but unsurprisingly hasn't made even a touch on the original. It's pace is very very odd feeling slightly boring yet also having so much going off. It's been a while since seeing the previous one so maybe that didn't help but I found this to be averag eat best offering little charm and mainly aiming for spectacle which isn't necessarily an issue but just doesn't have much else going for it so ultimately far from the best but not a bad film,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

194,kgprophet,Slowly but Finally Getting Off the Island,6,26 June 2018,"From the very beginning in the very first Jurassic Park, there was an implied story arc that eventually dinosaurs would get off the island and wreak havoc upon civilization. We only got a glimpse of how exciting that would be at the end of ""The Lost World"". For this go round, thankfully a few other wrinkles are added to mix it up a bit. Part of that is the animals get off the island. In this case it is the crux of the first act, a volcano is about to erupt, we must prevent these dinosaurs from being killed. That is the patchwork to reunite the leads Chris Pratt and Bryce Howard. It also provides a cameo for Jeff Goldblum. Many action set-pieces were drawn up for this film. Many of them have good shock moments. Following along are two college-aged kids. They are given things to do but are flimsy as characters. Less successful are the set of characters surrounding an old estate. We learn that there is an underground dinosaur facility there. Really, for the movie's sake, is all you really need to know as it becomes the center of the third act. However, we are given a dying billionaire, a housekeeper/surrogate mom, a granddaughter, and the designated greedy corporate bad guy. But these characters, other than the bad guy, are not directly connected with the storyline up to this point. They are tossed in to create set-pieces, or at least artificially manufacture some heart tugging emotional moments (that don't work). Most reviews I looked over mentions that the sheer excitement factor of the action set-pieces makes it enough to enjoy going to see this film in the theatre. Yes and no. Most would agree that it is possible to put human emotion into a dinosaur film as demonstrated by the very first Jurassic Park. This script has obvious moments that feel slapped together to take us to the next set-piece. As for the excitement level in the action scenes, I would say about half of them gave you a good jolt. The other dinosaur attacks are now starting to get old, now on the 5th iteration of this kind of film. Through the years, other films have brought us CGI monsters, and one wonders how much shock value these kind of dinosaur attacks still hold. The action that creates the most excitement are based on other hazards (lava, water, explosions). There are moments that are supposed to tug your heart, but I wasn't moved. I suppose the conclusion about whether to see this film is to stick to the standard line ""leave your brain at the door and you will have a fun time"". Meant as a roller coaster ride, it is too bad since the original Jurassic Park had a lot more substance.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

It has bad men who work hard, accomplish nothing due to bad luck. At times characters die, not because of some great moment, but because a trained mercenary decides to enter a cage of an animal who is asleep, only to awaken at a key moment. That's this ENTIRE movie.It's a bad movie with the name Jurassic in it. Decent plot, actors with bad motivations and not a whole lot of characters to pull for.

197,shawneofthedead,"Surprisingly brave and thoughtful as massive blockbusters go, though there are moments that will sorely test your patience.",7,6 June 2018,"When it comes to gigantic blockbuster franchises, the law of diminishing returns typically applies. Each new film somehow manages to be bigger and dumber, while also offering audiences pretty much the same experience that raked in the box-office bucks in the first place. That's why Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom comes as a pleasant surprise. It's far from perfect, with a screenplay that veers between breathtaking and breathtakingly silly. But there's a lot of thought and quite a bit of bravery invested in everything on display: from story, character and thematic development, to where this dino-driven series can go in the future.On the surface, the plot is simple enough: Isla Numbar, the theme-park island left abandoned in Jurassic World, is facing an existential crisis. A volcano is about to erupt, threatening to take with it the dinosaurs now roaming freely all over the island. Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), now a dinosaur rights activist, convinces former dino trainer Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) to return to Isla Numbar and save what dinosaurs they can, including (but especially) fan-favourite velociraptor Blue. Before long, they find themselves entangled not in a rescue operation, but in an utterly grim, cynical criminal enterprise.It doesn't sound particularly groundbreaking, but what works refreshingly well is how Fallen Kingdom approaches the serious moral questions raised by the very premise of the entire Jurassic Park franchise. What happens when human beings play God, and bring dinosaurs back to life? How far can we push this power to manipulate genetic destiny? And do human beings have an ethical duty to preserve and protect a species that, by all the laws of nature, shouldn't even exist?Fallen Kingdom doesn't just flirt with these questions, as its predecessors did. It places them squarely in the foreground, however uncomfortable this may become for the film's characters or audiences. Throughout its far stronger first half, the film continually asks us to ponder issues of complicity and responsibility in a complex world. It pushes the original idea behind Jurassic Park - a new-found ability to literally resurrect the past - to its logical conclusion, and asks again and again what happens when the things humans create take on lives of their own.The film also benefits from director J.A. Bayona's remarkable ability to balance the epic and the intimate, as showcased so expertly in his tsunami drama, The Impossible. At its best, Fallen Kingdom serves up grand moments so startlingly effective in emotional terms that they might make you cry - whether it's Blue being, briefly, betrayed; or the sight of Isla Numbar retreating in the distance, the fiery backdrop for a sole dinosaur as it rages against the dying of the light. There's a truly eye-popping technical masterpiece of a scene that features humans and dinosaurs tumbling down a landscape ravaged by flame and fire. But the top-notch visual effects aren't the point. It's what the scene means, how it makes audiences feel - hearts lodging in throats at the prospect of innocent lives lost.As much as Bayona deserves credit for unearthing the heart and humanity in Fallen Kingdom, the screenplay by Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly deserves some praise too. It contains some canny decisions that strengthen the franchise and its characters going forward. Claire, in particular, actually evolves - once the park's by-the-books operations manager, she is now a badass activist who dares to fight for what she believes is right. There's a great deal of potential, too, to the new character of Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon), the plucky young granddaughter of one of Jurassic Park's co-founders.It's a shame that the film slips into dumb and dumber territory in its second half. There are a couple of excellent moments, dripping with the tension and horror of Bayona's chilling directorial debut, The Orphanage. You can see what Bayona is going for: the appealing notion of turning dinosaurs into the proverbial monsters under the bed, a menace that could come for you in the safety of your own home. In this regard, the film's new hybrid dinosaur - the Indoraptor - takes centre stage, although it doesn't have quite the personality or appeal of either Blue or the iconic Tyrannosaurus Rex.But Fallen Kingdom shrinks into itself once the action is transposed from the island to the Lockwood mansion. The nuance and depth of the first half largely disappears. Instead, the film ends up trading in the kind of huge, intelligence-free action sequences that belong in a lesser sequel - from characters (and dinosaurs) plunging in and out of bedrooms and across a shatter-friendly glass roof, to mercenary Ken Wheatley's (Ted Levine) final encounter with the Indoraptor.The film also makes some narrative choices that seem silly even on paper, much less on screen. Daniella Pineda's spunky Zia Rodriguez is a fun addition as a paleoveterinarian - except she's never encountered a dinosaur in her entire life. (Why didn't they just make her a former Jurassic World employee, like Owen?) Similarly, the screenwriters demonstrate a bizarre disconnect from the real world when they put prices on the rescued dinosaurs - still insanely rare for being history made flesh - and come up with paltry amounts like $10 million each. (What criminal hijinks can you carry out for that amount of money?!) It makes the film's avaricious antagonists, Eli Mills (Rafe Spall) and Gunnar Eversoll (Toby Jones), come across as pantomime villains instead of criminal masterminds.For the most part, however, Fallen Kingdom works. For a summer blockbuster, it's surprisingly thoughtful in examining the human - and dinosaur - condition. Its second half doesn't quite live up to the promise of the first, but it's still a fun enough romp. And the film ends as boldly as it begins. In completely re-calibrating the relationship between humans and dinosaurs in its final act, Fallen Kingdom doesn't just make a sequel welcome - it makes one necessary.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
198,DeBBss,Jurassic World: An Utter Disappointment,4,1 July 2018,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom had a decent and entertaining trailer, but sometimes the trailer can be totally different than the movie, and this movie proves it. The trailer hides what this movie really is. All the scenes in the Jurassic Park island in the trailer is all that you get; literally, I'm not joking. I know that all movies nowadays are for cash grabs, but this movie is the cherry on top. They could've ended the Jurassic Park series with Jurassic World, but no, they have to add on one more, just for the money. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom shouldn't of exist. The story is just insane; yeah lets save the dinosaurs that killed thousands of people, that's a great idea. The story just proves that the writers ran out of ideas, so they just stuff in a ridiculous plot. I'm really disappointed with this movie. I'm a huge fan of Jurassic Park, and to see this franchise go down this path really makes me sad.Story: 3/10The biggest complaint I have with this movie is the lack of realism. No one would begin a movement to save the dinosaurs from an exploding island; maybe it would slightly make sense if they only brought back the herbivores, but still that's too dangerous. The pacing was really weird too. The movie starts off quick, and we get straight to the island, but we only get to see the island for about 15-30 min, which is short due to the fact that most of the Jurassic Park movies are set mostly on the island. Then for the last hour and a half we're in a mansion, and then the pacing is very long. So the story starts off quick, then ends long. This movie is a cliche-fest too; the good guy is actually a bad guy, all the villains die, and all the good guys live. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is very predictable; take everything that you saw from all the Jurassic Park movies and add them up, you get Jurassic Park: Fallen Kingdom. Jurassic Park: Fallen Kingdom has no original ideas. We get the Indo-Raptor, which is just a copied idea from Jurassic World, but this time it's less awesome than the Indominus Rex. Then we get the hunter guy, who was outsmarted by a dinosaur, which was straight ripped out of the original. Overall, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is just a remake of all the Jurassic Park movies. Everything was predictable and cliche, and the story was just stupid.Characters: 5/10We get two characters from Jurassic World, Owen and Claire; they're pretty much the same, but Owen feels a bit more boring. Then the new Characters, Franklin and Zia. Franklin and Zia are just stereotypes and unoriginal. Franklin is the nerd that doesn't have any people skills and hates nature. Zia is the strong and fearless character, she's pretty much the exact opposite than Franklin, and we see these duos all the time in movies. There's two main bad guys, Eli and Ken. Eli is the greedy character. Eli is such a cliche character, he's a good guy on the outside and a bad guy on the outside; I really don't know if it was supposed to be a surprise when we find out that he's a bad guy, but it was really predictable. Ken is the hunter/leader of the operation. Ken is such a terrible character, he's pretty much a repeat of Hoskins from Jurassic World, but more boring. Ken even has a predictable death, his death is a remake of Muldoon's death (Muldoon is the guy that says ""Clever girl""). Overall, all the characters are cliches and just straight out boring. Action: 6/10For a Jurassic World/Park movie, we really don't see that much dinosaurs. We really only see dinosaurs at the beginning and at the end. We do see dinosaurs quite frequently, but they're all in cages. We primarily see carnivores fighting people, and we only see dinosaur versus dinosaur about three times in the movie. The CGI is okay for a 2018 movie, but some scenes looked really fake. One thing that really bothered me was that we really only saw the Mosasaurus (Fish dinosaur) twice; at the beginning and at the end. If there was more Mosasaurus scenes, then I'd appreciate this movie a bit more. There wasn't that much action involved in this movie. Most of the time spent in this movie is just setting up what's going to happen in the movie, but we already know what's going to happen, because this movie is predictable. Overall, there wasn't that much action, there wasn't enough dinosaurs, and the CGI was below average.Overall, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom was a huge disappointment. Everything that I wanted in this movie wasn't there, and everything I didn't want was there. This movie really didn't feel like a Jurassic Park/World movie. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom fails in a lot of different factors, like the comedy. There wasn't a lot of comedy, but when there was comedy, it wasn't funny. The director wasn't the problem, it was the writers. The writers completely ran out of idea, so they have to produce this garbage. I think newcomers in this franchise would enjoy this movie, but long-time fans are going to be disappointed.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

I can hear Chris Pratt's face saying ""Why am i even in this thing?""No meaningful story, super lame side characters and just very very boring in general.

No need really to explain it all since I see a lot of reviews here that touch on everything I would point out anyway (plus some new ones I hadn't noticed) and there's no reason to keep beating this dead horse.This movie just is so full of plot holes it is ridiculous, and they are obvious ones too.

201,gavinp9,"Starting to overstay it's welcome, but still - dinosaurs!",6,20 June 2018,"'Jurassic Park 5' starts pretty well, with the giant crocodile thing & sense of foreboding doom, as we're reintroduced to Isla Nublar and what's happened to the abandoned park in the last three years. Both Claire (Dallas Howard) & Owen (Pratt) are brought back in to help rescue the dinosaurs - basically it's a mash up of the plots of JP2 & JP3. My only wish for the film - we see dinosaurs kill over five humans...They try to bring back Ian Malcolm (Goldblum), but he's given far too little screen time, as are the new sidekicks - Franklin (Smith), Zia (Pineda) & Maisie (Sermon). You sort of get to know them, and then they're hardly used. The same could almost be said of Pratt, who almost seems a passenger in the film, basically phoning it in. Cromwell and Jones are likewise great actors underutilised. The only one who plays his part with relish is Eli (Spall), the profiteer. There's some good scenes - and a few frights done well where I had to clap - but overall, I'm left feeling that the film didn't really add anything to the franchise or story. Sure, we get to see plenty of dinosaurs (including a stegosaurus, yay!) for a few minutes, but mostly its's spent in a weird CGI-castle. The ""bad guy"" is another genetically-improved raptor (didn't that happen last film?) and there's plenty of what I'm sure the director hopes are call-backs, but just seem lazy. I don't like how they only pull out the T. Rex when convenient. Still, there was at least 10 people eaten by dinosaurs, so it's not all bad...",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

203,PoisonKeyblade,My Favorite Since Jurassic Park,10,6 June 2018,"Three years ago, we were gifted with the new franchise entry Jurassic World, a film that broke records and stole my heart. It was a beautiful love letter to the original films, deeply rooted in nostalgia, but it also amped up the action and gave us a new set of characters to fall in love with. I loved every minute of it, and never wanted it to end.Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a completely new monster. This carries the basic DNA of what we expect from a Jurassic movie, but takes it to crazy new heights, relying very little on nostalgia or setup from earlier installments. New director J.A. Bayona brings a new perspective to the sweeping action set pieces and a dark, riveting tone that isn't present in any of the other franchise entries. The ensemble cast, including Chris Pratt's charismatic Owen Grady, Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire Dearing, and (my personal favorite) newcomer Isabella Sermon's Maisie Lockwood, all bring something to the table that fits together in a nice cohesive way thanks to a lot of onscreen chemistry. Maisie is the anchor of film's twisty story, and she is just downright adorable unlike some of the annoying children this series is known for. Depending on how you look at it, the real stars are the dinosaurs and special effects, which are the best they've ever been. This one feels like a love letter to the dinosaurs themselves in more than one respect. Best of all, though: this might be my favorite sequel since the original Jurassic Park.The opening sequence alone made me fall in love with the film almost immediately, already setting up the scarier tone and feel. This movie has such a large scope that it dwarfs any other Jurassic film in that way. It just feels bigger, and of course it's extremely entertaining. The action pace is nonstop, but Bayona also gifts us with beautiful and tender shots (there's one in particular that broke my heart) and great character beats. The claustrophobic setting of the film's second half is atmospheric gothic horror meets creature feature. It's something I never thought I would say about any Jurassic film, but it felt exciting and new and certainly nothing like what we've seen previously.Fallen Kingdom is a dark, explosive blockbuster that takes the series in an exciting new direction and I absolutely loved it. It expands the scope of the series in such a way that it feels like there is so much more story left to tell here. I can't wait to see it again, and I can't wait to see where this series will go next.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Film of Choice this morning at The Plaza Dorchester Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Like Gods, man interfered to bring back the dinosaurs and their arrogance gives them reason to believe they can manipulate the natural order to their own means. As in previous outings to Jurassic Park and in the words of Dr Malcolm..... 'life finds a way'. This latest instalment of the hugely popular film series takes us back to Isla Nubla ostensibly to rescue the dinosaurs from a volcano, but hey that's not really going to get bums on seats is it? Throw in some bad guys with an ulterior motive, a crazy scientific dude who is torn between the love and passion of his developmental work and the dirty dollar, mix it up with an elderly man and his granddaughter, some kick ass special effects and the relationship between Chris Pine and his velociraptor Blue and you have a pretty darn good film. Touching at times we see a different side to the dinosaurs and are introduced to yet another new hybrid which proves biggest is not always baddest. As we came to the final scenes of the film we are left with a line that could either end the franchise or leave it wide open for another instalment, I personally want more!!!!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
207,kermitkid,It's a dinosaur! It's a dinosaur!,8,31 March 2020,"In every ""Jurassic"" movie there are 2 certainties. The T-Rex is always built up until at least the second half, and the T-Rex will show up at the very end, usually saving the main human characters in what I've dubbed ""Deus Rex Machina"". This ""Jurassic"" installment breaks the mold by having neither. (Good. These films were starting to get a bit predictable.) Parts of it still feel a bit too familiar, mostly because the first half of the film is essentially a remake of ""The Lost World"" Jurassic Park movie, and some of the ""twists"" are really, really stupid, even for this franchise. And yes, there are a lot of really dumb decisions made by the characters. The action sequences are edge-of-your seat, the danger and stakes have been upped significantly, and the second half turns this from action movie into horror movie, and it is intense! The CGI really needs to stop though. The first ""Jurassic Park"" looks better than this, and that came out in 1993. After watching ""Park"" and then this, the CGI really stands out in a bad way. They really need to go back to using practical effects. This is still a very fun movie, despite being more of the same, and I'd say it's at least worth a rent.

208,mgd_m,You are warned,1,14 February 2019,"Possibly this is the worst movie I've ever watched. I just can't believe they produced such trash of a story. Though I was not a fan of the previous chapter, it was fun and entertaining. This one is just nonsense from top to bottom. There's no suspension of disbelief allowed, because it would be too much insulting for your own intelligence. I don't want to spoiler anything, but... C'mon!! I guess it's good for an 8 years old maybe. You will find out if you dare watching it. Also, the supporting characters are dull, the humor is gone, and it's the same old, same old heroes vs. evil businessmen. Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom will always keep a place in my heart for the egregious disaster it is. And I agree with what another reviewer said, Imdb has to start moderating the obviously fake reviews.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
209,rollernerd,It's all about Blue,7,13 January 2021,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018) where it is now three years after the disastrous events at the Jurassic World theme park and the island of Isla Nublar is abandoned by humans with the dinosaurs roaming free. This all changes when the island's dormant volcano starts to slowly erupt, which threatens to destroy the occupants of the island.We are back on the island along with Claire played by Bryce Dallas Howard, the heroine of the previous film who is no longer wearing heels in this flick and is ready to do anything to save the dinosaurs from the dying island. We also have the raptor wrangler Owen Grady played by Chris Pratt, who is trying to reconnect with the raptor Blue. Their rescue mission of the dinosaurs from extinction results into a double cross, a few twists and turns which eventually leads to bringing the expected chaos and disruption to the natural order of the entire planet. In Ian Malcolm's words, ""Life has found a way, again.""This second chapter of the Jurassic World series is an interesting contribution to the overall arc of the series, where we have the known concept of genetics which helped give dinosaurs new life but this time, we see creating a human. Spoiler free alert, the human person who doesn't know they were made in the science lab, makes this very intriguing. Pratts performance is again solid but is shown more of an Indiana Jones mixed in with a human super hero like character. He has an awesome scene with dinosaur other than Blue, which makes you think - is Owen a dinosaur whisperer?? Great comedic timings with his co-stars and great to put him in the action from escaping the volcano erupting to interrupting a black-market campaign.We have a cool cameo with Jeff Goldblum returning briefly as Dr. Ian Malcolm, who keeps telling everyone the risks of mucking around with mother nature but as usual since the very first film, no one listens. The CGI in this sequel is amazing and I am not just talking about the dinosaurs but the whole volcano eruption scene was entertaining with the filmmakers providing stunning visuals. The sequel continues this line of uneasy relationships between man and predator, which isn't bad and we can see this with how the franchise is leaning on Blue, the heroine of this film. On the negative side, as mentioned there are a few surprises however you can tell them by a mile away, but this shouldn't sway you away from the movie. The movie ends and leads the story arc to new possibilities by finally bringing the prehistoric animals with the current animal kingdom. That scene with the lion and T-Rex was awesome.A fast-paced action with a few cool emotional moments, which rushes character development however what more can you do with so many characters and so many plot threads? The filmmakers did well with the execution of the film with great imagination along with the ethical question of cloning. Overall, 7.8/10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
210,Mcduff3601,"nothing special, but it is fun and less dumb than the previous one",7,22 July 2018,"I really didn't like the first Jurassic World there were too many little things like Byrce's choice to wear high heels, the raptor dynamic was too unbelievable some of the character development was questionable. In this one it was all surface level stuff. They stripped out everything that didn't work in the last one and just stuck with the action and watching dinosaurs do their thing. Totally left open for another one and as long as it's on the same caliber as this one I would watch it, with lowered expectations. If I had to rank them, it would be the 1st Jurassic Park, This one Fallen Kingdom, The Lost World, and a tie between Jurassic Park 3 and Jurassic World (both were stinkers).",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
211,CountJonnie,Specifically designed and enhanced to annoy the viewer,5,10 June 2018,"Jurassic World follows the same people who have the same relationships, have the same actions against the same enemies. There, that's it. Below I'll give some of the many cons that make this a disappointment on various levels.Jurassic World follows the same heroes, who are hired to transport the dinosaurs to save them from extinction, which seems noble. Of course, the rich benefactor has a handsome employee who betrays the heroes, for.....money. While at it, there is a child who somehow discovers secrets, escapes from dinosaurs, and even looks like Newt from Aliens. Her subplot which might be interesting just got forgotten.Further: the people are evil and threat the dinosaurs like dirt. The main dinosaur is just the same as the previous, except of course for genetic alteratioms that make him faster, smarter and sadistic. Some bad guys get disposed off in predictable (feel good) ways and ""Blue"" saves the day multiple times, so nothing new here.I would love to say that the effects were perfect and they were. But the time where good effects were impressive, are in the 90's. Great effects are the standards. Praise should be deserved for something else, like story, characterwork, development. All of which are not present here, or they are a direct copy of the previous movie. Good that people enjoy this film, but how this can be rated higher than a 6, is beyond my understanding, which stopped after the 2nd movie which was the last great one.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
212,Thrashman88,Surprisingly Good Sequel.,7,5 November 2018,"I was expecting an equally bland movie like the last ""Jurassic World"", but was pleased to be surprised with this new take on the Jurassic franchise. While no new territory is being explored, this installment of the dinosaur franchise is more sympathetic to its titular monsters, making humans the real threat. Compared to previous Jurassic movies I dare say that there are (gasp!) LESS dinosaurs in this chapter.This is basically a kids movie, so bear that in mind, but it is thoroughly entertaining, despite its derivative action sequences and dialogue. The special effects in particular keep getting better and better each time around though.For my money, I enjoyed this far more than say, ""Black Panther"", or most other Marvel fare.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
213,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,"This movie gets the most crap and the hate for it, it is solid decent action sci-fi film my second favorite in the franchise",9,8 February 2019,"This movie gets the most crap and the hate for it, it is a solid decent action sci-fi film so what's the problem? It is a decent film I love the film. I would put it in my second favorite Jurassic Park film in the franchise. I know I am going to get a lot of hate because it is not a rant. In my opinion it is a good film I love it, if you hate the film is your opinion I have no problems with the film, but it is an improvement over Jurassic World I hated that film. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard returns and they are decent I love them in the film so much.When the island's dormant volcano begins roaring to life, Owen and Claire mount a campaign to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from this extinction-level event.I enjoy the practical effects, the explosions, the acting, the story and the action. I love the CGI effect for the raging volcano This is a faster paced film it goes fast around. I enjoyed the film it was entertaining and I wasn't bored with it. I understand the story, the twist and what they try to do with the film. I got this movie on Blu-ray disc and I enjoy it, I enjoy the film it is a guilty pleasure of mine. Call it whatever you want it I love it.Chris Pratt as Owen Grady was decent and really a good hero, he does good performance, he has more stuff to do than in the first one. Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing was one hot mama who showed emotions and she cared about dinosaurs and a rescue mission. She wasn't annoying she was fine and entertaining. I like Bryce Dallas Howard because she was in Spider-Man 3 as Gwen Stacy and I have enjoyed her performance more than Emma Stone in The Amazing Spider-Man 1 and 2. I enjoy Ted Levine in this movie he was in Joy Ride and The Hills Have Eyes remake and I enjoy his performance to be a bad guy. I enjoyed Isabella Sermon as Maise little girl she wasn't annoying I liked her. Rafe Spall was awesome as Eli Mills the villain he was practically like Carter J. Burke (Paul Reiser) from Aliens who wanted a profit of capturing aliens while Mills try's to get rich by selling a live dinosaurs.CGi are better than in the previous movie and gets criticism for trying something different. At least this movie did not copy the first one or other movies like Jurassic World did. I love the first Jurassic Park to death it is the best one in the franchise by a novel who directed Steven Spielberg. I love Jurassic Park III and this one. Directed was by J. A. Bayona who made a good direction. I enjoy the film I would put the film between Aliens and Deep Rising the opening sequence is a really horror aspect, you see a man been eat by a sea monster. Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow wrote a script for the film and they did a good job Colin Trevorrow previously directed Jurassic World so I respect him.I love the idea the rescuing dinosaurs from raging volcano I thought was better idea then the Jurassic World did. The rescue mission was a ploy and Claire and Owen must try to save the dinosaurs from been sold on a black marked. The problems and dumb idea was the cloning little girl that was stupid and bad idea. Of course the T Rex- Veloceraptor blood transfusion was a bad idea too.My favorite scenes are in which Indoraptor hunts Owen and Maise throughout the mansion they are both on the roof but Claire shows up and distracts Indoraptor and of course Blue Velociraptor comes and saves them, kills prototype Indoraptor I loved that in the film. Jeff Goldblum has a cameo scene in the beginning of the film as Ian Malcolm and on the end of the film I don't mind him. BD Wong as Dr. Wu is also back as the bad guy he does a solid job. I love Claire and Franklin in an abandoned gyro-sphere to flee from the pyroclastic flow, but falls into the ocean that scene scared me because I thought they could have died for real. Excellent scene in the movie one of my favorites.I watch this movie twice in the row now, I know it is not perfect film it is not the greatest movie or the best one ever, I know it is stupid but I love it. I enjoy the film it is my second favorite film in the franchise. That is my opinion I forgot they mention a guy who is an arms dealer and they mention Slovenian my country yes I am from Slovenia so I am honored by this movie.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

215,srdjan_veljkovic,"Not as good as previous Jurassic World, which wasn't good at all",4,8 June 2018,"There's not much interesting here. We've seen these dinosaurs many times now. Without a particular order:1. Jeff Goldblum two-piece cameo is not interesting (making him uninteresting is a feat, but, well, not an interesting one)
2. Bryce Dallas Howard was hot, now she's not
3. Apart from a few nice jokes in the first 15 min, it's not very funny and it's less funny than Jurassic World.
4. There's nothing new, really. Jurassic World had new things, like someone training the dinos and the park being run by a misguided modern female executive. But JW: Fallen Kingdom has none of that. It's just running around with the dinos and them getting out in the open world at the end.
5. A few CGI shots are not very good - mostly the scene of dinos running away from the lava.
6. Yeah, it has no real story, either, and what it has doesn't make much sense most of the time.Basically, it's ""a monster movie, pretty much like any other""... If you're into those, it's OK. If you want something more than silly monsters doing silly stuff (some of which is supposed to be scary, but actually isn't), skip it.

219,patriciogl10,The entertainment that never fails.,8,5 September 2018,"I know that Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom's plot leaves a lot to be desired; especially concerning the purpose the evil guys want to give the dinos, that is turning them into war machines; so far fetched that one inevitably thinks that they have really not thought this through at all. Many people think that this is a rehash of The Lost World, and in certain ways it is because of the fact that humans are taking the dinosaurs to the 'real world'; nevertheless this movie has a totally different vibe and can stand up on its own merit. All plot issues aside, this movie never fails to entertain, which is the first thing I look for in
this kind of films, and especially the Jurassic Park movie franchise. The acting is good, no one seems to be out of tune; there is a fairly good chemistry between Chris Pratt and the always gorgeous Bryce Dallas Howard, however in the previous movie they had more serious romantic interactions between them. What happens is that in Fallen Kingdom the action and the primary plot starts to develop quickly from minute one and it virtually doesn't stop. I find that to be one of the good things about this film, you don't have to wait for the events to be set in motion, they already are at full blast. As a fan of the original Jurassic Park, I loved the inclusion of Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm even if it doesn't come from the center of the action. Toby Jones does a fair job as the evil rich eccentric man; Isabella Sermon plays Maisie Lockwood (Benjamin Lockwood's granddaughter), because it's not a Jurassic Park/World movie if it doesn't include children. The supporting characters Zia (Daniella Pineda) and Franklin (Justice Smith) spend most of the film apart from the leads which I thought that it was a different but acceptable approach, since they proved themselves useful nonetheless. Rafe Spall (Eli Mills) as the main antagonist in my opinion was passable. He wasn't too great nor plain bad, just okay. Maybe he lacked a bit of evilness.As for the dinos, they looked great, particularly the animatronics. They always give such a genuine look sometimes overdone by CGI. The relationship between Blue and Owen reaches new heights; it falls to a deeper emotional level where we actually find ourselves rooting for her. Oh, and there's a new dino in town, a hybrid between the Indominus Rex and a Velociraptor. This new addition, the Indoraptor, doesn't appear fully in picture until the third act more or less. While in Jurassic World the main attraction was the Indominous Rex and appeared from the beginning, the Indoraptor is only revealed later on; and it proves to be a highly menacing creature.All things considered, I found the entertainment I came looking for; I'm aware of certain plot flaws but that can't take away the fact that I had a blast watching this movie, and sometimes you have to put that first, but many people seem to discard that by looking for infallible logic in a hugely popular dinosaur movie franchise. I mean come on. If you're like me, this action-packed adventure will not disappoint you. On a side note: should we start saying ""is not a Jurassic World film if the Mosasaurus doesn't jump out of the water to eat a person?"" or is it too soon? But I think I'm noticing a trend here. I just wish the filmmakers would give the Mosasaurus a much bigger involvement.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

222,doorsscorpywag,Carry On Follow That Velociraptor,1,27 July 2018,"Stupidest movie of all time? Gets my vote!Chris Pratt managing to outrun a 500mph pyroclastic flow was the best since John Cusack's outrunning it in a VW Campervan even falling in a hole before outrunning it again in the atrocious 2012.
Pratt managed to go one better by showing he was fireproof as the white hot cloud enveloped him just before he managed to outrun it again.
All we needed was for Sid James to sail past him in a tin bath to give it some gravitas.The whole premise of 'rescuing' the dinosaurs as the island blew up was too stupid for words. 
Science took a back seat as every type of volcanic eruption possible happened at once. Nobody seemed too concerned that the island was exploding as they collected their specimens as lava flowed past and huge rocks were sent flying through the air.What followed in the dinosaur auction managed to beat THAT!
The amount of money spent on buying a dinosaur and then on weaponizing it could probably buy a decent sized army with some good equipment.
But no! These people want dinosaurs as they are cooler.Bryce-Howard could not act if her life depended on it and her two annoying side kicks were worse than the original two brats in #1.
We had a succession of idiotic chase scenes where dinosaurs managed to tear people to pieces without getting blood on themselves. Of course when chasing the lead actors they seem to lose their deadly skill for a moment.Diabolical sub plot about a clone served no real purpose and we could have easily missed that out for more dinosaurs.
The CGI was OK but since #1 its become ordinary to see T Rex and friends.
We had some scenes from the other movies rehashed but it was pretty dull even when the dinos appeared.Ted Levine was the only bright spot and even the normally excellent Toby Jones was pretty pathetic. The ending was perhaps the stupidest ending possible as vicious ravenous massive monsters were deliberately released into the surrounding communities by clone girl.

224,darkreignn,Borders on parody,4,27 February 2021,"Having recently seen ""Jurassic World"" and finding it pretty entertaining (for comparison purposes, my score of ""Jurassic World"" is 7/10), I was eager to watch its sequel, ""Fallen Kingdom."" With an incredibly thrilling first trailer that teased an even darker tone, I was looking forward to a special-effects packed thrill-ride, with even more emotional resonance, brutality, and awesome dinosaur action. Let's just say my expectations were subverted, in the worst way possible.""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" is a massive step backward from the first film, filled with so much silliness that it starts to border on parody. I'm not sure what director J.A. Bayona and crew were thinking, because they ruined what could have otherwise been a good movie. Usually I like to start my reviews with the good, but this movie was so infuriatingly annoying that I want to get the bad off my chest early - first things first, the characters: The film introduces two new characters, played by Daniella Pineda and Justice Smith, and both of them practically destroy this movie, and I'm not even joking. Justice plays a computer nerd that is scared of literally everything - because of this, every time he is scared, which is often, he lets loose a high-pitched shrill of a scream that sounds like something a little girl would yell, not a grown man. It is like listening to nails on a chalkboard, and it happens over, and over, and over, voiding all sense of tension or suspense in every scene that it happens in. I literally wanted to gouge my eardrums out just so I could stop listening to his scream - it's that annoying.Daniella Pineda plays a hipster woman who, in the beginning of the film, says that she's never seen a dinosaur before in her life. No less than 15 minutes later, she is taken to the island as a first aid expert on dinosaurs, even though she literally just admitted to never seeing one in the flesh. This is just one of many idiotic and immersion breaking decisions the movie makes. Daniella goes on to mouth off to armed guards, saying how she knows more about how to care for dinosaurs than they do - not only is it a dumb decision to act tough to people holding semi-automatic machine guns, but it's also equally as dumb to claim that she knows more about dinosaurs than they do, when it is literally their job to capture dinosaurs.Later on in the film, the movie introduces a little girl, played by Isabella Sermon; while she is good in the movie, rocking emotion when she has to, and playful deviousness when she must, toward the end of the movie she makes one of the worst decisions any person could ever make, and again, it is completely immersion breaking - at the end of the film, she decides to release a bunch of dinosaurs to roam the earth freely. Keep in mind, many of these dinosaurs are carnivores that will likely want to feast on human flesh. Her rationale for doing this? ""They're alive, like me."" I kid you not, that's what she says, verbatim. It is so painfully cringy and unbelievable, especially since she has been running for her life, trying to keep alive from a deadly dinosaur for half the film.And that's another thing that his movie does wrong - why are most of the characters so sympathetic toward dinosaurs when they spend almost the entire running time of the film trying to not get eaten by a dinosaur? For example, Bryce Dallas Howard's character now sees dinosaurs as living creatures who deserve sympathy, something she didn't agree with in the first ""Jurassic World,"" and rightly so, as once the dinosaurs are let loose in the park, she ran in utter terror away from them as they tried to eat her alive. Yet, in this movie, she has a complete outlook change and starts to empathize with them, even though they tried eating her. And what do they do in this movie? They try eating her, again. Why in the world would anyone sympathize with monsters who are trying to eat them?While director J.A. Bayona has crafted a film that looks good - especially when they are on the island, with all of the chaos that unfolds there, he decides to add in frustrating characters and unbelievable motivations that make his film feel more like a comedy - let's explore another example: There is a really cool scene where Bryce Dallas Howard and her team are sailing away from the island, watching as a remaining dinosaur is engulfed in volcanic smoke. It is an impactful and surprisingly emotional scene, and it looks really good. And then something happens - the film focuses on Bryce Dallas Howard's face as she is witnessing this, and for some inexplicable reason she is wearing a John Deere hat. It's so ridiculous and so out of left field that I couldn't help but think that J. A. Bayona was trying to sabotage his own film. I mean, what was the point of her wearing the hat? Product placement? Surely she could've worn that hat at literally any other point in the film, and not during a sequence that was trying to be emotionally resonant. And this is what I mean - the movie has all the pieces in place to work, and is ruined by annoying characters and immersion breaking decisions that make no sense.What's good in this movie? Chris Pratt is charismatic as always, and the CGI is genuinely good. Some sequences can be fun, but again, because of the inclusion of the new characters, all tension is thrown out the window, replaced by sheer annoyance. I didn't completely hate this film, but when compared to ""Jurassic World,"" it is a massive step backwards, and I cannot imagine myself willingly re-watching this ever again.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
225,pranayjalvi,Bayona continues the rich legacy of Jurassic series,9,6 June 2018,"Being a fan of Jurassic movies, it was already in my anticipated movies list and yes I liked it (even though not so exceptional). It was more thoughful and interesting than its predecessor. J.A Bayona did a decent job in maintaining the legacy of this series and not letting its characters as well as its plot loose. This movie may be your worth a while for this weekend, especially for the Fans of Jurassic series.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
226,Aly200,Truly a disappointing sequel,5,19 July 2018,"While ""Jurassic World"" was a good return to form after the poorly-received and made ""Jurassic Park 3"", ""Fallen Kingdom"" sadly harkens to the lackluster second and third films in its execution.Director J.A. Bayona follows up the events of the prior by starting at the ruined title park where InGen drones are seeking the remains of the Indominus Rex for obliviously nefarious purposes. Let's say it doesn't go well and then we shift to where our heroes, Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Owen (Chris Pratt), have ended up since the first film; Claire is running a rescue group and Owen is building a home in the middle of the woods. Claire is soon contracted by a wealthy former business partner of John Hammond, Benjamin Lockwood (a poorly used James Cromwell), and the charming Mills (Rafe Spall). Dragging Owen along to find the missing Blue and a paleo-vet (Daniella Pineada who is actually good) and a systems analyst (Justice Smith who is beyond useless), the film goes into action for the first half and then the second half goes back to what we have seen in the past where the baddie is revealed and again we have another hybrid dino that gets loose to kill many people. The two leads actually try to be engaging, but it shows that Chris Pratt would rather be somewhere else (likely due to shooting ""Infinity War"" at the same time) though his chemistry with Howard is slightly better than the first film. Dallas Howard is stronger in this outing than her stuffy shirt appearance in the prior film, but Claire is still not as engaging like Laura Dern's Ellie Sattler; Daniella Pineada comes a bit closer but still not quite either. The supporting characters are complete throwaways especially an irritating Justice Smith who screams through the first half and never really demonstrates why he is a systems analyst. Then there's the unnecessary kid in Isabella Sermon as Lockwood's granddaughter who like Smith in the first half just screams when in danger and provides no help to the heroes like Lex assisting Grant and the others in the original ""Jurassic Park"". Let's not even get into the utter waste of Jeff Goldblum who only shows up in the beginning and end of the film. The screenwriters (Derek Connelly and ""Jurassic World"" director Colin Trevorrow) can't seem to reconcile the shifts in tone which tries to be a action-horror that doesn't hit the combination. The action on the destructing Isla Nublar is at best passable, but then falls apart until the final showdown atop the Lockwood mansion. Even Ian Malcom's final monologue is generic (especially as it is used in the initial trailer for the film) as he explains why we shouldn't mess with nature and the final shots harken back to the last half of ""The Lost World"" to set up for the third outing (to be called ""Evolution"") which hopefully will come back to a better product.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
227,austin0731,Losing its step,4,8 June 2019,"One of the weakest entries in this beloved franchise, with the resurgence that the previous Jurassic World brought on our favourite dinosaur park comes its sequel 'Fallen Kingdom'. Unfortunately this sequel brings little to be excited about, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were rather flat and there was little interest for these characters.For me Jurassic World was a guilty pleasure in that while it wasn't the most serious narrative heavy movies it brought back the nostalgic feeling of seeing dinosaurs on screen. However, second time around the movies can't rely on that sense of wonder and nostalgia anymore, I can see that the filmmakers seemingly acknowledges this with the inclusion of the storyline about the auctioning of dinosaurs and the further adaptation and genetic modifying of the dinosaurs. It was an attempt at doing something different but it falls flat on its face, this plotline that it tries to create makes little sense and makes for a very boring third act. While losing even that sense of fun that it had created in past entries in the franchise.All I can say is, the dinosaur scenes were cool but that is about it.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
228,galahad58-1,Extinction - A Must,3,2 July 2018,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom shows that it is way past the time to put this franchise into the extinction phase. While you may enjoy the special effects - it is nothing new and nothing impressive. For those who want to see the same raptor and T-Rex effects you have relived over and over since the original Jurassic Park. The acting is subpar. There is no character development. While most action movies do not have a lot of character development - these characters really are two dimensional with no substance and they do not give you a reason to care about any of them.The script is beyond awful. Spoilers: No one is building a huge complex in someone else's house with no one knowing about it; the reveal about the granddaughter was dumb filler that had absolutely nothing to do with the movie; the decision to bring deadly creature to America to sell them off to the highest bidder made zero sense; and the release of those deadly creatures into the American society to kill hundred (or thousands) was the most stupid ending in years.

229,asifahsankhan,"CGI is spot on, the visuals are aesthetically mounted while the plot is left undeveloped",6,13 June 2018,"""The Fallen Kingdom,"" helmed by Director J.A. Bayona, the film promises a lot when it comes to presenting concepts and characters, but at the time of developing the story, it falls into the same sin as Jurassic World.Just as Jurassic World was remade on a larger scale from Spielberg's Jurassic Park for consumption by the younger generations, 'The fallen Kingdom' too, seems to aspire for the same with the continuation of the lost world.Here you see more reptiles, close and upfront, in all their glory and action. The action-sequences are intense but at times appear deliberate and dumb, just to stimulate heartbeats.The actual story begins with some exposition about the end of the first Jurassic World. The theme park on Isla Nublar off Central America's Pacific Coast is destroyed and the dinosaurs roam freely on the island for three years.While the Former Jurassic World Operations Manager, now an animal-rights activists - Claire Dearing (Bryce Howard) is working to save the dinosaurs, we then see Jeff Goldblum, reprising his role from the first two films, addressing a committee. He tells them that he thinks the dinosaurs, ""should be eliminated by the volcano"" that threatens the island, and Goldblum works hard to give this plot exposition some urgency.Claire is joined by her ex-boyfriend Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), a former dinosaur trainer when she teams up with Benjamin Lockwood, to bring the creatures to a sanctuary in America. But soon she and Owen are betrayed and mayhem follows. There is also a helpless little girl Maisie (Isabella Sermon) who elevates the emotional quotient.Chris Pratt is a charismatic, good-looking and funny guy. He returns as the leading man and everything he utters tends to sound like a double entendre. ""If I don't make it back, remember, you are the one who made me come,"" he tells Howard at one point and pauses just enough to generate a laugh.Also when Howard is on top of a dinosaur and needs to sedate it with a syringe, Pratt matter-of-factly states, ""You are going to have to jam it in there!""The plot hinges, as so many large studio films do, on the evil of villainous capitalists who have no shame or moral scruples. These villains are poaching the dinosaurs to make their millions and also to use them for warfare.The director unfolds so comfortably with this material that one ends up scrutinizing the frames, wondering if any of the reptilian offspring that appear on screen will end up looking clumsy.But instead, the CGI is spot on and the visuals are aesthetically mounted. Director of Photography, Oscar Faura's live-action frames mesh smoothly with the CGI and together, you experience some enchanting images.Overall, this edition is still much better than its predecessor.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
230,swedzin,"Fast paced, dull, manipulative and exists only to grab your money.",3,15 January 2020,"This has to be the most fast paced Jurassic Park film in which things escalated so quickly, so clumsily and embarrassingly. Before I start... I just want to point out something. I know that most of you are familiar with that fact, but I just cannot go on without saying that. Most of Hollywood films in the last 8 years, or so, were made just for one purpose - to take your money away. And, that is just it. Yes, I know, now you think, Hollywood has been doing so ever since it existed. True, but we had so many good Hollywood films in the past. Movies that WERE worth your money. So, movies today... they rarely have good characters and that good old feeling... The feeling of connection between the audiences and characters. You could enjoy a good, well executed story and other things. But today's films... they just don't have characters anymore, I dare to say, metaphorically... they don't have soul anymore. So, let's dive in in this dino-turd.To mention that first Jurassic Park film was really something tremendous and magical in 1993, and I think that even the 1997 sequel was not that bad, until 2001 sequel came a long and slapped a shameful whack to the audiences all over the world and fans. And in 2015, we got Jurassic World - the beginning of new franchise (because Hollywood is now taking the sequels and not calling them sequels directly - rather ""a new beginning in franchise"". Speaking of no more ideas...). So, the 2015 film was not the best film around, but the ending was cool. But this film... this was something very ugly. It has a lot of terrible things in it. The movie essentially borrows from The Lost World - Jurassic Park (1997) - the idea is similar to ""rescuing"" dinosaurs and transport them to a better and safer place. However, the movie also introduces an evil people who are not for rescuing of dinosaurs. So, nothing new! Just the same as 2015 film, only double in appearance. The movie was directed by J.A. Bayona. Not the best director for JP films. It was written by Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly. Colin directed the first Jurassic World, but he didn't brought anything new with this one in the script, it was basically the same thing over and over. The characters were dull, not interesting and characters of Owen and Claire were not developed, nor evolved. We have some new characters... an irritating computer geek and a paleo -veterinarian. A what? Is that even real? Dude, you need a dinosaur to learn how to operate on them. Now, I know that you think ""we should not take these movies seriously"". Sure, I agree. But, in order to make a good film - you need to put some sense into it! From older actors, we have Ted Levine as a dinosaur hunter. Levine is a good actor, but this time, they wasted his talents. He is just a hunter who likes to collect dinosaur teeth. And that's just it. Another one is James Cromwell, who is John Hammond look alike. I am not going to spoil you anything, but it seems that we needed some old character to resemble Hammond. But, the problem is - Hammond was interesting character. Also, we have D.B. Wong as Henry Wu, the man who designed dinosaurs of Jurassic Park. In first film, he was likeable (no matter how shortly he was there), but in the JW, you can clearly see a change in the character. But, here, he was nothing but a ridiculous, villainous slime ball. And, finally, we have Jeff Goldblum, just to spew out his lines from trailer and that's it.Now, let's talk about other things. The music score was tolerable, maybe. There was a lot of original score, but I think that John Williams should have been a part of this movie. Cinematography was decent in some shots, production design... nothing new. I thought that production design was better in the JW. CGI? Well, I didn't like it. It was uninspiring and in certain scenes - terrible. OK, I would say that volcano and lava CGI is OK enough. Practical effects were used minimally. Editing was OK, it was consistent and clean. The script and dialogue were freaking horrific. As I said... no connection. Not even between the characters, or characters and audiences.So, what was the point of this film? I cannot really tell. There were a lot of terrible things. It is just a mess. As I mentioned, the pace is just ugly and everything is escalating so senselessly. Who is the target audience here? All of us, sad to say. Because, Hollywood needs money. So, they expect that their movie will work? Do they think that their movie will be timeless? I guess - not. Today's movies are just... lost. Everything is lost in this meaningless, pseudo stories and characters which don't serve nothing to the audience. For example, we have this little girl in the film and she is nothing but a little jerk who hides around in a large mansion. That is it. What else do we have about her? Nothing! Well, later it was revealed who is she. Most of people don't like child actors and characters in the film, but I could connect to the kids in the first and second film, but in this one... not even close. One more thing... I don't know why, but this film also give a few manipulative scenes. The manipulation of emotions. This was such a pathetic attempt for audience to feel sorry for some things. Why? Nobody cared for that. And how can I care, because I could not relate to most of things in the film. My friendly advice is to avoid this stuff and turn your head toward cinema from other countries... maybe you'll find something better there.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
231,FelipeCarrillo,Dinosaurs are endangered by J.A. Bayona,5,25 September 2018,"Before finalizing its drawn-out closing credits, I witnessed a thank-you line alone in the dark, with an exquisite composition in its very last seconds before the post-credits scene, a first name and a surname that encompass the most appreciable and single improvement that can be highlighted in the eyes of common viewers: Guillermo del Toro. Clearly, in addition to their friendship and unbreakable 'orgullo'- written in Spanish, - they both share advice on the different audiovisual projects that they carry out, from the most imperceptible details to the most important ones, in this case: the stifling atmosphere that inundates the whole pic for everybody's enjoyment, Bayona' and Del Toro's imagery.""Fallen Kingdom,"" always lewdly ruled by an unthinkable narrative incongruity and a soaring fandango in the devices used to move forward the plot, is a progression of varying-quality set-pieces differing from the increasing suspenseful anticipations from start to finish. Spanish filmmaker J.A. Bayona described the second installment of this new 'Jurassic' trilogy as the darkest, most gothic in the entire saga in the months prior to its release, and there's nothing more than truth in his words, at least, in most of the taut action sequences on the island and the mansion. Even with MPAA's PG-13 rating as a ""restriction,"" Bayona and cinematographer Oscar Faura find ways to bath the film in an unco survival horror from the middle of the second act, and although it suffers from a wounding disconnection between the genres it handles, artistically feeds off the wonderful camera work, a wild color palette and Michael Giacchino's uncommonly weak soundtrack that gets its only point of glory in the variations of the original franchise theme. Avoiding tooth and nail internet since the review embargo was over and the moment when the first teaser came out, just a few details and core info reached my ears. Having as basis the 2015 Hollywood prequel, huge surprises were predicted for this new entry, and although the writing was an unhopeful horizon, the visual potential was the main prey for depredators, but even with a fabulous crew, such hopes faded away once the movie is over. By far, only three pics are memorable by their artistic magnificence, a deeply disappointing conclusion in an entertaining mess. Regardless of the result, J.A. Bayona has just made his debut in the cinematic monster called Hollywood. Besides the huge pressure coming from the exorbitant budget - estimated at 170-187 billion, - the director from Barcelona got in his hands the weight bestowed by one of the most famous, emblematic science fiction sagas in history of cinema. Apparently, in the new round of films predominates the objectification of the ""aggressive dinos -"" a thesis radically opposed to, at least, the original principles by Spielberg - and it prioritizes high grosses rather than a good, fitting storytelling process, but the filmmaker sets up his unusual blockbuster at a very high price, dynamizing what Colin Trevorrow's entertaining roller coaster ride already did quite well and destabilizing his own vision with a very poorly matched plot; a decadent, pernicious pace; mediocre characters; performances deprived of charisma and an ever-growing succession of flaws and/or inconsistencies in the script that only provoke idealizations by fans about this sequel if all of the above would have been otherwise. After all, Bayona is a true artist endowed with overwhelming visuals and powerful emotionality that permeates his fantasy tales that cause a very personal, enjoyable experience, however, for example, unlike the creative freedom put on the powerful, tearing fantastic fable starring Lewis MacDougall, this time Universal only used his ideas and features in the soaring atmosphere.Relegating Chris Patt's natural charm to give the chance a ""comic-relief"" as clumsy as uninteresting is one of its biggest cons, fortifying it with the weak performances of the leading actors and some one-liners lacking in effect. The most discussed issue of the previous film was Claire's footwear, fleeing through a muddy jungle or the high-tech park, this time, naysayers will have reasons to criticize because she becomes the typical, currently unwanted damsel in distress that must be rescued by a man, displaying even an artificial and totally unnecessary ""romantic"" moment. Even coming from good actors, the performances are medium-quality. The leading actors, even more, their chemistry, the little spark from the first film. They intend to get it back by means of no-more-of-forty-second interactions. Many of the characters are deprived of their essence and potential on screen: Chris Pratt gives up his inherent comic-factor for being the hero; Daniella Pineda pretends to be the very first LGBT character but they are afraid to show it; Bryce Dallas Howard doesn't get a significant plot weight beyond being the target for deception; and Justice Smith is entrusted with a repellent, tasteless character, there is no force in performances or characters here; a really harmful feature.In short, the best scenes are the only two starring Jeff Goldblum - any similarity, on a marketing level, with what Warner Bros. and DC did ""Suicide Squad"" Jared Leto's Joker, is coincidental. - Was it necessary to see two hours of high-sounding melodies and determined truly beautiful pictures to say: ""Welcome to the Jurassic World""? If it's a matter of curiosity, love and fidelity to Bayona and Trevorrow, I'm in, otherwise, I'm out.Here, one more case in which the power of a real test-screening is disdained. This film's test-screening was the approval of Steven Spielberg and the positive reception of Marvel Studios' Spider-Man Tom Holland's family. Of course, and according to the director, both parts loved the final cut, however, if the film had been evaluated with a wider range of testers, oblivious to the director's acquaintances, many misfortunes would have been avoided.It's not possible to disclaim the amazing cinematography and certain high-tension set-pieces that give you goosebumps in ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" by J.A. Bayona, in the same way, it's fair to appreciate the neat construction of some atmospheres brimming with suspense and mainstream-horror-genre tropes that embed their claws with intolerable tenacity. Although moderately efficient and unusual by the ""Jurassic"" franchise, the darkness and drama the director intends to endow his story don't get a truly effect due to, first of all, the PG-13 barrier between its purposes, and secondly, the discrepancy between the menacing pictures and the frightened script that obviously prevails when it's evaluated as a whole. The fingers of one hand can be useful to count the qualities in favor of this uneven, disappointing sequel, a movie that opens the way for the upcoming, barnstorming cinematic climax. Once more a blockbuster with little soul and a lot of pyrotechnics that will surely be an overseas summer box office smasher thanks to an instinctively striking, aggressive mise-en-scène and the hook provoked by the magnetic leading duo - Pratt and his lizards - however, it will sink in with respect to the summer competitors due to unfunny, medium-quality performances, a short-of-innovation soundtrack, and a simply poor, disjointed narrative and storyline. All this coming to the conclusion that the worst sin committed by this film was to fetter freedom to an artist, in every sense of the word. J. A. Bayona was able to achieve big, praiseworthy things, such as taming the wildest beasts of entertainment.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
232,TheVictoriousV,"I've seen smarter people deal with dinos, let's say that",3,16 May 2019,"The greatest part of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is the brief return of Jeff Goldblum as franchise staple Dr. Ian Malcolm. For those of you who don't care about that, I can assure you that the film also entails cool, scary dinosaurs whose often unconvincing presence won't bother you as they are technically well-rendered. If that sounds good enough, close this window. The rest of this post is presumably not of any interest to you.Now that the rest of us are alone, I can discuss how the VFX work is somewhat improved and how there is certain dramatic weight to more scenes than I expected. Still, its characters are not exactly a gripping bunch - pretty undefined outside what they've told us about themselves and each other - nor is there that much weight to the scenes we're here for: the ones involving humans at the mercy of dinos.These are scenes that often - but as previously noted, not always - care more about showcasing spectacle than seeming grounded; I'm talking both about the appearance of the visuals and the amount of damage a human body can sustain (particularly without ruining Bryce Dallas Howard's prettiness). Be that as it may, I had more fun with the film when the dinosaurs were the focus than whenever humans were explored.Back again are Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), Jurassic World's former raptor trainer and operations manager, respectively, now advocates of dinosaur rights and yes I seriously just typed those words. With help from other dinosaur sympathizers, they plan to transfer the dinosaurs which now rule the volcanic island that used to be Jurassic World, and before that ""Park"", to one where they shall be safe from the impending eruption (as well as the cold clutches of humanity) and can kill each other in peace. Even in movies, you can't make much sense of the PETA-types.Owen and Claire are out of luck with the US government, but do receive help from Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell), once a partner of Dr. John Hammond. Also involved are Lockwood's aide Eli Mills (Rafe Spall), an instantly obvious baddie with a scheme of his own, as well as such Dinosaur Protection Group members as ""hacker"" Frank Webb (Justice Smith) and veterinarian Zia Rodriguez (Daniella Pineda). Mills is in cahoots with a dinosaur auctioneer played by Toby Jones (that's a thing) and Ted Levine and B.D. Wong appear, the latter being another quite familiar face.The motif of genetic engineering is also brought back. Instead of the Indominus Rex, which was essentially a meld between Velociraptor and T-Rex, this movie offers a look at a DIFFERENT blend of T-Rex and raptor. But this one looks slightly cooler. I dare not describe what level of human stupidity and carelessness allows this creature to break free and wreak mandatory havoc, but let's simply say, I've seen smarter characters deal with dinosaurs.Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (directed by J.A. Bayona of A Monster Calls) is a fairly standard sequel. It adds things to the franchise mythology that have never been mentioned but are necessary for this particular plot, it has its share of call-backs, and it takes the things that were stupid about the previous movie to new heights. Luckily, it adds some new nonsense to shake things up. Wait 'til you get a load of the true nature of Sir Lockwood's grandchild.Happy belated 25th birthday, dear dinosaur franchise. I would urge you to consider retirement at this point, but I don't know that your legacy will necessarily be tarnished when your most recent outings are insanely forgettable or just plain dumb. As far as I'm concerned, keep up the bad work.All I want to know is how people can be so certain of what dinosaurs sounded like and that they looked exactly like their skeletons plus a very thin layer of very tight skin.

233,jackgdemoss,The best part about this film is how it sets up for a potentially fantastic sequel,6,24 June 2018,"There isn't much movie to discuss here because there was hardly a plot. It felt like the screenwriters were told they have 15 min to tell a story, because the rest will be filled with dinosaur action (not necessarily a bad thing). The result was some cool effects with an extremely lacking story. There was one huge plot twist that had me excited...and then they literally never addressed it again. It was by far the most interesting part of the story and they never mentioned it again. The movie leaves with a cliff hanger that sets up for the next installment and has my genuine interest. The potential atmosphere they created for the next Jurassic World has endless possibilities, and I hope they pull in a crew to not waste the opportunity.

In this form however it's really just the brilliant dinosaur visual effects that I enjoyed.I rate 4/10 and I'm sorely disappointed in every aspect of this film apart from its dinosaurs!! However the writing of plot and characters, the narrative sense, the acting and directing, the sound design and the score, even the editing seem fat, flat, flabby and flaccid.I recommend only to ardent fans of dinosaur movies and special effects junkies but there's not much more to this film than dinosaurs and special effects so for other film fans this is probably going to leave an unsatisfying impression.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

I mean, I didn't love the previous one (I gave it a 7,5 here), but it was entertaining, and, the story at least made sense! C'mon, you can really say what is he real plot behind this movie is. It's just a huge set up for a war (or something like that) between humans and dinos. And, even though this I love the idea of seeing that on the big screen, again, WHAT THE HECK THEY DID WITH THIS MOVIE? There are lots of moments and plot holes I can talk about here.In fact, I've took some notes thought the whole thing, so I will just list then here, in case you missed something.Right in the first scene I wondered: What the heck is the deal with this island now? Who is taking care of it? I mean, the guys invaded it, they left THE GATE OPENED! And NOBODY CARED? Did anyone noticed that the giant sea door was suddenly open? NOT EVEN THE NEWS?! And, later in the movie we have this expedition, so, again, isn't there ANY type of governmental supervision? They just let the rich guy bring an ARMY to the island even though the apparently said that the government's final decision was to let the dinosaurs die?A quick one: Did Owen and Claire brake up because he didn't let her drive...?What is going one with this whole ""for the kids"" thing, I mean, what's the connection here? Will you save the most dangerous creatures on earth because of the kids...?There A LOT of odd shots/cuts thought the movie (mainly in the beginning), some a minor, but it's something really impressive for a movie with that much of production value. Like in one scene Bryce is full dress, and cuts to another angle where apparently time has passed and she is now dress completely different.Ok, so, I will just leave the question. Claire and the IT guy were stuck, they were trying to open the doors the whole time, why they didn't go for the stares before...?A TRUCK JUMPS INTO THE SHIP AND NOBODY EVEN NOTICES! Is anybody even looking at what the doctor who is treating the most valuable creature in the whole ship is doing? Really?The scene at the end when the tiny dino comes out of the elevator and starts killing people is great though. The army guy, I mean, I even don't want to say it out loud, he enters the cage with a completely unknown type of dino because of a necklace? C'mon buddy, you're not helping yourself.One thing that really bugs me thought the film is how unbalanced is the dinosaurs' strength, sometimes they can break walls and iron, bun can surpasses and wood door. I don't buy it that those huge animals would be stuck behind those tine iron bars either, I mean, c'mon.But, probably the hardest thing to deal with is at the end, when the little girl just RELEASES KILING MACHINES IN THE OPEN WORLD because ""they are alive""! C'MON! F# YOU! ARE YOU INSANE? This may cause HUMAN EXTINCTION! Wtf? I'm sure you two will be great parents for her, indeed.And, what the hell was that close up in the girl's face at the end? Is she evil or something?I have lots of other questions too, but I don't need to make this even longer (where is Vincent D'Onofrio's character?). But overall, it seems to me that they almost didn't have any script, they had just the guideline cataclysm->scape->war-in-the-third-movie, and went along with it improvising. The film seems rush sometimes, and others too slow, you can tell what is going to happen long before it really happens (like the revelation that the kid is a clone). And you actually almost didn't get any of the most entertaining stuff (which is dinos killing people). And it's just a shame to have that much of money, incredible effects and actors, and still make a bad movie. I'm not giving it an one, mainly because I love Chris and Bryce (the kid is great too), and you have (almost) a hand full of good moments here and there, and because you can also laugh of the atrocious parts too, but man, it's incredible what they did here.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

I was surprised that the action does not take place on the island for very long. Yes, we have new villains, trying to make a buck in the same old way, exploiting the poor friendly dinosaurs. Yes, some of the chases we have seen before, but this is a Jurassic action flick, so that can't be helped. Overall, I found this to be an exciting, suspenseful romp while we wait to see if the good guys prevail.If you liked the previous Jurassic World entry, see this episode also-there may be another chapter to come.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Yes, they can.Fallen Kingdom had the insurmountable task to be better than its predecessor and I will dare to say that it accomplished just that, because the movie is so much more contained and they keep the stories fresh by adding some new and interesting characters that can turn the franchise around for a while longer.Chris Pratt is always excellent but so is Bryce Dallas Howard and new additions that include Ted Levine.In my opinion this entry is one of the best ones of the franchise, I cannot wait to see what they do next.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
240,kevinxirau,"Fallen Kingdom, indeed.",5,15 July 2018,"It seems that, to Ian Malcolm's chagrin, the dinosaurs and the franchise they star in just won't die, hence ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"". In this continuation, Owen and Claire set out to save the dinos from Isla Nublar's now active volcano. However, the men backing them have more sinister motives behind this venture in mind, leading to a nail-biting confrontation with a new hybrid, the Indoraptor.The studio heeded the fans as practical effects are much more prominently used in this film than the last one, allowing for more effectively intimate moments between humans and dinosaurs and, boy, do they look fantastic (the CG is good too). As always, we also see new species in this series from horned predator Carnotaurus to bone-headed Stygimoloch with Rexy and Blue back to dominate the spotlight. The way the action was handled is interesting, going from the grand scale of a volcanic eruption to the smaller, claustrophobic tension of the new facility with the animals. The Indoraptor, while more-or-less a smaller version of the Indominus Rex, is a little scary, has more personality, and isn't as ridiculously overpowered as its predecessor, though it's pretty flawed as a killing machine compared to its larger predecessor. Creds to the music as some tracks stuck out like the grim choir singing in the hybrid's scenes. JW also managed to muster a few powerfully moving scenes, one of which nearly made me cry. The cast all did their jobs well given the material at hand, though Justice Smith annoyed me and it's a little jarring that Owen and Claire's relationship has taken a step back when the film begins.I have some few bones to pick with this one (no pun intended). As usual, there are slimy corporate villains which, while competently acted, aren't engaging/entertaining to watch. In fact, they are by far the worst, most 2D villains in the series. There are a few idiots that make such obviously dumb, illogical decisions that lead to very predictable outcomes. The one thing that nagged me throughout is that the film doesn't acknowledge the second island Isla Sorna, which is full of dinosaurs, which made the rush to save the ones on Nublar exaggerated. This led to much confusion about the continuity of the series. The film also throws many nods to the first two films to the point where it gets distracting; in fact, the basic story ideas are copied from ""The Lost World"". The volcano's existence also throws the whole concept of the park into question. Perhaps the biggest missed opportunity is a plot twist involving Isabella Sermon, which, while an interesting idea for the franchise, isn't explored nearly enough as it could've been and has little to no bearing on the story.""Fallen Kingdom"" is a step down from the last one in many respects despite a few improvements in certain areas. It delivers on thrills, likable-enough protagonists, and does ask a good question about the dinosaurs' rights of simply existing. On the other hand, the writing is terrible with many plot holes, uninspired villains, and there are too many nods to the older films. Dare I say, ""Jurassic Park 3"" is better put together.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

The film franchise does a solid job NOT veering away from it's original predecessor. The obvious conglomerate is the CGI effects of the dinosaurs. It is absolutely amazing how incredibly real the composites are.In the film we go back to the island where a volcano is on the brink of eruption and will essentially destroy and kill everything, once again confining the dinosaurs to extinction.

243,Lewis_Heather787,Two separate films in one!,7,8 June 2018,"I get the sense that the screenwriters of this film tried desperately to fill this film to the brim with as much story and plot points as they could. To me this film definitely feels like two films sandwiched together, the first hour of the film feels rather different to the last hour of the film. More importantly does it work as one film as a whole?That question is difficult to answer because its sort of a yes and no, the first hour of the film, for me, is much more interesting than the last hour of the film. Pretty much all the positives I have for the film are in the first hour, whilst most of the negatives of the film are in the last hour of the film. The first hour on the island is actually really quite entertaining, which surprised the hell out of me to be honest. The story and the characters were all really on point, I was genuinely starting to really get invested in the film and started to care. In that sense then the film had worked, I instantly cared about the dinosaurs and the mission that Clare and Owen were on. Talking of those two characters it must be said that Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt's chemistry throughout the film, but the first hour predominantly, is much better that it was in the first Jurassic World film. The quick snappy dialogue and humour between the two characters was really nice and developed them more and more as the film progressed. The same should be said for the directing and story which again is much more consistent and better in the first hour whilst on the island. It is just such a shame that the second half of the film was as good. (It should be noted that the first hour was so good it made an emotional impact on me when the last dinosaur on the island was consumed by the volcanic ash)Unfortunately the film could keep up the same standards in the last hour of the film, because this film goes down hill in a really badly. The story for one is just not that interesting, the idea that this secret organisation is auctioning of dinosaurs to rich people around the world is just......I don't know.......a bit to ridiculous. I know Im watching a film about dinosaurs in the modern world and to me this is the most unrealistic part of it. However the biggest problem with the second half of the film is the over acting by the ""villans"" of the film. Toby Jones is a great actor but god is he getting a pay check in this film. Also Rafe Spall again good actor but really one dimensional as a character and not given to much to do. Im surprised that one of them didn't turn to the camera, break the forth wall and say ""I'm really bad"". The dialogue is extremely cheesy and makes their characters almost cartoonish. Overall I'd still just about give this film a positive review just based on how surprisingly good the first half of the film is. 70% out of 100 or 7 out of 10 its good, my advice would be to watch the first hour, fall asleep and then wake up with about 10 minutes to go. Not as good as the first film but saying that I am interested with what they do with Jurassic World 3.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
244,Dragonsouls,Back to Crichton roots.,8,22 June 2018,"If you think you're going to be watching another mindless Jurassic Park sequel then do not fret. Jurassic Park Fallen Kingdom sticks to its Crichton roots in that the dinosaurs represent byproducts of science and intelligent design. Jeff Goldblum returns as Dr. Ian Malcolm and even though his cameo was brief, he had the best lines. Dr. Malcolm drifts through long enough to warn a congressional committee-using a not-so-thinly veiled climate-change allegory-that we have meddled in the order of things enough and should just let nature take its course. Fallen Kingdom is the title of this sequel, and this Fallen Kingdom is not in reference to any park at all, but civilization as a whole, our civilization, which just like Jurassic Park, is a byproduct of advanced science and perhaps intelligent design, or at least, soon will be. Thoughts of the prophetic notion of the ""singularity"" come to mind, making Fallen Kingdom one of the most allegorical stories of the series since the original film. the plotline dovetails nicely with the warning bells the film sounds about the dangers of genetic manipulation. It delves heavily on the topic and how such a technology can be used for personal aggrandizement, rather than the good of mankind.There was a dinosaur in the film that I actually shed a tear for, that being, the Velociraptor named ""Blue,"" the smartest dinosaur ever created. I thought this was a much darker film than the last one. The acting was solid and the few comedic lines in the movie did not feel out of place. This film is going to make a lot of money, and I'm glad it will because Hollywood is the only outlet for artists and their voice. Its interesting how so many people love this film and yet professional critics bash it. The contrasting divide between audience and pro critics is baffling lately. I really liked this film and it was everything I hoped it would be.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
245,AdrenalinDragon,A good sequel that keeps the series from falling into extinction,7,6 June 2018,"I didn't really know what to expect initially when I went to see Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. I was hoping it wasn't just The Lost World: Jurassic Park all over again, and I was pleasantly surprised by the end of it. The island part of the movie doesn't feel like a slog to get through compared to The Lost World, and it felt like two movies in one when it came to an end.If you were expecting action and dinosaurs, you'll get that, but one thing that surprised was there were quite a few emotional scenes in it. The themes of greed and extinction lead to some interesting scenes spread throughout the movie, and I definitely got a bit of a classic Jurassic Park vibe to the movie in small doses. Is it perfect? No, there are quite a few cliches and predictable parts to it, but it didn't destroy the movie for me. I enjoyed both the first half and the second half equally, and I also got a bit of a Horror vibe to it in parts too.The acting is decent. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are the same as they were back in Jurassic World. The new characters are good and the little girl in this one has some decent moments. Even Jeff Goldblum's appearance didn't feel wasted and made sense in the plot of the movie. The CGI/Special Effects feels more polished here, the music is good, and the directing seems much more solid compared to Jurassic World. Overall, I liked this movie but I think it's going to be quite divisive. It's impossible to top the original Jurassic Park, but I appreciate the new things they added to keep things fresh in the series.7/10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
246,Jared_Andrews,"The Trailers Spoil the Best Moments, but the movie is pretty poor, anyway",4,24 June 2018,"It's probably too late to mention this, but do NOT watch the trailers. They spoil way, way too much. Many of the movie's best sequences, or at least fragments of them, are shown in the trailers. Several times I found myself thinking while watching the movie, ""I know where this is going because I saw a clip in the trailer."" Now I'll give a quick plot overview of Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. After witnessing the carnage, chaos and death that ensued during the theme park's meltdown in the last movie, you may be wondering why any human would ever set foot on the island again. It's a very reasonable thought. In brief, all the dinosaurs on the island are going to become extinct after the island's volcano erupts. Nature is clearly trying to tell us something, right? Just let nature correct the mistake humans made in bringing back the most dangerous predators to ever exist. While we're thinking about the volcano, I'm also curious about why the founders of the park ever chose to build on an island with an active volcano that could wipe out all nearby life. Seems like poor planning. Also poor planning, is endangering human lives with a rescue mission to an island with an erupting volcano.Against all logic, operation: Save the dinos has its supporters. An animal protection group, headed by a less steely and less robotic Clair Deering (Bryce Dallas Howard), convinces a billionaire to fund a mission to rescue the dinosaurs. But, oh no! The team needs help tracking Blue, the last surviving raptor. Cue raptor trainer extraordinaire Owen Grady (Chris Pratt). Those two are joined by a paleo-veterinarian (apparently a real thing) and an annoying tech guy who is afraid of absolutely everything, including bugs and planes. As you can imagine, he does not hold up well around dinosaurs. I'm not sure why the scaredy-pants character was ever written into this movie. He's meant to provide comic relief, but isn't that why Chris Pratt is here? Pratt is actually funny, and he's wasted in this movie, relegated to a puppet of a character, who showcases none of the charismatic cool he demonstrated in the prior film. Beyond the obvious character development flaws, there is one unavoidable issue: I don't agree with their mission. How can I root for these heroes if they're doing something indisputably foolish? I love animals, but these particular animals have killed countless humans and will surely kill more. I cannot support risking more human lives for this mission.That's not the movie's only problem. For one, the directing is spotty. A few sequences will wow the viewers, as long as they haven't already seen these clips in the trailers. Director J.A. Bayona has a background in horror that becomes evident in this movie. He creates dingy lighting and makes clever use of shadows as dinosaurs approach their victims. When the dinosaurs fully reveal themselves, Bayona knows to focus the camera on teeth, claws and eyes--the scariest parts of the creatures. Some of the action is legitimately scary. Other times, it's cartoonish. One scene in particular feels like something you would see in Scooby-Doo. The issue with the action, other than being occasionally cartoonish, is how often in leans on callbacks to past Jurassic movies. Sure, the concepts are fun and well-executed, but we have seen them all before.Here we are at the fifth movie in the franchise, and the filmmakers are clearly out of fresh ideas. They're banking on fans flocking to see the movie solely because it has dinosaurs. I demand something more from my movies, and you should too.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
247,cgearheart,So ridiculously overstuffed that it becomes dull,4,16 April 2019,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a very, very boring movie.. and it really shouldn't have been considering how many different things were crammed into it.

Uhm, oh okay, we can work with that, no problem!Third, it's a movie about cloning humans and keeping them a secret from humanity. Wait, what? Okay, I guess this might still work?Fourth, it's a movie about dinosaur poachers and corrupt businessmen who attempt to kidnap dinosaurs so they can sell them on the black market. Okay, this is the same movie?What goes on in the film shifts back and forth from these four ridiculous plot lines and goes on for well over 2 hours... on top of this, the long awaited return of Jeff Goldblum is a complete scam, as he is reduced to a 45 second long cameo.D+",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
248,sirwillisiv,Take it for what it is...,6,4 July 2018,"I've got some mixed feeling about this entry, but I really can't fault it entirely. It's Jurassic Park. It's about a theme park for cloned dinosaurs. It's by all means meant to be absurd popcorn entertainment. I'd be lying if I said Fallen Kingdom didn't entertain me. The whole thrill of these films is watching dinosaurs run amok and kill people, and there's tons of moments like that worth some laughter and applause. Chris Pratt is impossible to dislike, and he has proven to be quite a riveting action star from both this series and Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy. A few refreshing sequences showcase Owen brawling with mercenaries when normally its the dinosaurs who serve as the significant threat. This time around the prehistoric creatures serve more as supporting protagonists. I was taken aback by the film's ending. Has the series run its course? Perhaps, but the direction it takes in the final act really has me intrigued with how the upcoming Jurassic World 3 will play out.As for my criticisms, I found pacing a bit troubling, especially in the third act in the mansion which seemed like it went on forever. I was also disappointed by the severe lack of Jeff Goldblum, who played Dr. Ian Malcolm in the first and second Jurassic Park films. I'm sorry, but you can't write in a popular, quotable figure like Dr. Malcolm and only have him appear twice within the two hour runtime. He should've had some kind of pivotal basis to the narrative, it was an extreme injustice to such a memorable, break-out character. I wasn't too fond of the villains. They're the same cookie-cutter baddies from previous entries; the selfish idiots who just want to exploit the dinosaurs for personal gain. The only interesting thing about these clowns were how the dinosaurs axed them off. Lastly, I want to address my thoughts on this new character named Maisie, a little girl who likes dinosaurs who eventually becomes tangled up in the millionaire's plot and teams up with Owen and Claire. There's always been a central kid character in the Jurassic Park films, and they've proved to be quite resourceful during the perils they encounter, but this girl didn't do a thing for me. It wasn't the actress' performance that threw me off, she was fine, but there was a rather odd revelation about her character's past that was forgotten faster than it was introduced. It wasn't interesting either, it was just disturbing and redundant. I won't say what it was, this is something you need to see and think for yourself. Again, I really can't fault Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom for being what it is; I have to give it some leeway due to its fun factor. Come on, it's supposed to be an dumb thriller. It has its badass moments, Chris Pratt is likable as always, and the film ends on a somewhat interesting note. My biggest gripes were the story's pacing, Jeff Goldblum's minimal involvement, and that bizarre twist regarding the little girl. I don't know what else to say...I've seen better CGI in other films, and the villains were just another band of greedy morons. Seriously, folks, it's Jurassic Park. I didn't walk in expecting Godfather-tier performances and storytelling. It's by no means great or terrible. It's completely serviceable. I had fun with it, I felt like I got my money's worth. So, take it for what it is!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

250,scb_coldsteel,Shiny but not too satisfying,6,1 October 2018,"I watched the new Jurassic World last night at the theater. I didn't go in with very high expectations. The last film was a big, stupid, but fun mess. Jurassic world 2 did not disappoint in that regard.So plot wise the film is separated into two distinct parts. The first involves returning to Jurassic Park to save the dinosaurs while the second involves stopping a nefarious organization from exploiting the dinosaurs. Both are fairly cliche ridden and predictable. Of course the plot is just an excuse to see CGI dinosaurs fight each other. Gone are the days from Jurassic Park 1 and 2 where the the movies plot had a degree of substance. This movie has no qualms about being big, stupid, and fun. Character-wise again the film didn't cover any new ground. The good and bad guys are just cartoon caricatures without any real depth. Don't expect any degree of character development or even really liking the characters. Everyone is just a placeholder for CGI dino action. Even Chris Pratt's likeability can't save his character for being boring.Speaking of action this is the one area where the movie shines. The movie was a nonstop action ride. From start to finish the movie provided ample amounts of CGI action to keep the audience entertained. The action scenes where well choreographed and are enough to keep your inner child asking for more.The CGI was outstanding all around and provided plenty of moments to root for your favorite dinosaur. I was very impressed with the attention to detail that went into crafting each dinosaur. As far as being pure eye candy the movie succeeds all around.I will say I miss the elements of horror found in the original series. Gone are the days of being terrified of the T-Rex and Raptors. They are the good guys now! The T-Rex even saved the day three separate times in this movie. It's just silly, but that is what they are going for.Jurassic world 2 is not the kind of movie I really enjoy. It's big, stupid, and shiny with nothing more than action and CGI to keep you entertained. That being said there is an audience for popcorn flicks and if you can turn your brain off at the door it's not a bad ride. A 6.5 out of 10.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

255,Slarkshark,Entertaining but Nowhere Close to Being the Best Jurassic Movie,7,4 January 2021,"Ranks 4th out of the 5 Jurassic movies (the third is last for me). Unfortunately too many plot holes to get on board with.I like Owen (Chris Pratt) and his trusty sidekick Blue the Raptor. CGI is much improved from the first three Jurassic Park's; however the animatronics were so awesome and well used in the first two. The time on the island was beautiful and my favourite part, but of course too short.A few gripes... I wished they would have at least attempted to explain what happened to all the dino's on Isla Sorna. The truck literally jumping itself onto the ferry... at least put some kind of visible ramp on the dock so that it's not so ridiculous. The Indoraptor is extremely poor at its job; prototypes I tell ya. I guess we are suppose to believe about 20 dinosaurs or so, most of which are all different species are going to repopulate and live among us now? And lastly, do raptors have tear ducts? I genuinely would like to know.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
256,Fields201,Jurassic Rush,7,30 June 2018,"My mother had seen every Jurassic movie together and this one is no exception. I think my mother enjoyed it more than I did, but I can at least say the movie was entertaining, I was never bored, and I liked some sequences like the chase scene with the volcano and the sleeping T-Rex scene which were all seen in the trailers.Somewhere down the line, though, I started getting taken out of the movie. It starts out strong enough. We are taken underwater where a sub finds the skeletal remains of the Indominous Rex from the last film and takes a tooth from it for some reason. Then this poor bastard in the rain hears a dilophosaurus (which once again doesn't make an appearance which angered me yet again) and then he gets chased by a T-Rex. Then he escapes via ladder from a helicopter and laughs at the T-Rex until a reprise from the Mosasaurus from the last film chomps him. The helicopter goes unscathed and returns back to wherever it is returning to.This sequence, though thrilling, proves my point about films today. In the first Jurassic Park it took its time before the action and it was developing characters and a story. Audiences were bored of that so this sequence and the rest of the movie is purely action. We are then introduced to Claire from the last film who isn't as pompous as she once was, and now has two people working for her: A girl who looks like Velma from Scooby Doo and some wuss named Franklin. Soon Claire visits a place called Lockwood Mansion and meets with a guy who looks like a cross between Bradley Cooper and Patrick Wilson named Eli. They seem to know each other very well and Claire sees some little girl hiding from her. Eli tells her that they need the raptor named Blue from the last film and one man alone can retrieve it.That man is of course Star Lord himself, Chris Pratt playing Owen again. Like the last film she finds him in some secluded area where he's building a log cabin. She buys him a beer in some bar and Owen would rather Blue die in that volcano eruption and leaves her at that. Somehow his mind changes when he watches home videos from when Blue was a puppy so just like that, he was sleeping in their plane the whole night waiting for them. He even mentions to Franklin how he rode a motorcycle with a pack of raptors.Then, in some strange turn of events, the movie starts to copy Lost World. There is a bunch of mercenaries hired by Lockwood to find these dinosaurs and when Owen finds Blue, they suddenly turn on them and try to kill them. What? From this point on, it's nothing but action. When I say nothing but action, I mean one action scene to the next. One minute they are running from lava, the next they are underwater where Owen can shoots bullets and use a knife to open the gyrosphere. After that they rush to the boat and watch the dinosaurs die horrifically in the ashes of the volcano. Then they are trying to get blood from a T-Rex to save Blue.Then the movie starts to be more of a cartoon with this auction and characters better seen in a Looney Tunes cartoon. This is where we are introduced to yet another hybrid dinosaur called Indoraptor. I can't take this thing seriously. It's like every frame of it is like watching something out of Animaniacs or something. It's just not scary at all. There's even a scene where it plays dead and opens its eyes and smiles to the audience as its next victim looks away. It's really dumb.Another thing that bothered me as that the last half of the film felt very rushed. There's this quick scene of Owen, Claire and that kid running and it looked like they were just picking up on the yell ""Action!"" but then soon they are held at gunpoint by cartoon villains. Then there's a scene with Owen being saved by Blue out of nowhere (which is in the trailer) and yet after the events that transpired, how can this animal even trust him?Oh yeah, I forgot to mention Jeff Goldblum is in this movie. You would think this is a big deal but he's in it less than a minute of screen time. By the end of the movie, I felt like I barely got to know any of the main characters. They were just there trying to slug it through. No real character arc or development. The action scenes were thrilling, and the dinosaurs look good, so I guess that's all you can ask for in a Jurassic sequel.I know it sounds like I'm harping on this movie, but I did enjoy it for what it was and looking forward to seeing another one. I hope they take more time on that one because this one just felt uninspired in the end. I hope to see the likes of Dr. Grant in the next one.

258,kenyae-cagle,Eh..,4,25 June 2018,SPOILER ALERT: Jurassic World: Fallen KingdomI hated it. The movie was too cliche in a cringe worthy way. Kiss scene at stupid moment to prove a point.

And there were moments where people should've died amd they didn't.,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
259,bayardhiler,Good for What it is: An Outrageous Dinosaur Fest!!!,7,25 June 2018,"Let me start this review by saying I knew what this movie was going to be before I even stepped into the theater. I knew it wasn't going to be on par with the original Jurassic Park, I knew it wasn't going to win any Oscars or awards or any praise from critics. Nope, the only thing this movie was going to be was a ridiculous, unbelievable, farfetched dinosaur fest made for the summer blockbuster season to cash in on an established franchise. And sure enough, that's what I got. Does that mean it isn't entertaining? Not at all. In fact, if you go in to the movie with the same mindset that I did. there's a good chance that you will have a really good time for two hours. The dinosaurs look absolutely incredible with the CGI, the T-Rex is scary for the first time since Jurassic Park: The Lost World, the new genetic monstrosity that's created and known as the Idnoraptor is an awesome creature, and on top of it all, we have Starlord himself, Christ Pratt, returning as Owen Grady to save the day. In addition to Pratt, we also have Bryce Dallas Howard returning as Claire, and the addition of new characters played by the likes of Ted Levine and Rafe Spall. Unfortunately, where the movie goes bad is it's plot. If you've read up on this movie at all, you probably have a good notion of what it is so I won't go into too much detail about it other than to say that Claire and Owen are contacted by an old partner of John Hammond's, Benjamin Lockwood, (played by James Cromwell ) for a rescue mission be undertaken to get the dinosaurs off the old island because of an eruption of the island's volcano that will wipe it out all the dinosaurs and correct man's mistake. Little do Claire and Owen know, it's all a lie, as Lockwood's associate, Eli Mills (Rafe Spall) plans on double crossing all of them by auctioning off the dinosaurs for the highest bidding to anyone who will buy them, arms dealers, warlords, crooked corporate executives, etc. As a result, the movie goes from being on an island to being at a giant mansion where the dinosaurs are taken to be held, displayed on fashion runway, and then naturally escape to cause havoc. As you can imagine, this is where the movie is most farfetched and hard to believe, and has plot holes galore! Why go to all the trouble of using dinosaurs as weapons (in particular the Indoraptor) when drones and robot technology has made killing machines more efficient and deadly than ever before????? There are many more plot holes you can find from other reviews or by seeing it yourself; I just don't have the space to point them all out! Still, I can't lie, I enjoyed dinosaurs run amok in a large mansion in the dark of night and if you're like me, you will too. Bottom line is, this movie won't be one you'll remember or cherish for years after seeing it like the first JP. But if you happen to be looking for some mindless fun for two hours, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is your film.

260,n-kefala,Nothing new,4,10 June 2018,"These movies will go on and on, but some of us are still waiting for them to evolve. This fun addition to the dinosaurs disaster franchise doesn't do much that's particularly new and fresh. The truth is tha J. A. Bayona's ""Fallen Kingdom"" is more watchable than its predecessor, as the director adds some creepy moments as our heroes trying to save themselves, but it's still a pointless and visually exhausting chapter in a tired series of movies.
Bayona gives us a number of memorable set pieces combine tension and thrills in the right balance, but overall, these dinosaurs deserve so much better. Hollywood keeps telling the same stories over and over again, and I think if there are not good ideas, for ""Jurassic World"" extinction is the only cure.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
261,mgruebel,Tried and true formula,6,26 January 2019,"Big game hunter sent by bad guy (Jurassic Park II) cheats good guys, who get stuck in a museum with dinosaur skeletons, hunted by meat-eating-o-saurs while Jeff Goldblum pontificates (Jurassic Park I), and at the end escaped dinosaurs rampage on the mainland (Jurassic Park III).In many ways this flick pays homage and rips off earlier installments just like Star Wars VI ripped off IV (or I-II-III ripped off IV-V-VI). The acting in 'Fallen Kingdom' is routine but solid, the plot filled with minor (i.e. avoidable) plot holes but moving fast, the music a solid Williams rip-off, the evil corporate characters suitably slimy.But why do they have to: make food elevators in a mansion operate soundlessly without the bad guys noticing; make the good bedridden guy tell the bad guy 'to call the police' when (a) either the bad guy is innocent, no need to call or (b) the bad guy is guilty, in which case he has to kill the good bedridden guy; and so on a hundred more times.The sad thing about such plot holes is that they are totally avoidable without messing with the big picture of the plot. For example, the bad guy could overhear the granddaughter (actually cloned daughter) giving the good bedridden guy the heads-up on the situation, and then kill him after toying with him. Or the girl could not have moved the food elevator, and the bad guy left the room without checking it. And so on, and so forth.Bad screenwriters of blockbusters just don't seem to be able to resists cheap momentary thrills at the cost of plausibility. Which sucks because there's already enough suspension of disbelief required without that.But on the positive side, Fallen Kingdom, although formulaic, is solidly acted, stuffed with great action set pieces, gives its dinosaurs real character as much as possible, and of course, who can resist a film with a volcano blowing its top to annihilate an island.6/10 for nice action and badass 'saurs.

264,lucasnochez,Film Review--Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom/www.nightfilmreviews.com,7,30 October 2018,"In an age where narratives of superheroes, animation and science fiction rule the box office, there is one fossil amongst the great big box office contenders that audience just can't quite enough of. In Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the park may be gone, but dinosaurs are definitely here to stay.Fallen Kingdom is the fifth entry in the Jurassic Park film franchise and the second within the Jurassic World trilogy, and while it features the most amount of dinosaurs out of all the previous films, don't be fooled because the film takes place in only a few very specific locations and features the least amount of dinosaur action out of all of the movies. Yet, despite the very minimal action, the permanent set pieces and of course its fair share of charm and charisma, Fallen Kingdom is a Jurassic film unlike any we have seen before.Much of this might have to do with the inclusion of the franchise's newest film director, Spanish filmmaker J.A. Bayona. Bayona, who has previously directed The Orphanage, The Impossible and A Monster Calls, has quite an imaginative and generous eye when it comes to offering the embellished perspective of children, which, for many people such as myself, would warrant well for a refreshing take on a franchise that has been around for almost twenty-five years and on its fifth entry. Also, given the fact that many people who were first introduced to Michael Crichton's world of dinosaurs with Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park in 1993 were only just children or young adults, really plays well with an audience that is all grown up. Luckily for audiences, Bayona allows all of us old, matured, geeked out, nostalgia driven cinephiles to indulge in a film that is both the epitome of blockbuster/popcorn entertainment film, as well as a self-aware and respectable ode to some of our favourite monster movies.What makes Fallen Kingdom so consuming is the fact that Bayona treats the dinosaurs like monsters for just a couple minutes, but like any good classic monster movies, Frankenstein for example, the monster begins to resonate with audiences and become much more than just visual and visceral entertainment set pieces. For the first time in the cannon of the Jurassic series, the dinosaurs gain as much empathy as any if not more than the human characters we know or have grown to love.This love for the dinosaurs sets up the very relevant narrative in very pleasing fashion, especially since, the newly created dinosaurs of Jurassic World are threatened by a recently active volcano on Isla Nublar. And while political and government officials all over the world are trying to figure out if these creatures are actually worth saving from extinction...again, this threat allows a chance for redemption for our characters from Jurassic World.In comes in Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), the former honcho of the recently closed Jurassic World Amusement Park, who now has a career for the preservation of the dinosaurs species. So when the world decides that they are going to watch and allow the creatures to face their deadly fate, Claire is unexpectedly contacted by Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell), the silent partner to John Hammond's original Jurassic Park. Lockwood's extraction plan for the dinosaurs is headed by the idealistic pretty-boy Eli Mills (Rafe Spall), whose sharp suits heavily contrasts the safari inspired outfits of all the other human characters. Lockwood, who entrusts Mills with the whole operation, informs Claire that in order for the extraction to be fully successful, it is essential that they retrieve the second smartest creature on the planet next to human beings, Blue the Velociraptor. Yet, as much as they have already tried, capturing Blue seems close to impossible without the help of our Indiana Jones inspired hero Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), who aside from being the best dinosaur wrangler on the planet, also has the advantage of raising blue from infancy.While Owen, Claire and a few more new faces travel back to the Island, and face dinosaurs, active volcanoes and the basis of Murphy's law, their efforts to retrieve all the animals from the island are never what it seems.While Fallen Kingdom does take the dinosaurs our of the park, or in this case the fictional island of Isla Nublar, the looming doom and impending danger of the park is never absent and much of this danger is thanks to the wonderful vision of Bayona as well as a masterful score by Michael Giacchino. Giacchino, who elevates the original John Williams score in ways no one would ever think possible, raises the stakes and sonically charges the world of human eating creatures into a glorious manifestation of wonder and beauty. Fallen Kingdom really allows the composer to stretch his muscles and show why he is one of the best contemporary composers in film today.Thankfully for Bayona, a director who feature film debut is a horror film and a director who realizes the potential the franchise has adding terror and genuine scares to it, allows the newly popular horror genre (thanks to films like Get Out and The Shape of Water) to have such a large impact on a tentpole blockbuster film franchise. Implementing gothic elements of horror to the final act of the film, as well as feeding off his signature motifs of children nightmares and realities blending into the world of creature features, and of course not forgetting his admirable talent to honouring some of his favourite films, Hitchcock's Rebecca is the obvious one here, Bayona gives us the most deeply embedded, nerdy cinephile Jurassic picture to date.While many might see it bizarre that the director of Jurassic World was only a screenwriter for this film, Colin Trevorrow along with Derek Connolly (who were both screenwriters on the previous film), allow the narrative to go in many directions but find a nice intersection amongst the plot to tie everything together. Garnishing social/economical/political points into the script at every turn, including issues between the dinosaurs and human beings concerning ""animal cruelty"" or dino-cruelty if you will, as well as allowing the dinosaurs on being protagonists instead of antagonists, and of course showing snippets of good-old dinosaurs chomping, Fallen Kingdom easily goes down smoother than its predecessor despite some obvious missing plot points.Bayona's direction is easily the most visionary and artful of all the previous directors within the Jurassic franchise, really allowing the world to grow and explore new heights without much effort. While the real stand outs in Fallen Kingdom are the dinosaurs themselves, the only other honourable mention for human characters is the only child in the film, Isabella Sermon, who plays Maisie in the film, Lockwood's granddaughter. Not only is Maisie an integral part of the film's narrative and some of the biggest surprises in the film, but Maisie is also Bayona's secret weapon. Through Maisie, the director is able to effortlessly show the nightmares of a child and how they bleed into the world of adults, as well as glorifying disastrous world events with such ease and childhood innocence that, even amongst all the bloody dino violence, human sacrifices and inhumane treatment of such creatures, the loss of innocence and fear of a child is what makes the driving force of Fallen Kingdom so believable, so entertaining and most of all, so spectacular. Fallen Kingdom is easily one of the best entries to the franchise since Jurassic Park and one we cannot wait to explore in the third and final film.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

266,AnishMisra,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom Review,6,31 July 2018,"Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom is a film directed by J.A. Bayona. The trailers of the film looked quite good and with me liking the first part (Jurassic World), I was quite excited for this one. But alas, it mostly disappointed me.Plot: Owen and Claire travel to Jurassic World to rescue the remaining dinosaurs in Jurasic World from a volcano that would explode any minute.Story and direction: This film series boasts mainly for its special effects and visuals. That box is ticked with every instalment in this series and it never fails to impress me. The action sequences are spot on and have been directed very nicely. The character designs for the dinosaurs also surprised me. The music of the film is also wonderful (partial thanks to John Williams who did the main JP theme). The technical department work on this film is accurate and wonderful and never for a moment did I feel it was superficial. The main problem this film posed was the story itself. The story was just a normal action-adventure movie when I expected something more out of the film. While JURASSIC WORLD had its small character moments, this film fails in that aspect. Where the first half of the film felt justified, the second half is where the film goes downhill. The plot turns absurd and I was cringing almost every minute and waited for the film to finish. Even the characters (especially the villains) were poorly written. The film does have a post credit scene too, which was totally unnecessary.Performances: Chris Pratt was good at his role and did provide some comedy in the film. Bryce Dallas Howard also complemented Chris' character. James Cromwell gave a good performance. Justice Smith's character was very poorly etched and was very disappointing. Same can be said for Rafe Spall and Toby Jones. Finally, it was great to see Jeff Goldblum reprise his role from the previous instalments. Even though it was roughly a role of 10 minutes, it was a treat to watch him.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Own watches a video of him training Bue and the others raptors. This scene very well depicted the bond that Owen shares with Blue and how much he cares for him. If this theme was stretched a bit then the film would have worked wonderfully.Verdict: FALLEN KINGDOM felt more like a filler film which was just needed to make a trilogy. The scenes basically make no sense and were full of absurdity. This felt more like a money making vehicle. I do hope the third instalment (and the final one, hopefully) brings back a good story and throws back some sense into this series, that has just run out of ideas.I am going with a 6/10.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
267,highmarksreviews,The Kingdom Has Fallen...,6,8 July 2018,"Say what you will, I enjoyed the Jurassic World reboot back in 2015 and the sequel is almost as good. What struck me as odd, was how much emotional drama was put in into play here, and it wasn't half bad either. Sure the plot lacked integrity and the cast wasn't pushed to new heights by the script, but it was a slightly darker and thrilling spectacle nonetheless. And while dinosaur effects hold up this well, there will always be something to look for in this franchise. There were a bunch of cool and zany ideas that the plot explored, some better than others, but neither lacked potential really and the ending, while a little underwhelming in retrospect, opens up an intriguing new direction for the possible third outing. All in all, a perfectly acceptable dino flick with action and a surprising amount of heart to compensate for a slightly open ending and dumb narrative.The good:
-Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are still as good as they were back in the first movie
-The Indoraptor was a step up from the last big-bad dino
-Neat visuals and effects
-Isla Nublar scenes were winners
-Auction set piece was coolThe bad:
-Dumb script and story
-Tame jump-scares
-Forgettable and weird Lockwood family drama
-Ending was a little underwhelming",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

269,thepriceofpayne,Jurassic World: Fallen Franchise,5,2 July 2018,"I walked into this film already expecting it not to be as good as the classic Jurassic Park. I know you can't compare but none of the sequels have ever seemed to reach that level of fun, drama, thrill, And whimsy. That said I really liked Jurassic World (2015). So I was really excited for the sequel, and needless to say I was really disappointed. The fifth film in the Jurassic Franchise, had some interesting things to accomplish, and in its first act it does a great job. Bayona's direction really shines and we get some great character moments from Howard and Pratt (despite being broken up again) and newcomer Justice Smith is hilarious and one of the most memorable characters from the film. Pratt and Howard really have there hearts in the film delivering something special, to their characters that felt one note in the predecessor. And the return to the island is very emotional and visually dazzling, with a great underwater sequence, and a beautiful character reunion between Owen and Blue. It's in the second half where the film takes a real turn. The first half felt very emotional, stunning and at times gripping, but the second half has way to many ideas going for it. Introducing Tobey Jones' character half way through the film, the dinosaur auction, and the continued theme of animal rights in the film. Which may bring tears at some points, but then you remember these are dangerous Creatures that eat people! There is also a stupid, completely degrading twist with a little girl being a clone, which felt off putting and very B-Movie esque. Complete with an ending that makes our human characters make the dumbest decision in Movie history, realeasing the dinosaurs. I know what some are thinking, it's a simple escape movie just enjoy it. And I still did enjoy it, but there's still that voice in the back of my head saying ""This is the continuation to Jurassic Park"". The Lost World took itself seriously at least, JP3 while unessesary still had fun moments, and World was just a popcorn film that was entertaining. This film is entertaining just jumbled, unfocused, and forgettable. Which is not what I want personally from these films. That said the way the film ended leaves me extatic for the sequel, which feels like it something new and original is coming.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

271,TheMovieDoctorful,I'm As Surprised As You Are...The 2nd Best Jurassic Park Film To Date,10,14 November 2018,"It's very much worth noting that I absolutely hated the original Jurassic World. Colin Treverrow's 2015 reboot suffered from undeveloped and uninteresting characters, a lack of emotional stakes, hideous CGI and, above all, a distinct lack of any style or atmosphere. So how is it, pray tell, that its sequel, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, is one of my favorite films of the year and my 2nd favorite film in the franchise, surpassing even the 1993 Steven Spielberg classic? (For my money, nothing beats Spielberg's terrible and beautiful cautionary tale of nature, The Lost World: Jurassic Park) Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is the rare modern franchise reboot with identity, sole and purpose, the rare reboot that genuinely succeeds with flying colors in re-capturing the lightning in a bottle that made the original great. It's not rehashing the original film and condescending the rest of your franchise legacy with awful meta humor like Halloween (2018), it's forging your own unique identity and breathing new life into the series. And Fallen Kingdom does that wonderfully.If you asked me to describe any of the characters in the original Jurassic World beyond their one-note personality quirks, I'd come up completely blank. If you were to ask me to describe the characters in Fallen Kingdom, however, I could go on forever. Claire Dearing is the Dr. Frankenstein of the film; passionate, proactive and blinded by her own ambitions, hubris and sense of righteousness. Her entire reputation, everything she's grown into since the events of Jurassic World, any chance she has at personal redemption for the lives lost on Isla Nublar 3 years ago, hinges on her saving the animals she once viewed as nothing more than corporate assets. She is driven by her emotions (Particularly her deep seated personal guilty), passions and code of ethics rather than merely plot convenience or cold, unconditional logic as was the case in the original Jurassic World. This makes her character far more relatable and human and her errors in decision making a lot more forgivable and understandable. Her arc from self-tortured and arrogant martyr to willing and humble hero is handled with a surprising degree of subtlety that not many critics have given her credit for. Owen Grady also benefits from a stronger characterization in Fallen Kingdom, we get to see more of his relationship with Blue and understand why and how he formed such a strong relationship with her. Fallen Kingdom does an excellent job establishing Owen as a man outside of and uncomfortable with the civilized world, exhausted with the pretensions and self righteousness of his fellow human beings. The honesty, trust and unconditional love he's shared with Blue since birth means the world to him and his love for her is the one thing he has left that's truly worth fighting for. Because the cast is playing actual characters this time around rather than merely hollow archetypes, the performances improve tenfold. Bryce Dallas Howard is allowed to be confident, fervent and passionate in her vocal delivery. Chris Pratt is allowed to be emotionally vulnerable and nuanced in his facial acting.Even the dinosaurs have more character here than they had in Jurassic World; Blue's mini-arc of feeling distrust and abandonment from Owen to repairing their broken relationship is certainly more character development than any terrible lizard of Jurassic Park movies prior and the Indoraptor has both an odd sense of tragedy and unique, slasher villain-esque aesthetic that give her a real sense of identity that the Indominus Rex lacked.Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom possesses possibly the most striking and memorable aesthetic of any Jurassic Park film to date. The tone feels deliciously Gothic horror inspired with some beautifully chilling and dark imagery that really captures the feeling of terror and majesty held in the Crichton books. In an age where so many Hollywood blockbusters are so unbearably dull in their visuals, Fallen Kingdom retaining the style of a Gothic monster movie is as refreshing as it is gorgeous to take in. Also, it's definitely worth mentioning than the effects have improved significantly from Jurassic World, in large part due to the combination of CGI and animatronics and the darker pallete.Finally, I wish to discuss the film's ending and the character of Maisie, both of which have been under heavy scrutiny and both of which I loved. Isabella Sermon is one of the most endearing, ranged and talented child actresses I've seen since Danielle Harris and she does a phenomenal job handling her character's slow and methodical unraveling or her traumatizing origins. Maisie also brings real weight to the film's ethical question and a legitimate argument for why humanity shouldn't let the dinosaurs die. Maisie's creation as a clone was by all means unethical. However, this does not mean that killing or abandoning her would be the responsible decision to such an ethical mistake. This is why Maisie has to be the one to set them free into the world; she understands the ethical mistake behind their creation, but also that the murky ethical circumstances behind them is not necessarily their fault. She has an empathy for these creatures that none of the other humans do. The dinosaurs in Fallen Kingdom having much more in the way of characterization and personality already established the foundation for this argument and Maisie makes that argument all the more difficult to answer.If you had told me a year ago that I would be praising a Jurassic World sequel as the 2nd best in the entire franchise, I would have called you crazy. But, lo and behold...Here we are. I love this film to the point where I could defend it for hours. I love the themes, I love the performances, I love the characters, I love the effects. I loved it. I loved it. I'll keep saying it if you want me too.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

That said, the SFX were enjoyable, the action solid, and I got to see Buffalo Bill again as a mercenary semi-bad guy. This movie has some real heart to it. It builds the tension the whole movie. Unfortunately, there are a few too many Deus ex-Machinas (an ending that you never saw coming) and a few MacGuffins (plot elements designed to distract you and which play no part in the story).Now the negatives. The ending was the worst part of the whole movie. This starts and ends with Jeff Goldblum overacting in front of a Congressional Committee, and no his acting is 100% terrible. There are some usual cliches', but they don't overly take away from the action. Again, I cannot even say how good some of the SFX were.

275,joshbarton15,The park is gone... for now.,7,7 June 2018,"Twenty-five years ago, Steven Spielberg created movie magic with Jurassic Park, a film that redefined the blockbuster, becoming a worldwide phenomenon in the process. Thanks to 2015's Jurassic World, a film that smashed all sorts of box-office records, the franchise is well and truly alive, and the reason why dinosaurs are back on the big screen in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard), both former employees at Jurassic World, agree to travel back to Isla Nublar and rescue a number of dinosaur species before the island's dormant volcano decides to erupt.The idea of evolving the franchise ensures that we don't just sit through the same film of people being trapped on an island with dinosaurs again. You could sense from Jurassic World and the idea of training Velociraptors to follow human command that they wanted to take this franchise in a bold new direction. Events that unfold in Fallen Kingdom certainly confirm this and, for the most part, it's executed rather well.This film has a plenty of cases of smart people doing dumb things but when has there never been a dumb decision made in one of these films? I mean, John Hammond's decision to actually bring dinosaurs back to life is pretty dumb but hey, if he didn't do that, we wouldn't have a franchise right? So, while some of these characters and their actions may be quite irritating, I advise you to just go with it and enjoy the ride. J. A. Bayona throws back to previous instalments with certain sequences but this is most definitely a film with his fingerprints all over it. He delivers plenty of thrilling action but he combines it impressively with elements of horror to ensure that kids may find dinosaurs scary again. The opening scene of the film should be enough to convince you because it genuinely had me excited at what else Bayona had in store for the rest of the film.The effects are expectedly magnificent for a film of this stature, coming to the fore rather brilliantly in a pulsating sequence that sees the volcano on Isla Nublar finally erupt. They really do make settling into this type of film rather easy. What didn't feel as settled was Michael Giacchino's score, which felt bizarrely intrusive at times, not like his work on the previous instalment.Coming to the performances, as they did with Jurassic World, Pratt and Howard serve the film well. Pratt just has that charisma to make just about any role he plays insanely likeable, which makes it clear to see how he's forging such a career for himself. New additions to the cast will neither make or break the film because most people are there just to see the dinosaurs, and in Blue the Velociraptor and the new dinosaur named the Indoraptor, children will have a new favourite action hero and nightmare respectively.I've come to the realisation that they will never be able to make a film that matches Jurassic Park in terms of quality in what remains of this franchise but I'm ok with that. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom entertained me from start to finish and that's what these films should aim for. From the last shot of the film, if they're going with this franchise where I think they could be going, I'll be damned if I'm not in the queue at the cinema.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
276,jaredpahl,"In This Dusty Old Franchise, Dinosaurs Are Scary Again.",7,4 August 2018,"What a difference expectations can make. 3 years ago, I saw Jurassic World with the weight of a lifelong fandom and a 14-year buildup of anticipation on my shoulders. I had heard the critical hype, (The best of the sequels. Yeah right...) and I was let down. I eventually grew to like JW, but that film's sequel, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, came without its praise, and as a result, it left me pleasantly surprised the first time out. While it still may be the worst of the Jurassic bunch, Fallen Kingdom wisely chooses to go smaller and scarier, resulting in a movie that can be enjoyable because it doesn't choose to compete with its superior predecessors. The story centers on the destruction of Isla Nublar, the site on which Jurassic World, now abandoned, still sits. It is determined that the island will be destroyed by a volcano, killing all the dinosaurs living there. The ethical question is then posed, leave the genetically created creatures to die or save them from another extinction? In the ""Save the Dinosaurs"" Group is Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas-Howard), a reluctant Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), and new characters Franklin Webb and Zia Rodriguez. Claire and Owen resume their 'will they, won't they' schtick, while the new characters feel wildly out of place for the franchise. Never has Jurassic Park had such overt comic relief or girl power poster children. It's a shame they don't get eaten. On the other side are the villains of Jurassic World 2. Their names aren't important, just think of them as the value brand versions of Roland Tembo and Peter Ludlow from The Lost World. They are mean, and they want to exploit the dinosaurs for money. That's all you need to know.So there is at least one ethical dilemma presented in the picture, but that's not enough to qualify Fallen Kingdom's story as sophisticated. It's dumb, real dumb. However, After a mildly exciting first half on the island, with Claire and the rest attempting to locate Owen's beloved raptor Blue before the volcano erupts, the setting switches to a Northern Californian mansion owned by John Hammond's business partner, Benjamin Lockwood, played by James Cromwell. From there Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom finds its groove as a goofy haunted house movie.And that is the biggest strength of Fallen Kingdom. It is preposterous, and there are huge logical inconsistencies and plot holes, but because it embraces its place as a lean, B-caliber monster movie, Jurassic World 2 doesn't get the deservedly unkind comparisons to Spielberg's work in the series. And the real discovery of the picture becomes its horror elements. I thought that maybe after 4 movies, I had just become numb to seeing dinosaurs onscreen. The first two movies gave me nightmares, but with JP3 and JW, the Jurassic franchise seemed to have completely lost its sense of thrill in favor of fun. Thanks to horror director J.A. Bayona, Fallen Kingdom has brought those nightmares back. From the opening T-Rex ambush, Bayona makes it clear that his dinosaurs are movie monsters, but like all great monsters, these dinosaurs are scary. As I said before, the mansion is where Bayona really lets loose. There are some moments with the new Indoraptor that finally recalled the type of unnerving excitement and suspense that made Spielberg's Jurassic movies such great rides. Bayona has the filmmaking chops to tease an action scene. The lighting, camera angles, and staging in the mansion sets are surprisingly confident. Even with some good special effects work, including animatronics and puppets, the biggest thrill came from seeing actual filmmaking applied to the dinosaur set-pieces.Bayona is not in the same class as Spielberg, and this Jurassic movie is not up to the level of even Jurassic Park 3 or Jurassic World, which were grander and more fun, but it successfully carves out its own tangential spot in the franchise. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a well-made dinosaur horror movie. It had me jumping in my seat, biting my nails, and munching my popcorn like a madman. I would still gladly rewatch any of the other films before I put this one on again, but with expectations lowered to a reasonable level, there is plenty to sink your teeth into.71/100",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

But the movie felt more about Blue. Story was mainly about rescuing dinosaurs and saving them from extinction. However a double cross has happened and now we have a greedy business owner trying to sell dinosaurs for money. Their are bad points in this movie, spoiler alert: how does lava not burn you if you are so close to it?Ash and sulfur are in the air as volcanic eruptions occurs, how strange that they are not suffocating or coughing.Lava enters the water. How is Chris Pratt not burning up in the water?Something to think about while watching the movie. The movie had similar moves from previous Jurassic Park movies. If that upsets you, you should not watch it. But movie is more towards Blue. I have to say, Blue deserves an Oscar because that Raptor was so likable.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
280,pjgs200,"Not bad, but it feels totally uninspired",6,7 July 2018,"This is going to sound harsh, and I don't intend to put anyone down, but ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" isn't a very good movie. It's not entertaining, the script isn't thought through, the acting is okay (with Bryce Dallas Howard being the only person who actually did anything worth mentioning), and the new characters the film introduces are poorly written, stereotypical, and annoying. If I had to describe the film simply, it just feels like it's there, playing in front of you. There's no excitement, about one moment emotion (which is directed well), and little humor. It's not a bad movie, but it feels totally uninspired in almost every way.I liked the first Jurassic World movie, but this one isn't really worth watching. 6 out of 10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
281,paulijcalderon,"Humans and Dinosaurs working together? Will the film, huh, find a way?",5,8 June 2018,"Take a shot every time Bryce Dallas Howard does a dramatic head turn, and you'll be walking in circles by the end. They tried to transition into new directions, and the efforts are admired. Ultimately, the ""scary"" elements don't mesh that well with the action tone they got going. Colin Trevorrow, who directed the last film, wrote the script and produces this time around. The man's got decent ideas and the new director J.A Bayona has a good eye for interesting visuals and tension building. You get neat scenes and shots, but everything as a whole can't escape to not feel serious. It's a mixed bag of ""Hey, I liked that little funny moment."", ""Wow, those dinos are pretty clever"" and ""Yeah, now the T-Rex saved them last minute again.. Wonder if that will happen once more in the third act"".I'll say that I enjoyed most of the comedy and that action set piece at the end. If you embrace the ridiculousness of the scenario, you'll have fun. Mostly because the dinosaurs have nice personalities. So I liked that. Chris Pratt is still an action safari man, he survives anything and can fight his way through bad henchmen like it's no big deal. It seemed like they were kind of self- aware of it, so with that in mind it can be seen as a wink to the camera going ""Yeah, we know"". Whenever he's not training raptors he's a lumberjack man who wants to build a house. That was alright, and I honestly bought the whole raptor training aspect. It was nice to see human and dinosaur working together as a team. The big evil villain, the Indoraptor, he was great. Never have I seen such a sinister dino who even smirks to the joy of killing. Organically, the movie looks and feels like a proper ""Jurassic Park"" story, only that it takes some of the silliness to a new level. But, if they fully embrace what they were transitioning to, then maybe, the franchise can still find life... or if I rephrase; the film will, huh, find a way.I'm a little torn on weather I like this more than the fourth one. Maybe. It's generic, yeah, but I'm glad the second half did attempt to change the scenario. I'd be happy to watch a ""Jurassic"" movie without any human characters. Just have the dinosaurs, like that show ""Walking with Dinosaurs"". Well, with the preceding film we got Jimmy Fallon, but you know what, here we get Jeff Goldblum back. Even with a limited screen time, the phrase of ""more Goldblum the better"", still applies. Oh, and Geraldine Chaplin is always a delightful presence. She must be Bayona's favorite actress.PS: To me it looks like the series can evolve into a ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" type story, only that it's dinosaurs instead of apes. That's at least the vibe I got from it.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
282,domtaylor,The best 'Jurassic' film since the 1993 original.,7,10 July 2018,"'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' is, in my book, the best film in the 'Jurassic' franchise since the 1993 original. Sure, the story gets pretty stupid, especially in the third act, and the whole thing is extremely predictable, but director J.A Bayona is the first director in the franchise since Spielberg to be able to craft genuinely tense and exciting sequences. I think that his background in horror really helps him to understand how to craft what are essentially horror and not action set-pieces, and this somewhat captures the spirit of the original. The film also plays with different environments than we have seen before, which adds something fresh to the franchise. It's by far better than its immediate predecessor and, although there is exposition aplenty, the visuals and Bayona's staging of the tense sequences help to elevate this entry to the second best in the franchise. Saying that, it's nowhere near as good as the masterful original and is definitely still a modern popcorn blockbuster. The difference then between this film and the other 'Jurassic' sequels is simple: it's entertaining. 7/10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
283,KatMiss,"Painfully disappointing, but I understand why. **HUGE SPOILERS - DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW PERTINENT PARTS OF PLOT**",3,29 June 2018,"In comparison to other Jurassic Park movies, this one was awful. It was basically the exact same thing that has been done in every other installment, PLUS so many plot holes, the theater smelled of swiss cheese.The first few minutes were pretty similar to the opening scene of the first Jurassic park ... but in the water. It was a good scene nonetheless, and did what it was intended to do, which is grab the viewer's attention much like a dog whistle does to dogs. These types of scenes are basically a prerequisite now for any action movie, especially if they then have to divert to more boring scenes right after as filler, or to give you some back story, etc. It is what happened here. For the next couple of minutes we watched what would amount to all of Jeff Goldblum's cameo in the movie, which personally, I wish he had not been in, only because I prefer to have remembered him as the wise-cracking, Chaos-Theory spouting, flirty, strutting, young ""rock star"", and not the white-bearded old guy we saw. After that, you have scenes which could literally be used in videos for the cure of insomnia, where we get to meet the guy we all know is going to be the bad guy. The only thing he was missing, was a handlebar mustachio, and not even Babe's friend, Farmer Arthur Hoggett (James Cromwell) could save those wasted minutes. Cut to Owen and Claire's tear-jerking reunion (tear-jerking only because of its boredom), and we finally get to the barn door opening on one of the worst parts of the movie: the introduction to the tough as nails Latina and the nerdy black guy. Here, I have to honestly ask if it ever occurred to Claire (ahem), to get a nerdy computer guy who ISN'T afraid of his own shadow and isn't annoying as all heck? Like what did this guy have that any other computer guy who isn't as annoying and scared, not have, in order to solely qualify him as the guy you'd take to an island with KILLER DINOSAURS? For heavens sake. As for the Latina, well most of my friends are Latinas, and I can tell you that there is a far stretch from sassy to downright behetch. I'm not saying they should have gone for the sexpot stereotyped Latina, but did this one have to be so ... unlikable? That's just the beginning of this un-epic ride and I have to admit that I kind of tuned out after that, or wasn't really wholly immersed. It was fairly entertaining for a while, although again, everything you see was already done in other JPs. Even the bad guys on the island were cast out of the bad guys on the island before, except that before, they were more believable. Case in point, while I REALLY believe that true evil exists in the world and some people are more demons than people, the evilness in the main evil guy was split between evil and cartoonishly bad. Which brings me to the ""auction"".If ever there was a more hackneyed version of an illegal auction, it should be famous. This version was pretty bad. You have the bad guys in a dark, subterranean lair (WHY can't the auction be held with lights on? LOL), and they all look as if the stepped out of some comic book called 'Bad Guys in Bolero Ties and Leather'. The only thing that was missing, was a guy with a hook for a hand. When will Hollywood get that if you put together a convention of real bad guys from the dark web, they WON'T look like this.The part that really, really, really, really, really, broke my heart though, was the scene where Owen and Claire are being held in a cell, and Claire asks Owen ""Do you remember the first time you ever saw a dinosaur?"" It was a clear indication, at least to me, that even the creators of this crappola knew this movie sucked big time, so they wanted to manipulate the audience into trying to feel those same emotions - the emotions we first felt when we saw that first dinosaur on the glorious screen of the original Jurassic Park. It backfired in that, oh yes, I remembered, and thought, man, we've sure gone downhill.As for the big spoiler/reveal? The little girl is a clone. Now, it seems as if this was meant to mean something and to be part of the plot in some way that affects something else, but it isn't. If you had not guessed it before it's revealed, or even if you did, it makes not one iota of a difference to the movie. At all.Which brings me to the last part of my review. I understand. I understand that this movie was just filler in order to bring us certain things we need to know before the real blockbuster, without taking anything away from that movie. If I am right, and this is indeed the case, then as the good former engineer of the old Jurassic Park, John ""Ray"" Arnold (Samuel Jackson) said, ""Hang on to your butt's"", the next one is going to be a doozie.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
284,wycherleyp-960-470658,Poor sequel,4,10 June 2018,"I'm pretty honest when it comes to reviews so I'll carry on with the second Jurassic world film,The opening is great lots of fun, then as the film goes on the plot begins and it's not great. 
The best way to enjoy this film is to go in with no expectations and to not think about the story your watching.Chris Pratt does not seem to be into the second film as much as he was in the first one, I'm glad they decided to alter Bryce Dallas Howard character in this as she was a bit annoying in the first film, she is miles better in the sequel. Legendary Jurassic park favourite Jeff goldblum is under used and wasted and this film would be badly passable if they did not totally destroy it with one of the dumbest post credit scenes in movie history!!

285,cwade22,Had potential,4,7 April 2019,"So many flaws, but had potential. I Hate Comcast cable and nbc, so sadly, I try to avoid giving money to them. Even sadder, Comcast owns universal and nbc, so I can't even watch a movie without nbc forcing their dying msnbc network in. Really?! Msnbc is a credible news outlet? Maybe you can put nbc in a movie, but msnbc?! I'm glad I didn't pay money to see this movie. Every time I see Comcast on the opening universal title, I feel disgusted. Why can't we watch movies without having media forced on us? I guess if we watch Corporate media, we should ask ""why can't we watch the news without the reality tv aspect? Where's journalism? What are ratings? Where's the truth?"" I avoid all universal films because I know my money would be paying the salaries of the cowards who regularly lie in media. And RAISE YOUR HAND IF YOU HAVE COMCAST CABLE AND LOVE IT?! Nobody?! Comcast cable WAS THE WORST! Worse than Spectrum/time Warner(which is connected to cnn and sadly, now att). Yet, Comcast has a giant building in studio city and is owning universal?! How'd that happen?! I HATE the corporate media because I hate being lied to. So, despite the lying media being forced into a fantastical movie about dinosaurs, it still isn't warranted. If you're adding ""NEWS"" at least add a credible channel. Msnbc is not credible after 2 years of saying trump would be impeached, EVERY DAY. If you can forgive the fusion of Msnbc or cnn or Fox News with the movies they produce, then, fine. But I can't. That's not the only flaw, but it made me tune out when I saw ""MSNBC"" and I missed what the characters said seconds after.Writing/characters are a big problem. The movie had potential! Especially with the Indoraptor! But the characters ruined it. Mainly the Little CLONE GIRL and Claire! VERY ANNOYING and dumb at times. Example of claire's Ignorance: They needs to gather TREX blood to transfuse into Blue's blood. She gets in the trailer with the TREX, starts talking loudly, and Wasting time arguing. Then, she's required to Get onto the back of the T-REX, to get over/closer to the exposed Vein to stick the needle in. She doesn't carefully get onto the back, she JUMPS ON THE BACK of the sedated dinosaur. Doesn't she realize jumping on the think will wake HER?! Dumb! Maybe the writers thought that would be FUNNY?! But I never laugh at dumb characters doing dumb things.Maise the cute but very dumb, curious and annoying clone girl exuded some dumb parts. Most notably, the indoraptor prowl. She runs from him to her bedroom. He decides to go to the roof, rather than Break the dang door down! Maybe I should include the indoraptor as being another dumb character? The indoraptor gets on roof, outside bedroom window. Dumb but cute maise knows this, but stays in bed. She hides under covers, thinking it'll hide her. All she had to do was leave the room when she heard the thing jump on the roof. Dumb! THEN, at the end, She releases the dinosaurs into the Wilderness of California! Wow! Some carnivores are going to be eating all the liberal protestors blocking LAX and all the highways. I feel bad for all the homeless in San Fransisco and Los Angeles as they'll be first victims. Maise was RECKLESS! I know she's a clone, but she seemed smart. Her curiosity indicated she thinks! She failed to imagine the consequences of releasing dinosaurs into the wilderness of California, lol. This was released 2018, but I still haven't seen any dinosaurs in Los Angeles. Maybe I'm safe. Maise is annoying, dumb, cute and reckless. I pity the dude she marries.Another thing that I wanted to know was How did the Russian Man get all that money?! I'm curious because I need his job! Dude spent about $50MILLION at the auction. Also, LOCKHART! How did he and John Hammond get so rich?! SCOTLAND?! I need to go live in Scotland and get rich! Did I miss the origin details about how Hammond and Lockhart got their money?! Are we just to blindly accept that old white Lockhart is a rich man, without explaining his history?! I know it's msnbc, but TELL US THE DETAILS!I ALMOST took a Tinder Date to see this dumb movie! Glad I didn't! Tinder also is terrible. The movie had potential, but was sloppy in presentation. Seemed like so much was just thrown together. Quality is always better than quantity, unless it's money, and in that case, give me all the money!Lastly, I want to own, tax free, the Lockwood Mansion! I also want to have a Baby Girl Velociraptor and hopefully she doesn't grow to be 2 meters tall. Hopefully she stays cute and small, like a Mini Raptor! You know, like a mini pincher or Mini Cooper? I want a Mini raptor! Make it happen! Seriously, you know how profitable it would be to have mini raptors as pets?! SO PROFITABLE! And if we're cloning people, I'd like clones of Charlize Theron, Tara Reid from 1998, Lindsay Lohan from 2005, and so many other pretty ladies. Even that premise is more interesting than this movie. Maise is so dumb! ""I had to"" isn't a responsible thing to say after releasing dangerous creatures. Maise needs to be sued and sent to prison for what she did! Where are her parents? Lol",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
286,rabbitmoon,So bland. Tonally uneven. No memorable character moments. Awful.,2,6 June 2018,"Its as much of a non-film as I can remember. Somehow, Spielberg made a cup of water and the sound of footsteps far more suspenseful and engaging than anything in this movie. The dinosaurs are just sort of... there. Same goes for Chris Pratt, who features in scenes but only mildly forwarding the story with a few rescues or whatever. There are some cringe-worthy moments - firing a gun underwater to break glass, everyone being submersed but having perfect hair/makeup after, a horribly acted young girl who has the most shoe-horned and pointless subplot ever (as well as a nonsensical, cringe inducing climactic line). So much of the story makes no sense, a hybrid dino is basically produced and supposedly trained to follow laser sighting overnight. Yet has no buildup, suspense or point whatsoever. The whole thing is stranger than a David Lynch movie. Its like a string of bland cutscenes to a dull videogame.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
287,tresm87,At this point in the franchise we needed more than just Dinosaurs showing their teeth. We need a solid plot.,7,18 August 2018,"6.9/10 There were 2 things I was looking forward to most from this film. Bayona promised more practical animatronics used for the dinosaur effects, as well as more horror aspects in overall delivery. I think I maybe spotted only 2 scenes with actual animatronics used. The stegosaurus on the truck and the tyronnasaurus on the truck sleeping. Everything else was cgi and at times it looked fine but other times so shoddy. I get that in order to portray many different scenes and movements of this type of film cgi is necessary, but he definitely overhyped and led us along with that promise. As far as the horror themes went, there were some effectively shot and tense sequences though I wouldn't classify them as horror due to almost no blood or visceral human deaths, but as close you could get for a pg13. The plot gets damn right stupid and ridiculous when the greedy corporate tycoons start literally auctioning off the Dino's. It was almost unbelievable that they went that route. The story really doesn't go anywhere until the end and even that seemed so insanely far fetched and a huge reach to set up the sequel. The entire film to me seemed like an excuse to put as many different Dinos in as possible without having a solid plot or main point other than humans are evil and greedy. Honestly it really was a dumb film with some redeeming fantastic thrilling action sequences and visuals throughout, but really nothing more and at this point in the franchise we need more than that. The 2 new characters joining Pratt and Howard had to be the most useless and annoying characters of the franchise and offered nothing other than forced PC diversity. I did enjoy Levine and Spall as the main 2 villains no matter how cliche they were, they nailed the evil portrayals. Also the Maisie little girl clone should've been expanded upon if she has Dino dna, and hopefully they do something more with that though it will most likely be ridiculous. Overall this film is underwhelming but fun.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
288,thomvic,The awe of dinosaurs has lost its magic,5,7 July 2018,"I know many will inevitably compare movies in a franchise to the ones that came before it. it's kind of hard not to since without the originals, the sequels and follow ups could not exist. The original Jurassic Park had so many moments that are extremely memorable and for me will remain the best in the series.I enjoyed Jurassic World (the one before this) and took it for what it was worth - a kind of reboot for the newer generation while continuing the franchise for the fans. And for what it delivered, it was entertaining and decently plotted.Fallen Kingdom however is really more of a monster movie at its heart. There's a predictable formula of the dinosaurs escaping, the good guys get lost amongst all the chaos and the bad guy gets his due at the end. Now I don't mind the usual formula but as long as it can hold itself throughout the movie. This one unfortunately falls flat very early on.There are some very good action scenes but what is severely lacking is any build of of suspense. The opening scene of the movie was probably the most suspenseful part of the movie and if only it was able to keep the suspense going for the rest of the film, it would have been much more entertaining. I didn't really care about the characters at all and I actually found the overuse of the CGI with all the dinosaurs everywhere kind of feel like overkill. It makes the dinosaurs seem less magnificent and more like tons of extras.The music score also is very disappointing - there's none of the original Jurassic Park theme and is rarely used (except the end credits). I know that they are probably trying to distinguish this film away from the originals to make it feel fresh, but the plot itself is also dull. Not to mention there is a twist at the end with one of the side characters which felt like it was thrown out of nowhere as an afterthought and then is not even explored properly afterwards. If you were going for a shock, it failed miserably.I know the Jurrasic World films won't ever recapture the magic of the first film and I don't expect it to, but the fact that it can't even hold my interest all the way shows that these films have simply become action blockbuster films with no real soul in them anymore.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Unlike the previous instalment, where we see Claire undergo a character arc from career obsessed aunt to caring motherly aunt, this movie has none.

Bryce Dallas Howard does not enjoy much screen time (probably due to Pratt's star power) or any memorable scenes. The other human characters played by BD Wong and Jeff Goldblum are there just for continuity and provide continuity. Yet, there are spectacular actions scenes, and several dinosaur battles.

I don't really like the title, especially the ""kingdom"" part, but I wanted to give it a shot. And boy was I taken for an adventure. Everything I dislike about the previous entry in the series was mostly swept away and exchanged with better character development and the well-known intentions of some bad people close to the creators of the dinos, who want to either monetize or weaponize the dinosaurs, as was almost always the case. Chris Pratt is more likable this time, BDH is less annoying and more trying to make things right. I can't stress how much I really disliked the previous movie and thought this one would be even worse (because movie titles like this one don't sound too promising when it comes to quality content). But I was surprised in so many ways; the humor is way better and a lot less forced. The puns are spread wisely and there is a decent amount of slapstick comedy. The side characters are not just caricatures of SJWs or nerds, they actually get something to do. Overall this is a vast improvement on the series and a great way to introduce those who might have never watched a single Jurassic Park/World movie.

You can clearly feel the lack of passion and love for the art created; more than a simple movement designed to get as much money as possible. The only redeemable thing is probably the great special effects on dinosaurs, although you can still see them a little unrealistic or ''lifeless''. After that, the movie is a great Meeh, with no special features or truly iconic moments, and probably the most memorable moment in the entire movie is the death of a dinosaur on the island.

Ever thought of keeping a pet crocodile in your swimming pool & swimming with it? NO! And yet somehow we are going to save animals that are a real threat to humans & may not be able to be contained. There is some really braindead scenes of romanticising the dinosaurs. At that point, the humans are focusing on a brachiosaurus, much easier to feel empathy for than a velociraptor!There is a strange 'good guy, bad guy' undercurrent to this film, except its got a modern day rebranding with all the current versions in the world of who is good or bad.

The trailers did nothing for me, and after Jurassic World my excitement for a new movie was in the gutter. So I didn't see this in the theater. I could easily wait for DVD, and I'm glad I did.The plot is quite simple. It's been three years since the destruction of Jurassic World. Now a volcano is erupting and threatens to kill all the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar. Now a covert rescue operation is underway to rescue some of the dinosaurs and bring them to the mainland, led by Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) from the last film. However, a more sinister agenda lurks under the surface.The only redeeming factors in the first movie were the Indominus Rex and Chris Pratt. Here the main dinosaur threat is a smaller version of the Indominus, which doesn't appear until the third act. I even liked Chris Pratt's character less here, though I still enjoyed him.My expectations were very low, and I was somehow still disappointed. I just wanted a fun sci-fi b-movie like Jurassic Park 3 or Jurassic World. Granted, the first half of the film, on the island, was like that, but the second half just ruined it. The entire second portion of the film was about trying to escape this mansion, like it's Resident Evil, and it was so boring. The first half was a dumb fun b-movie, while the second half was a dumb boring b-movie. As a piece of entertainment, you can't get any worse than boring.So much stuff doesn't make sense. It flat out ignores the second and third movies, despite referencing them multiple times so they're clearly still in continuity. The effects are better than the last film, but not by much. The characters are even more bland and annoying than in Jurassic World and Jurassic Park 3 combined. At times I feel like I'm watching a Saturday morning cartoon rather than a Jurassic Park movie. Jeff Goldblum is in this for three minutes at most. He's a complete waste here. And just when the film starts to get mildly interesting it ends.Overall, Fallen Kingdom is the perfect title for this disaster, as it personifies a franchise that's fallen from grace. This is the worst Jurassic Park film. Jurassic Park 3 beats the crap out of this, in my opinion. It's not completely unwatchable. The first half you can enjoy on a dumb action level. Chris Pratt is good. It's not offensively bad or anything. I've seen worse movies. However, this is definitely a new low for the franchise.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

He and his men try to take dinosaur eggs off the island but failed . George devoured from the rexs . Howard king velociraptors ans Dodgson baby rexs . Zia Rodriguez has the same doctor training like Roberta carter who sees an 18 year old attacked from a raptor . Franklin wears the same glasses as Arby in the lost world novel.

304,jeannefrancoise,Bold idea but not highlight the deep meaning,7,8 June 2018,"Dear movie freaks, I am so happy finally I watched Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, because I am happy when somebody still survives, even though there is T Rex side to side of him/her. Jurassic things is about survival and how deep we can go to the fear of extinction that became the main idea of whole story here. Unlike other Jurassic movies, here there are some sad scenes about the human choices to direct dinosaur. Human is being boss for other creatures, but in some point money can lead also the mentality of human. When human becoming not focus, the dinosaur lead themselves. This is really intriguing idea. The movie can blend the sci fi and drama in this point, but still stick to the memories came up about the human error in previous ""Dinosaur Park"". That's why the scene begins with a trial because human rights concern also other creature's destiny, to be exist or not to be exist. This kind of philosophical question is well-acted by the actors and actress, yet the touch of comedy that make us still have fun and relax in some creepy scenes. Of course there are people being eaten by dinosaur. How big they are and how big problem coming to human, is also being thought by the Director. The fear is not coming along just like that, but well edited by Editor by the help of Cinematographer. For me, this movie is movie for holidays, without really deep sense of meaning that can stick to our heart, well perhaps audience already think the ending and already being normal to see dinosaur in this movie. I think we must improve in some point of delivering a sci fi. Please continue to make Jurassic World: Rising Kingdom maybe...lets see....",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
305,nafodude,More of the same,5,29 July 2018,"Not much to say except this film offers more of the same. Although there really aren't many storylines you can get out of mixing carnivorous dinosaurs and human beings. On the other hand it was an easy watch and does get you caring slightly for these amazing creatures. 
They really need to call it a day though but unfortunately have left it open for another.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
306,garethvk,A Solid Follow Up And Good Summer Entertainment,8,21 June 2018,"It has been three years since ""Jurassic World"" kicked off a new trilogy of Dinosaur films and successfully rebooted the ""Jurassic Park"" series which had been dormant for over fourteen years. The new film ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" centers on an urgent need to save the dinosaurs from a pending volcanic eruption. This kicks off a huge debate as to the ethics about saving resurrected animals or simply letting them go extinct once again amongst government leaders.
Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) leads a group hoping to lobby support to save the animals and just when things look darkest, hope arrives with an offer from wealthy industrialist Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell), arrives. Lockwood worked with Sir John Hammond to create the creatures many years ago and despite a falling out, he remains passionate about protecting the creatures and wants Claire to help save some of the creatures and relocate them to a private sanctuary. Claire is needed as she has a radio frequency which will make locating and saving certain species easier and she is tasked to take Owen (Chris Pratt), with her to retrieve Blue the Velociraptor.
The fact that Owen and Claire are on the outs is a challenge but the chance to see and save Blue gets him to join the trip and they set off with a team to accomplish their task.Things do not go as planned as it seems that there is a nefarious plan in place unbeknownst to the ailing Lockwood where animals are being captured in an effort to sell them as organic weapons and collectibles.Things go into high-gear when it is learned why Blue is so important to the plan and with a new and very deadly species of Dinosaur introduced, things are about to get very dangerous.If you have seen any of the prior films you will know that there will be plenty of Dinosaur carnage and destruction on hand and that the humans must face their own creations in a battle to survive.The film takes what to me was a glaring hole in regards to why not simply make new creatures versus the debate over a rescue and gave it a very sobering and sadly understandable answer.The effects in the film are first-rate and the film does hold your attention and provide some very exciting moments. Some may say that after five films it is hard to recapture the sense of wonder as after all; the film is bound to eventually become creatures on the loose with humans caught in the middle.Director J.A. Bayona keeps things moving at a brisk pace and does have a script with a few nods to prior films in the series. While some may want to detract the film as mindless entertainment, the film is better than the two sequels to the original ""Jurassic Park"", and does provide enough good moments to keep fans happy. I look forward to seeing what the next film in the series offers as this is pure summer entertainment at its best.4 stars out of 5",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
307,CriticalOfEverything,Oh dear.,2,29 June 2018,"The first Jurassic World wasn't anything original, but I found it to be decent and I would still recommend it to fans of the franchise. It's the second best one in the franchise for sure which isn't saying much as nearly every sequel to the original is utter garbage. But this movie, good lord this is a train wreck. The script is so bad, like, SHOCKINGLY awful. It lacks any genuine thrills and since this is a Jurassic Park movie, that's terrible. It repeats the same boring love story from the first Jurassic World and Chris Pratt isn't as charming as he usually is which is just straight up sinful. The CGI and effects are very good, but that's really the only upside to this broken dumpster fire. It has a stupid and awful script, bad characters, mediocre acting, a moronic twist and it lacks any thrills or decent attempts at humour. This is easily one of the worst Jurassic Park movies and shows us that this franchise is doomed and will never be as good as the first one, which still holds up tremendously to this very day.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
308,byson5186,Jurassic Park Is 25-Years Old,5,28 June 2018,"No doubt, one of the best movies ever made is Jurassic Park. Despite seeing that movie numerous times, it never gets old. If you're up for a movie night, an entertaining thriller, Jurassic Park is an ideal movie to see for a movie night.Since Jurassic Park came out, they have done sequels and rewrote the story to Jurassic World. I will say, I thought it was impressive with the first Jurassic World of how they finally got a secure dinosaur amusement park. It felt like a real place!! I wish this new movie had included Gray and Zach from the first to give more of a sequel feel.Anyway, I just want to say that they seem to have trouble coming up with sequels and make them appeal as much as Jurassic Park. For one, I feel like the dinosaurs looked and seemed more realistic in Jurassic Park with practical effects than they do now as CGI. I also thought their eyes looked more realistic in Jurassic Park. With CGI being so big nowadays, I still am often times more for the practical effects. In Jurassic Park, the dinosaurs look like dinosaurs, but with the CGI we have nowadays, some of the time while watching this new movie, I thought the dinosaurs looked like they could be aliens instead from an alien movie attacking.Another thing to mention is we remember and like the characters from Jurassic Park: Alan Grant, Ellie Sattler, Ian Malcolm. In these Jurassic World movies we think of Claire and Owen as the main characters. There are other characters, but mostly these characters in the Jurassic World movies aren't all that interesting, just like characters to play a scene in an action movie with dinosaurs. There's like no character development in this movie, as a good part of Jurassic Park is how we see character development with Alan Grant.I ought to say, I thought the action sequence we see from the trailer with the volcano was cool. Often times when we think of dinosaurs we think of volcanoes. But, I thought the other action sequence, while it still kept you on your seat I thought of it as cheesy, and not really seeming realistic, just including action scenes with dinosaurs.While this movie was okay, it's not a movie I'd really care to see again or really recommend seeing. It entertained me, but didn't really leave me feeling excited. I'd leave it at a 5/5.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
309,valen060,Danger: Adrenaline Up! Park In Ruins! Explosion Imminent!,7,28 June 2018,"Following from the success of Jurassic World, this is an intense movie where the stakes are higher than before and interesting twists that grow even more intriguing. My adrenaline kept going up as I witnessed Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard return as the lead roles Owen and Claire, while they take on another challenge in the ruins of the abandoned theme park.Three years have passed and with a volcanic eruption imminent on Isla Nublar, it's up to former park employees Owen and Claire to take on their newest challenge: Rescuing as many roaming dinosaurs and getting them to safety. But for Owen, it's about finding the last surviving Velociraptor he personally raised, Blue. As before, this also attracts attention of corrupt individuals willing to use these dinosaurs for nefarious purposes as well as encountering a new species of dinosaur never seen before.Director J.A. Bayona definitely painted a darker picture in the Jurassic Park universe. Story-wise, I say this latest installment is basically a dark clone to its 1997 predecessor The Lost World. And the return of Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm was worthwhile and a nice touch to said film, but I kind of wished his role was expanded more than given here. James Cromwell's role as Ben Lockwood is an interesting person with his ties to the late founder of Jurassic Park John Hammond. Given Chris Pratt's reputation in action-adventure films, his performance kept me on the edge of my seat as I simply just picture him as Star Lord on a separate, solo mission. I know there's still a sequel film on the way following from this and judging by what the end result of the movie had shown, it feels unfinished. The story comes in short supply, but the performances were more than enough to keep an open mind.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
310,clock_me,huge fun will not dissapoint,10,10 June 2018,"Back in 2015 when Jurassic world came out i hated it becuase it was trying to redo the first film and instead of doing anything new or exciting all they did was enticingly cloned a dinosaur
now comes the sequal and let me just say I havent had so much fun watching a dinosaur movie since the lost world and the humor thogh out the film hits in the right spots as for emotion there a quite a few im not going to tell you where to spoil anything, 
even thou they just redid the same old same old from number 2 back in 1997 this films has a hell of a lot of more scares suspense great characters and yes the beloved blue who you can't help but love
and the dinosaur that headbutts was just way to cute
also it was nice to see Jeff Goldblum again even if was only for a breif moment or so
anyone who hated the third and hated Jurassic world will appreciate this one if they used cgi in this movie i could not tell this is a must own for a movie buff like me
and the ending made me smile knowing that there will be a number three",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
311,Sunsphxsuns,"Charming! Alarming! Chomping! Stomping! Yep, It's All That . . . And More!",8,25 June 2018,"With the fifth installment of the Jurassic series, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, doesn't disappoint. The story unfolds quickly. The dinosaurs must be evacuated from a terminally unstable island, either that, or perish from the unstoppable power of an exploding volcano. The ""bad guys"" want to ""weaponize"" dinosaurs. The ""good guys"" want to save the remaining dinosaurs. And of course, all of this will eventually lead to seriously uncooperative dinosaurs who can't help chomping down on bad guys who continue to underestimate their ability to adapt and survive. It's classic stuff - and halfway through this film I found myself already yearning for a sixth Jurassic movie.The plot is essentially basic: Human villains VS human protagonists, with a plethora of toothy dinosaurs thrown in the middle. But now we get to go beneath the surface and learn more about relationships, and not just the human ones. In Fallen Kingdom we are allowed to discover the delightfully warm relationship between our favorite semi-domesticated velociraptor, Blue (played by Blue) and our favorite hero, Owen (Chris Pratt). And don't worry, because there are also plenty of scenes with Pratt and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard), all shamelessly designed to make you sigh and smile. Indeed, my only true disappointment with the film is that we only get to enjoy a brief cameo appearance from Jeff Goldblum who shows up in a congressional committee lecture to discuss how technological advancements precede our capacity to use it responsibly. Of course we've heard this before, but it's a vivid reminder that you can't cheat Mother Nature. And when we try, we get . . . Jurassic Headaches!The CGI and ""Animatronics"" are convincing and visually stunning, with plenty of stampeding, marauding, stalking dinosaurs. There is even a new ""whatever-o-saurus"" that participates in some very intense and scary scenes as ""she"" chases humans down hallways of an incredibly gothic looking mansion. It's all there to absorb in several outrageously well paced scenes. This is a genuine action movie, make no mistake about that. It moves quickly.6.6 so far in reviews? Hogwash. This is an entertaining thrill ride that delivers. On an estimated budget of $170,000,000, as of June 26, 2018, the Cumulative Worldwide Gross currently stands at $715,024,610, proof that this brilliant franchise has legs and is going to be around for a long, long time. If you want a philosophical film, go see On Golden Pond. If you want to see big-ass reptiles with insatiable appetites chasing down and devouring hapless humans, then this is your ticket. It doesn't need to be more complicated than that, and I'm certainly happy if this new plot becomes the blueprint for future installments.Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom plays well on what this franchise does best. Just get in line, find a seat, and enjoy yourself. And as the theater lights dim, try to remember what Jeff Goldblum once said, ""Be afraid. Be very afraid.""",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
312,DeadMansTrousers,Honest review from someone who grew up watching the originals.,6,18 September 2018,"I am a child of the 90s, my family owned the original Jurassic Park on VHS for my entire life and I've seen every film since The Lost World in the cinema. So it pains me to say that this one really does lack a certain magic that the original films had. This isn't the worst movie ever made but when you find yourself using the same type of dart joke that was used in Ace Ventura, you know something has changed. I disagree with the people who complained that the dinosaurs look ""too fake"" I think they're fine. Overall it's an entertaining movie for what it is, but you shouldn't compare it to the originals.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
313,ajzeg,"While this isn't the worst movie I saw in 2018, it is by far the most disappointing.",2,15 September 2019,"I'm not even comparing it to the original Jurassic Park, no Jurassic sequel could be as awesome as that! No, this movie absolutely pales in comparison to the last movie, Jurassic World! While that movie had a pretty weak story and characters, the action was absolutely thrilling and I regularly rewatch it for that alone. It's tied with Star Wars: The Force Awakens for my favourite movie of 2015. Fallen Kingdom didn't have any of that. What little character the first movie had was gone, replaced with cartoon characters with exaggerated and over-the-top personalities, and it was much tamer in comparison. Most of the movie is set in a house and there's only one dinosaur on the loose! What kind of Jurassic movie is that? That's like something someone would make up as a joke, making fun of movie series that have clearly run out of ideas! Also, out of all the subplots in Jurassic World to follow up on, why did they choose the weaponized dinosaurs? That was by far the weakest aspect of Jurassic World! It's stupid and makes absolutely no sense! There's a lot of that in this movie, it feels like a Saturday morning cartoon! I have to say though, the ending was pretty awesome. I wish I didn't see literally all of it in the trailers. I'm looking forward to Jurassic World 3, it has a very interesting setup that really makes me wonder why they didn't just make that movie instead. They could've easily skipped over this movie and made the next movie this movie! Anyway, as you can tell, I really didn't like this one.

 The sequels however have become stale, repetitive and worst of all, boring. How many more times can you do the ""no one ever learns from previous mistakes"" routine. And then throw in the dumb and obnoxious military and then always have a kid or two around just to scare. Great CGI does overcome a monotonous script.

It's a movie about dinosaurs for god sake and people can suspend their disbelief for that fact, but not others. I take a movie for what it is and can find the entertainment value in it. I refuse to see a movie about dinosaurs and then try to act like Gene Siskel the entire time.

321,WooderIce64,Fun Popcorn Flick,6,28 June 2018,"Jurassic World was one of the biggest popcorn flicks of the decade. It's a fun movie, but that's about it. It borrows a lot from Jurassic Park, and relies heavily on nostalgia. Fallen Kingdom is a follow-up to it. It does have quite a bit in common with the first film, notably that it's nothing more than a decent popcorn flick. Most of the good qualities about the movie come from that. The visual effects are spectacular. The dinosaurs still look awesome. The action sequences are great. Some of the new stuff is also interesting. The second half of the movie is set in a giant mansion, rather than in the park. This is a very neat setting for this movie, and a welcome change of pace for the franchise. The first half is a rescue mission, which isn't particularly interesting and feels rehashed. The second half makes up for it. The new characters are nothing to report on. Gia is this sort of dinosaur veterinarian. Not much else to say. Franklin's whole thing is that he's a coward, and that's all there is to him. He shows up for a few jokes, and that's it. Maisie is the granddaughter of John Lockwood, John Hammond's former associate. After all, it wouldn't be a Jurassic Park movie without a kid. Is it just me, or is every child actor out there British? Not that that's inherently a bad thing. Lockwood himself appears as a dying old man. The non-dinosaur villains are lame, but then again, since when were Jurassic Park villains not lame? Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) return from the previous film. They're given most of the attention, as they are the main characters. Dr. Wu returns from the other films, although here he's a villain of sorts.I think the problem here is that it wasted too much potential, for new ideas and nostalgia appeal. For the latter, the ads heavily featured the return of Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum), who gets 2 minutes of screen time at max. It also could have made better use of the classic John Williams soundtrack from Jurassic Park. It's in it, but only once in the movie and once in the credits. Look how well that worked for the new Star Wars movies. For new ideas, there's a twist involving Maisie that's totally out of left field and only referenced once, but was interesting and had the potential to bring a whole new edge to the series. The cliffhanger ending was a good new idea, and leaves open the ideas for what will happen when Jurassic World 3 inevitably comes out.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

323,Joejoesan,"No fan of Jurassic World 1, but this one's pretty good",8,6 June 2018,"In 1993 Jurassic Park made a big impression on me. I even thought its two sequels weren't that bad. Jurassic World was the movie I didn't like. To me it was a mildly entertaining mess and its global success was a total mystery to me. I really wasn't looking forward to seeing Fallen Kingdom, but luckily I did. Surprisingly it's very good!The story picks up four years after Jurassic World. The dinosaurs of the island Isla Nublar are in danger because a volcano is about to erupt (!). Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) wants to save them and gets an offer from Benjamin Lockwood, former partner of park founder Hammond, to relocate all the animals to a new island where they can live undisturbed. She agrees and even convinces her (now) former boyfriend Owen (Chris Pratt) to join her. Back on the island they discover that they have been lied to and that their own actions have led to this...Fallen Kingdom isn't the big Chris Pratt show and that's a good thing. Don't get me wrong: I love Pratt, but in terms of characters the film has a lot more to offer. Bryce Dallas Howard gets most screentime and even the kid in the movie, old Lockwood's niece Maisy, isn't annoying like the ones in the previous films. She's a real heroine. The role is played by first timer Isabella Sermon, of whom we without any doubt will hear much more from in the future. Well done!The first half of Fallen Kingdom, when the gang gets back together and discover what happened on the island, is the best part. The hommage to Raiders of the Lost Ark (""Jock! Start the engine!""), when Owen and Claire must run for their lives because of the eruption and dive into the ocean (as seen in the trailer) is the best sequence. But there's also a lot of fun in smaller scenes. I won't spoil it for you, but there's a moment when Owen gets drugged and something very dangerous is approaching him. In typical Pratt fashion he escapes. In another scene he has to draw blood from a dinosaur in a truck. Very funny.I also like the fact that Fallen Kingdom does a lot with suggestion. In Spielberg fashion we see a lot of silhouettes of dinosaurs which adds to the suspence. It also makes the film look very good. The ending of the movie is a bit strange, though. It's okay to have a heart for the dinosaurs, but to do something like that... well.. that's pretty extreme. It does make way for an interesting part 3.Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom will be the big summer movie of 2018 and without any doubt rule the global box office. It deserves that success because it's a well crafted and very entertaining action movie. The special effects are excellent and the characters are more interesting than in most action flicks.

The first of the Jurassic novels by Chrichton was a book that you couldn't put down as most of his work was. The first movie by Spielberg, while lacking the finesse of the novel, was also a masterpiece of sorts because it gave the dinosaurs flesh and bone through superb CGI that was indistiguishable from reality. I loved it even if the cast was wasted on it.None of the above can be said in this sad and offensive mimicry of the forebearer of a dwindling franchise that should go extinct as the protagonists did millions of years ago.Pathetic plot, amateurish writing, cardboard characters, even offending CGI. If you have seen any of the previous, you must know that this staircase only goes down, like an escalator. Starts with a stupid premise and doesn't lift an inch from the ground through the whole of the footage, until the very stupid ending. It pains to see how low have names of once great performers like Bryce Dallas Howard, James Cromwell and Jeff Goldblum have descended. They must really be strapped for cash.Not even Spielberg could have saved it from the trash can where it belongs. Don't waste your time, it will only make you angry.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

328,eparazak,"I enjoyed the movie, but I am aware that it's very, very flawed.",6,26 June 2018,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is the latest addition to the Jurassic Park franchise. Isla Nublar, the home of the dinosaurs for many years is about to fall apart thanks to a volcano that has apparently gone active on the island. As such, it is up to Owen and Claire from the previous film to work together with a mysterious group to help bring the dinosaurs to a safer location before it's too late.I like the first Jurassic World, mostly. The characters outside of Claire and Owen may have been on the bland side, but I still thought the effects and story were still pretty good either way. When it comes to the effects, they still are really good. The CGI from the dinosaurs to the volcano eruptions look incredibly convincing, and the production design of the movie looks beautiful. Some of the dinosaurs weren't even created out of CGI, some were done through the means of animatronics, and I couldn't tell much of a difference myself.The story, however, was a mixed bag. There were some elements that I really liked, particularly the dark and thrilling scenes. A large majority of the previews and trailers of this movie take place on the island, where they all begin their escape. That takes place in the beginning of the movie and puts the movie onto a great start. However, I feel like the plot begins to go downhill, where we get some very dumb cliches, the main villain, for instance is a walking cliche. After the whole escape from the island, the next 45 minutes or so become very tedious. We don't necessarily learn anything new about the concepts in the Jurassic Park franchise. Instead, it mainly involves bickering about money. There is a concept that does feel like it was rehashed from Jurassic World which I won't get into for spoiler reasons, but at the very least it elevates the conclusion and makes it enjoyable to watch.Something that also bothers me about this movie is that there are certain times where it feels like it tries to set up a sequel. The ""twist"" after the beginning feels like it's trying to derive from the main plot in order to set up and continue the plot from this movie into the next installation. I know I'm not necessarily alone on this because there is a Forbes article talking about this.Despite my criticisms with this movie, I still enjoyed it. I already talked about the visuals. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard's performances were really really good. I loved the darker and tense moments that kept me on edge during both the beginning and the climax. In general, I genuinely enjoyed the experience despite my flaws with this movie's storytelling and I wouldn't mind picking up the Blu-Ray when it comes out.6/10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
329,pcrprimer,Uninspired and a letdown from the previous sequel,5,2 December 2018,"Since the original Jurassic park movie, the sequels have never striven to be more than fun, action movies filled with dinosaurs and special effects. With that in mind, I didn't expect much in terms of story and script going into this movie. Yet the weak script and uninspired acting did not meet the already low expectations. The action scenes did have many throwbacks to the original Jurassic park movie, but they did not have the same excitement, nor immersiveness of previous movies.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

333,Mccadoo,A great example of a franchise being squeezed dry,5,25 September 2018,"The first Jurassic Park movie is a classic. The second was terrible, absurd plot, idiotic and unlikable characters, just terrible. The third was ok, it had some good moments, but not a tent pole movie by any measure. The last movie, the first with Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard was pretty good, and I thought hey, they've revived the series, at least approaching it's previous luster...Then I watched this movie. Don't get me wrong, I didn't hate it, not like I hated the second one, but it's not a great movie, and it shows that Hollywood will keep squeezing every last drop out of a franchise to earn a few bucks, long after they should just let it go. There is only so much you can do with dinosaurs. As said, I didn't hate it, but it has a lot of really bad stuff in it, starting with the plot itself. The island the dinosaurs are living on has an active volcano that's about to erupt so Claire wants to save them from going extinct again!?! I'm sorry but weren't there two other islands with dinosaurs on them? And weren't these dinosaurs cloned in a lab? So, even dismissing the other two islands, couldn't you just clone some more if these die? So right out of the gate the premise was really stupid.Then, the rich evil industrialist (Hollywood hates rich industrialists, don't they? never mind that they create companies that provide jobs, and they fund innovations that move society forward and on and on...like maybe Bill Gates? But I digress) the rich evil industrialist wants to steal the dinosaurs to sell to the highest bidders, and the biggest ticket item is a genetically modified raptor that can be ""weaponized"" to give some army an edge on the battlefield. And here we have stupid plot twist number two. Has anyone who worked in this script ever seen, or at least studied, a modern battlefield?? Their super raptor would last about ten seconds before a tank or a close support aircraft, or hell, even a ground troop with a handheld rocket launcher, smoked it's genetically modified ass. We're in the age of mechanized warfare here people, the days of Godzilla attaching Tokyo are kind of over.So, the basic foundation of the plot is dumb. But even with that I was willing to suspend belief (it's only a movie after all, and one about dinosaurs at that) and have fun with it. Except for one other thing that really jumped out at me. Now, I thought that Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt both just kind of sleep walked through their roles, neither showed much personality at all, and Howards character somehow transformed from a high-powered executive to a bunny hugger trying to save the world. I guess that could happen, and Hollywood loves bunny huggers, but shouldn't she have first had to serve a little time for her role in the dozens of deaths that occurred in the last movie? Anyway, Howard and Pratt didn't seem to really want to be there at all. And the actress who played the little girl wasn't that great but she's young, still time for more acting classes. What really jarred me out of the movie whenever she was on screen was the absolutely horrible performance of Daniella Pineda. She was so over the top over-acting in every single scene she was in it simply ruined every one of those scenes. I mean, this was one of the worst acting performances I've seen in years, a lot of years. Who in the world decided to put this woman in this movie?? She was horrible!And never mind that her character was insufferable to begin with, and did some really stupid stuff. That was all overshadowed by her utter lack of talent. When they first got to the island and she, in a galactically stupid move, jumped out of the vehicle to do some stupid thing or other, I was hoping that something was going to eat her right then and there, thus sparing me, and anyone else who ever watches this movie from any more of her ""acting"". Anyway, rant over and I apologize but she really was that bad. As I said, I didn't hate this movie, it was kind of entertaining, if you checked your brain, and your logic, at the door. But it definitely proves beyond any doubt that the Jurassic Park franchise should be laid to rest. Unfortunately it ends laying the groundwork for yet another movie which I probably will watch...with very low expectations. I only hope that they hire script writers next time with IQ's that register above room temperature, that Howard and Pratt at least put a little effort into it...and that Ms. Pineda is NOT in the movie.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
334,gb901,Ultimately falls flat,5,7 June 2020,"Would any government let dinosaurs - particularly very dangerous carnivorous ones at that - roam free? No, obviously not, so goldblums characters announcement of welcome to ""Jurassic world"", is, frankly, ridiculous!

335,VikiLauda,JP meets Hammer House of Horror!,7,25 February 2019,"I have to admit I quite liked this, but it is far from perfect. It's more like the entertaining movie escapism of yesteryear, with little PC agenda, which I found refreshing!
The plot is actually nearer to the feel of the original JP book, in other words BG corporate big money agenda who has no idea what they are messing about with. Yes, sure some of it is far fetched, but that is what is missing in movies today, but the plot is ok and the pacing is good. A real popcorn muncher. I felt that some of the suspence sequences were a little too drawn out such as the pod in the sea section, as well as the T Rex blood transfusion, neither of which came off as suspensful. But I like the light humor, & the character development (a little lost with the little girl side plot?) However the creepy mansion was what really tickled my ""like"" bones! I am a MASSIVE fan of the old 60's 70's Hammer Horror films & the 80's series Hammer House of Horror, & I felt like the makers of JWFK has been binge watching all these for inspiration! Shadows, dark corners, bleak creepy rooms & halls, all hallmarks of trad retro horror/suspence films. & if I am honest it was nicely done. Of course this move is not an award worthy masterpiece, but on the entertainent level, it certainly does it's job! If you love Hammer. I think you will ejyoy this movie!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

HAHA!Nowadays it's almost a norm now to go to the cinema expecting mediocrity. not this time. It was a fun not a dull moment popcorn film that I thouroughly enjoyed! If you don't take things too seriously, have an imagination and love the dinasaur films then don't hesitate and go and watch it and give the few amazing reviews it's gotten a chance. Hopefully you won't regret it. This was one that has me hoping for another!Not like the last Marvel avengers movie that was so terrible it's traumatised me into waiting for every other movie that comes out to come out on DVD before watching it haha. It was so terrible I wondered if there world collectively decided to agree on leaving their brains at the door to the cinemas before watching the movie, especially for marvel fans who've actually watched the films and know the characters and who would know what a sham it was!Oops! Got a little side tracked there...Hehe my bad...^_^",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
338,freewillyfan,Fallen Kingdom,5,1 December 2019,"Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom has entertainment in it but I personally don't like seeing what this franchise is turning into. The very first film was more serious and smart. I find the creation on new species and cloned people too ridiculous. It's getting a little too Hollywood for my liking. The cast is good, but has a poor villain. One of my biggest complaints is that a main plot of the movie is what to do with the dinosaurs on this island that has a volcano about to erupt. There is a very easy solution because there is a second island with dinosaurs that the could be brought to and this was never mentioned. At the end out the movie you can see what they're setting up for the next film. Having Jurassic World being the Planet now, but my issue with this is that there aren't too many dinosaurs out and I'm pretty sure that with the amount of weapons and stuff the humans have, the dinosaurs wouldn't be too much of an issue. Still will see what they do for the next film.5.5/10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
339,iranu-74195,Moves along and is entertaining chewing gum. Director/Editor: very very good,5,3 January 2021,"It's juvenile and often silly, of course it is, this is a Jurassic franchise for G's sake. But, this is suprisingly well directed film. The action shots are very well paced and set up professionaly. This film really moves along and none of the cast are embarrassing: they do a professional job of getting the script completed. So, to waste an hour or so, it's OK. The only downside is near the end - when the appalling ham Goldblum phones in a cameo appearance. Not sure why anyone thought it necessary. I don't understand the Goldblum thing because he is such a bad. selfish and crap Actor it's beyond understanding that he is invited onto any set.

With the eruption imminent, the park's former operations manager Claire Dearing, now the founder and leader of the Dinosaur Protection Group, recruits Owen Grady in an effort to rescue the island's dinosaurs and evacuate them to safety. The fear factor is back. This Jurassic World sequel isn't better than the first one but it's a good, entertaining and thrilling ride.

342,e-m-hobo,"If Blue is the hero, focus on Blue",6,14 August 2021,"The movie when you watch it feels all Deus Ex Machina without any exception. The only surprises were different angle surprises in that you think one dinosaur is about to eat a character and it turns out to be another.Most of the Deus Ex Machina solutions made use of Blue jumping into the scene to save the day and overall it's impossible to deny that Blue was set up as the hero of the movie. This also means that the majority of screen time should have been spent on Blue and the human cast would've been the supporting cast. Pitching it the other way around like they did now really didn't work. They totally ignored the hero.The movie overall also lacks balls. The first Jurassic Park, which as we all know also had its Deus Ex Machina solution to everything in the end, at least did have the balls to show the cut off arm on the shoulder. With movies like this, you really do need to show some chewed or cut up flesh here and there and the movie makers were too scared to do that.Could have been an interesting new angle to the Jurassic Park franchise, but the newly added angles like having a dinosaur for a hero and also the human cloning experiment could have been dealt with better by adding more depth to that.

Token comedy side characters, the obvious doublecross and yet another hybrid dino... yikes. The movie is just a contrived mess with few original ideas to sustain it.

350,BiiivAL,The Star Lord of the Jurassic Period,8,7 June 2018,"In 2015, Colin Trevorow brought to life the dying interest of the viewer to the prehistoric inhabitants of the Earth. ""The world of the Jurassic period"" did not become a revelation, repeating in many ways the concept of the early films initiated by Steven Spielberg. However, the picture managed to break the cash register and prove its relevance even many years after the release of the third Park. Part of this is the merit of the writers, in part Trevorow himself, who brought his vision of history to the viewer.The sequel studio Universal entrusted the director Juan Antonio Bayon, familiar to the viewer on the recent ""Monster's Voice"". However, for the script, among others, Colin Trevorow still answers, which is probably why many of the motives from the First World here are developing.The events of the ""Fallen Kingdom"" (such a subtitle have a sequel in the original) occur three years after the catastrophic failure of the new Jurassic Park. The island of Nublar is abandoned, and the dinosaurs scattered throughout the territory. Everything changes the sudden awakening of the island volcano, which threatens to destroy the formed ecosystem. Claire Diring (Bryce Dallas Howard), the heroine of the last part, is ready to do anything to save the dinosaurs from the dying island, so when there is a chance to take part in the rescue mission, Claire does not hesitate for a minute. And with it, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) returns to the island, whose task is to find Blue Raptor, which is of great scientific value due to its cognitive characteristics.""Jurassic World 2"" does not try to be more than he really is. This is an exciting adventure with dinosaurs, which is firmly based on the foundation laid in his novels by Michael Crichton, and after him Steven Spielberg his screen version. The screenwriters once again beat the same stamps that we saw earlier, but they do it unobtrusively and with imagination. It would seem that the roaring tyrannosaurus we see every film, rescuing children from a predator - without it anywhere, a system that gets out of human control - this is what the entire franchise is all about. And yet the World of the Jurassic period raises rather curious ethical questions, which previously in the films were not particularly covered. In particular, the question of cloning and how far a person can go by mastering this technology.A separate mention is worthy of the storyline of Raptor Blue and Owen Grady. According to the previous film, we remember that Owen was training the raptors, and some of them showed amazing learning abilities. Blue was the most capable of them. And therefore the most tenacious. The sequel continues this line of uneasy relationships between man and predator, and, perhaps, this is the strongest side of the ""Jurassic World"". If earlier dinosaurs were only a spontaneous force that broke out of the control of a person, and caused little sympathy, now the franchise is trying to fall in love with the viewer into the dinosaurs through the Blue Raptor. And it's not bad at all. Blue, in fact, a full-fledged heroine of the franchise along with Claire and Owen, and the final picture hints that her role in history will be much more important than we thought before.""The fallen kingdom"" could become an exemplary sequel, if not for the frankly undeveloped scenario. The first part of the film, which takes place on the island, and the second - at Lockwood's estate - are so different in tone that it seems like they are two different films that someone glued into one. Instead of the beautiful landscapes of Nublar Island, we spend more and more time in the dark corridors of the park and the enclosed spaces of the estate, so that claustrophobia begins to develop not only in poor dinosaurs, but also in the viewer. The second weak point of the film is its antagonists. Unprincipled businessmen who are eager to cash in on dinosaurs are a terry stamp that works here in so far as, and the next toothy-fanged miracle of genetic engineering differs little from Indominus from the past film.And yet, despite the unevenness of the script, the World of the Jurassic Period 2 turned out to be spectacular, sometimes dramatic (the lone dying brachiosaur on the beach is Hachiko divided by the sinking in the icy water of Jack) and truly adventurous, in the best traditions of the genre. And this means that the reptiles of the Jurassic period will continue to dominate the cinemas and the minds of the viewer for a long time.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

The plot of ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" is a botched mash-up of ""King Kong,"" B-movie SciFi, and James Bond-knockoff spy flicks.
Chris Pratt is wasted. Bryce Dallas Harper is wasted. The villains are vapid, melodramatic caricatures (think of GI Joe's old enemy, Cobra and his minions).
And there's this really weird sub-plot involving a little girl of suspect origins that seems to exist only to give pseudo-gravitas to Jeff Goldblum's cameo as Dr. Malcom, reprising his overwrought science-is-dangerous soliloquy.

This is exactly the movie you want, presented in the most mechanical way possible. That doesn't make the movie impossible to enjoy, but it's a bit like ordering fast food from McDonalds. You know it's bad for you, you know it's made from tongues and eyeballs, but it's still edible.Fallen Kingdom feels like you're watching a two hour movie trailer. Even during so-called ""down time,"" the movie is rushing you through a summary of its plot, never letting any one emotion or thought sink in for very long. There's no humanity in this movie, no heart, it's all just a rickety scaffolding to prop up the next CGI dinosaur brawl.And all of it, every minute of the movie, is slathered in a nostalgic worship for that first Jurassic Park movie. From a pointless cameo by Jeff Goldblum to straight up remaking multiple shots from the original film, Fallen Kingdom is obsessed with reminding you of better movies instead of just being itself. Fallen Kingdom wants you to love the fact it loves Jurassic Park, when I'd much rather cut out the middleman.A twist to the mythology here or a couple of cool moments there just doesn't make up for how hollow and plainly calculated this movie is.There's nothing wrong with eating McDonalds.

Or the original trilogy before that.The movie is good but I think it suffers in the way of its story. Though interesting, the story could have been far better.It was interesting to see them return to Isla Nublar to try and rescue the dinosaurs. But it was extremely predictable that they would be betrayed once they got there.The ending part of the movie with the havoc in the mansion was great. Though you do not see much of the Indoraptor like the trailers made us believe. I do question the rather stupid decision of the young girls character though. I knew and understood why she did it. But come on. It was not the brightest thing to do.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were great again in the roles. But it was more of the same. Not much character growth between movies. Though the connection between Chris and Blue was well done. The cloning aspect featured later on in the movie with the child? Yeah ok. I can kinda deal with that. But don't have that as a focus for future films. It is an enjoyable film and I am curious to know what they will do for the third film due out 2021.They have hinted over the years that they may be weaponised dinosaurs and they kind of set that scenario up in this and talked briefly about it in Jurassic World.

 -Those Russians are so bad, they have to buy the meaniest of Dinos! 
 
 
-Talking about the meaniest Dino.. ermm.. which sane person sells a prototype before making any copies of it? Greedy people are not necessary lobotomized.
 
 
-Talking about sanity.. have I mentioned how a group of adults (scientists included) had let dangerous man-eating creatures go free in USA? Except if the mansion was in an isolated island, did I miss something here?
 
 
The whole magic of the Jurassic movies was about people being trapped in contained space among very dangerous creatures. It is a huge risk to change the format, I am not very thrilled about it, we have already seen movies with 
 monsters destroying various places in America (hello Godzilla!).

360,rustonreviews,"Ludicrous at times, but still an enjoyable ride.",6,22 July 2018,"Steven Spielberg's original Jurassic Park (1993) is a landmark in cinema that still holds up today. With iconic moments including the still impressive T-Rex introduction and the tension filled sequence in which Raptor's stalk the kitchen in search of Hammond's grandchildren, the original film remains one of the greats. The Lost World (1997), a somewhat underrated piece of work, continued the adventure and packed many more memorable moments (a T-Rex patrolling a sleepy neighbourhood being a definite highlight). Audiences were less favourable towards Jurassic Park III (2001), and it wouldn't be until 2015 in which Trevorrow revitalised the franchise with Jurassic World, albeit with mixed results. I found Jurassic World to be a simply okay film; an undoubtably fun ride with room for improvement. When it was announced J.A Bayona (a terrific director) would be at the helm for Fallen Kingdom, I was immediately intrigued to see where the franchise would be heading. Picking up three years after the previous film, it is brought to attention that Isla Nublar's volcano is active with an eruption inevitably on the horizon, thus sparking the debate whether the dinosaurs on the island should be rescued or left to perish. Whilst Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum in a criminally short cameo) argues that the dinosaurs should be left to die to ensure that Hammond's drastic errors are corrected, Claire Dearing (Dallas Howard) actively works to prevent their second extinction. Bringing aboard a reluctant Owen Grady (Pratt) and a team of mercenaries, they embark on a journey back to Isla Nublar to transfer the dinosaurs to an island sanctuary. Because, of course, that totally sounds like a good idea.I had a lot of fun with Fallen Kingdom. Bayona's distinct visual style is evident from the beginning, resulting in what I consider to easily be the best looking instalment in the franchise to date. It's a thrilling ride with some fantastic set pieces, and the combination of animatronic effects and CGI is thankfully well balanced. The return of Pratt and Dallas Howard is a welcome one, and the films climactic battle is tremendously awesome and stands as one of the films most memorable moments. Despite being thoroughly entertaining, it doesn't change the fact that Fallen Kingdom is monumentally ridiculous at times. 
Connolly and Trevorrow's script is riddled with ludicrous ideas. Some much required character development is non-existent, and many decisions and actions present in the film are frustratingly illogical. One specific plot point is unapologetically recycled from the previous film, and there is a plot twist that feels entirely irrelevant and contributes nothing to the overall narrative. It is a plot twist that had no business being in the movie, which unfortunately leads into an ending that is both stunningly idiotic and baffling. But, despite all that, Fallen Kingdom succeeds where it matters most; it's bombastically fun, despite how cripplingly ridiculous it all is. For what it is, it's an enjoyable ride, providing you don't think about it too much.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

364,heatsink98,Ding-dong dino dumbness,4,3 August 2018,"JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM exists in a universe where very dumb people keep making the same mistakes over and over--namely, making dinosaurs and then being eaten by said dinosaurs. How many dino movies can the studio possibly make before audiences get tired of seeing characters who act like total idiots? I supposed they'll keep making films like this until the money dries up at the box office.Anyway, this film continues a few years after where we left off during the last one. Star-Lord and the spunky red head played by Bryce Dallas Howard get involved in a dino-rescue attempt that instead turns into a secretive and illegal dino-auction. In a side plot, the bad guys have whipped up a new and improved dinosaur called an Indo Raptor to sell as a weapon during the auction.As for logic, this movie doesn't have any, so don't expect much of anything to make sense. My favorite scene that illustrates this is when the Indo Raptor is being demoed for the warlords who make up the auction audience. A generic henchman points a gun with a laser sight at a guy and presses an attack button that sends the raptor into a frenzy. Great, right? Why use cheapo bullets from the gun when you can have a $40 million raptor do all the work? Ugh. I suppose the $40 million could also be spent on five Abrams battle tanks instead of a dinosaur, but that would be boring and make too much sense. Beyond the logic issues, the film is filmsy and it's over-long and sometimes drags, but it does have some decent jump scares.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
365,bonniejoy-978-68763,Laughably Recycled,6,12 February 2019,"So now I've finally had the chance to see Jurassic Park 5 (as it really should be called) and just to recap: the first movie was great, I felt the second movie was dumb, the third movie was trash, and the fourth movie was enjoyably dumb and great. In some ways I guess you could say the Jurassic Park series had a lot of dumb elements to it - even the first movie had many dumb elements (mainly the idea of having a theme park dedicated to resurrected dinosaurs) but it also knew how to have fun with it as well as make the audience believe the dinosaurs were alive.Now for Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom: A volcano is about to erupt where the dinosaurs live, and the former people in charge of Jurassic World have to decide whether or not to let them die or rescue them. However, behind the government's back, Clair and (Chris Pratt) are going to move the dinosaurs to another island where they can thrive and live in peace. But little do they realize, they're being duped and once again the military wants to use the dinosaurs as weapons of war (didn't we learn why that can't happen in the last movie?). It's another Man vs Nature story much like Lost World (just as I predicted).Oh this is somehow very dumb and yet very fun. Anytime you go to see Jurassic Park (any of the movies) usually you don't care about the plot or the human characters, all that matters are the dinosaurs, and I think they knew that. For that reason, the plot is a mess but the effects for the dinosaurs are good.So what bothers me about this movie? The villain. Good grievences, did we really need a military money power villain again? That's been the third time in the series we've had a villain like that including in the last movie (though to be fair the previous villain was a lot more unlikable).
Also, this feels like two plots rolled into one: 1) Dilemma on whether or not to save dinosaurs from extinction 2) Man is evil and wants to sell dinosaurs (how come they didn't learn from Lost World and Jurassic World that it's a bad idea?). If it had been about the first one, it would have been enough to hold a movie.
And probably one of the visually dumbest moments is there's a little girl in a red sweater sneaking around and yet somehow she slips by unnoticed. How do you do that in a RED SWEATER!!?!!
Not to mention, for a serious killer, the new dinosaur sure is slow to kill one of the important characters.
And while it was great to see Jeff Goldblum return, he's only there for three minutes. Though to be fair, he was the voice of reason.This movie embraces every tense moment and it often pays off. 👍 Also the acting is really good from everybody including the kid. The special effects for the dinosaurs once again look great, though I was slightly disappointed that the T-rex didn't get much of a chance to shine.Final Verdict: Overall, I say plotwise it is a dumb movie. I find it pointless that the series continued and that the characters never learn from the previous movies. However, as an action film it's enjoyable, especially if you don't think too hard about the situation. I think How it Should Have Ended described best how the issues should have been resolved by everyone.

366,Abranth-d,Claustrophobic horror,4,19 July 2019,"Here's my review of Jurassic world : the fallen kingdom. This movie is the sequel to 2015s Jurassic world and stars Peter quill... I mean 'Chris Pratt ' and he's the only good character in this movie like I wouldn't care if anyone else was killed by a dinosaur except for him . This movie was more of a claustrophobic horror flick than an escape movie unlike the rest..did it work ? It sort of did but the jump scares were all very predictable and so was the bad guy's scheme.This movie had a lot of cliche moments from most monster movies and shark movies like the person getting killed first and the monster v monster fight sort of thing. On the bright side I really enjoyed the escape from the island in the film's beginning , probably the best thing about it. There was also a little plot surrounding the professors granddaughter and I thought it was really good. But this movie is like home alone but with a raptor instead of robbers. Then why is it called ' Jurassic world ' you ask ? That is answered in the end by Jeff goldblum and yes . It's a setup for a sequel but in a good way. In the end , the fallen kingdom wasn't as great as it's predecessor but manages to make a movie for the franchise and also keeps you entertained doing so. If these guys throw in a single power rangers dino thunder reference somewhere , then you have my money for the sequel.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
367,mocaler,I should have waited for the next JW installment,5,7 September 2018,"I found enjoyment with this movie. But various issues made it difficult to stay in the movie. I don't want to detail too much here but some general points are valid to make.
1. Characters were problematic. This has been the case with each of the Jurassic Park sequels. I didn't connect with any of the characters in the 1st sequel. I liked 2 character portrayals in the 3rd one but some characters were also too unreal. With JW1, it shows how lackluster I thought were the characters when I thought more of the younger kid and the short lived assistant than anyone else. Claire and Owen both had too many unlikable traits for my taste. As the leads in JW2, they didn't do much to change my opinion of them.2. unrealistic sequences - In this case, all of the JP / JW movies so far have unrealistic sequence of events. There were too many sudden appearances of dinos to the rescue and dinos unrealistically delaying attacks. These issues continue in JW2. Related to this are odd behaviors of both dinos and humans. 3. Mediocre installment with a major cliffhanger - The movie ends with a major cliffhanger. Since the movie was mediocre by itself, I may have rated this higher if I had waited until the next movie and watched them together. Although it was clear that the story would continue, I thought that JW1 was adequate to watch on its own. But this one just does not have enough to it to be worth watching by itself. It would be more entertaining if the next installment winds up being a good ending to the trilogy.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

369,slicedbread117,All Bark and No Bite,4,6 July 2018,"If anyone ever wondered what a Transformers movie with dinosaurs would look or feel like, here it is. Jurassic Park's legacy is without debate; it's one of the most acclaimed films of all-time and 2015's Jurassic World, in my opinion, was a worthy re-entry back into the classic franchise. So how does Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (FK) stack up against those two films? How does it relate to a Transformers movie? All hat and no cattle, frosting without a cake, a funhouse mirror image of what this franchise aims to be.What's different in this review, is that first I must talk about the trailers and marketing campaign of Fallen Kingdom, which isn't an aspect that should have hardly any effect on the film itself, but it does here. FK basically loses all credibility for practically ruining most of its greatest moments by spoiling them in the trailers. Now, one could say don't watch the trailers, simple. But when you're sitting in a theater before another film and the second or third trailer for FK comes on, you don't have much of a choice. And regardless, trailers are made to tease you into wanting to watch the rest of the film, not give away its best moments. I had to address this, because it's a recurring problem throughout the rest of the review.Fallen Kingdom's story structure reminds me of a huge hoagie that starts off looking promising and then just completely falls apart as you eat it. We're initially presented with a simple premise; dinosaurs exist on an island which a volcano will erupt on any day, and mankind must decide whether it's in their best interest to save them. It's a safe, if not kind of lazy way to get our main characters back running through a jungle, but in real life, this would actually be a compelling storyline. And for what it's worth, the first half of the film did feel a little bit like a Jurassic Park story, which I can't deny is fun to watch. But that narrative dies faster than the idiot guy from the opening scene, however, when things take a ""unexpected"" turn as the plot shifts, leading to our first trailer buzzkill. The entire first plot twist moving into the new main narrative is completely spoiled in the trailers, from Owen's (Chris Pratt) Velociraptor, Blue, getting shot, to Bryce Dallas Howard's Claire screaming ""it was all a lie!"" and then the ensuing footage of bad people selling dinos to worse people, the unveiling of the new big-bad dino, the Indoraptor (totally unnecessary), and the ensuing home-invasion-style hunt, and that's pretty much the entire plot. If only it played out so neatly. Fallen Kingdom has a severe case of dreadful pacing; the film spins off into pointless subplots that draw attention away from its main story, and these subplots truly have no justification or development. FK can't always seem to keep its head on straight, it runs around more than the characters on screen.Where Fallen Kingdom's story really goes wrong is in its second half story featuring a generic cardboard cutout villain wanting to sell the dinosaurs for other buyers to use as weapons while our antagonist makes a few million bucks. Its bland, dry and worn out. The film becomes way too confined in its setting, no variation and no room to breathe unique ideas. Director J.A. Bayona tries to explore new territory in the franchise's storytelling, which I give credit for, but there's no room to explore stuck in an evil-lair-mansion for more than half the movie. The confined spaces do, however, make for one of the most positive aspects of the film. Fallen Kingdom delivers some of the best utterly tense and somewhat frightening moments seen since the original Jurassic Park, and that's a big thumbs up. Many moments had me drawn into the film, even if most sequences become unbearably predictable thanks to the trailer spoilers. FK still is able to build suspense and keep you engaged in several areas. Unfortunately, the humor to balance out the welcomed intensity is basically non-existent or terribly forced, with the best moments being shown off in the trailers yet again. The writing from Derek Connolly and Jurassic World director Colin Trevorrow along with the vision of Bayona is way too overconfident, trying to jam together a compelling screenplay which instead turns into a sloppy romp over two hours.Where the story is viewed as more of a mixed portion of the film, the cast of characters and their writing is what truly stands out as the ugly duckling in Fallen Kingdom. Not one single character, with the occasional exception of Owen, is intriguing in the slightest. Even Jeff Goldblum's return to the franchise was a shameless marketing plug, his lines in the film almost entirely can be found in the trailers word for word. I wouldn't have cared at all if any of the characters died in the film, everyone is just filler for a movie that works best when dinosaurs are in focus, yet another Transformers comparison. The human cast is dumbed down, unconvincing and emotionally disengaging. Alongside Owen and Claire in their quest are two tag-along interns from Claire's new dinosaur rights movement group, Zia (Daniella Pineda) who is at least of use in the film and Franklin (Justice Smith) the supposed comic relief turned into the absolute worst character in the entire franchise, annoying me to the point of wanting to plug my ears and gauge out my eyes. Least of all exciting is the aforementioned main antagonist, Eli Mills (Rafe Spall) who takes the easily foreseen twist from the good-hearted heir to Jurassic Park's creators to the mustache twirling, cliched capitalist with zero moral fiber and a lame agenda. The dinosaurs of the film actually do receive strong characterization, you care for them a heck of a lot more than any of the human cast. This does provide some heart in a film brimming with distress, a small shot of adrenaline for an overall stale set of characters.If nothing else, Fallen Kingdom does provide some stunning CG visuals to complement its occasional intensity. The dinosaurs look gorgeous, finely detailed as they roar with ferocity. It shows off its big budget with fun, if sometimes over-the-top action sequences, splendid cinematography and then there's still that giddy joy in watching a dino devour a bad guy or witnessing the king T-rex claim his dominancy on screen even for a brief time. FK does give some nice little bits of nostalgia for long time viewers to chew on as well, always a welcomed touch to a long-running series.Fallen Kingdom could maybe be best described as if you were to look at a picture of a pool from a resort, all glimmering on top, perfectly blue as if it couldn't be real. But then, you were to dive in and find nothing but sewage and grime, almost drown, only to pop back up to see the beautiful view on top. Rinse and repeat. It can be a fun ride with several thrills and big-budget CGI, cool looking dinosaurs and a scarcely engaging plot. But don't fooled, it's all style and no substance, all bark and no bite.4.5/10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

I've enjoyed the others but could not thing how it could go on. I was pleasantly surprised at JW: Fallen Kingdom. I thought the story line was entertaining and it kept my interest for the 2 hours it played. The CGI - awesome, so were the sound effects. Maybe I'm overly biased because I really like Chris Pratt -- he obviously makes the movie, imo. But still, all in all, a good movie on the big screen.Now here's what is a spoiler, so stop reading until you've seen the movie. The ending of this movie speaks volumes to the immigration situation we're facing right now. And it speaks volumes to the ""kid centric"" attitude of this country. ""Don't kill the dinosaurs, 'open the doors' and let them go. Of course the adult's better judgement ultimately and very sorrowfully seems to say, ""NO, I can't do that to all those people who are innocent, so the doors must stay closed."" But who opens the doors to the invading, killers of mankind? A KID! Now the dinosaurs, some vegan and some meat (human) eaters, are turned loose on an unsuspecting public just because a kid was crying for the dinosaurs and didn't want to see them die. I had to laugh to myself when the movie ended because it spoke volumes in regard to what we're facing now.

Fallen Kingdom is good but the previous installment is better, this sequel gives us an amazing first act, full of intense scenes while Isla Nublar is getting destroyed. The scene where the protagonists are escaping from the volcano is incredible and one of the bests I've seen in a blockbuster. After that, the movie stills good but isn't able to surprise us again as the first act in Isla Nublar.
The character development is fine, I just think they could show more about Maisie's past (the explanation is too weak, cringe and bidimensional), the cinematography is beautiful during the scenes on the island and the actions scenes are good but they can't overcome the big action scene during the first act. If I were the director, I would increase the scenes in Isla Nublar and decrease the scenes after that.It is a good blockbuster, its problem is gives us all its trumps in the first 40 minutes and then the story stills good but not incredible as we saw during the first act.

The pacing and premise is just off the mark and generally the second half is better in terms of thrills . There are no ""wow "" moments in this one. Though and a few scenes may be well done, the action scenes are predictable . Only run of the mill popcorn value.

The ethical and moral debate surrounding the appearance of these creatures was mentioned (on-screen) numerous times. Off-screen, man's constant need to tamper with things (and abandon them when he tires) is something we face every day. The scene that broke my heart this time was that of the volcano erupting where the lone Brachiosaurus cries out as her impending death draws closer. Owen's earlier dismissal i.e. being okay with Blue dying, really hit him when he saw the gentle Brachiosaurus perish amid lava and volcanic fumes. Her lone cries made me tear up rather badly. I get it, the movie is fantasy but what do we take away from it? Our constant use and abuse of the planet and her creatures (factory-farming, poaching, illegal wildlife trade, palm oil plantations etc.) is something which should cause us great shame. Do we care? Apparently not. Is Jurassic Park/Jurassic World as far-fetched as we think? For now in that we don't have dinosaurs running around. Aside from that? A resounding no. We show no respect to those we deem lesser than us, we put off helping those, reassuring ourselves that someone else will pick up the slack. The typical villain in these movies are us in real life dear audience. You may or may not care. This movie may jar something within your soul or you can treat it at face value.

Unfortunately, the entertainment portion of it took a huge nosedive with this installment.In short, Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom is more of a snore-fest than a Dinofest with what felt like an endless trip through nothingville before you begin to even think about becoming engaged ... if you aren't asleep at that point.The CGI is great and the dinosaurs are more visually stunning and real than any Jurassic film before, but in this case it makes it all the more sad, as it resoundingly lays all the fault for the film's mediocrity, on the script. While we are on the subject of the script, here's a hint to the writers, producers and director: If you have to use a gun-like device to ""laser tag"" something so that a dinosaur will attack it, why would you pass up the opportunity, while you have it in your laser tag sights, to just kill it yourself instead of tagging it and THEN sending the dinosaur after it? Doubtful that Dino would fetch a cool $28M without all the pesky quirks worked out. And that's just one of the many plot holes.I would generally say that you should watch a film of this scope on the big screen, but in the case of this film in particular, I must advise you watch it when it comes to Blu-Ray or via streaming so that you have less to feel let down about. Lastly, as for the mixed reviews, I highly suggest that for a proper feel of the truth of the matter, you sort them by ""Prolific Reviewer"". I'm not implying that a lot of the 10/10 reviews are from people who have only ever reviewed one movie (this one), but a lot of the 10/10 reviews are from people who have only ever reviewed one movie ... this one. :)",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
385,tenealesharman,One of the better sequels to a flawless original,5,20 March 2020,"I think I've seen all the sequels now, and this one was one of the better ones. It did feel like exact sequences had been copied from the other movies and thrown into this one. Like exactly the same. The scene where the kid is in the laundry shoot trying desperately to close the lid so the enormous dinosaur doesn't get her, yeah I've seen that. Dinosaur falling through a glass roof? Yeah seen that too. Heroine hurts her leg and sends the smart hero (who isn't fond of kids) to save the kid - yep seen it.
I'm glad I watched it on Netflix.
Let's see if the original a team can save the next movie",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
386,spicy_bee,When will we learn enough is enough,5,9 July 2018,"Predictable and story similar to previous installments. Despite there being a bunch of scientists I guess none of them heard of Murphy's law.

387,ellimic,Better than the last,4,17 February 2019,"It was quite a good film, and I might even say it was better than the last. It had quite A Lost World feel to it at the start, experts hired to find dinosaurs on the island while 'hunters' were there to capture them and take them to the mainland.Why did they keep saying the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar were the last of thier kind, what happened to the other island from Jurassic Park 2 and 3?I liked the idea of the new genetic creation, the indoraptor, but at times it seemed a bit far fetched: when the hunter shot tranquilliser darts at it in the auction how did the indoraptor know to pretend to be asleep? Then chasing Owen and co in the house, they climbed the winding stairs and the indoraptor, which was only able to get its head on the upper floor, somehow then managed to scrabble it's way up? And again on the roof it nearly fell through but saved itself despite having only two claws in the metal railing? It all seemed unlikely.
And how it was able to track the girl by climbing over the roof seemed questionable.How they killed the indoraptor was a bit too much like the last film, Blue fighting off a dinosaur larger and stronger than it, at least we didn't get the tag-team of raptor and txrex. Then again we had the parting where Blue ran away into the trees, I wouldn't have been too surprised to see it give Owen a hug!
A big dangerous predator suddenly acting sedate and gentle!?With that ending of the dinosaurs free in the world it leaves a good opening for a sequel, but I hope this time they give genetics a break, it's been done and they always have nature win no matter how big and powerful the creation is.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
388,sally-w,Terrible - did they have people watch it before it was released,3,30 June 2018,Why on earth didn't they get some constructive feedback before releasing it. There are all sorts of issues with the sizes of the CGI dinosaurs - how can something be big enough to cover 2 stories of a building but still be able to run down a hallway. How could Blue be half the size of the huge massive monster when she only comes up to most people's waist? Seriously did you not think we would notice? Then there is the plot and the birds and the dialogue - I almost laughed but not quite. Go and watch something else.,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Toby Jones is TOTALLY doing Trump.There are so many Easter eggs in this the cinema staff should be wearing bunny ears.I saw in in IMAX, which was good, but I'm guessing it would be better in 3D. The use of movement within the frame in the dino action scenes is superb.However you see it, don't wait to see it on video.

390,joshfedderson,Welcome....To Jurassic World,10,24 June 2018,"This hit sequel to Jurassic World was fun and exciting for me, I have been a Jurassic Park fan all of my life and when I saw this yesterday it did not disappoint me. My wife was working and I was bored so I bought a ticket for this movie because I really wanted to see it. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom takes place three years after the disaster at Jurassic World the Island Isla Nublar is a danger zone as a once dormant volcano starts to come to life again. Hired by a successor to John Hammond, Clair is assigned to help rescue the dinosaurs on the island, she then seeks out Owen Grady's help saying Blue is still on the island and Owen needs to find her. Turns out the whole rescue operation is a giant scheme, but man cannot outwit nature and, life finds a way. I give this sequel a 10 the story was good, and the rescue of the dinosaurs was very dramatic. You actually feel for the creatures when mother nature unleashes the volcano and it's destruction. Seeing the Brontosaurus be covered by that cloud of ash as the boat sails away from the island was sad, to hear it's last cries, almost brought tears to my eyes. What really made my day was how they brought back Ian Malcolm (a very older Ian Malcolm) to the movie, though, I wish he a had a bigger part in it but he was still classic. A new dinosaur takes the lead in this one, a very freaky one too. But nonetheless amazing and cool. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom had a much bigger purpose then it's predecessor, a lot of emotion, a good story, I would say out of the Jurassic Park series this one is the most dramatic. The ending blew me away, but it's cool to think where the ending will take us. A third movie is being planned as I speak, The adventure is not over. A wonderful film and story for Jurassic Park lovers out there.10/10 for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

392,MissCzarChasm,"Okay, I get it. Actually, no, I don't.",5,29 June 2018,"I began by giving this film a 7 and my opening line was ""If you are wanting to leave disbelief at the door and immerse yourself in mindless fun then this is a good choice ...."", only, this wasn't all fun. You had some fun, and the rest, when looked at objectively, was garbage AND WE WATCHED THIS IN RPX which makes me wonder how many others who are giving it glowing reviews (aside from reviewing only this one film), are doing so because of the theater experience, and not the film itself.The problem I have, is that if the creators this time around wanted to give us just action and adventure, they should have done that and just left all the boring and annoying parts out. Even the chemistry between Owen and Claire was dead, no matter how many times the camera held her looking at him with parted lips and a dreamy gaze. The baddies were just silly. Also, many of the parts that may have been moved to the fun or good column were ruined by the Franklin computer guy or the other character meant to assuage the PC crowd (and I say that as a living, breathing, card carrying liberal). The little cloned girl was there for one purpose (I won't give it away), but her story was dumb. They literally could have introduced her at the beginning as ""This is Macey, a clone of my daughter"", and it would not have made a difference except for allowing them to cut out all the unnecessary scenes spent on this that drama.

The movie did have its moments, just wasn't enough of them and to many unanswered questions. If you are looking for a way to waste a couple hours watch this movie if you know someone who has it, I wouldn't buy it, but then to this a personal matter of choice.

I just like to look at dinosaurs. If you don't like them, you won't like the movie either. 'cause ok, Lets be honest, this movie only survives on special Dino-effects, action and humor, sometimes borderline slapstick. The story line is secondary. This is pure mindless entertainment.What bothers me a bit is the fact that it's kind of a remade story of Jurassic Park 2 when they too go back to the island... And some movies are ok to be remade but not the original JP's. Why? They are classics spanning over 2 generations.
The movie lacks originality, but then again, where am I gonna see fun man eating Dino's in action... Only in Jurassic World.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

My main beef with the movie is the plot/conflict -- the gang's all back together again...to save the dinosaurs from extinction ... from an island volcano that's erupting. My word...that is the dumbest storyline ever. That's the first hour of the movie. If it ended there, it wouldn't have been as terrible. But no, the movie keeps on truckin' by ripping off King Kong. Yes, of course, there are bad guys on the island who steal the dinosaurs to sell them/display them blah blah blah -- at some guy's house in the woods (!!!!).Yep. Take the dinosaurs from the volcano island to some guy's house. Ouch. Painful to watch. So, so, so terrible. Absolute garbage movie. No camp - no cheekiness - it takes itself seriously. Unbelievable!I'd give this a negative 10,000 score, but here I've gone with a 2 out of 10 because I love Michael Crichton stuff and out of respect to him I'm gonna go with a deuce.

But although i really liked Jurassic Park 2, this one here has a lot of problems. A lot of people make really stupid decisions that are not rational. decisions that are so stupid, you only do them because it was written in the script. no sane human being would do that. and those bad decisions just to move the story forward really destroys the movie in many ways. otherwise the special effects are great and you get some decent action here and there. its fun to watch once and never again.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

403,ChristianLeFeuvre,Not as good as the others in the franchise,3,21 March 2019,"'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' is the latest instalment in the Jurassic Park franchise.
The story begins when we are shown volcano activity on Isla Nubla and the imminent threat to the dinosaurs there, and animal rights activists are protesting for the rights of these animals and the fact they should be saved, as they are living creatures despite the fact they were created in a lab, by man.
So, we see Claire and Owen from 'Jurassic World' back to save the dinosaurs from another extinction. Their team is funded by a dying rich man, played by James Cromwell, to retrieve the dinosaurs and place them on a sanctuary somewhere, but he is deceived, and there are some evil corporate guys who want a different outcome and have the dinosaurs brought to a huge mansion, to be sold off to the highest bidders.
I loved the original movie, and was very impressed by 'The Lost World', I thought it was a very good sequel, great action pieces, some terrific actors starring alongside Jeff Goldblum, notably the late Pete Postlethwaite, it was witty as well as suspenseful but after that, I believe the quality of other movies, from the script to the action and direction, grew increasingly weaker.
'Jurassic World' was very disappointing, no really good action sequences and a weak storyline and even weaker characters.
That said, it was nowhere near as disappointing as 'Fallen Kingdom'.
I have so many issues with this film, it's difficult to know where to start.
To be honest, I actually thought the filmmakers knew this wasn't going to be a good movie, and thought the only way to ensure audiences was to bring back Jeff Goldblum as Dr Ian Malcolm, who is featured strongly in the trailers, however his appearances were so small and, in my mind, insignificant, that it was so obvious an inclusion to appeal to fans of the original movies.
Actually staying with the trailers for a second, if you take a look at any of the longer trailers for 'Fallen Kingdom', you've pretty much watched the movie as 95% of the film is there for you already.
Ok, the characters. Chris Pratt returns as Owen and is likeable, but there is no development from 'Jurassic World', he's exactly the same. Bryce Dallas Howard returns as Claire and her character is actually a bit better than the last film, but not much. As mentioned Jeff Goldblum is back, but only briefly, and that is really where the likeable characters end and all the other characters were unbearable. The main villains are dreadful cartoony caricatures, corporate people who just want money, which was incredibly disappointing. There was a character called Franklin Webb, a young technician who is virtually afraid of his own shadow, yet he goes with them to the island, screams and runs throughout the whole movie, and was intolerably irritating and obviously just included for 'comic-relief'. I couldn't believe they would actually write a character like this into the film.
Most of the Jurassic Park movies have, obviously, had their scares and violence, blood and people being eaten, it seems to me that the ever-increasing 'snowflake brigade' have made their mark and the filmmakers were so frightened to push the boundaries, so concerned about showing younger viewers any hint of violence or blood. Now obviously I'm not saying it should have just been a movie full of gore etc, but the dinosaurs are vicious predators, and even in the very first film 'Jurassic Park' we saw more violence and blood than in this one, there is a ridiculous scene where a guy gets his arm bitten off and there isn't a drop of blood to be seen.
It just felt too tame. There was no stand out scenes, nothing that the viewer can take away and talk about afterwards, you leave the movie trying to remember a moment like the T-Rex roar at the end of the first film, the trailer dangling over the cliff in 'The Lost World', there is nothing like that. The CGI is of course very good and they have clearly spent a lot of money on the movie but not spent the most important thing....time, time to create a good story, believable characters, a good script with interesting dialogue, stand out moments, even a reason to watch it.
'Jurassic Park: Fallen Kingdom' is just a bland dinosaur monster movie with no sense of wonder or danger, and although it made a lot of money at the box office, Universal Studios have achieved the impossible, they have managed to make a dinosaur movie boring.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

A new genetic dino.
T-rex that brings the protagonist to the rescue at the very last minute.
Laboratory with samples for genetic engineering.
Main characters being cheated by a military organization.The worst thing is really when the poor Dreadnoughtus Schrani is standing on the 'harbor' of Isla Nublar and screaming.. while the lava comes from behind and you see it gets swallowed by the lava :(

406,WhenAmyMetSalad,Jurassic World vs Lost World,4,5 September 2018,"So to begin with this review I'm just going to get the positive out of the way as its short and easier to write. I enjoyed the beginning (sort of) as it gave me anxiety at all the right moments. I felt like I was watching the first Jurassic Park when I was a kid when the T-Rex first escaped its enclosure. And that's it for the positive. MAJOR Spoilers ahead. To extend on the beginning there is one thing I could not stand one bit which is how are these intelligent military-esque people too stupid to see someone frantically waving them down to run but they are thinking to themselves ""Oh look they want to play charades."" and in conclusion they end up dying from not getting the hint on to run. Like who goes to island full of dinosaurs and isn't smart enough to be on guard at all times. This movie reminded me so much of The Lost World with the military going to the island to capture dinos, ignoring all the survivors of the first movie and sort of betraying them. It felt like they took that script and told someone to tweak it and make it modern. We got the military who wanted dinos for personal use and that same group betray our survivors. But instead of solely wanting the T-Rex this time they wanted the Raptor. Whats next? They want an even smaller carnivore for the next trilogy?By the way I HATED when they got off the island and we had to suffer watching the Brachiosaurus get melted to death as it cried for help. Like what the heck writer? You sick sick man. Stay away from writing the 3rd please. Might as well just show us a dog get beaten and thrown into acid. Thats how horrible it was to watch that scene. So this movie takes a turn from adventure to horror with the introduction of the Indoraptor. We are now in a setting inside a huge mansion where all the dinos have been taken to for auction to rich people. Because apparently owning chihuahuas and stuffing them into purses is so last season. And why is this brilliant scientist who mastered cloning humans so idiotic? He wants someone arrested and tells the guy who is going to be arrested to call the police on himself? This guy is a criminal and you think he's going to be like ""Yes sir, I SHALL turn myself in for many crimes. I will pack my bags at once and head off to prison."" Is he that daft? How did he manage to clone a child but can't see the poor logic in his choice. He deserved being smothered.The only good thing the writer did for this movie was kill the guy in the cage. Well deserved. That scene alone deserves an Oscar. the rest of this movie deserves a razzy.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

409,artmania90,"A classic ""New Hollywood"" recipe!",2,24 June 2018,"JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM
Try this new and improved Hollywood blockbuster recipe on your own to experience that zing of nostalgia your life has been missing! A great recipe for a beautiful summer day that will surely dampen your spirits - or - to gently remind you how painfully inept Hollywood films have become. Enjoy!!!
Ingredients:1 Hollywood hack script that lifts most of its material from an original, better film (in this case, ""The Lost World."" If you are running low, even ""Jurassic Park 3"" will suffice)
1 director with limited experience in making a big-budget blockbuster. Preferably one known more for quirky indie flicks. (If your film begins to feel like it's using CGI to mask a lack of story, then you are on the right track)
A heaping cupful of references to the original, more successful trilogy (mainly ""Jurassic Park"") to remind audiences that nostalgia is an adequate substitute to originality 
Characters who constantly fight for dinosaur rights (but make sure that 99% of the dinosaurs are soulless blood-thirsty monsters that murder humans like flies! It's a monster movie, after all!)
One painfully thin love story because, well, you gotta have that in there..
One annoying character who screams too much and whose purpose is entirely unneeded (consider also adding a child in your film to raise the stakes when your dino's attack)
One cameo from an original cast member (Jeff Goldblum, if possible). Even if it's just for 15 seconds, it's exactly what your fanboys will want!
A newer, biggerer, more lethal dinosaur (who wants an Indomidus rex anymore?? BORING). Give it laser tracking and vampire claws to make it more scary. Oh, and it should be black, because black is scarier. 
A hack villain who is only concerned with money, regardless of 4 previous films proving that dinosaurs can't be contained. 
Recipe:
Preheat your youtube trailer to at least 25 million views. 
Take the basic plot line from ""The Lost World"" and filter it through 2-3 untalented screenwriters. Make sure your heroes spell out the movie's themes in broad, emotional monologues. This is important. 
Shoehorn your characters back together no matter how unlikely the reasoning. 
Remove all craft behind the camera. Also remove all talent in front of it.
Disregard all sense of logic and reason. (Remember, this is science fiction! Don't be afraid to put your heroes within 5 feet of an exploding volcano, or performing dino-blood transfusions in the back of a moving ship, or narrowly escaping the jaws of a lethal dinosaur several times per scene. Audiences don't expect logic! They want hungry-hungry dinosaurs!)
Remember, audiences don't want a simple action movie with well-written characters and clear action. Make sure to incorporate lofty plots about the weaponization of raptors, selling dinosaurs to wealthy foreign buyers for sport, etc. Make sure the scientists are still trying to genetically engineer more deadly animals!!! That's what audiences want! More plot points = good. 
Use editing to cut back and forth between drastically different scenes (ie, a girl playing games in her house and a woman performing surgery on a velociraptor. Repeat as often as possible). More editing = good. 
Continue tacking on ingredients in no discernible order until the film is over 2 hours long. Longer runtime = good. 
Make the ending scary so that the audience won't remember how boring and awful the rest of the movie was. Preferably in a big mansion with no lights and long, narrow hallways and screaming little girls. Yeah, that. 
Conclude with the little girl spelling out the overall theme of the movie in one or two sentences. Reshoot until her acting makes your eyes roll back in your head. Top it off with a voiceover by Jeff Goldblum that is nearly verbatim to the final lines of ""The Lost World."" Voila!Remove from oven once box office reaches $300 million domestically! Excited for the sequel? We didn't think so, either. Happy cooking!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

The whole plot and the characters' decisions make no sense at all and are aggressively stupid. This has to be one of the worst scripts of the year. Its whole structure is very awkward and makes the movie seem like a mere setup for the inevitable third film, which I'm really not looking forward to after this mind-numbingly dumb sequel.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

From start to finish, you really are left wondering what the whole view on dinosaurs really is. Do we want to save them? Are we scared of them? Do we just get rid of the ""bad"" ones? Who knows. At the end of the day though, everyone in the movie is running and trying to survive these giant extinct monsters. I feel like the answer is very simple.
The movie passes a very dumb, very sequel plot line through with the thought that the audience would just love looking at the beautiful cg dinosaurs and not even notice anything else. However, in this day and age, great CG is expected not admired, and I wanted to walk out of the movie. There was way too many dramatic running sequences and a bad boring script that at one point had two adult strangers trying to persuade a little girl to come with them and to leave her family and everything she knows. Just so much left and right that was so not good that you almost couldn't look away, but actually it wasn't bad enough to even do that.

If they keep doing it, I see the risk of spectators get bored. If they have plan B script like spinning off the major track, better see and think about it.I am very sorry about the director. I didn't see actors really running scared from the erupting volcano. Also the bunker scene when the easily freaked-out boy so afraid of the dino.

The second half of the movie is just a broken down mess.....Shipping the dinosaurs off the island to a rich persons estate and containing them in an underground vault/lab, give me a break...No character development from Howard or Pratt's characters, they're literally only in this movie because they were in the first one. As if cloning dinosaurs wasn't enough, now we have these scientists who we find out have cloned a little girl. they're trying to throw the cloning thing in the audience face harder than ever this time. Rehashing the same old ideas of creating a genetic hybrid and using dinosaurs as military weapons and actually auctioning them off this time for that very purpose. again, give me a break...The only redemption this movie really has is Jeff Goldblum returning as Ian Malcolm, you know what, stuff it, i'm going to upgrade my 5/10 to a 6/10 literally just because he is in it. after all he is the one true ""star"" of jurassic world. everyone else is just there for the hell of it or just there as dinosaur food.The movie concludes with Blue (Pratts special raptor) looking out over a city just to let us know they're going to beat the dead horse yet again and deliver us another pointless sequel. All in all Fallen Kingdom does offer an extremely entertaining first hour but the second half just flat out tries to be something it isn't. enough said. Go see it for yourself!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
416,maurodc,Great follow-up to the franchise,10,17 July 2018,"Jurassic Park is one of my favorite sagas of all time. And as fan, I must say that I loved 'Fallen Kingdom'. It is very entertaining, funny, and excitingly epic in many ways.As the previous films, it has great visuals and sound editing. The photography is excellent and the dinosaurs are awesome. The script is really good with funny moments and dialogues, and it's good to see this two characters back again, and also to see Dr. Malcolm once more after a long time.If you're a follower of the Jurassic series who liked and enjoyed all the previous films, this won't be the exception for you. It is a funny, entertaining, exciting and epic ride that you can't miss.Enjoy!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

I actually like her in these movies, she is pretty and seem like a lovable leading lady. What I enjoy basically is the dialogue between Owen and Clair , and the CGI effects. I don't know why there are so many negative reviews yes it has been done before, but you go with that idea. I enjoyed it , It's an entertaining movie, it's not an Oscar winning movie.

It's sequel, the 2018 Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom however doesn't enjoy that privilege. I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. 
I saw this movie on the 10th of June, given it released in India before US. I felt it was a significant improvement upon it's predecessor. The thrill element was back, and the with the destruction of Isla Nublar, the series took a new direction. That's definitely something Brave. Director J.A. Bayona who is an expert at helming horror movies, sets the 2nd half of the movie, in a secluded mansion which provides him the opportunity to stage some thrillingly dark sequences.

Active vulcano? Harder level. 
Why they always think to save raptors and trex first place?Ok lets watch this film. Starts fine like always. I was happy to see when the commander shoot mr smart to calm him down. That was real.
But than they just left him there? Come on! And the whole film falls from that point.
He rolls away from lava? Is it a joke?
Is not vulcanos hot? Ash and smoke also contains danger and heat. But ppl runs around and jump off the cliff among with animals. How animals jumped anyway? I dont think they would jump.As usual nobody hurts from main caratcers bacause of heat, jump, shaking, rolling, bitten by monsters.Of course last minute escape as usual from danger. Trex is his friend now? What is this? Other story line sallow as usual, bad guys want some bad things. Use monstertrex dna to tailor a new weapon. Story is lame but good enough for Hollywood cinamas. 
Good guys try tonsave the world and bad guys about tondestroy more than thank think.So 4 good guy sneak in military protected ferrt to steal million dollars dinos. Of course.Trex and all other animals locked in a normal truck?How they steal that truck? It has to be a driver who drovi in is not he missing his own truck? Driver of the truck does not realised he came with it and now he walks?And than bring them in a secret basement, what is so secret even Sir Oldguy did not even notice it somebody building elevator and 3 floor down underground with security, tech, cages etc... never see builders coming to his house to build that fort under his castle? Commander look smarter before but now he is went inside the predators cage.Dinos shout with open mouth when they show up, eat, hunt, or take any move. Why?
Shout that strong everybodys hair. That so Disney.The new dino is a killing machine with perfect sences but cant smell them when they behind something?
Runs fast but cant catch a child?
Broke walls and cages with force but could not break the food lifts door?
I think all of this clamsy mistakes is too much for this dino, that is the reason she climbs in top of the house and shout.
I cant see an other reason. Why climbs on top? And if she is hunting why roaring?How is it possible the dino knows which one is her bedroom and she is hiding there?
Ok, find her, but that killing monster is so gentle and slow. Why so slow all of sudden? She was about to kill that kid any second and now do nothing, even roar without funcion again.
Than theatrical ends, fall in two spikes.Why those caracters so stupid? Let raptor out to protect them?And in the end setvall of them free? They did not learn anything.One button with ""open all gates"". Just like in cartoons.This is the third movie endimg with birds are escape.
Where are they???
2001 escaped a lot of birds. Than 2015 again and now 2018 escaped again. Why not any new about them?",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
425,politicidal,A big grand blockbuster that is even better than the first Jurassic World,8,22 June 2018,"J. A. Bayona has made a mammoth of a sequel that not only cranks up the action and suspense that people expect from the JP/JW franchise, but brings back some of the heart as well.Seriously, there are surprisingly dark imagery and sometimes moving moments that occur in a movie of all things that has an exploding island, mutant dinosaurs, and cloned humans.Admittedly, the set up takes a bit (roughly 20 minutes?) to reintroduce the characters and establish the stakes. And what stakes? The island is apparently set to explode during a volcanic eruption! So Claire (Howard) and Owen (Pratt) are tasked to rescue the remaining dinosaurs and transport them off to the mainland, ostensibly for safekeeping, But this being a Jurassic Park movie, there's evul corporate types wanting to profit off the prehistoric creatures and betray our heroes. So it boils down to a relentlessly exciting climax in a massive gothic styled mansion. The new mutant dinosaur, the Indoraptor, is legitimately scary and the visual effects used for it are outstanding. The action scenes are thrilling and sometimes even funny. Even though it IS a substantially darker movie than the last Jurassic World, there is humor to be had in the script.Chris Pratt is awesome as always while Bryce Dallas Howard's character is much more likable than the ice queen she was in the last movie. Supporting characters fall squarely in the good or evil category. Daniella Pineda is a standout though because she's a funny and brave sidekick. Justice Smith is annoying as the stereotypical black nerd unfortunately. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a blast of a blockbuster and a lot of fun for dinosaur enthusiasts everywhere.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
426,jmillerjr-00983,"Sorry, Wanted to Love It",4,16 July 2018,"So there are three things I look for in a Jurassic Park movie. #1 - Science stuff. Characters debating ethics, new experiments being tried, that kind of thing gets me in the chair to see the movie. It all goes back to that dinner conversation in the original movie where they are debating the whole idea. Brilliant. Grant, Malcolm, Hammond, the lawyer, really cool conversation, even if the middle of a big budget flick. #2 - The awe and wonder. Epic scenery, swelling music, and CGI that seems to blend in well with the natural environment. And then #3 - The horror elements, of which I am not a big fan, but it seems like the only way they can get people in to see these movies is with blood and guts.So, how did JW:FK do in these three areas?1. Lots of ridiculousness. Malcom seemed to disagree with Claire and Owen, but you'd never know it because they never met. Basically, the plot line was Lost World all over again. There were several times I found myself rooting against the main characters. Frankly, they are responsible for a lot of the death in the film. The plot line just didn't seem thought through.2. JP and JW got this one really right. LW, JP3 and FK just have bland sets that don't really get your attention.3. Yeah, there is plenty of guts, cause I guess that's why people pay for. So if that's what you're into, go for it.I like the franchise, but this film was pretty freaking ridiculous. Bring back Alan Grant and I'll probably go to the next one.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
427,PubHound,"Slightly better than JW1, but still pretty dumb",5,8 June 2018,"Maybe I shouldn't follow this franchise anymore, the age bar has been drastically lowered since the first three movies, now more appealing to children , but definitely unbearable for adults. The protagonists look like indestructible superheroes, dealing with hyperbolic situations that would most certainly be fatal in the real world, and easily getting out of them without consequences. There's no more love for the craft, just blandness filling (almost) every single scene and no concreteness whatsoever. Another forgettable attempt to exploit the original.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
428,sugardaddy-31900,Generic and old,5,13 March 2019,"This was an average film with an average story line, average acting, average excitement, average action...just average everything.
The dinosaurs don't look any more real than any of the other films, even the 1st film. This will they, won't they sexual tension between the two stars was so lame, it was off putting. Same story about the mad sciencetist making a new, scarier dinosaur is just old news. This was so predictable, it hurts. I was looking forward to watching this for months and I'm really disappointed. Unfortunately, they've pandered to the masses and made this kid friendly again. It's a dinosaur movies where they kill and eat people so let them loose and kill everything in sight.P.S
Just on the 1st page of this review page are 25 reviews, 17 of which gave it 10/10 rating and two gave it 9's.

stimulating like Meet the Kardashians.Firstly the Dinosaurs now all have a quirky persona, they're no longer the ancient reptile similar to your modern Nile Crocodile or Komodo Dragon, these guys jump in for a fight to help you and show love, affection and anger. Secondly, I couldn't bare the site of seeing men armed with MP5 and Colt Rifles enter in a location teaming with beasts the size of buildings, like a Colt Rifle is going to stop a charging 16-Tonne Tyrannosaurus Rex.

431,chiluvr1228,Save your money,1,5 July 2018,"I am truly shocked at all the people who have given this movie a 9 or 10, just plain surprised at anyone who give it more than a 3. Makes me wonder about the ratings system on IMDB because these people can't possibly have enjoyed this movie.It started out okay but quickly went down hill. A once dormant volcano on Isla Nublar is starting to erupt. I guess John Hammond didn't give that a thought when he built Jurassic Park. So now our heroes have been summoned by Hammond's one time partner to save the dinos. Only he's oblivious to what is really going on. The head ""bad"" guy wants to bring the dinosaurs, not to a supposed sanctuary like he told our heroes but to this castle in Northern California where they have strong cages in the basement. There's an auction with some caricatures of bad guys, a granddaughter who is not what she appears (although I suspected it rather quickly) and the usual action sequences from all the other JP's included the T-Rex who saves our heroes once again. Anybody recall how much noise the T-Rex made in the first couple of scenes in the original? However from the middle of the first one, they apparently have taken ninja training as they show up out of nowhere.I felt a little sad for the dinosaurs left on the island as the volcano was exploding but that is the only emotion other than boredom I felt in this movie. Unfortunately it looks like there will be one more sequel (and hopefully the last) as now the dinos are loose in Northern California. Don't waste your money, wait for it to come out on Netflix or whatever streaming device you use because this was a horrible movie in every way. If I hadn't been with someone I would have left halfway through.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

433,markj-02556,PREDICTABLE WORLD,6,9 August 2018,"This film is a sequel to Jurassic World. It follows the two leads from the original as they try to keep dinosaurs alive against growing tensions about the extinction of the formally extinct creatures.This film is directed by J.A. Bayona (The Orphanage). It stars Chris Pratt (The Lego Movie) and Bryce Dallas Howard (Jurassic World) reprising their roles from the original.Bayona is a talented director, who brought a sense of real danger and peril not seen since the original Jurassic Park. It is also entertaining from start to finish, I never felt bored, and finally, the sets, especially the mansion, are beautiful and seem more fully realized than the characters themselves, along with the dinosaurs.But, strangely Pratt gives a sub par performance, and everything they did with a young girl just seemed wrong. I'm not blaming the actress I'm blaming the writers. Which brings us to the worst aspect of the film. THE WRITING!!! Some lines made me cringe in my seat and say to myself NO, JUST NO! It is also one of the most predictable films ever made, every plot point seems done before.Predictable, but still watchable.6/10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
434,benjicaunce-19647,Mediocrity,6,25 November 2018,Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom brings very little more to the franchise however is not as abominable as other cinematic entries to a franchise.,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
435,Popcorn_Media,Dino-Mite!,8,9 June 2018,"A movie of two halves... The island rescue (action) and the Lockwood mansion chaos (almost horror in its style). The strongest for me is the first half and features some great moments and some really emotional scenes. One in particular (which was devoid of dinosaurs) was the way director J.A. Bayona shot a rapidly sinking Gyrosphere. This director certainly knows how to use water to build tension from his incredible 2nd film THE IMPOSSIBLE and this moment is claustrophobic and a joy to watch. The 2nd half pulls in the resigns somewhat and gets super dark and suspenseful. I guess your enjoyment of each varies on your preferred genres.
Speaking of beautiful, JURASSIC WORLD: FALLEN KINGDOM features some of the most stunning cinematography I've seen in a long-time throughout its entire run-time... The Indoraptor roaring on the rooftop and the final shots of the island to name just two are gorgeous to look at. Some of these moments are sure to become timeless as the franchise continues.
It's also stuffed full of some of the most incredible CGI I've ever witnessed, it really doesn't miss a beat and this time out, unlike 2015's movie, spotting the shift to animatronics and back again was almost impossible.
As a long time Jurassic fan there's an incredible amount of fan service dotted throughout, including countless dialogue moments that are ripped straight out of the original Jurassic park film. Many shots and sequences from both the original and its sequel are expertly recreated in ways that are both new yet recognisable.
The script is a noticeable improvement from 2015's release with very few cheesy or awkward dialogue moments however the story itself is much more confined, taking place in only two locations in its 2 hour run-time. This came as a bit of a disappointment, especially considering I'd seen the trailers and they unquestionably gave far too much story away and left little in surprise, (there are still a few twists and turns awaiting even for the most researched fans though!) This isn't technically the films fault (I'm laying the blame on Universal) but it definitely robbed me of some enjoyment.
FALLEN KINGDOM also sees the return of Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, both do a Dino-Mite job! The chemistry between the two is great and has some real depth as we slowly piece together what happened to them after the events of the first film. The real star of the show here though is young Isabella Sermon (Maisie Lockwood) She had some of the most emotional driven scenes in the whole film and she smashed it! Supporting cast members Daniella Pineda and Justice Smith walk the fine line between comedy relief and silliness without it being cringe. Ted Levine who plays ranger Franklin is just about passable but the film could have done without Toby Jones who (for me at least) always brings B-class movie cheese with him wherever he goes. It was great to see Jeff Goldblum and BD Wong reappear in the series but don't expect to see them much.. It's a shame really as for the screen-time they are given they bring a lot to the story.Overall FALLEN KINGDOM is a solid and surprising claustrophobic dino thriller, stuffed with fan pleasing easter eggs and stunning cinematography. The overall story doesnt evolve as far as I would have liked but it injects some much needed terror and style into this 25 year old dinosaur franchise.www.popcornography.co.uk

448,SnowLeopardMaster,Actually much better than other people say.,10,22 October 2018,"Haters gonna hate. And they targeted this movie. I've read the reviews, I've heard other people gripe about it, but in all honesty, I still fail to see what's wrong with this movie.In my opinion, it's the best Jurassic film since The Lost World. The opening scene in particular may be the best opening scene in the entire franchise, including Jurassic Park. It's incredibly well shot, and the suspense is built up perfectly. The underwater sequences are kind of terrifying, and it actually kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.Then, it's time to meet the protagonists. Claire has changed her ways substantially since Jurassic World, and I like this new Claire a lot better.People have criticized the main characters in the movie. It's been claimed that Owen goes through absolutely no justified character development and is just the cliche big strong buff guy who's there to fight stuff. Kind of reminds me of Indiana Jones, don't you think? They're really similar, don't you think? And isn't Raiders of the Lost Ark a well loved movie with a 95% rotten tomatoes score?People have also criticized the villains in this movie, calling them cliche, bland, and predictable. However, is Dennis Nedry from the first film any different? He's a fat computer nerd who's got financial issues and isn't well paid. Kind of sounds cliche, don't you think? So why does Fallen Kingdom get criticized for this, but Jurassic Park doesn't?Also, the movie easily has the most tear jerking scene in the entire franchise: Leaving the Brachiosaurus behind. No joke, I started weeping right there in the theater. That image of the poor Brachiosaur chasing after the boat, calling out for it to come back, as it's engulfed in volcanic ash and dies, is absolutely heartbreaking. Well done, Fallen Kingdom.Then comes the scenes within Lockwood Manor. Now, this is where J.A. Bayona's time to shine as a director is. The horror sequences are very well shot, dramatic, suspenseful, and just straight up spectacular.I can't find anything wrong with this movie that isn't already a problem with other great, critically acclaimed movies.

450,pulikd,Jurassic Park V. Dawn of Chaos,5,28 July 2021,"The original dinosaur island turns out to have rested on a dormant volcano the whole time, and that volcano is now awake, about to wipe all the creatures out. Despite another dinosaur island having existed this whole time, the fifth movie in this franchise states that all the dinosaurs are on that one island, about to go extinct again. Very significant events may have taken place off screen in between some of these movies, which isn't a positive thing to say. Claire is now headed for that island with several others in order to save as many species as possible. So, this is about dinosaur transportation again.Owen is here as well, so this is the first ""Jurassic Park"" movie with two major players from the previous one, which is fresh. But the volcanic eruption does not take long, and the island screen time is short. The movie cannot wait to get back to the civilized world where the rescued animals now are. This part of the movie is nighttime, and the climax uses pouring rain. The same goes for the little opening scene where, unlike the last time, the franchise once again has some people hurt or killed by dinosaurs. And the pouring rain is there again.Of all the sequels, this one relies more than ever on the so called nostalgia. Even one of the old heroes is back. Though he is only in the movie for a handful of seconds, this is not a bad way to bring back an old character. They cannot take part in big action scenes because of their age, but the world is interested in their opinion on the current crisis. The movie brings the old character back because of his experience, and seeing Doctor Malcolm was nice.There is another thing this movie relies the heaviest on of all the franchise yet. It is the clear line between the good and the bad guys among the human individuals. And because of that, it isn't just the carnivore dinosaurs that our heroes must deal with. Also, it is worth mentioning the death scenes. Some of them are the stupidest in the franchise. That isn't a positive thing to say. Not to mention how the movie turns people into villains without good reason. No movie before this was as stupid in the franchise.There are many dinosaurs, both herbivores and carnivores, only the movie does not focus on them much. The visual effects are good, but there is too much CGI, more than ever before. And this doesn't go for the creature effects alone. But that's all visual effects, they do not occupy the whole screen time. How about the visuals in general, the colors, the lights? Surprisingly and unfortunately, there is a big problem here. It is very easy to see, but quite difficult to explain. For clarification, an example is required.Let's take a moment from the previous movie, one where the two kids encounter the new super predator for the first time, right before it attacks some of the armored dinosaurs. The kids are in their ""gyrosphere"", facing the jungle, four herbivores in front of them. But there is something behind them, and they turn around to take a look. But the sun is right behind their backs, and when they turn their heads around, they are basically blinded, they cannot see the threat. They see very bright light, which is uncomfortable both for them and the audience to look at. But it does not last long, because the scary carnivore dinosaur opens that huge mouth to roar at them, the jaws creating an obstacle for the light, and we can now see a scary dark silhouette.This way to use light, in this particular example, is driven by the plot. It signifies danger that comes from your blind side. But what if this method is used a great many times with no good reason? What if, time and time again, the movie uses light in such a way, that the source of light, be it the sun, or be it a lamp, or a number of them, is staring the audience right in the face, rendering all around it bleak, dark, and simply uncomfortable to see? Well, when that happens, a movie like ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" is made.There is a kid here, and that little girl was wonderful, as was the cast in general. The visual effects were good, as should be expected from a movie of this caliber. Too bad the plot wasn't so good. Even worse, the cinematography is a problem because of how light is used in the frame. And that, by the way, is becoming more and more common of big budget productions. The ending, however, is promising, and with Colin Trevorrow back to direct it, improvements can take place.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

452,sagniknath,Had potential but ended up being mediocre due to bad scriptwriting,5,22 June 2018,"The best I can say of the film is that the premise was somewhat original compared to the 1st Jurassic World (although it still copied quite a bit from The Lost World) . I liked the general idea of dinosaurs loose in a mansion (as shown in the trailer) instead of the usual jungle or city venues. There were some good ideas and scenes thrown about here and there.Also, Chris Pratt's character is more relatable this time round. But the rest is just a sordid mess. They set up these plot twists as if they are going to be mind blowing but when they pay off, it feels so dumb and distant from the main tension in the movie. And I still can't figure out what Bryce Howard's character is all about. It was a complete mystery in JW1 and now it's simply baffling that she is still relevant in JW2. What the writers could have intelligently done is simply remove her character completely and focus more on Chris Pratt and the two new kids and cement their relationship. This could have perfectly mirrored the relationship Alan Grant had with Hammond's grandkids in the original JP. It's not as if they don't already waste a lot of screen time referencing the older better JP movies by recreating certain memorable moments and shoving in the iconic John Williams theme whenever possible.
The 2 new kids (stereotypical chippy doctor girl and nervous tech geek) again were just painfully underutilized. They only served to pull in the teen demographic in the audience. In the end, I can swear the script was infact NOT made by any human but rather the outcome of a Machine Learning algorithm that was tasked to pump out a script that promised maximum immediate sales for the studio . A sad world indeed",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

The film has so many plot holes, characters doing things that make absolutely no sense. Cringeworthy, embarrassing acting and one of the worst endings I've ever seen in a movie. It's a bit embarrassing how dinosaurs making a lot of money despite being pandering, lazy and unwatchable pieces of garbage yet movies from A24 and other underrated studios and directors bomb.If you like this movie then that's fine, like what you like.

454,breckstewart,Franchise Fatigue Setting in,5,19 May 2019,"I don't know why but it took me a long while before I felt like watching this one. Something about it seemed quite predictable and I got a ""been there done that"" sort of feel from it. But last night I was bored so I said to myself, why not give it a shot. So here we go.First, the pros are there for sure. The effects are very well done as expected, the story zipped along at a fast enough pace and the acting was good and adequate for this genre. So why was I so disappointed?I think it's because as I watched, I felt like I had seen all this before and could almost predict in details what would happen next. I really tried hard to let myself get invaded by the story and gave it a fair shot but as the film progressed I got more and more disillusioned to the point that I had to fast forward certain scenes to speed things along even though the story was not exactly that slow.I guess it's also because there's been quite a few movies in that franchise already and well, it seemed like overkill. But that doesn't totally explain why I disliked it. I think it's just that I might not be in the key demographics for this particular type of movie even though I usually like sci-fiction films.A 5 star rating might seem low compared with all the glowing reviews this got here although at rottentomatoes it was certified rotten with a 48% score which I tend to agree with. Basically, I got blasé quite fast and my level of interest declined instead of rising. So if you end up liking or even loving it, good for you. But as for me, I am not fond of this and will never watch it again.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
455,TYContact1,"Part 2 is improved by new, interesting action scenes, and impressive set pieces - gotta experience it in the theatre!",8,7 September 2018,"The original Jurassic Park is iconic, so let's not compare this to that: it's a different era with different technology, and different actors available.Most Part 2 movies have the pitfall of rushed dialogues (assuming all audience have watched Part 1), recycled action scenes (using Part 1 props save $), dragging philosophical review or weepy flashbacks of Part 1 (padding screen time), bizarre sudden change in characters' casting/ personality, or a confusing head trip into the future or some incomprehensible scenarios that makes you wonder if this ""Part 2"" is related to the original Part 1 story at all.Fallen Kingdom manages to avoid most of the pitfalls: the gyrospheres feature again, but under water; this time, dangers on the island include volcanic eruption - it's not just dangerous to humans, dinosaurs have to flee as well (stampede alert!). Without specific references / spoilers to particular scenes, let's just say volcanic eruption has played a role in some intense, touching and/or hilarious scenes. Some plots are predictable, such as ""evil scientists"" shipping off / selling / researching on dinosaurs, an environmental subject explored in Part 1. However, Part 2 spins some humour into the rescue mission. The new characters Webb and Rodriguez are welcome addition to Grady's team.I do not find the plot twist near the ending forced, because I picked up the hints from the scientists' conversations. Part 2 did a good job carrying on the events on the island from Part 1. The storyline is actually more defined and all the missions and side characters have a clear purpose, whereas Part 1 felt experimental, loosely focused, and took awhile to kick into action (no one knew if the reboot would succeed, so understandably Part 1 couldn't afford to make a tight script with non-stop actions). I look forward to Part 3 - hope it won't be a messy ending with mindless explosions...",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Every few years they have to come up with a new one or park loses numbers. 2. With 1 being a reality, 10m for a dinosaur isn't so far of a stretch. To us in our world yes 10m seems a little low. But this isn't our world. This is their universe with their rules. 3. Could this movie have been better? Yes. 4. Was it good? Yes.5. Was it a safe movie? Yes. And it admittedly didn't take many risks which isn't necessarily a bad thing. 6. Was it a remake of The Lost World? Uh no. This is a much better movie than The Lost World and while some things are similar the plot is different. 7. Is this a movie that works as beginning middle and end movie? Not quite. I found this movie a transitional movie. While the previous films minus the third movie was about corporate greed, this is about human greed. It also was a movie that admittedly doesn't add much to the story but works a film that is transitioning the events from Jurassic World to Jurassic World 3 set to come out the 28th anniversary of when the original film debuted in the theaters.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

460,lennybuttz,Great expectations crashed and burned.,3,11 June 2018,"For me to say this movie sucked is an understatement. Jurassic World was a really great movie. The only explanation I can think of is they rushed to production with no script or credible idea for a part 2. There's a lot of action but it's so disconnected, the characters have no depth, it's just plain boring. Sure there's dinosaurs running amok, people screaming and dying and being evil but it doesn't make you feel anything, not scared, not hopeful, well it did make me feel sad that I wasted my time watching this crap. Even the obligatory child character was boring and really out of place. I was so disappointed with this movie. I expected so much more. It was kind of nice to see Jeff Goldboom wish he would have had a bigger part it might have been a little interesting then. The direction they took with this installment has ruined the whole franchise for me just like Star Trek when they destroyed Vulcan and rewrote the whole timeline. This takes away the warm and fuzzy feeling and replaces it with nausea. They totally jumped the shark. Bye Bye Jurassic World.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

They would be hunted down and killed by the military, in a far more painful way than simply passing out from the gas.

With this I was on my iPad, doing something else. I mostly don't understand the need for this film. Jurassic World ended on a good ending. Why make a terrible sequel?

466,sheldonnylander,Just Don't Bother,2,21 September 2019,"Brain hurt. Me no likey. Err...umm...ahem.This is a movie that really stretches it as far as believability, logic, or even physics.First, just a quick note: The trailer makes it seem like the movie spends its time on an island about to blow up. Less than half the movie is that. So, if you're looking for a long drawn out volcanic eruption, look elsewhere.The heroes are annoying and dumb caricatures, from the techie who's afraid of everything to the wisecracking animal wrangler (in fairness, this is Chris Pratt's character from the previous film, but still). The villains are short-sighted, moustache-twirling dolts who never seem to remember to watch behind them, especially in dangerous scenarios. And why was Jeff Goldblum even in this movie? He serves no purpose to the story. None at all. He's there for them to say, ""See! We have someone from the older movies, so it ties together."" That's literally all he's there to do for his two minutes of screen time.It's the same plot as every other Jurassic Park/World film. Let's create/genetically engineer dinosaurs. What could possibly go wrong? Even the supposed ""plot twist"" could be figured out from the very beginning of the film. Basic physics don't even apply, such as the impossible truck jump at one point. I swear I could feel my brain leaking out of my ears while watching this.This film honestly makes me somewhat relieved that Colin Trevorrow got removed from Star Wars Episode IX. Unfortunately, the way this movie ends basically guarantees that there's going to be another one. Although it begs the question about what happened to Jurassic Park III since it ends in a similar way. Is that film even supposed to be canon anymore?Just don't bother. Even if you love the dinosaur special effects of previous films, there's really not much here that you didn't see before, and some of it is actually pretty bad and unbelievable for a film from 2018. Just don't bother.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
467,rolandjordaan2,Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom - Spoiler Free Review,1,14 September 2018,"To this day, I still consider the original 'Jurassic Park' to be one of the greatest films ever made, 'Jurassic World' on the other hand...let's just say that when people tell me they liked it, I find myself questioning my relationship with that person. Still the movie made more than a billion at the box office, so a sequel was inevitable, I know, because I just sat through it, yes that is the level of masochism I have become willing to endure to write these reviews...that I'm still 99% sure nobody ever reads. 
Now I'll be fair, the first 10 minutes of this movie actually was pretty good, the opening was very similar to that of the first movie: very gritty, quite intense, the dinosaurs were mostly kept in the shadows...if they had just stuck to that formula, I actually would have loved this. The few minutes after that wasn't too bad either, Jeff Goldblum made his cameo for the trailer, we had an appearance from John Hammond's walking stick, it was all serviceable...and then we're reintroduced to Chris Pratt, yes I know his character has a name, but screw it, from now on I'm just always going to call him Chris Pratt, because he ALWAYS plays the exact same character: 'Jurassic World', 'Guardians of the Galaxy', 'Magnificent Seven', hell even 'Passengers', a movie I really liked, still had him playing that tough guy, one liner spouting, slightly sarcastic, using a bad boy image to hide his heart of gold, character, and it's just starting to run really stale, really quickly. Bryce Dallas Howard returns too, and I will admit that she didn't annoy me quite as much here as in the previous entry, but that's kinda like saying that my Tinder date who spent 30 minutes making fun of my speech was slightly less awful than the one who threatened to shoot me. Tim and Lex from the original film return too...okay fine, it's not Tim and Lex, these two morons are called Zia and Franklin, and they're completely different to Tim and Lex in the sense that in the original Tim was the tough kid dino expert and Lex was the scared hacker kid, forced by circumstances to find her inner courage while here: Zia is the tough kid dino expert and Franklin is the scared hacker kid, forced by circumstances to find his courage. These two are the comic relief characters and I cannot put into words how much I detested every second that they were on screen. There's a little girl who makes out a 5th of the hero pack too, who simply gets waaay too much screen time with her limited acting ability. These five characters are not only our main protagonists: they are our ONLY protagonists and this is the first major fault with this movie, we know the Jurassic Park formula by now. They are not going to kill off a kid, they are not going to kill off the comic relief characters (no matter how much we wished they would) and they definitely are not going to kill off our two main heroes, so we're stuck watching a movie with zero intensity, because we know from the beginning that none of our heroes are going to die. The villains, on the other hand, we know the exact outcome, none of them have any character traits other than being greedy and villainous; Roland Tempo from 'The Lost World' was technically a villain, but he had redeeming qualities, qualities we could relate to and what's more, the villains had connections to each other, when they died, their friends felt it, so we felt it; here, if a villain dies, we don't care, because the characters don't care, they are simply cannon fodder, thrown in, because finally in the third act the writers remembered that this movie should probably kill some people off for fan service. Then we get to the plot, lol, a plot in a Jurassic World sequel, I make myself laugh sometimes. The just of it is that dinosaurs are facing extinction, because a huge volcano is threatening to destroy Isla Nublar and all the dinosaurs on it (I have two words for you Isla Sorna, did you forget that exists??). A greedy corporation wants to capture the dinosaurs and sell them to the highest bidder, so they go to the island to capture them, before the volcano erupts, and our heroes are invited along, because, well, I guess we had to bring them into the movie somehow. So, I know what you're thinking, isn't that basically the exact plot to 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park'? And yes, they did basically remake that movie, only difference is they removed everything that people actually liked about it and focused on the parts that were critically panned. You like the island sequences? Well don't get too attached to it, because, regardless of what the first trailer made us believe, we're only there for about 10 to 15 minutes before switching the movie to the mainland. Yep, the bulk of Jurassic World plays off in a mansion owned by a man named Benjamin Lockwood, who apparently helped Hammond create the dinosaurs, funny how we just made it through four movies without any mention of a co-creator...convenient. From there on, really nothing happens, our villains do villain things, our heroes do heroic things (which in this universe means they act like idiots and just get lots of people killed) and the movie ends with the second part of Jeff Goldblum's trailer monologue and setting up the next sequel. So, is there anything positive I can say about this movie? Uhm, the original John Williams theme is still there and that's always nice to hear, uhm, the CGI is better than the previous film, anything else? NO! This movie is awful, it's a waste of time and yet another painful entry into, what was once, a brilliant franchise. In closing, I will say that this movie didn't anger me quite as much as 'Jurassic World' did, but that was simply because I had spent 14 years waiting for that film and went in with the highest hopes, while here I waited less than three and went in expecting nothing...exactly what the film gave me, so at least I can say it lived up to expectations...so, I guess well done for that?",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Chris Pratt barely moves a face muscle and Bryce Howard doesn't blink for almost the entire film. You think I'm joking; were they coached?
It starts fairly routinely but quickly abandons any sense of realism. The magic as science turns each scene into a ride to crazy town until it inexplicably turns into a horror movie for kids, complete with fairy tale music.
In fact it may as well have written by children when nothing makes any sense and the ending, although visually impressive, makes even less. As if that's possible.
Weirdly, for all the Dino action, it gets pretty dull quite quickly.

470,patboldt,The Title Sums it Up: JP is Dead,4,20 October 2018,"How could a movie fail so miserably! I'll tell you how it's because it failed to have a story worth telling! There is no reason to create this movie, there is nothing worth adding to this franchise! It's worthless! It's garbage!All that aside, this movie is very seriously flawed. First off, if you saw the trailer, you saw the movie, you have even less reason to see this failure of a film. For a movie that lasts for two hours, it fails to keep your attention once it gets to the second half. This is mostly because the writing is just non-existent. It's the same story of The Lost World except it's less interesting and the second half has all the dinosaurs trapped in a house. We also get more of the evil military business from the last movie, and obviously, the executives didn't realize that nobody liked that element from the movie, and the movie goes exactly where you will expect it to go with them.None of the actors are bad per se, at least not in the way that characters in a Michael Bay movie are, but they just have no impact. They have no lines to chew on, no dialogue that will leave an impact or any sort of memorability. This film desperately needs some badass one-liners for Chris Pratt but the writers were too lazy to do that and it shows. Even when the film attempts to add some new concepts which the audience will learn towards the end of the movie, they aren't developed and fully realized, just shoved into the movie as a way of saying ""Hey, that's different, that's a cool idea!""This whole movie just comes off as a lazy Hollywood screenplay. Some may try to defend it by saying that people are hating it because its popular. Here's the thing. This isn't being hated in the way that The Last Jedi is hated where the criticisms tend to be illogical and poorly based, this is hated in the way that the Michael Bay Transformers movies are hated. The hatred for this movie is due to how unoriginal and lazily written it was, and peope are upset because they don't want the Jurassic Park franchise to become the next Tranformers franchise where every movie is the same uninspired pile of garbage.

479,travishouze,"Another ""Jurassic"" Meh.",5,21 June 2018,"Jurassic World and it's follow up Fallen Kingdom are both so aggressively ""meh"" that it amazes me that its become the phenomenon its been lately. The film takes place after the disaster of Jurassic World being overrun by dinosaurs and money hungry men in suits, as they try to retrieve several of the dinosaurs from the park. But to no one's surprise, we find out soon enough the men in suits are using the rescue op as a chance to snatch up the dinosaurs and sell them as predators.The film almost exclusively takes place in only 2 locations, the island and this insanely large estate. The moments in the park go by so fast that we are out of the park only 50 minutes into this 2 hour film. For people here to see Jeff Goldblum, he's literally only in the movie for one scene of exposition. His moments are so detached from what else is happening, you could edit him out and the movie wouldn't be affected. There's also a scene involving Chris Pratt outrunning a valance eruption, and it's as ridiculous as it sounds.Its not all bad, as some of it's horror like tone helps with the of the tension in some moments, particularly one moment that involves reflection and shadows really nicely. There are some moments when Blue, the raptor is fighting with one of the dinosaurs that gets pretty nice to watch. There are some moments where the dinosaurs are attempted to give them distinct personalities and a bit of moral conflict is woven into the plot.My biggest issue with the Jurassic World franchise so far is it thinks you are more invested with the characters than you really are. This film made me wonder if there is any where else this franchise can even go, as I feel it's told me the same things already.

The only real difference this time is just how boring it really is . Huge stretches of this film are quite dull and force you into thinking about why characters are doing everything they are doing , and just why we should care about things they seem to care about . It comes heavy handed with messages , mostly one written by a new generation of people who would damn humanity for animal kind ... which I find baffling. All that being said chris pratt is fun as the director tries to do some of his own take on Indiana Jones and it kind of works in a strange story forcing other characters in , his character has some real touching moments with the real star (blue the raptor). The dinosaurs look great and it's fun to watch them , which is really the reason to buy a ticket .

(5/10)""Fallen Kingdom"" try's so hard to be different from ""Jurassic World"" that it ends up being ""Jurassic Park 2"".
Is ""Fallen Kingdom"" a good ride? It's okay. The plot is a little more convoluted, with numerous human villains and less family-unfriendly blood. Cut from the same DNA as all of the previous ""Jurassics"", this one has some tension, but never lives up to its potential. The minuscule narrative is the same, the characters repeat the same mistakes, and the two lovers escape the jaws of death again, paving the way for yet another installment.
Mr. Bayona and the screenwriters, Colin Trevorrow (who directed ""Jurassic World"") and Derek Connolly (who was a co-writer of it), try to atone for the sexism that was one of the most remarked-upon features of the last installment. The one plot point was the same from the 4th. Humans make genetic dinosaur, dinosaur turns out to be evil, humans have to stop dinosaur. The only difference is that it's smaller than the last one. It can apparently take orders better than humans, but that makes no sense considering that it goes on a murderous rampage as soon as it escapes it's cage.
It seems unlikely that the next film in the series will continue to play with those same tropes, but if the filmmakers are smart, they'll recognize that the best way to think about the future of humanity isn't as a sci-fi thriller. If we really are going to get the message about playing God for profit, then the ""Jurassic"" series needs to keep embracing the horror at its core.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Put any of those things on a modern day battlefield with today's artillery, and it will die instantly. Also how did SO many trained soldiers and enforcers get brutally maimed by dinosaurs but the little girl and the other four main characters who mostly have zero training in fighting not take a scratch.

This was prevalent throughout the film. The progression of the series was okay but the use of the tired old plot of deception for profit really got old. The end plot twist was rather annoying and quiet frankly, goes against the grain of every ecologist and biologist I have every met ( I am a scientist myself so I do know several ecologists/biologists).If you liked the other Jurassic Park films, you will probably like this one but if you are are scientist or truly understand the laws of nature and how they affect us in the cold brutal realities, this film is likely to annoy you at times.

Luckily, they have Chris Pratt to look after their welfare and this is where the whole credibility-thing falls down. 
I think it's well known that Pratt takes joy in taking down pretty much any creature that comes within range of his high velocity rifle and yet, here he is almost showing emotion and empathy for lesser creatures. Almost.
Viewer interest is further tested by a lack of humour, uninspiring dialogue and ridiculous subplot. 
Toby Jones (much respect) did what he could but I think most participants wouldn't put this outing at the top of their CV. 
I would suggest that this franchise is now tired and well, well past its best.

Her perfunctory role could have been played by any other actress. Everyone else is just a stock character. They're so one-dimensional, they would disappear if you looked sideways at them.The first half is by the numbers, but somewhat enjoyable. The second half, once off the island, turns into a B-movie horror with a super FX budget. One by one, the stock villains get dispatched, in really not that creative ways.

505,darryl-42069,"Fun, thrilling, and actually scary! J. A. Bayona nailed it!",8,16 June 2018,"Warning! MILD SPOILERS AHEAD!After 2015's surprisingly good Jurassic World, I was pretty excited for Fallen Kingdom. With J. A. Bayona in the director's seat and Jeff Goldblum returning as Dr. Ian Malcolm, it seems to be a sure hit, and for the most part, it does. Though the film was bogged down with stereotypical villains, uninteresting side characters, and rehashed plotline, it's still a good movie nonethelessPros:
CharactersEveryone is amazing in this movie (well, except one). Star Lor- I mean Chris Pratt is great as Owen Grady. Bryce Dallas Howard is also great as Claire Dearing. I also really liked Daniella Pineda as Zia Rodriguez. My favorite of the bunch is Isabella Sermon as Maisie. She really shines in this movie. Her screams are a bit annoying of course, but she's a great character that I hope will be explored in the future. B. D. Wong returns for brief performance as the ""still mysterious"" Henry Wu, and he did a good job. Rafe Spall and Tobey Jones were great as Eli and Gunnar, but I'll talk about them later. James Cromwell is amazing as Benjamin Lockwood, and lastly, Jeff Goldblum has a brief but great performance as Ian Malcolm.CinematographyThis is, hands down, one of the most well shot movie I've seen all year. Seriously, kudos to whoever shot this movie. The cinematography here is spectacular. I notice that there's no shakey cams in this movie (at least what I saw), which is a breath of fresh air. CGIThere are a brief moments of bad CGI, but for the most part, it looks incredible. The fact that they use a mix of animatronics and CGI instead of full CGI for the dinosaurs, deserves a praise.DinosaursI love the dinosaurs in this movie. Blue the Raptor is back, and I love how he's essentially, a main character, and I love it. Rexy the T-rex is also back, and although he's taking the backseat in this movie, I can't help but smile whenever he's on screen. The Indoraptor is, however, the true star of the show. He's menacing, he's dangerous and for the most part, he's freaking scary! Oh, did I mention that some of these dinosaurs were unexpectedly cute and adorable?PacingJ. A. Bayona surely knows how to make a good movie. The movie, though opens with slow, and uninteresting first act, quickly changes once it enters the second act and from there it just keeps going. From simply dumb fun, to actually intense and scary movie, to some really sad moments. I just love the change of pace in this movie and I love in particular, how they embrace the horror aspects in the movie and amplified it to 11. I jumped out of my seat several times because how surprising it is. Overall, it's fun, it's scary, it's funny, it's intense, and it's sad, all in one movie.MusicMichael Giacchino, you've done it again! The music is intense, eargasmic and just epic. The music during the third act is just amazing, and surely does help in making intense scenes even more intense.
Cons:
The villainsThe villain, Rafe Spall as Eli Mills, like many Hollywood movies before, stereotypical money-hungry baddie. You'll saw him being the bad guy from a mile away, and although he did his best, that doesn't mean he's a compelling villain. Toby Jones as Gunnar Eversol is also not a good villain, in fact I think Toby Jones is wasted in this movie. Ted Levine as Ken Wheatley, though a bit more interesting, doesn't mean he's a good villain. Like Tobey, he could have done so much more. The Indoraptor is also admittedly, not as menacing as it's predecessor, Indominus Rex.One annoying characterJustice Smith as Franklin Webb is, by far, the worst character in this movie. Totally uninteresting, useless in most part, and honestly, very annoying. He's screams like a girl, which though it's a natural response when you're face to face with a dinosaur trying to kill you, but c'mon, can't you just stop screaming and complain? Granted he did something useful in the end of the movie, but honestly, it's too late to redeem his character.Unresolved plot pointsThere are some plot points that were left unresolved, and that's disappointing. *MILD SPOILER* There's this one character who just disappears without a trace although the movie clearly seems to indicate that this character would return for someone else, but no, they just leave it unresolved. *END OF SPOILER*Conclusion:
Overall, this movie is a must watch for fans and average moviegoers. It's fun, it's exciting, it's intense, and overall, a great movie. Though, after you read my review, you'll probably thinking: that's this is essentially The Lost World all over again. I'll admit: It's a rehash of The Lost World, but I recommend you to go watch this movie with a open mind, grab some popcorn, and enjoy the ride. Oh, and try not to watch the trailers, because that kinda gives away most of the plot (lucky me, I guess?)",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

There were more 'fighting' action sequences with Chris Pratt than actual dinosaur mayhem. The entire plotline was a absolute joke. All the characters were ridiculously one dimensional; with several of them serving no purpose whatsoever.The subplotline with the little girl was atrocious and had absolutely no place in a Jurassic Park film.The scenes with ""Malcolm"" were 100% pointless and only served to add his name to the credits. There was literally not one thing enjoyable about this movie; which is incredibly sad.

This one was far superior, to the point where I consider it the 2nd-best Jurassic Park movie (after the first one, of course). The action kept me on the edge of my seat and never let up. It also packed an emotional punch similar to the original Jurassic Park, where you feel for the dinosaurs and genuinely want them to survive. It also posed an interesting ethical dilemma so that the question of whether or not the dinosaurs should be allowed to exist was never given a clear right-or-wrong answer.

This film is included in a great saga with two trilogies: the original, created by Spielberg and this new trilogy in which is the fallen Kingdom that is in the middle.
The movie has two very well marked parts. The first is very bombastic (blockbuster) that gives way to a second part much more gothic and even terror.
Let's go clear, Bayonne directs the film very well, which is what saves her from a rather poor script (made by Colin Trevorrow).",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

You know you have a movie on your hands which can only be seen if you can fast forward to the CGI scenes and skip the dialogues entirely.The direction is atrocious. There are flaws galore. For example in one scene, in the time it takes one character standing next to a door to swing around startled, another character seated in a chair across the room, some twenty feet away, managed to reach the door and is already dutifully screaming. Apparently, that person has the gift of teleportation.Neither me, nor my friends were every as arrogant, obnoxious or plain stupid as the director would have us believe most of the characters in this movie are.

Can't think of any others off-hand? ;-)But this was actually fun and moved along quite nicely if you blinker yourself form the history of the previous titles. Action sequences lead into each other with enough pace and nicely interlaced humour that I managed to empty the popcorn bucket without noticing. I does amaze me that no matter what predicament a carnivorous species is in ALL the Jurassic Worlds, their immediate concern is to eat a human. Being hunted, exploding island, falling through trees. Any situation in fact, even when there is a few tonnes of defenseless herbivore nearby. They certainly have a grudge against homo sapiens! I'll take this film at face value and just say it was very enjoyable and refrain from getting hocked on how it came about from the previous title.HOWEVER - and not a spoiler.

Anyway the characters don´t have any personalitys at all and especially the women seem so helpless and made stupid and dependent on the help of a man.
Very annoying!
There was also one scene, let me tell you about: They where running away from the lava, right. Everyone escaping the lost island, they just made it and jumped onto a transporter and hid in it, right? The women and the guy sat, heavy breathing in the front seats, catching breath and overthinking their next steps.
So of course she needs her thinking cap and puts on a John Deer baseball cap. The close up was so huge, I now have lawn mower in my backyard and I don't even have a lawn!

523,JasonXIX,Jurassic World: Fallen Franchise,4,27 September 2018,"The weakest of the series so far. Cliched story with comical villains who's money making scheme to exploit dinosaurs makes absolutely no sense. If you ignore all the pointless dialog and exposition and just watch the dinosaurs chasing and eating people for 2 hours, then you might enjoy yourself just a little. It's a shame because the first movie was so creative and original, it's hard to watch the series as it continues to devolve into mediocre monster movies.The real villains here are the cynical movie studio execs that continue to exploit this franchise until every last dollar can be drained. But unlike the villains in the movie, the executives money making scheme to exploit dinosaurs actually makes sense, as these movies continue to make 100's of millions of dollars around the world.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

In comparison, they say it is terrible for this reason and that reason. The problem here is that you people watched Jurassic Park as a child, before you became cynical, and it left an impression on you. Now you watch this movie, as a cynical adult, and say its not as good. The first Jurassic Park was fine -- nothing spectacular, and this fits right in. Your memories of the original are biased by emotion and nostalgia. If you want oscar winning performances or scripts, this is not the movie for you, nor are any of the Jurassic films.

526,Songwriter_90210,"Lots Of Teeth, But No Bite",5,5 September 2018,"The fifth of the Jurassic films, Fallen Kingdom is appropriately titled if the kingdom we're talking about is the franchise itself.There's just no teeth in this one.We've come to expect groundbreaking CGI effects in all big budget summer blockbusters, and in this area, Fallen Kingdom does not disappoint. But there has to be something after that that keeps one interested in the story. This story is bland and unfortunately, quite boring. Not only is the story boring, but it also has a feeling to it like it was written as they filmed. It really has a lot of unusual pacing problems as well as one reveal that seemed unnecessary. They tried a ""story-within-a-story"" format, but it was just unnecessary and confusing. There are the usual suspects with their wide-eyed, mouth-agape expressions to let us know they are as amazed by the tennis balls and green screens they are seeing as we are with the fake dinos we are seeing. Overacting abounds, as usual, and Chris Pratt's attempt to breath life into his character seems to be a chore for him. Beyond that, an incredibly predictable story line and ancillary characters who are too singularly-dimensional to even mention, create the perfect blend of crappiness that makes you wish someone would hurry up and get eaten. Look, I'm not going to say it's not watchable, but don't blame me if you come away from this film feeling empty and ripped off. Factually, you may like it. After all, it's just supposed to be a thrill ride (it's really not though). But if you thought the first Jurassic World was very good, you probably will not feel very good about this movie. Unless all you wanted to do was look at some more CGI dinosaurs and Bryce Dallas Howard's pretty face. Which, frankly, is almost worth the price of admission.

I am a huge fan of the JP series, so I am biased, but this was another fun romp, and though there were some comedic moments, it doesn't have the cheesiness of the first Jurassic World. It has a more serious tone, and the characters and dialogue are better-written. I wasn't crazy about Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas-Howard) but they return, and they're more enjoyable.The dino action is great as always, with creatures old and new. I felt a lot of emotion for the dinosaurs, as they are again facing extinction. The Indoraptor is a great, scary follow-up to Indominus rex. Don't want to say much more.

529,JasonR77,Fun but Predictable,7,26 June 2018,"Jurassic Park was my single favorite movie for a very long time. The series has never quite reached the heights of its progenitor, though the previous entry did a good job of capturing a number of ideas from Crichton's original book that did not feature in the original trilogy, while carefully steering the series into a new direction.Fallen Kingdom, however, fails to capitalize or reach the lofty levels that its predecessor did. At the heart of it is the introduction of John Hammond's heretofore unknown former friend and partner, played by James Cromwell. Injecting such a character with such a deep history and link with Hammond throws a wrinkle into what we have had up to this point, and makes itself somewhat problematic.The set pieces, animatronics and action are some excellent parts of the movie (even if in some occasions they border on the absurd), but some development, particularly of Owen, is sacrificed. The two newer ""good-guy"" characters aren't much more than one-note, and Owen gets little actual development beyond being a bit more badass than last time.There is a brilliant twist in the latter stages that escalates the stakes and acts as a sort of game changer for the world built out of the original movie. It could cause reverberations in further installments, depending on decisions future creative teams could make.In many ways, this movie feels like the adaptation of the Lost World, in that it was a cash grab that didn't do much to expand on the original, and featured Jeff Goldblum. It is fun, there are certain points that are good, but they fail to string these ideas together well enough, and the notion that the previous film presented of the Franken-saurus now feels overused. But for fans of the series, and fans of dinosaurs eating people, you should have a good time.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

The moment Claire lands on Isla Nublar and encounters mercenaries that should have tipped her off that ghere was a real problem. Nevertheless, she blithely goes along and so does the hero. And are we to believe that the mercenaries show up on a dino hunt armed with standard issue military issue rifles (5.56 mm and or 7.62x51 mm) and sleeper dart rifles? Granted, they didn't intend killing the animals but those guns aren't powerful enough for modern big game animals let alone animals with hides thicker then rhinos, hippos, or elephants. Mercenaries would know this. I don't understand why the film makers ignore such minor details. The fact that they get so many of them worng is annoying,",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
531,bjoernidler,Rise of the planet of the... dinosaurs?,7,15 October 2018,"I truly enjoyed this. It's bold, quite different than the previous jurassic movies but still respectful of the beginning of the franchise. It even reinterprets some classic scenes like the kitchen scene from the first one, the scenes with the hunters and the dangerously fragile glass from the second one.
I even enjoyed the 'Resident Evil with dinosaurs at the mansion' part of it.One worry remains: The ending just feels like the reboot of Planet of the apes, only with dinosaurs. Please, please, please don't let that become true. As good as the ape-movies were, I honestly don't think we need another variation of those and I'm quite sure it wouldn't work.But give me dinosaurs in a confined space (park, island, mansion...)

Great opening scene, solid island rescue, then it tails off. Positives: CGI was great, Chris Pratt wasn't too ""Chris Pratt-ish"".Negatives: Too many.One of the biggest plot holes though is auctioning off dinosaurs for $10 million a pop. At minimum the starting bids should of been $50 million, ending at around $75 million plus.Also, admittingly getting a tad picky here, but when those 20-25 dinos escaped into the wilderness, once news broke out with our military and technology we'd have those dinosaurs pinned down within 10 days.

533,bobandlulureview,Jurassic World: Fallen Franchise?,2,25 June 2018,"The movie, unlike the first 3 installments, was trying to spook the audience. It's supposed to be an adventure movie not a horror movie! (Have you seen the trailer for The Nun?) It felt like the ghosts were replaced with dinosaurs. Well, the movie begins with the death of a human. Nothing as fancy as being lifted off the pot but a human dies on Isla Nublar. Then we have Dr. Malcom telling the U.S Senate that the once dormant volcanoes which have now become active on Isla Nublar is nature's way of correcting Dr. Hammonds' mistake 25 years ago. He espouses the cause of letting nature take its course instead of intervening again to save Dinosaurs. Except Claire Dearing thinks otherwise and on Eli's urging manages to convince Owen Grady to head back to the island. That is when the ""adventure"" begins.On one hand Owen, Claire, Zia and Ken head out and once on the island things don't go too well for the team. On the other hand Lockwood's granddaughter finds herself in the middle of a series of events that would petrify any 11 year old. The events on the island lead to evacuating a few species but is that all? Ah well... there is murder, mystery AND ACTION all of which apart from being predictable are also lacking in so many ways.Plot holes are aplenty and dear good lord god! The extension charm features in the movie! Because if you jump into water in skin tight pants and still manage to bring out a pistol, a knife and later a pair of binoculars those pants must come from the wizarding world.Here is what ruined the movie for me - This movie single handedly destroyed my childhood memories of the Brachiosaurus sighting in the first movie. I believe the movie was trying to pay homage to the previous movies but it just ended up making bad choices again and again.People in their 30's will certainly not enjoy the movie. Definitely suitable for kids below the age of 10 because all they need is CGI to be impressed.Recommend: Go only if you have a child that is interested in dinosaurs, else skip it.

The whole introduction of cloning people should never have been brought up. That introduces WAY too many variables to the series that it really just cannot handle. The list goes on, but the biggest sin of this movie is that our main characters decide it's ok for a little girl, immature and with no worldly knowledge of consequences, unleash new predators into the world that will simply mame, kill and eat any people in which they come into contact. Why? Sloppy writing. The main characters have now been reduced to killers. This film is an absolute mess and the screen writer or whoever signed off on the script should really be embarrassed. And for those that gave this film a ""10"" star rating, you must not have any moral compass whatsoever. As Ian Malcomb stated... the dinosaurs ""had their chance"".

There are several unnecessary characters and I think some necessary characters missing. Pratt plays the same Starlord character. His love interest isn't really a love interest. The capitalists are portrayed as bad guys but they are the ones ultimately saving the dinosaurs. The scientist is the person who should be selling his services to the highest bidder.This movie is just a quest for cash by the studio. There was some talk of using dinosaur tech to build a dino/human soldier. If they would have done that this would have been a knockout with at least two more sequels in it.

The characters are bog standard and the plot is thin but it's undeniably entertaining to watch the movie go from action scene to action scene!Most of the credit for this probably goes towards the director, who can handle both large scale destruction scenes and tense claustrophobic chases (no matter how familiar they may be). Claire and Owen are nothing special but the actors make them watchable enough to where you still enjoy watching them run from dinosaurs, even if I disagree with pretty much every decision they make.The film was created specifically to set up a ""dinosaurs on the run"" third movie, and this is very obvious by the lack of new ideas or effort in the story for this instalment, with twists that go nowhere, random character changes, and unlikeable character decisions.

Again,7,5 June 2018,"It's been 25 years since first ""Jurassic Park"" has hit the screens, and it's great to see another part of the Isla Nublar saga - surely, this film aims to please every fan of both the original trilogy and previous installment. In doing so, director J.A. Bayona and screenwriters Derek Connolly and Colin Treworrow covers wide range of contemporary social issues, and this is the most curious aspect of the film. It's safe to speak now that ""Fallen Kingdom"" clearly attempts to be thought-provoking story, even it's still a big, bright popcorn blockbuster with dinosaurs.Be sure, dinosaurs are here: they're big, they're fast, they're deadly! You'll see a lot of action-packed sequences, and witness the fall of the prehistoric kingdom under volcanic ashes. But this film is probably the first in the series which clearly centers much more on humans interacting with other humans, and relatively rare using traditional ""humans vs dinos"" theme. It's not a perfect choice to make, because due to lots of human affairs something feels missing in the story, and dinosaurs play lesser part in this than in any of previous movies. What is also surprising is the social commentary. If ""Jurassic World"" was the film about greed for fun, ""Fallen Kingdom"" is the film about corporate greed. Its lust for money that drives bad guys here, and this point has a great illustration during the story. The film also has several references to environmental issues, such as preventing the extinction, and questions probability of a coexistence between man and dinosaurs. The main question, however, is about should people ever save what already extinct and was re-created? The answer Is given, but not in straightforward way, this is a pleasant surprise in such kind of films.I wouldn't say this film is the most interesting part of the franchise in terms of entertainment, and it certainly has a lot of minor flaws, but it's still an enjoyable ride into the world of Jurassic Park.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
544,treborquest,Jurassic Park 3 was better... and that says a lot,5,6 June 2018,"SPOILER: Who likes a movie full of action and does not really care about the story has a blast watching Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. But for me, as a lover of the Jurassic movies, I felt somewhat disappointed leaving the movie theatre. Yes. There are a lot of dino's. Yes, we all want them to be saved from the volcano that is going to whipe away Isla Nublar, but who came up with the idea to do this story and then throw out all the logic. I had so many questions. Why didn't Owen have any injuries after touching the lava? Does any animal 'hunt or attack' another living creature for food when its life is in danger? Why don't dino's jump in the water when there's lava surrounding them? Why didn't they sedate Blue? Why is a small wooden door strong enough for an animal that burst through nearly anything? Why does a huge animal take the time to silently open a window to creep up on someone? Why hide in a bed and create a Nightmare on Elmstreet moment? And why does Owen crawl in the bed with the girl? Why doesn't anyone seem to be intelligent? So many questions, I won't ask them all here, because I don't want to put spoilers out there, but I believe there were about 20 or more scenes where I thought 'Seriously?' and after the first, very chaotic half of the movie I knew it wasn't going to be any better. No, it became worse. They didn't learn from creating Indominus Rex, because now we have the Indoraptor. The dino's should have passed out from gasses at some point, but they didn't. At some point there are a few scenes where I thought this was actually a remake of the movie Relic. And they give away the ending like 10 minutes before it actually happens. You just know what will happen. 
Besides this all, some of the actors with smaller parts are really stiff and acted as if this was a stageplay. I am giving 5 stars. Why? I did enjoy the movie for all the action and dino's in it and after the biggest part of the first half I was able to watch it, disconnecting it from the Jurassic-series. Even though there are quite a few 'nods and winks' to the first trilogy. The main characters are enjoyable to watch, the younger actors belonged more in an X-men spin-off though. Can you expect something close to the previous Jurassic movies? No, this is something totally different and the ending leaves a lot of room for a next movie, so there will be more to see for sure.

But no more. I'm just tired of all the Hollywood sermons.SPOILER WARNING: The first thing that ticked me off was the final scene on the island where the animals lived and from where some were stolen. We see a pathetic scene of a brontasaurus standing on the beach wailing pitifully towards the boat, as it is surrounded by lava sparks and sulphuric smoke, being slowly baked alive by lava falling from the cliff. My teens cried so hard that we had to stop the movie. My youngest couldn't be coaxed to watch the rest of the movie and I didn't try. It was one of the most pitiful, sad, and disgusting scenes we have ever seen. Even though I finished the movie, that one scene was so horrific that the entire movie was ruined for me. The rest of the movie showed one abuse after another of these animals, addressing a current debate about genetic power. The fact that mankind is even pursuing this idea is itself depressing. But the end of the film is one of the worst endings I have ever seen. The remaining animals are set free by a little girl who is genetically produced. She explains it saying, ""They are alive. Like me."" OH, PLEASE!!! Even my 18 year old was outraged, shaking her head in disgust as she mumbled what I was thinking: ""Yes, as long as they aren't unborn children."" The Hollywood crowd will spend a fortune preaching their garbage that it's okay to kill a baby, but prehistoric animals brought genetically revived MUST LIVE! ALL ANIMALS MUST LIVE. But not babies.""I am fed up with their tripe. Never mind the fact that the closing scenes are of these animals finding their way into civilization and threatening already endangered animals in zoos and everywhere else. The ""good guys"" watch on as a pair of pterodactyls fly off towards the sunset, leaving us to wonder what small pets or children will be their next meal.The only redeeming quality of the movie is the speech given by the scientist that has been involved with the prehistoric animals all along from movie 1, portrayed by Jeff Goldblum: Mankind is DESTROYING earth with their newfound technologies. That in the end, no one will gain anything and will lose everything. I can agree with Michael Crichton's original moral of the tale. We certainly - or rather, those with the money to throw at these technologies and programs are messing things up in this world. Living proof that the rich don't have a wealth of understanding about consequences. Like Hollywood (some of those donors), have no moral compass; only greed is their motivation.

548,q-85184,Some discussions on dinosaurs,7,20 May 2020,"I think the final release of dinosaurs is a very suitable setting.
Reason 1: first of all, press the button is not the hero and heroine who have deep feelings with dinosaurs, but the little girl. Who is the little girl? Knowing her father's inhumane business, she was mercilessly treated by her father, witnessed the death of her only grandfather who loved her, and finally realized that she was cloned. Isn't that what happened to dinosaurs? At the beginning, it was recreated to meet people's needs. It was also ignored and treated mercilessly on the island. The little girl is brave in nature. She loved the story of dinosaurs since she was a child. After suffering from multiple blows, she thought that the suffering of dinosaurs had much in common with her own. If you are a little girl, you can bear to see the ""same kind of people"" struggling with death by inhaling poison gas? Even though the protagonists and heroines wanted to protect the dinosaurs, they held back. And the little girl can't bear it, because unlike other people, she and dinosaurs are the product of people's recovery for their selfish needs and against the laws of nature. If the reason for the recovery of dinosaurs is that the little girl released dinosaurs is a fruit. The iniquities of man's own making will be borne by himself.
Reason 2: I want to make it clear to the audience that it is the Jurassic world, not the Jurassic Park. Now the Jurassic world has taken the second film, the key word of the world must be cited. The setting of releasing dinosaurs is just right to take the audience to the Jurassic world, rather than take them back to the Jurassic Park for sightseeing. People will be tired of this series after watching many ""Parks"", and the setting of releasing dinosaurs will give new vitality to the Jurassic series, and the story of dinosaurs in the whole world will be more shocking and attractive.

Lot's of worn out plot points in this one. Lots....Dinosaurs were excellent. Probably the best they've ever been! There was a good scene where they were trying to run away from volcanic ash, and falling off a cliff into water below. You saw them struggling to not drown. Cool scene, even though the human stupidity intertwined with it was ridiculous. Since when can humans run through volcanic ash and still have enough lung power to hold their breath underwater ? Spoiler - never. Anyway, CGI is very good!I cried in the scene where the Brontosaurus died on the dock :(
NO I DIDN'T I LAUGHED BAHAHAHAHAHHA!! Because it was ridiculous! Why didn't it just jump into the lagoon, like you would have expected it to do?? Every book we saw as kids showed Sauropods semi-submerged underwater, but this one couldn't hop a few feet into the lagoon to get away from molten lava and ash. They tried to make an emotional scene but who cares! I didn't know that dinosaur. I didn't see it be born and grow up. And who's going to relate to that in the real world? It's not a dog or a horse! And I don't care that it's not called a brontosaurus anymore. If it's good enough for Fred Flintstone it's good enough for me!Anyway, now they've decided they're going to use Dinosaurs in combat, like they did with horses and elephants. WHAT COULD GO WRONG?! So they catch and sell the ones they got from the island, for next to nothing. I had a real Dr Evil moment when the Ankylosaur only sold for $10mil. The entire auction scene was ridiculous beyond words.So the kids a clone, and they need the auction proceeds to finance their next endeavour, which would be to splice bits of animals together, with maybe a bit of human chucked in.....

554,MekkaMax,6.5 Entertaining Sequel,6,24 June 2018,I overall liked the first Jurassic World. It was a fun movie with cool moments. This time around it's not as good but it's still entertaining. The first and third acts were filled with popcorn worthy moments and jump scares. The second act is where this movie fails for me. It slows the entire movie down because it is basically filled with conversations about selling the dinosaurs and our heroes don't have much to do. The action scenes could have used more blood and suspense but what we got was fine. The characters are also underdeveloped because none of them really change from the beginning of the movie to the end.,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
555,Kevnerd77,Dinos man,8,19 January 2020,I walked into this movie with high hopes and I left with mid reactions this movie was good I loved but something about it just didn't sit right idk what it is anyways this movie is one of the best in the franchise next to the original really at first I liked it a little but after watching a review on YouTube I loved it ok now here's the review I loved the beginning good start to the movie when they on the island it was so tense cause it was blowing up brice Dallas Howard ( who btw just found out that Ron Howard is her dad wow) was great Chris Pratt as always kicks ass even the two new characters were cool my favorite was dr Ian Malcom who is my favorite from the first he was good wish he did more though the rest were ok the guy who worked with Jon Hammond was nice the bad guy was ok and the auctioneer was ok the Dino's were amazing I loved the T. rex of course cause she's my favorite Dino blue was cool and the rest were stand in Dino's oh and the girl she was strange but cute at the same time the new hybrid Dino was scary really she was anyways to wrap it up Jurassic world 2 gets a 9-10 good characters amazing locations and wonderful Dino's,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
556,rolando19552001,Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom,9,22 June 2018,"Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom The sequel follows the story of the first film, after the opening of the park and the denouement of that film. Claire now is working and lobbying for a dinosaur animal rights institution that perhaps has few members but they lacked in quantity, they earn in quality. Claire is followed by a young and apprehensive young man that is a computer system genius and prodigy and a doctor that has a plethora of knowledge about dinosaurs and animals, she had vast knowledge. The main problem of the first half of the film is that in the island where the Jurassic Park was, now a dormant volcano is active and the island would become quickly an inferno. A friend of the past, in Lockwood from earlier films who helped made the Jurassic Park in the first film has a good heart and wants to save what his friend and him helped built with the Amber DNA discovery, idea from Michal Crichton masterpiece Jurassic Park. In the first film the dinosaurs began roaming again and now with the end of their island, many would go down with the volcano´s lava and ashes and the inferno and fire that it would bring. Lockwood, now a senile and by his great advanced age also suffers by the ravaging and deterioration of health by age and time, Lockwood now needs help managing his businesses and this complex task falls into a very insidious and greedy and amoral middle aged and relatively young man that had met Claire before and now asks for her help. Claire needs to get Blue, the most intelligent organism in the fauna in earth, only after the homo sapiens, Blue, the velociraptor is extremely audacious, high learning raptor who also thanks to the other protagonist and true hero of the story, Owen again played by the great charisma and effort of Chris Pratt who always delivers an energized and zealous performance and always bring all his effort to his roles, always good to see him act charismatically and always with a laugh and making others laugh. When Claire asks her beau, Owen, they have taken a break to join her and save the dinosaurs, he is hesitant, but he sees Blue again in some videos that make him believe that she is a great creature and she is more than just a pet, Blue is family. Blue reminds me of extremely intelligent birds, like parrots. Then Owen and Claire get to the island when they find out they have been out played and be used, they managed to escape to safety from the island volcanic inferno. There is a powerful scene where Blue which had been shot and is losing blood, is helped by her father like caretaker, Owen who would risk anything, even getting to close to a T-Rex to save Blue who always have shown great empathy and intelligence, like many smart and genius like birds of today´s world. This is good in the film Fallen Kingdom that actually shows that there are many nuances of dinosaurs and probably the smarter dinosaurs like the raptors are more similar to the smart birds as birds are the only direct descendants of dinosaurs today. 
The saving mission of dinosaurs is not a benefactor or magnanimous effort, the insidious man that bullies over the elder and wise Lockwood´s enterprises and wealth is out of any control and he oversteps his powers and become a power and wealth megalomaniac seeker. Then the appearance of the industrial military complex now with dinosaurs ensued and the dinosaurs are sold in auction by a mafia like reunion of wealthy individuals from all over the world. But then a new creature formed by the DNA from the raptors and the first enemy of the first film, Indominus rex who DNA samples had been recollected from the carcass of the bones in the lost island before the volcanic inferno. Now this new creature is styled the Indoraptor has the great intelligence of the raptors and the savagery and brutality of the indominus rex which destroyed the Jurassic Park in the Jurassic World first film, three years before. The denouement transpires in northern California in Lockwood´s estate, where after all is said and done in Fallen Kingdom, there is an overlap between dinosaurs and humans, now like Professor Malcom would say, now truly comes the new age of the Jurassic World.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

561,Watcher42,Dino fan fiction,4,6 August 2018,"This movie plays out like some ridiculous Jurassic Park fan fiction. It removes the few interesting angles from Jurassic World, mixes in the worst parts of The Lost World and delivers a film devoid of personality and story. It is insultingly stupid - even by modern popcorn movie standards.And to top it all off, despite the numerous action sequences and winks towards its predecessors it's a boring blockbuster.The writers, Trevorrow and Connolly really need to find alternate careers. Weaponising dinosaurs to auction off to the highest bidder is such a joke of a plot. Building a secret containment unit in the basement of Cromwell's mansion without him noticing is beyond stretching credibility. Throwing in a clone daughter / grand-daughter sub-plot that goes nowhere was pointless and a waste of time.Both Pratt and Howard deserve better than this - they were not the most fleshed out or interesting characters in JW, but in this they become little more than talking scenery (along with every other character).Rafe Spall plays a generic 'evil suit'. They should have given him a moustache to twirl while he does an evil laugh!Ted Levine is just a poor facsimilie of Pete Postlethwaite's character from Jurassic 2.Jeff Golblum was clearly chucked in to help market the film as his screen time is about 5 minutes. And yet somehow he gets the best lines in the whole film!Lets not forget the generic and lazily written spunky science girl and the scaredy cat nerd guy, whatever their names might beAnd of course the star of the show.. Blue. Yes, the sympathetic, brave, caring and heroic velociraptor who saves the day.Unfortunately the 'writers' are already down to pen Jurassic World 3, and Star Wars Ep IX.

The writing was well done - loved the characters and the storyline. But what the heck happened with this one? The story was all over the place and quite predictable once it got rolling. The dinosaurs acting was better than the cast. The opening was pretty intense with the volcano but after that it was all downhill. The story was just flat. A few issues that I have: It was pretty much a ripoff of the original JP sequel. Plucking up dinosaurs to take back to the city. Who would have thought something could go wrong (yawn). Plus, when did Owen become a professional fighter? I know that his character has military training, but it was overkill. He was taking out people like he was James Bond. I'm just frustrated - this movie had so much potential and the writers really blew it. I'm thinking this franchise is dead. I won't waste my money on seeing the next in theater.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
571,freqeteq,Austin Powers 4: Fallen Kingdom,5,24 June 2018,"I've got to say, the opening scene of the film I quite enjoyed, characters being dumb and getting eaten in a pretty cool set piece, it was a bit of fun, but overall Jurassic World is very disappointing thanks to a plot that is totally ridiculous. It takes itself way too seriously when the plot is like something Dr Evil from Austin Powers would dream up, ""Let's collect and sell the dinosaurs to the bad guys of the world so they can use them in their armies!"" What? That is the plot for your film, are you being serious with me? One of the dinosaurs being auctioned the auctioneer goes ""and this one paleontologists called natures tank because of it's armor"", and the villains in the room ooh and aah as they start bidding their millions of dollars, and all I thought was, have these guys never heard of human made tanks that have guns that kill things like natures tanks? The main bad dinosaurs gimmick is that you point a laser at something or someone and the dino will kill it, that's right, it's essentially just a land shark with a laser on its head, Dr Evil would be pleased. And I'd also like to say, if dinosaurs are worth so much to these people to use as weapons, why don't they use lions or elephants? They're readily available, and judging by what I've seen in circuses can be trained to do things even without being genetically engineered. Surely a trained lion is just as deadly to a human as a trained dino is? Not to mention that owning a dinosaur would bring a bit more attention down on you than owning a lion would, oh well, to hell with logic, this is Jurassic World after all. I know I spent a lot of words just going on about one thing, but it's the entire plot of the film and it's just so terribly bad and seemingly not thought out at all.Apart from the visual effects there's really nothing to praise about this film, it looks good, it's directed well, the 2 lead characters are as good as they were in the first film, that's about it for the positives. On the negative you have supporting characters that are either completely forgettable or overly annoying, and when I say annoying I mean think of the most irritating comic relief character from a Michael Bay film then times their annoying factor by 10, that's how annoying this one character is, he makes Jar Jar Binks seem not that bad. The main bad guys motivation, well his entire character really, is that he's rich and wants to be richer, that's it.The annoying thing is that the film started off quite well posing the question, what ethically should we do with dinosaurs if a natural event is going to wipe them out? In the original Jurassic Park the characters discussed the ethics of bringing these creatures back to life while in this film they were asking should we save these creatures we created from a second extinction? The moral dilemma was worth exploring and quite intriguing, unfortunately the conversation about it lasts for about 2 minutes before it's off to the island to fight dinosaurs and volcanoes and action action boom boom explosion. It was an opportunity missed. I understand that it's a summer blockbuster about dinosaurs, but just a little bit of depth to the movie would have been nice for the people in the audience over the age of 9.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

573,kevinthecritic,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom: Dino Sequel Darker, Scarier, and More Thrilling",7,1 July 2018,"3.5 out of 5 (above average)I am baffled by the critical reception to Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Sitting at an unbelievable 50% critics rating on Rottentomatoes.com, reviewers are claiming this entry is stale, unimaginative, and lacking the magic of its predecessors. I completely disagree with those criticisms and believe the film actually improves on its predecessor by being darker, scarier, and providing all the expected dino-action without sacrificing the heart and character of this franchise. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom should leave moviegoers totally satisfied with action, thrills, and a scarily plausible plot in today's world.
The film picks up 3 years after the events of Jurassic World. Now that the raptor's out of the bag, the world is debating over the creature's rights, with an active volcano threatening to sink Isla Nublar. Scientist Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard, sans high heels) and dino trainer Owen (the eternally awesome Chris Pratt) are called into action by elderly Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell), who promises to relocate the creatures to a sanctuary safe from pesky humans. Little do they know this expedition will lead to a conspiracy that will change human life forever.Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom absolutely delivers as a summer blockbuster. The story feels realistic, the characters have developed a bit, and the action is some of the best you'll see this summer. The effects are still astonishing and mix flawlessly with the dedicated human actors, who continue to sell the outlandishness. Newcomer Isabella Sermon is also great as Lockwood's young daughter. She's cute, likable, and believably terrified when called upon, all the more impressive when you realize it's her first acting role. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard continue to have wonderful chemistry, and the climax is nothing short of awe-inspiring.The film has a few problems that hold it back from being one of the greats. Rafe Spall's human villain simply lacks a threatening screen presence and is one of the weakest baddies this year. The writing for his character isn't amazing, but I was more taken in by Wayne Knight with his goofy shaving cream can in the original than by this guy. Knight was enticing in his greed, but this guy is so milquetoast that he comes off more like one of those 90's villains who wants to close the rec center than a manipulative businessman. Worse still, Toby Jones appears as a secondary bad guy, and is much more engaging. I either would have made Jones the main villain or recast Spall with David Cross (Tobias from Arrested Development). There's also some mediocre aging make-up and weak explanation for Sermon's accent, but they don't sink the ship.These problems are minor in the grand scheme of things. We come to these movies for the dinosaurs and characters, and we get great results with both. While it might not be as good as the original film, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a surprisingly solid sequel with great action, good characters, and the possibility for future adventures. Also look out for Jeff Goldblum in the beginning and end returning as Dr. Ian Malcolm, and BD Wong as Dr. Wu. This is one attraction you need to see up close.Rated PG-13 for Intense Sequences of Science Fiction Violence and Peril",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
574,suganthram,Okay!!!,6,10 August 2018,"They say Jurassic world is a sequel to the Jurassic Park movies but it is actually a reboot of the 1st movie with more dinosaurs,more action but lacking the soul of the 1st movie.I hoped they wouldn't do that in the sequel after I saw the trailer but nope.the 1st 45 minutes of the movie was pretty good with the plot going like an adventure movie with volcanoes and stuff.It is then the movie derails a bit with rip off of the lost world- bringing dinosaurs from the island and using them for monetary gains.The movie picks up in the last 20 minutes after the indoraptor enters the scene.I also liked how they made it darker than its predecessor,also like the lost world,and also added a horror movie like feel to a few scenes.I would say it is the least engaging movie of the franchise but worth a watch overall",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
575,jhalcollege,More than just CGI,6,4 November 2018,"Surprised?While there isn't anything particularly great about Fallen Kingdom, it holds up pretty well in most aspects.One for sure plus is that there isn't as much talking as previous iterations- they screen writers let the action do the talking. This is nice, because some of the characters are rather annoying.
They've also created a new sense of sympathy within the movie that goes beyond just the surface. You want the characters to succeed, and you feel bad when things don't go as planned. There is an actual villain this time (and he makes sense too), instead of just the dinosaurs eating people.
And finally, the 128 minutes run time is on par. There's enough time allotted to get you involved, but it's not long enough to become a drag.It won't make as much money as Jurassic World, but it's a full tier better.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

579,hughrcarson,"Tyrannosaurus Rex? Tricera-plops, more like!",5,12 September 2018,"Way back in 1993, Steven Spielberg directed - in his own inimitable way - a film which quickly entrenched itself in our hearts.Taking advantage of great leaps in technology and making good use of his own brilliant sense of story and character, he tickled our collective fancy for all things scarily prehistoric by unleashing Jurassic Park upon the world.It was not only tremendous, but also groundbreaking, much in the way that Star Wars, for example, had been when it positively blew people's minds back in the late 1970's.Unsurprisingly, just like Star Wars, Jurassic Park has not only spawned sequels, but many years on, has experienced a complete re-boot of its franchise.The alarm bells were ringing during 2015's ultra-formulaic re-visit, Jurassic World, a film which I must confess to actually having quite enjoyed, and in fairness, despite its massively predictable plot and mountains of excessive corporate product placement, it's a film which more or less pulled off that hardest of tricks: pleasing both newbies and die-hard fans alike.And so to 2018 and J.A. Bayona's follow-up: Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the living embodiment of the idea that if you throw enough s**t at a screen, some of it may just stick.Indeed, vast numbers of rampaging dinosaurs are positively hurled in our direction, be they fleeing from an encroaching lava stream, escaping from an evil human captor, or relentlessly hunting down their human prey.In amidst these waves of Triassic trouble, a convoluted yet contrived narrative is woven, haphazardly, in which a well-meaning bid to rescue the remaining dinosaurs from the threat of an erupting volcano in the now abandoned Jurassic World, turns out to have been nothing more than a ruse, with the captured animals then shipped off to be sold by nasty evil types to rich people with more money than sense.Cue various attempts to thwart the wrong-doers, whilst simultaneously trying to avoid being eaten by assorted carnivores, whilst mulling over the morality of both cloning and the captivity of living things.It's loud, it's screechy, it's overbearing and seemingly never ending. Or at least that's how it feels.There are some not very subliminal messages about environmentalism churned out by the Hollywood democratic propaganda machine, and even the mandatory thinly-veiled dig at the 'stupidity' of the president and his denial of the existence of dinosaurs in the first place.Change the record hey guys?Perhaps most tellingly of all though is the fact that one brief poignant scene on the volcanic island-aside, I barely felt a moment's empathy for anyone or anything for the film's duration. Try as it might not to be, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a pretty soulless affair. And compare that once again if you will to Spielberg's seminal original.Chalk and cheese, and a damning indictment for sure.On a positive note, the CGi is predictably excellent, and there are admittedly thrills and spills in patches, but given the subject matter, how could there not be? The cast too is both stellar and in good form, but given what they have to work with, there's only so far the likes of Toby Jones, Jeff Goldblum, Rafe Spall et al can take Bayona's messy, painfully predictable effects-fest.From the Director of such excellent work as: The Orphanage, The Impossible and A Monster Calls, it's all a bit perplexing.

Now comes Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom the fifth installment in The Jurassic Park franchise. In my opinion the movie isn't bad or a let down. To back up my opinion I have to include some small spoilers, but don't worry, I won't give away everything. To start with, I think the name of the new carnivorous dinosaur (That's a Hybrid) which is named The Indoraptor, is a very clever and creative name. It's a combination of an Allosaurus and a Velociraptor. Since the Allosaurus wasn't presented in the other films, and the fact that it's a real dinosaur was a great choice to add in a new species of a carnivor dinosaur. It's not a terrible film and there is a major twist once they arrive on Isla Nubler, in which I won't give away. But the film is full of suspense and the new dinosaur is scary and menacing. The film is darker than the previous film and when you watch it, you'll know why. At this point I do think they need to find away to wrap up the Jurassic Park franchise storyline for good, before the movies start to go down hill. Overall it's not a terrible film.

This movie however, was just boring & annoying at once. I just couldn't get into the mediocre plot of selling dinosaurs to the highest bidder. The action was subpar and the CGI was a step down. Then we have the addition of the 2 worst sidekicks. The effeminate nerdy guy & the angry unbearable feminist. Hollywood puts these annoying stereotypes in nearly every movie & tv show and it got old real quick. They couldn't even give us the pleasure of killing off these 2 awful characters, we're stuck with them for another movie. Ugh.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Classic adventure movie.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
591,sorenmike,Great movie!,9,26 June 2018,"Why is this movie getting a lot of hate? It's a great movie. It was very well done. A different take on the world of Jurassic Park than before, and I'm sure the series will never be the same again. 
Owen Brady and Claire return to a sequel that is very different than other Jurassic Sequels. The villains are more sinister, the new Dino was freaky, but awesome, and it had a very interesting story, and it did make some small references to the first movie, which was cool. I highly recommend it",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
592,mysammoore,Better than Ant-Man and the Wasp,9,18 July 2018,"This movie was, just great. At no point did I feel like I was being forced to watch a movie, you know? Like some movies just make you what to leave the theatre because even though they try they're just not that interesting. This is not one of those movies. Amazing CGI. A new compelling chapter in the franchise that's different from just ""we're in a park and something goes wrong!"" It was a new twist and I liked it.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
593,Jiszmo,Ridiculous and stupid,1,8 March 2020,"It seemed like it was going to be good, at first. The visuals looked nice. The story seemed interesting. But.......when the guy was laying on a small body sized chunk of land, and lava was all around it, and he was till alive, I began to get angry. Then when the dinosaur tried to get him on that chunk of land, and stepped in the lava, and then shook it off, like it was water, I said screw this. Actually, it still makes me angry thinking about it >.<",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
594,putnamdavis,Aligns with original,6,22 July 2018,This film aligns nicely with the original Lost World. It's very sad in some parts and reiterates the moral compass of man controlling life.,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
595,jkcanewton,Great addition,8,23 June 2018,This was a great addition to the franchise. I hope they continue making them. My biggest complaint is that I thought Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm would be in it more. That was the only disappointing thing about it.,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
596,mmlund2,No fun after they left the island,2,10 September 2018,"Pros the first part of the movie, on the island, was grand in scale, fun, and action packed. And of course jam packed with dinosaurs, including the mosasaurus. And the human cloning was an interesting twist. Also, Dr. Wu makes a cool modern Dr Frankenstein! Cons the movie lost it's fun after it left the island. and forced you into the basement of a mansion. The politics inserted into the movie were a bore animal rights, anti-trump jabs, and the modern, cruel, unforgiving flavor of feminism. Examples include when the antagonist says, ""what a nasty woman,"" and when Jeff Goldblum lectures us on the megalomaniac in politics, all referring to Trump of course. One of the female protagonists was a rude individual, easily offended, like when a man says to her to be careful on the island, she snaps at him because she is a woman. She is going into a jungle full of large, man-eating dinosaurs and an erupting volcano, but hell, how dare he even suggest!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
597,nicko252008,Decent follow up,6,12 March 2021,"Although not as good as the first Jurassic World, it still entertaining. In the first movie they decide to recreate Jurassic Park all over again, what can go wrong? Dino DNA! Well this time they have left over dinos on an island that happens to have a giant volcano that's about to explode... I smell summer blockbuster.. commence the prehistoric CGI beasts! Oh and they mutate A t rex and a raptor.. what's s that A Ter-raptor? A little too much CGI in this one for me. But they leave us with the next movie, which I suppose will be the entire globe. Jeff goldbloom gives a hint at the end. Dinos on every continent wrecking havoc. Can't wait!!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
598,entertainmentish,Dinosaurs! Run!,8,7 April 2019,"I have to say usually back in the days sequels are never as good as the first but Hollywood is doing pretty good making sequels and this one I can say was good enough for me. The first half of the movie explains what's gonna happen to the dinosaurs after the fall of Jurassic world and the second half is basically a dinosaur chase with terror. Somewhere in the middle you feel sad for the dinosaurs and what's gonna happen to them and you wish you could do something about it. And there is a focus on blue the velociraptor that plays an essential part to the story plot and why it's happening . It
Was fully entertaining, wasn't boring at all. And it was action packed",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
599,umashankarpati1997,A hunky-Dory entertainer.,5,9 June 2018,"Coming from the Spielberg's Jurassic Park to Jurassic World the CGI or the Vfx has improved or to be precise has evolved with the evolution of technology.
Bayona utilises these new rules to infuse some much-needed terror. But things go terribly wrong as Owen and Claire become aware that they were misfed by Mills.After this it's a whole lot of thrilling sequences accompanied by a bit a emotional touch. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are both great performers and familiarity with their characters allow a semblance of emotional investment.Owen's bonding with Blue adds the feather to the cap of the affection they share even if they are apart from each other. Blue among all the velociraptors from Jurassic World (2015) had the vehement affection towards Owen.The INDORAPTOR gives some chills when it is it introduced in the movie. All the action scenes were high octane and well paced. Especially the eruption scene till the escape on the boat. There is a surprising amount of practical effects on display.First half of the movie was too good. Well paced. 2nd half was admirable. Numerous jaw dropping moments.
This movie also had various references to the Change in climate, as it had the impact to the inhabitants.
This installment to it's Prequel Jurassic World (2015) is a bit let-off, not a disappointment to be honest it has a difference of a grain. This one had some Marvellous cinematography. The end fight was superlative.Coming to the plot, one can't expect a story line or a well developed herculean plot. These movies are watched for entertainment which this one did cover up it's purpose, it was a total hunky-Dory ride.
It is undoubtedly an Unalloyed Hit.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
600,tero-j-ojala,So very very boring movie,4,28 December 2018,"How can movie with so many action scenes be this boring? For the last hour i just prayed ""please be over"". Everything is so predictable and action scenes just follows another. First half is OK, there is real tension but then non-stop action just goes way over the top. Haven't film makers heard that orgasm is nice, but when it lasts for two hours, everyone is just waiting it to end?I just feel like i watched two hours of non-stop dinosaur fighting for some reason.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
601,stani_cv,A movie that shouldn't have been made,5,16 March 2019,"After I finished watching Jurassic World: The Fallen Kingdom it became quite obvious that it was nothing more than a money grab. I've seen people saying it copied The Lost World and while there were similarities it wasn't quite the same and not in a good way. Jurassic World 2 seems rushed and as if no thought was put into making it. It's mildly entertaining and visually appealing but that's not a big compliment considering it was made 25 years after the original which was revolutionary back in 1993.
Plot: goofy and completely unrealistic. A volcano explodes on the island and a bunch of people supposedly try to save the dinosaurs. First of all, who decided to build Jurassic Park on an island with an active volcano on it. I don't even remember the volcano being mentioned in the first movie. What if the disaster in Jurassic World never occurred? Secondly, why would anyone consider throwing so much money and efforts to save those dinosaurs when they could most possibly be replicated again as they were in the first place. Not to mention there were other dinosaur islands - Jurassic Park 2 and 3 anyone? After they managed to rescue a bunch of them they are brought to a basement of a big house to be sold at an auction. Dinosaurs in a house? What could go wrong? I guess it's been so long since The Lost World no one even thought of that. Anyway, remember how hard it was to transport a single T-Rex in that movie? Well, it seems now it's a piece of cake to smuggle a whole bunch of them on a ship including Claire and Owen who managed to go completely unnoticed.
The movie is split into two parts: first one is on the island which is the far better part and the second one is Benjamin Lockwood's mansion where it becomes some kind of horror story but it's not even remotely scary or suspenseful. Everything is so predictable. I knew exactly what was going to happen in every scene and even how it was going to end far before it actually happened(I haven't seen a single trailer).
Acting and Characters: One could argue that the CGI dinosaurs did a far better job than the actual people in this movie. The only tragic death was actually of that dinosaur on the dock. Claire was just as bland as in the first movie. Her two assistants did not add any value and were quite annoying. I am not sure if the hunter was supposed to be scary or funny but he failed at both. The main villain was the biggest disappointment of all. I don't think I saw any emotion this guy's face throughout the whole movie. On top of that he was eaten by the T-Rex in the end. Why am I not even surprised? I am beginning to think they used some computer program to write the entire script.
Some final thoughts: the best part of the movie without a doubt was the beginning. I was very hopeful I'm going to see a good movie. Unfortunately, I was so wrong. I can't say Jurassic World was an exceptional movie but it was much better than this one. Even the original Jurassic Park with the money and technology they had 25 years ago managed to achieve so much more. I honestly did not care about anything or anyone in this movie. The Indoraptor was the lamest dinosaur from all 5 movies. This so-called weapon couldn't even kill a bunch of unarmed people. The whole idea of someone using dinosaurs in combat is something a 9-year-old kid could come up with. Try sending 10 of those against a single tank and see what's going to happen. And you have to aim with a laser for them to do anything? Give me a break! Compared to all previous films this one seems to have the least number of deaths and not a single drop of blood throughout the whole movie. It's worth watching only if you have nothing better to do and you have a couple of hours to kill.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
602,Evey88,"Eh...I hate to say it, being a JP fan",6,23 June 2018,"I think they're just running out of creativity. Jurassic Park is kind of like Star Wars, in the sense that - you have to find a way to bring just enough new creativity to make it interesting without straying too much from the original storyline. It felt very redundant in places. And the new dinosaur presented was not scary in my opinion. It just seemed like a movie I had seen before. There were parts of the plot that didn't really seem to fit. I really wish we had seen more of Jeff Goldblum. Ian Malcom is such a great character and I felt like they could've done more with him. Overall, and believe me, I hate to say this - I was disappointed. Unless they can bring a fresh creative plot to the table, I think they may need to quit while they're ahead. Or maybe they could do a movie that goes more in depth about INGEN and taking INGEN down?",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
603,domsimmonds,Jurrasic World Fallen Franchise,7,11 September 2018,"Why, oh why, oh why?!?!?! Now.....this is not a terrible film. However, this is such a famous Franchise and a lot is expected with each new film. For me, Jurraic Park died, when the T.Rex rampages round L.A. in Jurrasic Park The Lost World. However, it was revived a little in Jurrasic World, as a fun, enjoyable, easy watch. I was hoping this film would be the same. I was wrong!!!It was just disappointing, in so many ways. The plot is non-existence, and rips off the other films in so many ways. It felt like Chris Prat lost his touch in this film. Jeff Goldbloom is litterally in this film to promote it and why is there always a child in all of these films!?!?!?! IT IS UNNECESSARY!!!! CHANGE YOUR STORY!!!! PLEASE!!! But as a film by itself....it's ok. You can enjoy it....but just don't care about this history of the franchise or story line.....because obviously the writers didn't, and only wanted to set up a third film!!!!!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

There is a real sense that everyone except the child would suffer a gruesome death.The story is kinda repetitive which is actually why I didn't give it 10. Henry Wu is a bad guy for 2 movies already, surely some cop or constable would be on his butt. They seem to always have no phones, computers or something to call the cops on that guy. I would have loved to see the real development that included use of phones and stuff in this movie, but still it didn't feel like a world outside our own so the high rating remains. Watch it yourself, you won't be disappointed. Its definitely above a B movie, not quite Dark Knight :p.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

The Jurassic has definitely had it's ups and downs, and while this not the worst of the bunch by far... it still lacks a lot. The characters are bland, and Chris Pratt is not given much room to shine in a dull and uninteresting character. And with his character being the second best in the film... that's a problem. 
The story has begun to devolve to much into a cartoonish like battle off good dinos vs bad dinos with stagnate humans padding the run time.It was a bit refreshing when I saw the military leader guy not being portrayed in the stereotypical gruff military colonel fashion that his type of character is usually portrayed as. But then that was ruined by him turning on the main character. If he was the stereotype, the betrayal would have been expected. So it happening like it did actually was unexpected... but not in a good way. It came off as an eye rolling disappointment of ""Oh great so it is that kind of character after all"" just when I was starting to like the guy.The visuals in the story are great, and I won't shy away from admitting the fact that I almost shed a tear on the Long Neck on the lava dock scene... you know the one. But the whole movie felt like a rushed, half-assed segway trailer to part 3.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

More bout action and thrills this film starts slowly and develops into and dinowar. 
We don't see much development of the original characters but we do see new ones added with interesting twists to thicken the plot. Under 12's May find this movie a little scary as the dinosaurs take on an almost Alien position and there are a few jumps along the way. 
Fast paced, full of action and brilliant special effects. Looking forward to the third instalment, hopefully with Steven Spielberg at the helm.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

615,afatedcircle,Honest review,7,22 June 2018,"SPOILER: That's what the trailers should have said. The director claimed that not much of the movie was spoiled in the trailers, the director lied. Nearly every key point in the movie was shown in one or more of the trailers.Now let me just say, it wasn't horrible. It was a bit better than Jurassic Park 3 but yet not as good as Jurassic World.The first problem you notice is it's been over 20 years since Jurassic Park released and the dinosaurs still look more realistic in it than Fallen Kingdom. It's 2018, how is CGI not looking ultra realistic already?The movie spends the first half or so on the island. This is where it's a good movie and I wish the whole thing had been spent there. You'll notice a lot of Easter eggs as throwbacks to the first including the overturned tour car from Jurassic Park and the Indoraptor clicking its claw on the floor as a throwback to the Raptors from the first film. Sure, we all know theres no way Owen could outrun the pyroclastic flow but hey, you can suspend belief there. That being said you notice the baryonyx and rexy being flown off to the container ship but wait, rexy was just running from the lava flow/pyroclastic flow 10 seconds ago and the other one was stuck in the bunker surrounded by lava? Guess we can look past that too.So then we get taken to Lockwood Manor. Cool I guess, the dinosaurs are being sold off. Seen that coming...but then we get a look at the Indoraptor. Right off the bat you notice how unrealistic it looks. In the trailers people compared it to the xenomorph from the alien franchise and I can see the resemblance. A complete idiot opens its cage(of course) and it goes about slaughtering everyone for what, 15 minutes? It felt short as can be if it was longer than that. Blue saves the day....again and look now all the dinos are set loose in California because yeah that will surely save them...not like they won't be killed immediately with Blue overlooking a town or Rexy tearing up a zoo to roar at nothing for the third time in the film.Now, if you ignore all the things that make you go ""what"" in the movie you'll leave with no real connection to anyone but your two lead characters. Lockwood's cloned granddaughter didn't really make me want to care about her. The antagonist didn't do enough to make me particularly care or cheer when he was killed(unlike in Jurassic World). You don't really see the two supporting characters of the ""dino protection group"" enough to care about them.I suppose there's only so much you can do with a dino movie. This one was supposed to have more of a horror theme to it but it didn't really come off that way. The ""scariest"" moment was ruined when you realize the indoraptor is somehow hanging upside down off a roof spiderman style to open a door. If a sequel is indeed made can we keep hybrids out of it? Do something with the dinos that do not get enough screen time. Heck, the mososaurus from Jurassic World was teased but you see everything that goes on there in the trailers, under a minute of screen time.Decent watch, good popcorn flick but the plot falls flat and you don't really care about the characters. 6.5/10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
616,morfunkel,A movie about animal rights activists that are pissed off,3,4 May 2021,The movie starts off with a character from the prior movies saying let the dinosaurs die. Even in the first jurassic Park he says they had their chance. And all of the main characters agree. But hey screw that movie that everyone loved and do what the new characters want. There is not one explaintion as to why I should care that the dinosaurs are saved it says we are right they are wrong here is the movie. The first jurassic world had an okay story with annoying characters and this movie doubles down on that making them even worse. Justice Smith might the worst comedic relief ever. I didn't crack a smile at anything he said. In fact ian Malcolm and owen are the only characters i like. Very weak story. These people that are taking the dinosaurs own them it is their property. But the bad guys are completely bad so make them do one random gross thing like pull out the tooth. With an extremely weak ending. This entire movie was to set up a third film.

I think people are just way too quick to hate on anything blockbuster-related that's not a marvel movie. Anyways, this movie is a lot of fun to watch. Pretty decent action, and I liked seeing the island blow up, like it does in the books. Pretty good idea for a plot, and the CGI looks really good. Worth watching, but it's not the best thing ever. I'd say this is the third best in the series. Jurassic Park 3 is awful and the worst, Jurassic world is number four, The Lost World is two, and of course the original is the best.

 From the opening scene, this film has you white-knuckled and feeling as if your not watching a remake of a classic flick about dinosaurs in a theme park. You feel a taste of horror and a lot of thriller and action adventure.
 Throughout the movie, you develop those feelings from the first-excitement and awe mixed with a hint of nostalgia from the John Williams score. But make no mistake, this is not the stereotypical sequel of a remake of a hit 90's franchise. This is another great piece to this collection of adventurous and fun movies. It puts its own flare to it though, with scares scattered throughout that make this the definite winner for 'must-go-to-the-bathroom-before-watching' title. 
 I am so excited for the next (and, for now, final) movie in this continuation franchise. They have set it up to be a writer's paradise and I am rooting for Trevorrow and Bayona. They have proven they can still make this series entertaining and cinematically magnificent-enough to give Spielberg's masterpiece a good name. 
One for the collection; makes its own footprint known among the other classics.

630,christopherstamp,Good concept ruined by bad creatives.,4,11 September 2020,"Everyone who praises this movie - ONLY talks about the filmography. Yes in 2018 - high quality effect are expected. But the characters feel like 60s James Bond, the dinosaurs are treat like humans in a dinosaur body.I love this franchise, but this was a swing and a miss.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
631,yaseenfawzi,"""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" Review",5,20 September 2021,"""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"" the latest installment in the ""Jurassic Park/World"" series takes place in the aftermath of the previous film. With the Jurassic World theme park destroyed, former raptor tamer Owen Grady and park director Claire Dearing reunite three years later to save the remaining dinosaurs from a volcano that is about to burst on the now-abandoned Isla Nublar. However, while reuniting with Blue, the last surviving Velociraptor, a volcano erupts on Isla Nublar, leading to the subsequent extinction of the remaining dinosaurs and capture of Blue. Following their escape, Owen and Claire meet up with Maisie, the granddaughter of the late John Hammond's colleague Lockwood, and stumble upon various rogue profiteers and mercenaries, all while trying to save the last surviving dinosaurs.While director J. A. Bayona admirably attempts to create a more intense, horror-like atmosphere in this entry (complete with some nicely backlit shots in Oscar Faura's cinematography and a haunted house-like chase sequence), the film, as written by Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow (director of the previous film) descends into becoming yet another chase movie, with little time for genuine character growth or development. The destruction of Isla Nublar comes across as a repeat of the park breakout in ""Jurassic World,"" with the mostly CG dinosaurs diluting the whole intensity of it, and as a result, what should be an emotional moment just falls flat. The comedy feels desperate here, even more so than in ""World,"" with only a few cute gags having effective execution. The classically witty one-liners from Dr. Malcolm are missing, and as with ""World,"" a pseudo-hipster technician and paleo-veterinarian are featured as (rather unwanted) comic relief. Even the little bits of fan service, including cameos from Jeff Goldblum's Dr. Malcolm and BD Wong's Dr. Wu, only serve to showcase just how low this franchise has sunk. A few jump-scares, mostly involving characters hanging for dear life on ladders, come off as mostly laughable and even border on the predictable. Once again, the villains are reduced to being nothing more than flat, two-dimensional capitalists and army men, including Mills, who poses as a philanthropist while secretly tampering with dinosaur genetics for profit, with the twist coming off as extremely obvious.Given the material they are working with, the cast at least put in a great deal of commendable effort. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard comfortably return to their roles of Owen and Claire with panache, but their chemistry comes off as somewhat thin. Rafe Spall, on the other hand, portrays his character like the weaselly, mustache-twirling baddie Mills is depicted as, with mostly mixed results. Ted Levine relishes his role as a sadistic military commando that feels nothing but complete disdain and contempt for the fearsome creatures. Danielle Pineda's Rodriguez at least proves more tolerable than Justice Smith's irritating Webb. Only James Cromwell, Geraldine Chaplin, and newcomer Isabella Sermon really hold the movie together in their supporting parts, Cromwell as Lockwood, Sermon as Maisie, and Chaplin as Iris, the caretaker of the estate. Although the digital dinosaurs themselves are nicely detailed, they pale in comparison to the blend of practical and digital effects utilized in the original ""Jurassic Park."" Strip away the little glimpses of John Williams' memorable themes, and all you are left with in Michael Giacchino's score is just more generic action music.Fallen is certainly the word to describe ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"" as it proves how the ""Jurassic Park"" franchise has actually de-evolved from its beginnings as a parable on chaos theory and man desiring control over nature into a series of high-budget B-movies that emphasize style over substance.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

633,steven-loontjens-94-440406,Worthy successor and addition to the franchise,9,16 June 2018,"I don't often write reviews but this is one I must write...I'm a big fan of this franchise since its first release in '93 and every year I watch the first one over and over... and I keep loving it! When in 2015, after all those years a new installment came, I was overcome with enthusiasm and when I heard it would become a trilogy, I was so truly happy and it has fullfilled all my wishes so far.This one, again, is an adventure, a new proof that greed and utter stupidity don't mix and it promises to become a succes. No matter what others write or say, it is different from The Lost World: Jurassic Park. It even kinda acknowledges its events by mentioning Isla Sorna (Site B)What I do have to say are a few minor faults in the storyline (a mistake that happened in the third is repeated when the Indo-raptor breaks through would and steel but a wooden dumb waiter door can't be broken and when its victims don't leave any blood trails, I find that hard to believe.... but that is not what bothered me... what did was the fact that the trailers left no surprises for the movie. All was already revealed in all the trailers and that is a shame! Yet, I enjoyed this movie for what it was: great fun with dinos! I can't wait for the next installment!Life really does find a way!!!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
634,simon_ecc,Weak premise,4,24 July 2020,"The big problem with this film is the premise. I can understand why we should want to save the whale or why we should be ashamed of ourselves if rhinos become extinct. The idea that dinosaurs which have been re-engineered as some type of frankenstein reenactment, which are now about to go extinct, should be saved as a product of an elevated sense of morality is ridiculous. Either the screenwriters/ directors know this, in which case they are frauds, or they don't know, in which case they are vain or just have really poor judgment.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
635,artgutierrez,"Should be titled ""Flawed Kingdom""",3,7 October 2020,"This movie's story is flawed right from the beginning. Why would anyone go through all the trouble of cloning and keeping dinosaurs, AND open up a theme park on an active volcanic island in the first place? It's either extremely dumb writing, or extremely lazy writing. Surely, the brilliant minds that cloned these dinosaurs had to think in advance that Isla Nublar was volcanically active. And that sooner or later an eruption would destroy both the dinosaurs, the tourists, and the park itself. No geologists were consulted at all before it was decided WHERE to build this park??? Bottom line: Just turn off your brain and watch dinosaurs eat people.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

637,Jguy10,Repetitive but good,7,23 June 2018,"I thought it was good but not the best. It had a LOT of story elements from the lost world to the point that it sorta kinda feels like a remake. It also had a fair amount of story elements from Jurassic World. Overall it was good, but felt like a repeat of former films. I will say that I love where they are going with it, though.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
638,glenbording,So predictable it hurt...,5,24 June 2018,"It was really easy to guess what was going to happen, it actually became kinda a game for my brother and I halfway trough, we even nailed some of the dialog by pure guessing.
The CGI and acting was okay to great depending on the actor, but there was any plot holes and bad characters trough it all.
Like the doctor that thinks blood of all carnivores is the same, if they have the same number of claws, and that it would mess up the genetics to get blood from another dinosaur. It's really bad seeing the people behind a movie knowing less about a subject than the average viewers, only people that never had any biologi or common sense would fall for that. Also don't know why they kept the doctor alive, as she was a prick too all, and din't have any more value.
Then there is the teleproting people, and the sheer number of dumb to stupid decisions that are made all from not locking a cage to people not seeing an extra truck fly trough the air and land on the boat they are on, like really.
Then there is the plot of the movie, apparently it was a good thing the park was abandon as it was doomed to be destroyed anyway by the volcano that suddenly was there. How this would cause the Dinos to be extinct I don't know, as there are two more island with Dinos on, and there got to be a lot of DNA samples around the world too. Also why build a large door to the sea, so the the larges predictor know to man can swim directly out, I would really like to meet the engineer that build this place.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
639,justind-70204,It was so bad I forgot I even saw it!!!,5,8 August 2020,"So I was watching Jurassic World tonight, a movie I do enjoy, and I was thinking, did I really watch a horrible sequel to this? And I did in fact see a horrible sequel. So bad I wiped it from my memory.With reviews on IMDB, sometimes the people that bag a movie are wrong, but not this time. It's just a pretty boring movie with a horrible storyline and it's just not in the same league as the others. I hope the next one is good, Jurassic world 1 was a great movie imho, it wasn't the best movie ever but it had that dinosaur magic about it and they need to bring that back on the next one.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
640,wino-80050,Why... ?,5,21 August 2018,"I guess this is excellent example of what happens when too many CGI replaces a good screenplay. The amount of stupidity in this movie is enormous. And I would even consider saying that dinosaurs form the first Jurrasic World were way better presented than in this movie.
If you have hangover and you don't have the urge to use all of your braincells - you may watch it. Otherwise you are risking frying your brain.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
641,elmasbasakgoren,Not good,5,11 June 2018,"I'm just being honest, this movie doesn't come up to expectations. I like watching dinosaur films but this movie was almost boring. Not bad acting, but in my opinion the script was awful. It didn't have original things.. all things we watched was that we watched 100 times.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
642,workoutsmurf,So This is What Dino Dung Looks Like in Film Form,1,8 November 2018,"Oh man, I wanted to like it, I REALLY DID....but when the overly-aggressive misandric ""veterinarian"" character said ""I'm a dinosaur vetrinarian"" then states ""but I've never seen one"" I was done. Completely done, then came the flood of CG, explosions and all the other diversional tacticts you would need to try to divert from a horrific storyline. Don't forget the scene of the lone dinosaur on the dock, looking at the boat, almost crying, it was pathetic. Seriously a wooden dock is going to support the weight of dinosaurs? lol I cant. That was it, I sat there looking at my watch and wishing I had saved myself the 19.99 to see this ""film"". All those reviews giving it a ""10"" and saying it's ""amazing"" and ""brilliant"" either have zero taste or work directly for the studios. Save yourself the agony and either skip this totally or watch it expecting nothing at all.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
643,m0ds,"ALAN, it's up there with JP3",6,13 June 2018,"Probably just for kids. May be better on a second viewing? Every scene was basically a lead up to one of the shots in the trailer(s). If you've seen all the trailers then you've seen the movie, what you haven't seen is the filler between all the moments in the trailers. Like Jeff Goldblum? You've already seen his entire part in the trailers, in fact, they cut out a couple of his trailer lines in the movie. If you've seen the Thai trailers with additional footage (like I had) then the entire experience will not have any punch. It was alright, it was not a bad movie per se. Owen and Claire, though cute as always, are relatively useless in this movie. They extract some blood and escape a jail cell, that's about the long and short of it. The majority of death scenes are ""implied"" which is lame, though there are a couple of decent kill-count moments. I didn't like the music during the volcanic explosion, it sounded really cartoony and out of place. There are no great flourishes like Blue's ""Lost World"" cue in JW1 and the main themes from JP are not used (bar one piano note melody and JP theme for credits music). Nice to hear the JW themes but even they aren't used much.Blue is probably the star and even she gets very limited time on-screen. All that aside though, it's probably fine, fun and scary for kids. And I have to accept that my fandom for JP comes from enjoying it as a kid. I think as a kid I would find it a very entertaining dino movie. As a pretty hardcore JP fan, I was left underwhelmed, but not entirely disappointed. There was still Blue, and dues-ex-machina Rexy, and Owen & Claire. The effects were decent enough, but as a whole it just never seemed to quite come together. If you've kept yourself free from any promos or trailers, you should see it. All the iconic moments from the movie won't have been spoiled for you. If you got into the hype and watched the trailers I fear there's a chance you will be left underwhelmed, wondering why you paid for filler when you can pretty much watch the best bits in the trailers. That said, if you have kids, and view it as a kids movie (some distressing scenes mind you) then it could be ""right up your alley"". It wasn't right up mine, not even the back alley. But yeah a passable JP with Blue who remains a legendary raptor, so 6/10.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Do not go in with Oscar expectations or your critical contacts in. Treat it for what it is....entertainment! On that level it hits everything out of the park and truly is out of this world. You will laugh, you will cringe, you will jump, you will be on the edge of your seat. You may get teary (I did) and you might find all your heart strings played. It's genius, fresh, unfathomable and riveting. Forget these horrible reviews- watch Jurassic World first if you have not already as it really sets the tone, premise and direction. If you don't watch it you will find the plot nearly senseless and irrational. Fallen Kingdom is a direct continuance of Jurassic World and a hell of a sequel.

And that one has a score of 7.5 somehow. who rates this crap?This one however, was so much watchable at has a rating of 6.2 only. Bloody hell unbelievable. This is easily an 8. This was more fun than JP 3. Had more value to the story and the acting were way improved. Action was good, story line was very decent and intriguing to watch. I hope there is more to come. Byrce Dallas Howard somehow carried the burden on her shoulder and did well since Spiderman 3.That's why this is easily an 8 star, these were not top notch actors/actress and they did a pretty decent job and were stuck to the plot and gave some respect to the original JP acting.Don't be fooled by the ratings and watch this over and over again.

I was so excited to see this and you just presume the story would be just as good as the first one, but no the story line was not very good at all especially towards the end. It just diddnt make sense. I wanted it to stay on the island but it just went a bit weird.

651,adean81,Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,7,5 July 2018,"When the first Jurassic World movie came out back in 2015, I was super excited because I love the original Jurassic Park film. Even though Jurassic World made over 2 Billion dollars at the box office, fans had mixed reviews. Personally, I really enjoy the movie, but recognize it's flawed. So I was a bit skeptical going into Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. I will say that overall I might like it more than the first Jurassic World.One of the things I really enjoyed about this movie is that it added in the horror elements that made the original Jurassic Park so great. The tone throughout the film was dark, but most of it worked well. It plays into the theme and dark side that comes with the creation of the dinosaurs. Fallen Kingdom does an excellent job at following what the first movie set up, and pushes the theme of a dinosaur world further. It raises questions about the responsibility that humans have for these dinosaurs and what it means to have dinosaurs in the world, rather than just a theme park. Jeff Goldblum returns! All though it's brief, the way that the character Dr. Ian Malcolm was used fit perfectly with the movie's theme. Hopefully, we can get more from this character in the third movie, and maybe even bring back Dr. Alan Grant. The acting in this movie was pretty good, and in particular, I enjoyed the child character. The two boys from Jurassic World were boring characters that had too much screen time, the young female child in this movie does a much better job of integrating into the story. Not everything in the movie was great. There are a lot of moments that are used as plot points. A way to quickly jump the story forward, even if it doesn't make sense. While it doesn't ruin the movie for me, it is something that you have to just roll your eyes and move on from. Another thing I didn't like, was that the movie spent such little time on the actual island. Most of the film takes place off the island, and I would have loved to see more of the island before leaving it behind forever. The movie's villain is also very one dimensional and lacks a compelling motive. The opening scene did a great job to capture my attention, and the movie has a lot of action. I like the direction they took this sequel, I wish it were maybe executed better. But coming out of the film, I found myself really enjoying it. There were a lot of nods to the original Jurassic Park, some of which I appreciated and some that I rolled my eyes at. I'll have to see it again, but this might be the second best Jurassic movie, in my opinion.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Who on earth wrote this idiotic script?! There are too many uninteresting storylines in in one film. The crap about human cloning should be totally left out.

Bad acting (particularly, Howard), idiotic motives, forced PC, terrible CGI when compared to the original Jurassic Park and a ridiculous storyline which seems like a testament to the lack of creative talent in hollywood these days. perhaps a less nepotism and some more balls would do miracles to the film industry.

Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom was a fun enough sequel, but in my opinion it is not as good as the classic Jurassic Park, The Lost World or Jurassic World, but I thought it was way better than Jurassic Park 3! There were a lot of elements of Fallen Kingdom that I appreciated and others that I didn't appreciate and most of that has to do with the 2nd act of the movie and the characters. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are good in this movie and honestly Bryce Dallas Howard has a lot more things to do in this film! I could've lived without some of the new characters they decided to throw into the film, but they were fun enough and some of them were useful and others were just there to be a comedic coward, but the villains.....WOAH let me tell ya about the villains in this movie! Not good, at all and they honestly feel almost like cartoonish villains in a PG-13 movie. However, I thought the Indoraptor was pretty cool and a little better than the Indominus. I liked how the film didn't go to overboard with showing the genetic hybrid that much and only showed in the scenes that it should be in. And I also like how the film's called ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,"" because there are elements of this movie that give this movie the perfect title and I'm not spoiling any of these elements! And in my opinion, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is not going to be for every Jurassic Park fan or even everyone in general. Because of the choices the creators made in this film and the direction by J.A. Bayona, this film is it's own story that knows it's not similar to the other Jurassic Park movies, so there will be a mix between a lot of people who love this movie and a lot of people who hate this movie. I personally enjoyed Fallen Kingdom and I can't wait to see it again and I actually would recommend watching it, even if you think it might be bad, because I think that EVERY movie deserves a chance to be seen by audiences before its judged.

657,The Fresh Prince,For Me It's The Best Jurassic Film Since The Lost World,10,12 June 2018,"The new Jurassic World sequel was very enjoyable and entertaining. I personally think that it was a big improvment over the previous film. For start, the dialog was much better, not that ""streight to the point"" one liners but real conversations..just like in the older Jurassic Park films. I think that hollywood have embraced that one-liner action script and this movie took a step back from it and for the good.
Second - CGI and practical effects. In the first Jurassic World movie the special effects weren't all that convincing. It had some flaws and I didn't always find the effects convincing and real. In the new film, the dinosaurs looked very real and it added a strong sense of realism into it.
I think that some of the plot lines are very daring and it's obviously to me that the new director wants to take this franchise to new places.
if you haven't see the movie yet than I strongly recommend you not to read any spoilers, you would be very surprised by some of the twists toward the third act of the film.

Fails to deliver good plot.,5,20 September 2018,"I'm going to rate this a 5/10 because honestly it wasn't that great a movie. The CGI was absolutely incredible, but CGI isn't plot, and for a movie to be good, you need a good script. This didn't have that. BUT it did have great cinematography at times. I enjoyed watching it because frankly I love dinosaur movies, and these are all we really have in that department. Will I watch the next one? Yes.This movie is very PG rated. When people are torn apart on screen, there's no gore, no blood. I expected this of course, but it still disappoints me. This movie would be much more chilling if it had a bit of blood in it.I wish someone would make movies like these, for adults, with good scripts and more graphical violence. Less ""family movie"" vibe would be better. This movie was probably the worst so far. The plot was just silly and poorly orchestrated in a very unconvincing way.I AM looking forward to the NEXT movie. Dinosaurs roaming cities is what I'd like to see!

661,Fred_Mopkopf,Ignore the naysaysers - brilliant genre fimmaking!,9,1 November 2020,"Bottom line: This is one of the best action adventure films of 2018. And I have to be careful not to be writing a rant against ignorant revievers instead of an actual review. So, to get it out of the way: It's interesting to note that most negative reviews on this film circle around unrealistic premises and plot points - even the eloquent reviews, and eloquence should be a sign of wisdom. Seems it isn't. People, how many times over do we have to state it: Films like these do only EXIST because realism is not core of the story. These films need to be plausible - or at least probable -, but not realistic. That's at the core of the genre. If they'd left out everything unrealistic in the film, there would be no film. And no, the first Jurassic Park movie was in no way more realistic. There are no more dinosaurs walking the earth, and there will not be any for a long time to come (if any). And it's absolutely OK for such a film to stretch suspension of disbelief from time to time, to show stupid behaviour of people and technical inaccuracies. I really don't care that the wailing Brachiosaurus is probably too heavy for the dock he's standing on. Seeing him being left behind and facing his death breaks my heart, and what kind of person do you have to be to rather be facepalming yourself during that scene instead of immersing yourself into the story? The little technicality with the presumably weak dock is by no means distractive to the story, and it is very clear why people need to point it out, along with a scathing sneer: It is more important to have a reason to join the nitpicking contest with narcisisstically motivated ranting than approving of obiously very good overall work. The story is so old: Someone took a long time to build a beautiful sand castle, so let's destroy it with one quick blow. And why do those haters keep complaining about sloppy and unimaginative writing? In a world with 8 billion people and after a long storytelling history, there is only a finite number of very intelligent, surprising and new plots left to be written (if any at all). So what do actually want? Films like this not being made anymore? I have another suggestion: Just stay away from film genres you don't like. Yes, there are expensive yet stupid and wholly uninventive and sloppily written blockbuster films out there, but JWFK is by no means one of them!And now straight to the point: JWFK is one big surprise. It ups the ante of the series significantly, and I found myself being surprised that this is my second favorite of the Jurassic Park films (right after the first one). And that credit goes primarily to director J. A. Bayona. His vision and the capability to bring it on screen is just remarkable - and that's not easy to achieve. It's not a surprise that NOT everyone is a director these day, despite contradicting claims. The staging, framing and lighting of the dinosaurs (the auction and the confrontation on the glass roof in particular), Bayona's timing, his work with actors and imaginary creatures is just great. At no point of the film I felt left cheated, bored or even insulted, as some other people say. It was just one impressing, thrilling, aesthetic rollercoaster ride. And it's also the first time in the series (which I have been an avid fan of since 1993) that I really feel with the dinosaurs. Despite earlier tries to make them (in part) the victim, the previous films where centered more on the people being the victims of dinosaur-related mayhem. But this one made me think for the first time that it was maybe wrong to un-extinct the dinosars for their own sake (yeah, yeah, you guys figured that out long before, I know), and the character of Maisie Lockwood plays a pivotal role in that realization.I could go on and on with positive traits of the film, but there are other reviews here to find them. I have turned 46 recently and seen too many action-adventure, sci-fi, mystery and thriller films. I am bit bored by my own inability to find impressing films anymore and would love being able to start over. But I vividly remember, JWFK made my cinematic 2018. It it the best action-adventure I have seen this year. J. A. Bayona and his team have built one very beautiful sand castle. If you think you can relate to my self-characterization: Watch it. You won't be disappointed. By the way, if you are interested: I' am one of the people who loved 2017's KONG - SKULL ISLAND. I'm confident that if you liked that one, you will like this one, too - or the other way round.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

I thought Jurassic World was bad, but Fallen Kingdom takes bad to whole new level! The trend of fake reviews by the most likely culprit, PR films working for the studios behind rubbish like this, continues with fake reviews by presumably the same person with fake accounts, when you scroll down or up!But where to begin with this film, from plot to acting to the CGI, everything is overblown, lacklustre, and low quality!The writer and director are clearly lacking in the talent department, and it speaks volumes of the dearth in quality of this film and American cinema in general.

Fallen kingdom is poor from start to finish! Luckily I streamed the movie and didn't waste my hard earned cash on it! 
The special effects are decidedly average in places not as good as the original even. 
But to top off this turd of a movie they have a dinosaur auction near the end of the film and the dinosaurs go for less money than a championship footballer! I sat in disbelief as these billionaires from around the world paid less for extinct dinosaurs than they would a house or a yacht!! WTF!!Hopefully this will be the end of the franchise.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
664,jakehenry-80471,Awful sequel seemingly written by someone who's never seen a Jurassic Park film,2,16 May 2021,"First off I'd like to give some of the positives, it's a well made film with fine acting and decent effects. The opening scene was also very good. Now the negatives, the film actively craps all over the previous films and it's clear that whoever wrote this has never seen any of the previous films including the first Jurassic World. Let me explain why I believe this is the case: the film introduces a business partner who supposedly worked with Richard Hammond to create the original park yet this person was never mentioned at all or even hinted at in the original Jurassic Park. Second the main plot point of the film the Volcano threatening to destroy the island, you would think that Richard Hammond or even Simon Masrani would think it stupid to build the park on an Island that will potentially be destroyed at any point. This is also ridiculous because the film forgets that there is a second island with dinosaurs from the sequels The Lost World & Jurassic Park 3, so like Ian Malcom said they should have let the dinosaurs die since there's still more alive on the other island. Finally the characters of Claire and Owen have been swapped since the first Jurassic World, Owen was the caring one who loved the dinosaurs while Claire was only interested in profit and now for some reason Claire (who should be in prison because of Jurassic World) is trying to save the dinosaurs while Owen would rather just let them die. Aside from these continuity breaking issues the film is just a retread of The Lost World with bland characters. Also the ending is so ridiculous, that little girl has just doomed humanity.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
665,hjyguy-25992,We crave more diverse motives for villains,6,1 August 2018,"All in all, the movie is fun enough to watch to the end. But that said, it doesnt measure up to the standards of the prior installments. CG and cinematography is great. Acting is generally fine, except for a few quirks here and there. Its the plot that is so problematic. Really? Money again!! A manager in charge of millions if not billions of dollars of funds should not be so dumb as to risk everything in the hope of earning some millions of dollars. A billionnaire would not be so dumb as to place all his money and power in the hands of one treacherous subordinate. It would have been so much more interesting if, for instance, the villain had a deranged childlike fantasy of creating a prehistoric world where man fought dinosaurs, and genetically enhanced ones at that. And his dream would be to emerge as a hero by announcing a bioweapon that only affects dinosaurs, which he would proffer after tons of people had died and he would become the savior from the chaos he himself had created. That's just one idea and I'm sure there would be many other more feasible and exciting plots.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

But when they destroy the park 45 minutes in, you begin to think... what the heck are they going to do for the next hour and twenty minutes? The movie then becomes a Blackmarket dinosaur auction run by the people who we were led to believe were trying to save the dinosaurs. And for the question of is it very good... well not really. The first half is good but the second half didn't even feel like a Jurassic Park movie basically the Run down of the second half is a bunch a douche bags were auctioning off dinosaurs to blackmarket criminals they used raptor dna and the crossbreed from the first films dna. And created the indoraptor. It gets loose in the mansion and for 45 minutes people run around screaming getting eaten by dinosaurs. So no the movie kinda sucks I'm not saying everyone will hate it it just wasn't really for me. The first half was great the second half was terrible they should have just tried to save all the dinosaurs and movie them safely to the other island... OH YEAH...

Loved it,8,29 June 2018,"In a recent Washington Post article, co-writer and executive producer Colin Trevorrow drew parallels between the fifth installment in the ""Jurassic Park"" film franchise and the way animals are treated by humans. ""We have a relationship with animals on this planet that is tenuous and is strained. They suffer from abuse and trafficking and the consequences of our environmental choices,"" said Trevorrow.On their rescue mission, the crew runs into trouble with poachers who seek to profit from the vulnerable creatures. This aspect of the plot creates a metaphor for animals such as rhinos, elephants, pangolins, orangutans, and others who have been exploited to near-extinction by humans.Being an animal advocate myself, I personally found this movie very sad.

If you stop, think about what the characters do and what happens, you have to be a complete braindead moron to not think it's incredibly stupid. Can't fault the execution tho, the filmmaking is very good but it's in the service of pure stupidity. Unfortunately, the new boomer generation loves that kind of stupidity.

673,eer85,Hollywood lost the mold,3,1 July 2018,"The first ""Jurassic World"" was a dumb, nostalgia-ridden mess which managed to make a lot of money by rehashing the basic plot of ""Jurassic Park"". This sequel its the same deal, only it uses the already inferior ""The Lost World"" as its main source of inspiration. There's not a single plot element that makes sense, everything is jammed down the viewer's throat and the character's are a bunch of one-dimensional stereotypes. It's easier to list its few virtues than dwell in all its shortcomings:1) Visually speaking, its 100 times more appealing than its predecessor. Kudos to the director, the cinematographer, art department and all the other people involved. The lighting, especially, is more interesting. Despite the fact it is shot with digital cameras (the Alexa 65, which currently is the state-of-the-art, along with a few other machines, when it comes to digital imagery), it feels more like an old-fashion, Technicolor epic than its captured-on-film predecessor. 2) Despite the script's lack of truly suspenseful set-pieces (we're talking about the JP franchise here: who can forget the kitchen sequence in the original? Or the caravan hanging on the edge of the cliff in Lost World?), Bayona does a good job in instilling a quasi-gothic, horror-movie vibe in the last act. Nothing that will prevent you from sleep at night, but you can tell the guy knows what suspense is. I wonder what he could've done with a better screenplay at hand. 3) The opening scene does work: it's a nice way to kickstart the flick. Unfortunately, it all goes downhill from there. The rest is highly forgettable. The pseudo-science is one of the things that kills me every time I watch current sci-fi blockbusters: these things, of course, have never been actual textbooks you could take seriously, but nowadays it really seems that the writers don't even bother to check wikipedia and just rely on stuff they have seen in other movies. As such, not only we have to swallow a ton of silly technobabble fro Dr. Wu (who, since the last movie, has become a diabolical villain), but we are also supposed to believe you can actually do an on-the-spot, interspecies blood transfusion between animals that originally lived millions of years apart. And that's just the first example that came to mind, but there are many more. Hollywood definitely lost the mold for this kind of movie a long time ago. And the people there probably don't even care.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
674,irrelevantlife,Could have been much worse.,6,26 November 2018,"JW:Fallen Kingdom is not a perfect sequel by any means, but it does deliver on good action and plenty of dinosaur scenes.Some of the trailers were really misleading as I had hoped that Jeff Goldblum's iconic character Dr. Ian Malcolm would return as a staple in the series again, but sadly his presence here is more of a cameo than anything else.Chris Pratt is as always a good lead and balances out the often absurd plot which sees rich capitalist scrambling to make a buck by selling their dinosaurs for what amounts to pocket change when compared to what was said about the running costs of the parks in previous movies in the franchise! Isla Sorna is also completely left out - so much for continuity!Almost the entire premise of The Lost World Jurassic Park is recreated here, a was the case in Jurassic World which was almost a Jurassic Park (1993) remake, and it seems that the studio has run out of ideas - still it isn't as bad what Disney is doing to the STAR WARS franchise, not even close!All in all this movie cannot compete with the original Jurassic Park and its sequel The Lost World, but it still manages to entertain.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

That being said I thought JWFK was a ""fun"" movie that was well made and looked great with superb action sets. But the story is prettt shallow although if they had developed some of the points raised in the more it could have been so much more. Too many interesting sub plots were brought up only to go nowhere. That is the most disappointing aspect of the film for me.

679,hellostranger-32317,"If you love the original, don't see this.",3,22 June 2018,"The only reason I'm even giving this any stars is because the cgi has improved greatly since the first Jurassic World. However we apparently had to give up nostalgic feels, great acting, and most importantly, great writing for decent looking dinosaurs. There is nothing familiar about this film. Even the actors that are from the first film are completely different characters. Chris Pratt's charming character Owen Grady is no longer charming. They try so hard to make him a bad ass, that he's not even that anymore. He's just an action hero, and not in the loveable unique sense that we all (normally) love him for. While Bryce Dallas Howard plays Claire, who in the first film was all about business and order, and somehow in this film is a messy overly-caring woman who has lost all of her character traits from the first. The only actor that saves this movie is Justice Smith, who although is completely out of place and not well-written, is actually thoroughly enjoyed when on the screen. Now let's get to the villain. I'm a huge fan of the film Life Of Pi, so I was excited when I saw Rafe Spall casted for this film, especially since his co-star was in the first film. However now I can't tell if I just hated his character so much that it made me almost dislike the actor, or if I should just shame the writers. I've always disliked Toby Jones, so don't even get me started on the villains anymore. Leave the villain part to the dinosaurs, not the humans. It's like Walking Dead, it's gone from awesome characters going against cool zombies, to all about war. Lets skip this dudes and get straight to the dinosaurs. As someone put in their review, Spielberg was able to have an intense suspsensful scene with just a water cup moving and just the sound of a footstep. This film tries way, way too hard for suspense in all the cliche, wrong ways (like a little girl in her bed and an unnecessaryily creepy dinosaur creeping in her room to eat her). And can I just say that I'm like every other cliche American when it comes to absolutely loving Blue, but that doesn't mean you make Blue into a cute cuddly baby creature, she's still supposed to be a velociraptor, not baby Dory. They kill off dinosaurs like they're nothing (the scene where they're leaving the island ruined the whole film for me, those who have seen it know what part I'm talking about) and honestly they wouldn't have just left a theme park with dinosaurs completely deserted for three years, only to bring them across the ocean and place them in someone's garage. The people who wrote this movie didn't place themselves in the situations or do any research. Just leave all writing to Michael Critchon from now on and don't try to recreate it anymore. There were no memorable lines, no memorable scenes, it was just all, bad.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
680,brennandube,"Mediocre, different, fun but nothing special.",6,23 June 2018,"'Fallen Kingdom' is directed by J.A. Bayona and is written by the duo of Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly. The island of 'Isla Nublar', where 'Jurassic World' took place, has a volcano that is just ready to blow. From this, political debate sparks into whether or not the dinosaurs on the island should be rescued. With this we have our movie. I'm a huge fan of the original 'Jurassic Park' and enjoyed 'Jurassic World' when it hit the big screens a few years ago. Going into this I had my doubts... it's not uncommon for a 'Jurassic' sequel to be a dud. Nonetheless, I was very excited by the prospect of heading into the theatres and seeing a different 'Jurassic' film than what I, and millions of others are used to. In that, 'Fallen Kingdom' did not disappoint. This is definitely the most ambitious film in the franchise since the original hit the big screen in the summer of 1993. Despite its attempts at being something different, 'Fallen Kingdom' often fell flat, failing to deliver a savoring taste of dinosaur, and 'Jurassic' magic.  The opening third of this film holds some intrigue, aiming to be a deeper meaning than some of the previous franchise sequels. I did not fully buy into Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howards characters going back to the island but the movie gave a solid attempt and it was somewhat believable. Both Pratt and Howard are a thrill to watch and I am glad the series continued on following those two characters. Despite good acting from Pratt, there was no real structural development to his character in the film which feels a tad like lazy writing. We now have two entire films and Pratt has yet to develop whatsoever. Bryce Dallas Howards character, 'Claire Dearing' did have a bit of a change of heart in this film and it was pleasant to see her character grow. The aim of truly wanting to make this new trilogy into a world is very clear in this film. I do feel however the movie was not fully focused on that and really danced around its main end-game. I do give 'Fallen Kingdom' props for taking some chances and doing different things with the franchise. The supporting cast in this film, namely the two that join Pratt and Howard's excursion, are rather boring. Justice Smith and Danielle Pineda are the two that star alongside our main duo. At times, both are borderline annoying as they try to convey some unnecessary comedic relief. Other new characters include 'Eli Mills' played by Rafe Spall and 'Sir Benjamin Lockwood' played by James Cromwell. Cromwell's character has an intriguing enough backstory but Rafe Spall's newly introduced character comes off as two-dimensional and generic. Child actress, Isabella Sermon plays 'Maisie Lockwood' aka the granddaughter of 'Benjamin Lockwood' in this film and I must say she did quite a good job. Her arc was also probably the most intriguing of the film and it might well be the thing that sticks with me most in the days and weeks following this movie. Jeff Goldblum also reprises his role as 'Dr. Ian Malcolm' in this film which is always fun as well.  Onto what we are really here for... Dinosaurs! 'Fallen Kingdom' has some very incredible looking sequences on the island that look great on the big screen. The special effects in this movie are also absolutely top notch and the close up combat with the dinosaurs looks really well done. However, many of the same scenes and gimmicks from previous films were used and I did feel like I was watching a rehashing of other 'Jurassic' films at times. So as a truly great action-packed summer blockbuster, this movie does not always deliver. I did have some fun with this movie though and there were undeniably some pretty good, fun sequences.  One of the biggest issues with the first film that carries into the second is the villains. The quality of villains in these films need to seriously be upped in quality as they always detract from the film as a whole. Their cartoony feel, which is present in both 'Jurassic World' and this film 'Fallen Kingdom', really don't do much at all to benefit the story. Michael Giacchino's score is a positive from this film and he is just continuing to show how much of a terrific composer he is.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

691,glennmeerten06,Fallen Franchise,5,9 June 2018,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, puts us back on Isla Nublar after the events of Jurassic World. The island and the dinosaurs living there, are threatened by a cataclismic event. When a vulcano erupts, Claire and Owen reunite in an effort to save the animals from extinction, but also from war profetiersAs a massive fan of this franchise, I was completely on board for this sequel of the fun and well made JW. What could go wrong with an established brand, charming lead actor and a fun premise Well, it is with heavy heart and utter dissapointment, I have to say: a lot. THE POSITIVESThe opening scene is absolutely incredible. It sets the tone very well in terms of direction and atmosphere. It's the start of a film that really excels in its direction, cinematography and special effects. In the following hour, we are treated to a Jurassic World film, we as fans want to see. Great action, tens moments, new and longtime requested dinosaurs, interesting showdowns between dino's! Awesome stuff. 
The film even taps into some different genres in the third act. It turns into a straight up horror film and once again benifits from great direction. It shows us dinosaurs in locations we haven't seen before and it's great! THE NEGATIVESUnfortunately, the film takes a dramatic turn for the worse after the halfway mark. The screening I went to, had a break after we leave the island. By that point I absolutely loved it. It even went into said break with a very emotional, even devastating moment. When the film picked up after the break, I was horrified when I realised where the film was going. The film loses itself in a heavyhanded statement about nature being exploided for greed. It completely lost me. There's an entire subplot involving a child character called Maisse, who was protrayed very well. However, when a certain aspect of her character is revealed, I was baffled. It's nonsensicle, unwarented, pointless and laughable. 
The most insulting part of it all is when the film comes to a close, and you review the story that has been told in light with a message that a certain character gives at the beginning of the film, and the very end, you'll be left absolutely horrified. It makes our 'heroes' and their quest pointless. It reminds me of Allen Grant's remark in JP 3 (a fan favorite): ""Some of the worst things imagineble, have been done with the best intensions!"" That perfectly summarizes are heroes' actions in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. SUMMARYJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom starts off amazingly. A fun premise held up by great direction, cinematography, eventually falls apart completely because of a insultingly bad script and a focus on the worst aspect of this story. Fun and interesting steps in different genres, can't save the dissapointing second half. What a damn shame...",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
692,recklesscow,By-the-numbers fare.,4,7 July 2018,"The film is mildly entertaining and occasionally tear-inducing (as animal deaths always get me more than human ones), but the film feels too cut-and-paste and tonally off-kilter. The returning characters exist merely to provide a moral base for the audience amongst evil men looking to make money at all costs, and their new sidekicks are total cliches given lines merely to make ten year-olds chuckle (as they were wont to do constantly every time the sheepish computer nerd made a badly-scripted ""I'm such a wuss, I'm so funny"" one-liner).The portion on the island should have and could have been handled better, but the entire thing felt rushed as an excuse to get our group and their dinosaur captors into the second phase of the story, which was the most interesting. The darker second half involving the evil corporations and military industrial complex saved the film from total humdrum, but the contrast between settings only serves to highlight how uneven the film is as a whole.The special effects are typically amazing, but the thrill of seeing dinosaurs on screen has long passed, hence the creators rooting for us to connect with them emotionally rather than visually. It works, but one wonders what the franchise is saying when you're rooting for the dinosaurs more than the humans.No set piece ""wows"", but there are enough decent ones to make some fun entertainment if you don't have your standards set too high.It's too bad they didn't put as much effort into the script as they did the special effects.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
693,gerick_goldwyn,A very disappointing second film,4,15 July 2018,"I was very disappointed with Jurassic World 2, given the first film was outstanding. I thought the storyline was incredibly weak. It didn't add anything to the franchise, except pave the way for the next movie, which is: Welcome to the Dinosaur Apocalypse. In the first scene, we see excavators dig-up a Indominus Rex fossil, which is later destroyed and doesn't add nothing to the film. Ted Levine also abductions the Velociraptor Blue from Jurassic World, which later escapes, so Bradley Darryl is unable to harvest its DNA to engineer the next generation of weaponised dinosaurs. So, again, adds nothing to the film or to the next dinosaur apocalypse. We also see a new weaponised dinosaur, the Indoraptor, which is later killed off, so won't play any part in the next dinosaur apocalypse. It would have been heaps better if it escaped, outsmarted everyone, laid a heap of eggs, which later hatched and overrun the human population. But, alas, we won't see anything that cool in the next film either. All that happens is: evil capitalist Rafe Spall, sells some dinosaurs (as weapons or exotic animals to hunt and kill), and sends them around the world, which will most likely escape and somehow destroy the world? What the point of all these weaponised dinosaurs if we're not going to see any in the dinosaur apocalypse? So, ultimately, this film adds nothing to the franchise, except human cloning, but I can't see how human cloning will play in part in the next apocalypse; unless we're going to see human / dinosaur hybrids, which sounds crazy to me... This movie deserved much better, if we're heading towards a dinosaur apocalypse, they could have made an amazing film. Rise of the Planet of the Apes was an outstanding movie, and Jurassic World could have been even better. What are apes compared to dinosaurs? However, all we have here is an unimaginative film. Overall, a very disappointing movie; just a lot of running and screaming and dead-end storylines and plots. This one is a wait to see on DVDs...",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

From what I saw in the trailer I did not expect anything from this sequence, I soon realized that it would be a disaster. And it really was. Ridiculous and weak story worthy of a tv movie. Do not these writers really know how to write something real that makes sense? The new characters are boring and uninteresting to the point that you want their death. Jeff Goldblum appears on the scene to say an environmentalist speech (how much lack of imagination).
 In this film the character of Chris Pratt lost his charisma, turning into a stupid white male(It became the new trend). As the character of Bryce Dallas Howard suddenly changed his personality into a dinosaur-loving activist, it sounded so fake and unlikely (Live to feminism). Everything in this walking confusion made me laugh. Good thing I did not spend money on that !!! Hollywood will still continue to produce these mediocre movies ... giving its audience meaningless action and jokes without graces. I miss it when there were movies made with the heart.

Jurassic Park is a movie that is a product for its time as well as an all time classic movie that cant be replicated ever again. and 2018 even though we can long accept that Fallen Kingdom wont measure up to the original, it definitely doesnt even live up to a standard monster movie because thats all it is, a movie with dinosaurs and genetically designed monsters with a beyond far fetch and hard to swallow storyline, beyond dumb dialogue and actions by characters despite the movie trying to have a smart sci fi element, this movie would be lower if it wasnt for the first half where they are on the island and hell is breaking loose, but as shown in the trailer once they come back to civilian life the film takes a nose dive and the ending is just way too weird and just contradicts everything that they were trying to sell.

Clearly it never reaches the quality of the Original Jurassic Park or even previous film J.W., still I enjoyed seeing this in the cinema. 
I can imagine, if you would watch this at home, you would not enjoy it as much as I did. 
The director seems to have trouble making a choice what dinosaurs to show (so he kind of showed every kind he could think of...), also the hero dinosaur keeps shifting in the story (thank god here is T-Rex.... and there is Blue again!). Some shots feature many many dino's (especialy on the Island) ... next shot (beach) nowhere a dino to be seen....Popcorn film, very enjoyable, Starlord is fun to watch, there are dino's what else do you need?I am curious how the story will unfold....",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Again we are hammered with greedy owners who only want to profit by selling the beasts to despicable collectors and the absolute cruelty of a khaki-clad foreman who wants to make a dino-toothed necklace. 
Then there is a mandatory chase/stampede scenes on the island with our heroes narrowing escaping the melee. After that the entire dinosaur collection travels in tight crates in the belly of a transport ship to northern California in about a day and a half from an island in the tropics near central America. 
The beasts survive the cramped trip and arrive at the manor... all healthy and ready to rampage. 
To this movie's credit, the CGI was excellent and the beasts were believable. The acting was so-so.

A bad business man, the obvious threat, the dinosaurs escape, carnage ensues, the evil hunter gets what's coming to him... but in an attempt to break from type a cloned human let's the dinosaurs out. I couldn't cringe any harder than I did at that point.Hollywood has become so desperate that it is obsessed with sequels, prequels, remakes - the imagination engine has well and truly broken down.This isn't a bad film, it's just not good. It definitely isn't worthy of the 10s that some are giving. Anyone giving this a 10 is not a film fan, they are a Jurassic Park fan. It's a solid 5, and most of that is for visual effects.

716,werlingjakob,Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is an Ambitious yet Disappointing Sci-fi Movie that Generates Cheesy Fun,5,3 July 2018,"Both me and my dad both like the Jurassic Park and Jurassic World movies a lot, though my dad probably likes them more than me. And when we both saw Fallen Kingdom, the new entry in the series, I guess we both liked it but I have a slightly different opinion than my dad on the movie. And here is my opinion now: Fallen Kingdom's story is decent. It is somewhat creative yet slightly unoriginal though it also raises some deep questions about how the choices we make about the dinosaurs affect us and the entire world. It was also sometimes shocking as well, (though i thought the twist about the girl was very unnecessary). The acting was okay as well, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were both charismatic in their roles as Owen and Claire. I also liked Jeff Goldblum's appearance too. The special effects and set pieces were great, as usual (which I would like to point out, are usually the only merits movies like these sometimes have). The music was decent, but it was kind of formulaic. This movie does have a couple of decent scares though. It builds up suspense at a good pace and actually packs a couple of good jump scares (most of which involve the Indoraptor at the mansion). The wit and humor was also good as well, best delivered by Pratt's character. Though the action sequences were less so, they were more formulaic and that is what makes the suspense sequences better. Also, Fallen Kingdom at times feels like it doesn't live up to its predecessors or is just an edited version of the 1997 movie The Lost World: Jurassic Park. This all adds up to an ambitious and at times good adventure flick but it also adds up to one adventure flick that is sort of disappointing and unoriginal. But it is still cheesy fun and it has some really good jump-scares. So if you see it, except a nice, schlocky, cheesy, ski-fi adventure flick.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
717,battlecrusadersgames,Worthy addition to the franchise,8,12 June 2018,"Welcome to the latest instalment in what is still the most successful dinosaur movie franchise and with this movie, deservedly so. 
 This time around much of the action is set away from Dino island, because of an imminent Volcano eruption, but all is not as it seems, as our favourite Dino experts are betrayed. 
 There is loads of action in this movie, right from the onset, but there is also many tense scenes, that are intentionally played out long to ramp up tension. One scene in particular i expected the Dino to say; ""herrrre's Johnny.""
 In terms of story, the story may be a little complex, but far from confusing and with a surprising twist, it's a worthwhile sequel, unlike some more recent sequel attempts (""Deadpool 2...cough cough"").
 The acting is once again good, if not up to par with the original cast, but the most talented is the little girl, who has a bright future ahead if she decides to stay in this industry. 
 All of that said, it means nothing if the Dinosaurs aren't up to par, but aside from the dubiously named Indoraptor, the Dino's are amazing and so textured, you can almost feel they are real animals at times. 
 If i have any little gripes, i would say the movie lagged a little in the middle and after watching this in 3D, i would say they didn't use the 3D to it's best, so i'd stick to 2D if i were you, because even then, this is a great film.
It is also a shame to not see some of the beautiful scenery of the other films. Thankfully though, the tense atmosphere this movie creates, is thrilling in itself.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

More environment change would be really nice. And the scene with the Indoraptor and the girl in the bed was like they played Nightmare on Elm Street. This is not supposed to be a horror movie. The Indoraptor acts like a slasher killer.

Yes, I love the standard Jurassic plot formula, of course, however this film looks at the animals more than being killing machines and it pares that perspective with one of the ugliest sides of mankind, the marketing and selling of animals with no consideration or empathy to the animals well being. One scene in movie as the ship was pulling away from the island leaving one Brontosaurus on the shoreline literally brought me to tears.

It is still a far cry from the quality of Jurassic Park and I would still say The Lost World is a better film on the whole, but this movie has some good aspects (mainly during the third act), even though most everything that comes before it is pretty terrible.The first half of this movie starts out rather slow and is basically just a bad remake of The Lost World. They even go as far as to blatantly copy characters from The Lost World (I.E., Ken Wheatley was a total ripoff on Roland). And once the volcano erupts, it's pretty much a Michael Bay Transformers film but with dinosaurs. Everything from the sleazy characters running across the screen with explosions behind them to big CGI monsters fighting each other in the background with noises way louder than need be - all of it screams Michael Bay. The scene where Owen and Claire are trying to get the blood from the T-rex is awful. I am honestly shocked that the first half seems to be a plus for most viewers because I seriously thought it was horrible aside from having a bit more development for Owen and Claire and that one scene where Owen confronts Blue for the first time in three years.The good news, however, is that it gets better as it goes along. They reveal that the whole purpose of selling the Isla Nublar dinosaurs was to fund money for the Indoraptor project and that they need Blue's DNA to experiment on making an Indoraptor capable of obeying human command - a skill that the current prototype lacks. They reveal the prototype Indoraptor during the dinosaur auction - and once he gets out, he's a really cool and scary villain; he even rivals the Big One from the original Jurassic Park for craftiness. So I have to give kudos to J.A. Bayona for creating such a great dinosaur villain. The chase scenes between the Indoraptor and the little girl Maisie and the final battle between Indoraptor and Blue have some great cinematography. The downside is that once the Indoraptor chase is over, it all goes back to being directionless with the release of all the captive dinosaurs and the reveal that Maisie was actually a clone which felt like something the writer(s) made up as they went along.And all in all, it just doesn't leave you with any reason to be excited for a sequel. Unless they introduce another hybrid dinosaur, I probably won't be seeing the sequel myself - but this film was a high note to end on in regards to the Indoraptor, and I feel like it would be difficult to top that character with another hybrid. I still give them credit for trying something different with the third act, as opposed to copying the other Jurassic films.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

It pains me truly to see the direction the movies will now take with the ending of this latest film which only means that we are in store for alot more Hollywood action B movie bonanza based on effects rather than substance , teenage comedy scripts , instead of acting quality and depth of character etc etc . In all honesty even J.P 2 and 3 which could be considered inferior to the original in quality of writing and storytelling , are of oscar quality and acting compared to the new ""re-boot"" of pet dinosaurs being trained like dogs , and comedy acting to hide the fact that there is nothing of any worth left in this once grande statement to movie history .

As a teen, Jurassic world is my favourite as I have fond memories of seeing it in the cinema twice, with it being equally exhilarating the second time!This instalment focuses on the aftermath of the first, with the park being abandoned and a once dormant volcano threatening the dinosaurs existence. Claire (now a dinosaur activist) attempts to convince the court to rescue the dinosaurs, with most people (including an old favourite) in disagreement. In desperation, Claire meets with the leader of the Lockwood estate who agrees to rescue the dinosaurs, but with different intentions to Claire.Claire must then convince Owen to tag along to assist with the capture of blue the velociraptor as she is of great scientific interest. Alongside the duo, two new faces also join the team, a paleovetinarian and an IT wiz.As the dinosaurs are moved to lockwoods estate, the team soon discover the truth from lockwoods granddaughter and must rescue the dinosaurs before they are sold to be used as military weaponry. Alongside new human cast members, there is also a new hybrid creation which is equally terrifying as the indominus Rex! Soon it's running rampant in the estate which leads to some really great scenes!I highly recommend a view if you are a fan of the others.

Bryce Dallas Howard was the catalyst or the bridge you would say to bring chris pratt to the forefront. Little girl mystery I hope would have some say in the next part or I would say its not required.But in general People go to these kind of movies to watch dinosaurs break, burn,tear every thing.

But in no way an excellent plot/(movie in general), that distinguishes it self from other of a simular genre, but it stands to be a respectable movie for what was expected. I feel that these film ""Jurassic World"" is a different point of view that what spielberg invisioned when he started, and thereby important not to relate them that heavily.

738,blende,The Jaws 3-D of the Jurassic Park Franchise,1,30 July 2018,"I cannot Believe the Studio approved this script, let alone Financed the making of this film. What a shame to see the legacy of Spielberg and Michael Crichton so disrespected. The is the Jaws 3D of the franchise. No wonder Sam Neil turned it down. 
Why?.........Let me point out a few reasons.
***Chris Pratt is going through the motions. He's clearly not into this character. His acting is lifeless and his face is pretty much blank most of the time. Even his humor is flat. Not to mention the odd choice by the director to have shots of the actor's faces looking rather uninterested while they stare at supposed horror all around them. 
***Just terrible editing, jumping forward in time, and plot holes the size of a T-Rex
***The heroes steal a truck and jump it onto a ship of bad guys who never even see a truck land on the ship, not to mention who would be driving it. The heroes then spend the remainder of the boat ride making as much noise as possible and playing with dinosaurs and never a single risk of being seen or caught.
***A bad guy who looks just like Jason Sudeikis in glasses. His character so mute and bland that when he finally gets it in the end you feel literally nothing.
***Ted Levine as the great white hunter, once so scary in Silence of the Lambs, is frail, weak, and his dialogue so poorly delivered that is completely incoherent.
***Contrived danger copied from previous installments and a Volcano scene of Chris Pratt running stolen straight from the beginning of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Not only did they tarnish Spielberg's original Jurassic Park, but had to take it a step further and visually plagiarize scenes from his other masterpieces.
***An abrupt ending poorly executed with a Jeff Goldblum voice over as deep and philosophical as a high school locker room.If you watched this and enjoyed it, then you are why movies of substance are rarely being made. 
I'm so glad I didn't pay to see this at the theater. It's a disgrace to the art of filmmaking.

The story, however, was very lacking in emotion and meaningfulness. The action was incredible and fun to watch, but the plot was dumb. As far as story goes, nothing really happens in this movie that hasn't been done before, but the movie shines brightly with the gorgeous cinematography - all to the sound of Michael Giacchino's score, which was one of the best parts of the movie and a lot better than the score to Jurassic World (2015). In summary, this movie excelled with good directing, exciting music, intense action, and extremely beautiful visuals. The movie falls with the poor story and lack of emotion (there were a few emotional scenes, but they had more to do with the direction than the writing). I love the first Jurassic Park movie and I never thought it needed sequels, but this was still enjoyable and it's worth watching if you're looking to have a fun time. Also, I would say I liked The Fallen Kingdom more than Jurassic World, but I wouldn't say it's as good as the original Jurassic Park or even The Lost World.

From there, the rescue begins. But as Owen Grady said during his recruitment, ""what could possibly go wrong."" The action is non-stop, the threats are real. And the T-Rex remains awesome. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom exceeds all expectations, especially when the obvious comparison is to that of Jurassic Park II. John Hammond's vision of the initial Jurassic Park has now evolved fully. To push sequel after sequel something has to be lost for the story to move forward. This time, it was the park/island itself.Back on the mainland, two new dinosaurs made their mark on the franchise. The Indo Rapter and an unnamed dinosaur self titled ""Ramasaurs"". The latter becoming the comic relief while the first becoming the top bid from the arms dealers. One of the more interesting subplots is that of Maisie Lockwood, the granddaughter to John Hammond's former business partner played by James Cromwell.

748,davegfrancis,Just a money grab.,5,22 June 2018,"Not sure who this flick is really targeted at, way too dark for children and adolescents yet so predictable and downright laughable that adults can be nothing but amused and/or perplexed by the lack of intelligence required to enjoy a story this diabolically poor and uninspired. 
For one, rehashing story threads from prior installments is really getting old. Rich guy, hunter, new breed, rag tag heroes, corporate greed, weaponising dinosaurs, emotional animal rights allegory... it's getting tired. 
Secondly, the need to continually call-back shots, particularly of the T-Rex from prior installments (let alone do it numerous times in this one) is also becoming tiresome.
Another continual complaint I have is the stupid situations the lead cast always put themselves in and escape from, particularly the children. It seems that children have a unbelievable ability to avoid being eaten by dinosaurs and I just find it lazy writing to put them into and out of unrealistic situations over and over. A small gripe I also have is that the science is never wrong, any expert in these films always delivers rules of engagement or how to avoid dinosaurs and they are never ever wrong. The relationship with Chris Pratt and blue is also almost as gut churning as the stupid scene in Jurassic 3 with the dino-call whistle used by Sam Neil.
Last of all, the introduction of story elements that have no context or mention in prior installments. I always thought that it was a cheap cop-out to create another island in the sequel (especially when you consider the 7 or so other setups in the original Jurassic that could have been fleshed out... example would be the shaving can of samples given to rival company). So to introduce a partner to Hammond that was never mentioned, let alone the abysmal performance by James Cromwell, is just one too many times in this franchise. 
Could either villains have worse teeth and dialect! (What we're you thinking Rafe Spall and Toby Jones)
I'm assuming the constraints and shackles have now been lifted when you consider the ending, but I fear a prequel with fewer dinos and the creation of the park might be the way the franchise goes.

750,auritone,Plot convenience - The Movie,3,22 June 2018,"I was personally not a fan of the first Jurassic World. I generally found the movie too contrived and simply too silly to take even remotely serious.
Imagine my surprise when I realized that Fallen Kingdom is even worse in that department, and without even close to the charm that the first one at least managed to have.
Fallen Kingdom might as well have been called ""Plot Convenience"" - The Movie.
The entire premise and the first scene hinges on retcons and stupidity, and what tries to pass as a plot just gets worse from there, with everything from laser targeted dinosaurs (no this is not a joke), to a spooky castle (complete with fog), and teleporting characters and dinosaurs. Yes, we have characters and dinosaurs popping up at convenient moments without zero idea of how they even managed to get there. 
This is possibly best described by going back to the original Jurassic Park. Remember when the main characters were surrounded by the raptors, and just as they were ready to attack, the T-Rex showed up? Well, this happens at least four times in this movie. AT LEAST FOUR TIMES!!!!
This is the movie in its entirety.
Movies are supposed to try to suspend disbelief (something Jurassic Park managed to do quite well), but Fallen Kingdom seems to go out of its way to confirm our disbelief, by having humans and animals behave in ways that simply makes no sense what so ever.
Movies like this is an insult to basic intelligence and competent writing.
The only reason I do not rate it lower is because there are a few short scenes that work, and at times some excellent cinematography, but none of it saves this utter waste of money and time.

752,maaa-51935,I was expecting the worst..,8,11 September 2018,"..after seeing the trailers. I lost all hope for this franchise, and I felt disgusted.
Well, surprise surprise..after seeing the movie(of course I had to), I dare to say I actually rank it second only to the original Jurassic Park.
Somehow all the plot holes (the biggest one being the fact that it turns out the original Park was ""ingeniously"" built on an island that is basically a massive active volcano peak above the ocean), and ridiculous sequences (the girl manages to escape and locks herself in a room, then jumps into bed of all places, then waits for the monstrous dino to crawl inside slowly through the window and onto the bed itself. This is followed by the Chris Pratt character busting into the room, and after unsuccessful attempt to tase the beast, standing still right next to an open door and staring into it while it slowly recovers..in other words, doing absolutely nothing a person in such situation should do)... somehow it all fades under the sheer cinematic brilliance and a number of superb scenes and sequences, some of the best in the whole series - the dinosaur stampede in front of volcanic eruption, Chris's paralysed character getting licked by the ceratopsian and getting exposed to lava, the collective fall off the cliff, the whole idoraptor chase sequence etc. There are some moments of pure superbly styled gothic horror, marvelously visualized and with qenuine care for detail.
Last but not least..the CGI effects are, at long last, PERFECT. They were the worst part of the worst movie in the franchise, The Jurassic World. 
But this time they finally did it right and made me genuinely impressed. 
It is the first time the CGI creatures left a convincing, realistic impression of musculature, mass, momentum, texture and movement. 
The final scene where raptor and indoraptor fall together is a triumph of simulated physics engine.
Granted I'm a geek and maybe this matters to me more than to the average movie goer, but the quality of the visual effects itself is a big deal here, and is a true landmark moment. 
It must not be overlooked.Overall, a movie with silly premise and some large plot holes, but a brilliantly filmed, entertaining movie that really kept me engaged and brought suprising amount of awe.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

758,vincent_tillema,Welcome to Jurassic World,7,8 June 2018,"As a longtime, hardcore Jurassic fan it's hard to be completely objective when it comes to these movies. Or to refrain from going into too many details for that matter. It might also be difficult to please a fan like me and for it to be all too easy to disappoint me. 
Let's just go to that straight away: Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom didn't disappoint me. The Jurassic series is in a bit of a weird position. The Park series and the World series are sort of similar, all take place in the same universe with shared characters, themes and plot points...and yet they're also completely different beasts. World at times feels like what would happen if directors less capable than Spielberg would adapt Crichton's Jurassic Park novel. They're different takes on things we've seen before. Sometimes better. Sometimes worst. Overall they're still fun rides, even though they never reach that stellar level of the first Jurassic Park. The question is: do they need to? Even Spielberg himself couldn't surpass the first movie and we must not forget JP was a milestone in moviemaking that was truly new in terms of immersion due to realistic CGI. Recapturing what made JP great is almost recapturing the entire context of it.So where JW imitated JP to entertaining but sometimes silly and campy degrees, Fallen Kingdom (FK) imitates The Lost World for the most part. But: it does manage to be a lot more refreshing that JW was and does have its own identity. There are plenty of references to the granddaddy of the series. Unlike in JW they're fairly subtle this time around and maybe will only be noticed by hardcore fans. For instance, when the new character Zia (Daniella Pineda) first sees a dinosaur she sees a brachiosaurus. Sounds familiar? And then there are plenty of little things like dinosaurs taking on iconic poses from JP and even The Lost World that go by so fast you might miss them. FK is fairly light on story. There are plenty of points that feel illogical but mostly the movie doesn't give you time to think about the wrongs. What is there in terms of story isn't bad however. Its serviceable I guess. There is some debate on how the dinosaurs are now victims instead of villains...but they've always been that in a way. They were never supposed to be there in the first place as in the first movie already discusses. Emphasizing that in FK really was the only way to go I think. And, in a time where we're struggling with genetics to prevent the northern white rhino from going extinct, are working on reverse engineering chickens to dinosaurs and planning to recreate mammoths, FK asks the question: should we even prevent extinction and if so: aren't those animals then free to live outside of cages? And: who is to decide on that? The latter might cause some facepalms from what I read in other reviews but I thought it was a clever thing to do. Bits of such moral dilemmas are sprinkled throughout FK. The real show stealer is J.A. Bayona however who truly knows how to make dinosaurs scary again. His use of light and dark results in many amazing plays with shadow and builds tension when we see dinosaurs stalking unsuspecting humans. He heavily relies on animatronics which make the Indoraptor but many of the close ups look believable and intimidating. That's something the series hasn't had in a long time. Bayona just knows how to frame a shot. If you liked the T-rex escape and kitchen scenes from JP and the Rex attack on the RV and 'Tall grass' scenes from TLW you're in for a treat here. Bayona takes that darker style and slight sense of suspence and cranks it up a notch. This results in one of the best opening scenes in the series for instance. The acting is also serviceable, nothing amazing but not bad or distracting. 
Look: FK is not without its flaws. As I said: there are plot holes, some characters don't really work that well and it might be a bit more depending on taste movies and genres than other movies in the series. There's always something bigger to rescue characters from the big dino and the humor is hit and miss. But that's something to expect from a World movie: more silliness, more extremes. Expect that and you're good. Expect Jurassic Park and you'll be disappointed. 7.5/10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

You can almost sit with your Spielberg movie checklist and fill it in with this one- sassy scientist, wimpy techie, anyone in a suit is bad, big game hunter helpers cant be trusted, soaring overhead scenic shots (two almost in a row at the front of the film), precocious spunky kid who knows dinos, timely dino saves when things look bad. On that last one, there needs to be a dino hybrid called the Deux Machinasaurus. 
 With regard to the little kid, that tiny subplot (and, the character, sorry) could have be left out. She only seems to be there because Spielberg wants a kid in every film, whether they're needed or not. 
Visually, it is great, total eye candy. By now the CGI animals really do seem to have weight, total kudos to the people who do that work. Applause. 
Jeff Goldblum as the voice of reason in the before and after was a nice callback to the first movies. (C'mon, Jeff, open your shirt and pose on the table, just for fun)

It was such a lazy, cynical, cliche, SyfY level remix of one of my favorite films of all time.There are some things that Fallen Kingdom does better than it's predecessor. The action is better, the cinematography actually looks like a theatrical film rather than low budget straight to video junk. And the pacing is better...well at least its faster. The problem with Jurassic World was that the first 45 minutes were really slow and boring. The problem with Fallen Kingdom is it moves waaay too fast. The rescue mission on the exploding island, which was advertised as being the bulk of the film, is over in the first 30 minutes. The film then very suddenly becomes a different film. A film about weapinizing dinosaurs and selling them to the highest bidder. Then the film just becomes a basic monster in the house chase movie. There's 3 different movies in this movie and none of them are given the proper time to develop into anything. This movie is just a collection of half-baked, unexplored ideas. The film raises philosophical and ethical questions to give the appearance of depth and then doesn't ever address them again. The movie is basically just half-assedly recycling themes from black mirror and calling that intelligent. The film also reuses just about every iconic shot and moment from every previous Jurassic Park, but not in a way that's exciting or enjoyable, it just feels lazy.

In addition, I thought Hunger Games: Catching Fire was the best film in the entire series. Also, The Dark Knight is the best in Nolan's Batman trilogy. So there are instances where the sequels are better or at least equally as good. Unfortunately, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, is not one of those cases. It's good. It's action-packed. It's got comedic Chris Pratt scenes. Jeff Goldblum is in it, briefly. And it's got the dinosaurs! But it feels like it is a bridge film that needed to be made so we can get the third one. The first half of the film is our traditional island of extinct creatures that reek havoc, while the second half of the film is man foolishly bringing those dinosaurs to the city and we get our very own Godzilla AKA Indoraptor vs. Giant Mansion. The whole film was made just so we could get the last five minutes. Granted, you may not realize that until the film ends. I watched the whole film thinking it was a mediocre sequel, only to leave the theatre deciding it was an entertaining segue between introducing the ""successful"" theme park where current society could learn about a past world and the infamous end result that Goldblum's Dr. Malcolm has been talking about since the very first film. It is the idea of if you bring them back, you upset the balance, and eventually, the dinosaurs will rule again. There's the line: ""God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates man. Man destroys God. Man creates dinosaurs. Dinosaurs eat man--"" and the last line is originally ""Woman inherets the earth"" but I think this film suggests the truth is ""Dinosaurs take back the earth.""  In this film, it has been three years since the Indominous Rex destroyed the theme park and now the volcano is going to destroy the island. Claire (Howard) and some of her colleagues, tech-guy/whinybutt Franklin (Justice Smith) and dinovet Zia (Daniella Pineda), are trying to raise enough money to save the dinosaurs from their inevitable second extinction. Enter Mr. Mills (Rafe Spall) and his boss, Hammond's co-creator, Lockwood (James Cromwell) who fund Claire's trip back to the island with Owen (Pratt) to rescue Blue the raptor and several ""all the other dinosaurs""--but it's a TRAP! Turns out Mills just wants several species so he can sell them off and they needed Owen to get Blue. This films goes from another Jurassic Park film to an Endagered Animal Auction. Imagine if you will, staring from the hidden confines of a military truck securly placed on a boat back at a brontosaurus staring back at you through smock and lava, crying out and then suddenly all you can see is their silhouette as they are covered in smoke and debris before falling down dead. It's a cry-worthy moment to watch nearly all of the dinosaurs die again. Most Jurassic Park films have dinosaurs trying to kill the humans, and succeeding, but the underlying message is they were extinct and we brought them back. There have been a few scenes (Sam Neill's character trying to heal the sick triceratops in Jurassic Park and Owen/Claire comforting the dying brontosaurus after the I-Rex mauled her) where we feel empathy for the dinosaurs. Not many, but a few. However, what I do love about this film is there are many more scenes where we feel empathy for them and we remember they are creatures/animals with the same thoughts and emotions as us. Yes, I know, I'm a big softy. Though I understand why the film takes place in a mansion in California, it is still ""too weird"" to take seriously and truly be scared. I mean, imagine a large dionsaurs traipsing across the roof, crashing through hallways, and using it's nail to turn the latch on the balcony window and walk in...it's just too disjoining from the isolation of ""we're all alone, trapped on an island with dinosaurs""--which is where half the scare-factor came into play in the first couple films. Then again, part of why I might not have liked those scenes as much is simply because it brought back one of my childhood classic nightmares. The scene in question is where our child screamer Maisie (Lockwoods ""granddaughter""), hides under her covers and the Indoraptor opens her window, walks through, and looms over her. When I was five I accidentally saw Jurassic Park, meaning my teenage cousin was babysitting and let me watch it, which my parents resented him for when I started screaming and having nightmares. I lived in a one-story house with a bedroom that faced the street, with a large window I could have climbed through easily. After watching the first film, I was convinced that the T-Rex was going to smash through my window and eat me out of my bed, and there was nothing my parents could do to change my mind, except for dad sleeping on the trundle next to me, in between me and the window--so the T-Rex would eat him first. You've seen ""Indoraptor"" a few times and unless you've seen the film, you're likely guessing at what that is--it's this films new scary dinomonster. It's a mix of the velocirapter and the Indominous Rex (which was already part raptor)...however, while the I-Rex was playing and exploring her surroundings, I-Rap is having fun tricking humans before tearing them to pieces. Simply put, the dinomonster from the first Jurassic World was more T-Rex with the stomp and chomp, while this new dinomonster is more vicious, intelligent predator. Curtesy of Dr. Henry Wu (Wong) who is back as our very own Dr. Frankenstein, cursed with his god-complex and desire to create and control life. The idea of life brings us to the wonderful Jeff Golblum and his character, Dr. Ian Malcolm, who makes a framing cameo in the film--only appearing in the very beginning and the very end, as our narrator and doomsday sayer. He provides our on-the-nose line of ""it really is a jurassic world"" and reminds us of the chaos theory and how ""life finds a way"", which then is the theme of the whole film, and is then our warning at the end of the film to foreshadow the third film in the trilogy. I think this also plays into the popular tagline of the film, ""the park is gone"". The use of the word ""park"" suggests amusement and play and not-taking-it-seriously. To say the ""park is gone"" suggests that there's no more play, this is real, this is dangerous, and you can't take it back. I actually do hope the third film gets made, because even if I didn't like this film as much as the first one, I still love the concept of Jurassic Park, and I still am intrigued by the idea of what will inevitably come next after this film. SPOILERS, DON'T READ ANY MORE UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN THE FILMOR DO NOT CARE............................The ending where all the dinosaurs are going to die from poisonous gas if they are not set free echos the scene earlier where we watch all the dinosaurs die who were left on the island. It is just as heartbreaking and cry-worthy, but with a more bittersweet ending. They're set free and we're glad because we didn't want to watch them die, but now they're lose on California. Then again, it is very poetic how they are set free. The little clone girl becomes a mass murderer when she lets them out, but then again, since she's a clone too, it is fitting.Learning that Maisie was actually a clone of Lockwood's daughter, and that he cloned the first human, actually made me enjoy the film even more. Lockwood wanting his daughter back and breaking the laws of humanity is why he and Hammond had a falling out, because it is suggested that Hammoned only wanted to clone dinosaurs to educate people, not as test subjects for human experimentation. I do like the implications that this now means we have the ability to create actual clones, because Maisie seems to be a success. On the other hand, I feel that is an entirely different story that does not truly fit with our Jurassic storyline. I feel the only true reason we need Maisie to be a clone is so that the clone sets the other clones free, because she is the only one who can truly understand what they're going through. She was dead and brought back when she should not have been, and now all of California and probably America is going to pay the price. I'm looking forward to seeing what comes next.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

769,bsilbor,Solid summer blockbuster with a couple small things that could have been improved on.,8,13 July 2018,"I enjoyed this movie as much, if not more than, its predecessor. It has a lot of plot points that are blatantly copied from The Lost World: Jurassic Park, but they were presented in a way that felt new. And hey, if it ain't broke, don't fix it I guess. It had great action, awesome set pieces, a frightening volcanic eruption, and the return of the classic cautionary tale aspect of the franchise. This movie did a very good job examining the potential and ungodly power of genetic technology and threw in the question of: ""Do we let this abomination, this rape of the natural world die? Or do we keep it alive?"" The deepening of the parental connection between Owen and Blue, and the consequences of their companionship, is also a step up from the last one. Claire's character development was also a step up, having been a corporate workaholic in the first one. She is now a dinosaur rights activist who believes that these animals should be saved from the erupting volcano.There are two things that felt lackluster to me, however. The first one being the Indoraptor. It felt like another Indominus Rex, but a bit smaller and with a different name. It also apparently responds to laser pointers and sonic attack signals...okay, fine, I don't care, I just want that Mills guy to die painfully for killing poor elderly Lockwood and auctioning off the dinosaurs for money. The second problem I had was with the weird twist that Maisie was a clone of Lockwood's daughter and not actually Lockwood's granddaughter. I get that the dino's were clones and it would make sense that they could do the same thing with humans, but it felt unnecessary, especially since there was no real payoff for the twist. Maybe they're trying to set something up for the next sequel, I don't know.All in all it was a fun movie and Chris Pratt was as loveable as ever. Bryce Dallas Howard had some good character development from the last one, and the other characters were fun. Watching the computer analyst scream at everything was funny, too. The end leaves a lot open and it's going in an interesting direction. I wonder where they'll take the series now that the Isla Nublar is destroyed.8/10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

773,christopher-m-collins,So many things just don't make sense,3,14 July 2018,"So many things just don't make sense that I just can't like this movie as hard as I tried. There are some cute callbacks to previous films which I liked, and the action sequences are suspenseful. The film CGI is convincing and the movie is generally exciting, but it lacks quality writing and good storytelling.Dinosaurs bred to be super smart and strong but they can't break through a fake tree in a diorama?? Cyanide gas filling a chamber of dinosaurs in cages. The HVAC system isn't working. The answer to save the dinosaurs? Open the cages AND open the big doors that lead to the outside. Why not just open the doors and let the fresh air in? No need to open the cages and let the dinosaurs out. A bone from a dinosaur that was sitting at the bottom of the ocean for years but still has viable DNA in it... When they obtain it they have to carry it around in a special glass case with a red light shining on it as if it somehow now fragile after years at the bottom of the ocean! There are weird unanswered plot holes. Character arcs abruptly end, such as the caretaker for the girl who appears to be maybe her mother who doesn't even seem upset or shed a tear when she finds out that Lockwood is dead. Why doesn't she care? Even if she's just an employee she's worked for him for many years! 11 species of dinosaur get released into the world, and rather than put all the government resources towards rounding them up, we just have to accept that hey I guess we now live with dinosaurs in the wild? Give me a break! Of course the government would find a way to get all these dinosaurs back in captivity. The characters are very flat in this movie as well. The villains are super evil, the business people all look creepy and borderline offensively stereotypical. I love science-fiction and I love fresh ideas, but this movie just stretch his credibility so far it makes me sad. Jurassic Park was my favorite movie of all time, and I have enjoyed several of the sequels. This one however is terrible.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

782,aakinz,Get what you expect from the Jurassic saga,9,23 June 2018,"25 years ago we witnessed a never seen before movie masterpiece from Steven Spielberg with full of surprises and thrills which took us back 65 million years. It's almost impossible to make sequel to give the same excitement. But fans just wants to see more of it and I'm glad we're getting it.Fallen Kingdoms story is pretty much revealed in the trailer. To be honest it was an exciting and enjoyable ride. I thought the first half was excellent, the whole island getting destroyed by the volcano was showed well as well as showing all the animals we want to see. Also it made me feel sad to see the beloved animals getting killed in the catastrophe, especially the scene when the ship departs island and a helpless Brachiosaurus looks at them from the edge of the dock with entire island behind her on fire. It was moving.The rest of the story is typical, rich international co-operates trying to make money at the expense of living things, which was not as good as the first half, but decent enough to watch. Thanks to some funny moments, good performances especially by that little girl, raptor Blue and good CGI. They've clearly tried to show respect to the original series and as well as satisfying the fans.Overall, super first half , awesome GCI and a visual treat. The story could have been better. Unlike other movies where we saw dinosaurs only here and there, in this one you see them almost in very scene. In Jurassic world its all about the what you see (can I say I enjoyed it far more than Black Panther).",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
783,b2280545,The Chaos Theory Proves Correct,6,3 July 2018,"Set three years after the events of 2015's Jurassic World, Isla Nublar, the island that was the site for both Jurassic Park and Jurassic World, is on the verge of destruction as it's volcano becomes active threatening the island's remaining dinosaur species. Owen Grady and Claire Dearing, who witnessed the devastating fall of Jurassic World, are tasked with over-seeing the salvation of the dinosaurs. Among the species that are in need of saving is Blue, the last living raptor trained by Owen since infancy. The island becomes ash in a CGI mind-blowing spectacle but Owen and Claire soon discover upon saving the prehistoric creatures a conspiracy that leads them to a mysterious estate where they uncover a dark secret underway.So Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom is the fifth entry in the Jurassic Park franchise, a franchise that falls under the category of a studio that uses it's property merely for the intention of obtaining an instant cash grab rather than creating something special in film history. It is also a case where fans of the original Jurassic Park from 1993 feel as though every sequel to the original is not only a waste of time and energy but an offense to that original. Indeed 1993's Jurassic Park earns the title of legend, being a film that impacted the film industry upon release for it's ground-breaking special effects, terror aspect, brilliant cast, music, beautiful backgrounds etc. and twenty-five years later it doesn't fall short of the masterpiece that it is. The franchise's sequels have been decent over the years. 1997's The Lost World is memorable for bringing back the franchise's most popular character getting the spotlight and contained brilliant action scenes (T-Rex rampaging through San Diego anyone?) and possessed the same dark sinister tone as the original. 2001's Jurassic Park 3 contained some of the most brutal moments in the whole franchise but didn't quite live up to the same level of epic as the original or even the Lost World did. Then the franchise was revived about a decade later with Jurassic World released in 2015 which managed to bring back everything fans of the original Jurassic Park loved about the film with a new brilliant twist to it through the creation of the Indominus Rex. Although some would disagree, Jurassic World was able to introduce us to new characters to the franchise and we were given enough time with these new characters enough to care for them to the end. With Fallen Kingdom on the other hand, this was not the case. Every new character added for this movie unfortunately was so flat and one dimensional as characters that never once did they produce a spark of interest. Apart from the lack of interest factor, each character's actions and decisions were predictable and frankly the opposite of intelligent. That said, the entire premise of Jurassic Park from the beginning was proven to be an unintelligent creation on John Hammond and his scientist's part. In their defense, there was no way of knowing for sure the disaster Jurassic Park/World would become. The problem is repeating the same amount of stupidity can be just as harmful as repeating similar themes from past film entries. In this film, we get another genetically modified dinosaur creation that first of all feels less of a cinematic impact than the Indominus Rex and second of all is nothing more than a horror film villain in disguise as a caged animal. This destroys the purpose to what made Jurassic Park such a unique film and that was for it's portrayal of it's prehistoric antagonists as aggressive living things who have no idea what century their in and will defend themselves violently if necessary as Ellie Sattler from the first movie put it perfectly. The dinosaurs were always trying to survive the 21st century from the beginning just as the humans were trying to survive against them when stuck on the island. It was a fight for survival on both sides but this never made the dinosaurs evil. They were creatures who were as scared as the humans were of them. It was one thing with Indominus in the first Jurassic World which brilliantly brought something new and creative to the franchise but now this new genetic hybrid delivers a feeling of sinister dread that it's as though the writers are trying to depict the dinosaurs as ""evil"". The dinosaurs always possessed a great intelligence before but the way this film carries itself out gives viewers the nervous chill they get when experiencing a horror flick than a dinosaur/nature thriller at times. The film suffers from an underdeveloped scenario as well. The first half of the film takes place on the island itself and the rest at a dark mansion (classic horror film setting) that makes us viewers feel as uncomfortable as the characters.On a bright note, Jeff Goldblum returns as Ian Malcom from the first two Jurassic Park films though his role in the film is sadly reduced. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard return and sadly despite good performances weren't able to save the film from falling short nor were they as convincing as they were in the first Jurassic World. The writers definitely should have improved their story arcs. It can become difficult for a franchise to produce new ground-breaking material that will appeal to audiences when it's prime was it's triumphant stage. Hope is not entirely lost for the Jurassic World films as it's next sequel is set for a 2021 release date. Fans of the series will be very excited for more thrills and one on one dino battles and visuals. This is what earns Fallen Kingdom credit for it's entertainment value, visuals (even though to this day the original Jurassic Park's visuals are more stunning) and action. This review may have felt as more of a film rant of bad story telling. It was simply difficult to believe this was the best they could give fans after the success that was 2015's Jurassic World. Overall it did accomplish what it set out to be as an entertaining popcorn thrill ride. Piece of advise for the writers: drop the genetic hybrids and bring back the dinosaurs. They should remember what Lowery said in the first Jurassic World about what made the original Jurassic Park so great and that is they had dinosaurs, real dinosaurs.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

So going into Fallen Kingdom, I was worried.Firstly I think the movie had potential; the cinematography was pretty good and the lead actors are good in other stuff. Unfortunately their characters in these films are dull and 1 dimensional. There motives for doing what they' doing change from movie to movie and even sometimes scene to scene.The action sequences were boring and the tension felt really forced when compared to Jurassic Park for example.A side character who was there for comic relief was absolutely unbearable and I was shocked that we got a character like that in this film.The reason this movie exists became obvious by the time the credits rolled.

793,ustheman,Jurassic Fun,10,8 June 2018,"Let's take into account this is 5th film of the franchise. There is so much you can do and stretch story wise. Considering this, the film plays relatively well. As a JP fan of the original it kills me to see the obsession of over the top CGI. This area is where it let me down the most, there were some aspect where animatronic and CGI was well executed and some scenes it looked rushed or unbelievably fake. Nevertheless it was still an ejoyable ride. It is one of the few ""Family Friendly"" movies that are coming out these days. It has the action coolness and has the emotion feels for drama. If you are a JP fan you will love it, if you are a casual movie goer you will find it decent watch but if scientific inaccuracies and movie logic bothers you this film you will hate. Action (8/10): over all amazing, two sets of action from explosive to thrilling. Times unrealistic but amazing to look at. A lot of animatronics in this film which is great for the soul of the scene. Acting (7/10): Nothing great or anything that stood out to be Oscar worthy. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas-Howard were the only stand outs. The rest of the cast was forgettable. Oh and ""Blues"" character was enjoyable to watch aswell.Story (6/10): Only season story has an average rating is because everything was revealed in the trailers/promos/tv-spots. As a fan I watched all of those so hence story wise I wasn't blown away but still it was decent enough to keep you interested in the moment. Plus it's also the 5th film in the franchise. Sound (10/10): I had the joy of experiencing this in a Dolby Atmos cinema. While Dolby Atmos Cinemas essentuates sounds of all movies, you can tell if the movie has been produced in a Dolby Atmos sound mix. The surround sound effects in the third act were brilliant and made the dino scenes terrifying.Feels (10/10): This movie dealt with a lot of emotions. Not on a human side but from a dinosaur perspective. This movie gave the dinosaurs character and soul. This is what you want from a dino movie.

The dinosaur inhabited island where all the Jurassic Park movies and the last Jurassic World movie took place is going to be destroyed completely by the active volcano which will annihilate any living thing.The current owner of the dinosaurs devises a plan to get all sorts of species off the island before it blows. Specifically he wants Blue, the velociraptor from the previous film. The only way he can track and capture Blue is by convincing Owen (Chris Pratt) to go to the island and help. The only person who could convince Owen to come is his ex Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard).This is where the movie gets silly.
Owen, Claire and their team of comic relief characters who are highly irritating and irrelevant to the plot jump on a plane the next morning, track down Blue, and get betrayed by the owner's men and left to die all before the volcano erupts. Before getting blown up the team is able to sneak onto the ship carrying Blue and 11 other dinosaur species back to where all of this started. At Dr. Hammond's estate. It's Owen and Claire's mission to stop whatever plans the owner of these dinosaurs has in store for the shipment of dinosaurs on the ship they're hiding away on.Other Thoughts
I'd say one thing this film did good was paying little homages to all the other Jurassic movies. Here is a list of 23. But this positive is also a negative. One of the reasons why I got so bored was because the movie was so reminiscent of the old ones. There was nothing new here.Final Thoughts
Not so surprising to say there is a third Jurassic World movie planned for 2021. After what I saw today I don't think there's too many new things they can bring to the series to make it original. So I'm not dying to see the next installment. PS. I loved Jeff Goldblum's Monologues both at the beginning and end of the film. He's always been my favorite character in this series.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
801,kubapawlowski,Fallen Franchise,5,5 July 2018,"The first film in this brand new franchise was an alright blockbuster summer time film. Continuing from that we have Fallen Kingdom, where we go to the island to rescue the dinosaurs from a volcano. The actual island scene where the volcano erupts in this film was actually really good, it had the stakes the excitement and fun I wished the entire film would have. Instead the film really brings itself down with the addition of two new characters who can only be described as ""quirky"" and apart from that one exciting volcano scene the film felt tragically slow.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

807,iamarnold,FALLEN KINGDOM,9,8 June 2018,"A million years ago, Dinosaurs faced extinction and nobody was there for them. Jurassic Park gave them a second chance. Three years after it's shut down, a new team is recruited to rescue the remaining species in the Isla Nubler island. And this time these creatures find their savior in human greed. The opening scene itself gave a lot of nostalgic vibes. Jurassic World 2 is contained with a lot from Jurassic Park trilogy. It's impossible for a fan to miss those. There are many moments that extensively feel like throwbacks from Jurassic Park movies.
Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard again proved to be a fantastic cast. 
But for a sequel, you expect something larger. Fallen Kingdom's huge canvas became narrow as the story carried on. This time you're not getting a mega dino adventure but the movie is as thrilling as it's precursors. 
Maybe because I grew up watching practical dinosaurs, I find some of the CGI shots very sluggish and weird. Making a creature with the use of computer is a mammoth task and they still haven't found the proper formula. The effects of raptor are terrifically puppeteer-ed. The volcanic eruption is brilliantly choreographed. 
The narrative was very much drawn to the use of music. The climax portion has some intense rhythms to up the tension. The thing is they can make ten other Jurassic movies about dinosaurs running unleashed and I'll happily sit and watch all of them. I love Dinosaurs.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Maybe your kids would love it, but nothing left for me. I would like to start, the film has no element of surprise, seems every moment was re-use and recycle.The main plot could tell you, Bayona can't deliver a new premise, something fresh, instead he try to mix up everything. The volcano scene was nice,but escorting a dino to a city? secret-bio technology weapon development? im pretty sure that you had enough with this kind of plot.
line of cast, well Chris Pratt did a lovely job, but tell me again how do you like him if you have Jeff Goldblum before.
The only great thing from this movie was CGI, and the rest like i told you, it should end",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
809,athlbr3,A Film Truly Deserving of the Title 'Jurassic World',8,22 June 2018,"I love this film and think that it does a fantastic job that transitions from the end of the Jurassic Park world (which includes the first Jurassic World film) into the dawn of Jurassic World, where dinosaurs have been set loose on the wider ecosystem by one person's unilateral decision.The director has done a great job in taking the consequences and ramifications of genetically engineering extremely dangerous lifeforms to their logical conclusions, which is why it is so satisfying when Stiggy flings the arms dealers, megalomaniacs, and other piles of protoplasm that should babe been ripped out of wombs with coat-hangers in their fetus stages like ragdolls and the Indoraptor finishing almost all of the rest of the vile scum.There are two scenes in this film that make me pretty emotional. The first one is of course when the Brachiosaurus cried out her last set of anguished breaths as she is slowly consumed by molten lava while the main characters watch helplessly from the ship they are boarded on; and the second one is watching baby Blue and her sisters empathising and bonding with their trainer/father figure Owen. Baby Blue is just so damn adorable that it should be illegal, which is why it is a little sad when Blue decides to reject Owen's offer of security and venture out on her own into the Californian wilderness.While it is great (not the best word to use, but the action undertaken is necessary) that Claire is able to put aside her guilt and sympathy for the dinosaurs trapped in the gas chamber (lol) in favour of the security of the larger ecosystem, and I also understand that Maisie's action is necessary to set up the third installment of the franchise, I find it inconceivable that Zia and Franklin just watch her unilaterally change human history forever without any resistance or protest. While I can cognitively understand her emotional solidarity with the dinosaurs since they were all artificially created, no rational person can condone her action since she has now put innocent lifeforms at risk on a faulty premise. Two irresponsible acts do not make a right one. I would have firmly made the decision to let the dinosaurs die because the alternative is worse, all the while accepting the burden of committing a necessary evil.I think it is very possible that Maisie is part velociraptor herself. She is extremely intuitive and smart, more so than other kids of her age bracket, has great predator-like movements, loves to hide and scare her ""prey"" like the raptors do, and attracts the unhealthy fixation from the indoraptor. The girl has obviously been through a lot in the film, but her solo and emotional decision to set dinosaurs loose on the general ecosystem is going to get her a lot of hate from a lot of people (and rightly so I will argue), and that's on top of the fact that her personhood is illegal under Californian law, as she was created as a clone rather than naturally.Overall this is a great film and deserves far better than the shitty 52% Metacritic score. I cannot wait for the next installment of this very solid franchise.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

The only thing that bothers me is how much ""Blue"" is made out to be so special. I mean he basically was wanting to eat Chris Pratt in the last one, and now he's his long lost best friend.

You can say. The Trailer of the Movie showed in core the BEST of the whole Movie. Rest you can complete forget.
Jeff Goldblum recieved a nice side Role, close to Cameo, what could had been complete cutted away. For the Story simple way, as they needed to get time filled or simple the Character name in. What ever. He was deffinetly not needed inside this Movie.Then, the whole movie screams out to be a kind of bit overworked story of Jusrassic Park 2 and 3.
Extreme too much Chris Prat. Whas here a problem of Possible Budget cuts? That over 80 % of the story was Prat her, Prat there... .
The Island Rescue... come on... was that meant as Joke or really that way? About Travel on the Island, one road driving, some dino camshots, computer room and Bang... "" Days of Dino Capture work "" done in feeld 5 minutes. And oo wow run run, the Vulcan blows up like nothing... without warning sensors and such things at a Island computer controll system, what was equipped State of art with about everything... .

Last time the Travel Back was Guarded by a fully high armed and in fully alarm Navy Fleet.

817,jah9000,Form Over Function,7,28 June 2018,"The best thing to see here is the progress made in animating dinosaurs with believable screen impact. Observe the fine details, the lighting, and the compositing - all top notch, and an advancement from even the previous Pratt/Howard feature.The main storyline was formulaic. The three ""bosses"" were fairly drab. Ted Levine's talent was largely wasted by the screenplay. His character, Wheatley, was a greedy idiot. He went around dumbly threatening people and griping about his pay. He must have said something about his bonus at least three separate times. He's the lead henchman, and his demise is easymode, even corny, given the franchise's history of stunning bad guy deaths.The tier two boss, Eli Mills, is a cookie cutter corrupt and greedy money manager who has set about scheming to create an illicit dinosaur black market in the very residence of his employer and benefactor. It's a stupid plan, especially considering the fact that the foundation spent who knows how many millions on a private island upon which to house dinosaurs. Either that was a big lie, or the scheme is ridiculous, in terms of a cash motive. (Another goofy thing: This weird auctioneer, Eversol, played by Toby Jones, scoffs at the idea of a dinosaur auction because of s few hours delay in shipment of the animals... and acts as if his buyers will take their business elsewhere... as if there's some competition in the dinosaur breeding market. But then all of a sudden he's super on board and slinging prose about the animals as if he'd spent two years writing the catalogue.)Anyway... Mills... straight out of the limp villain handbook. Greedy, treacherous, no regard for human life, justifies his own evil by accusing everyone else of equal evil, and dies more or less insignificantly, but at least with decent screen impact. (Ripped apart by competing carnivores.)Final Boss, the Indo Raptor. Yawn. Not really menacing. Characters never really seemed to be in any danger, and they even had Claire Dearing climb with a claw-inflicted leg wound up onto a roof while wielding a rifle just to demonstrate how generally harmless the monster was. You just know it's going to die because the entire film has telegraphed the formula from the first few minutes onward. So, you're never worried about the characters, and the action loses impact.Aside from the main story, there's a pointless side story. Dr. Lockwood cloned his daughter. ZOMG! No one actually cares, because this has nothing to do with anything at all. Maisie is a completely unnecessary character, as is her subplot unnecessary. It only serves to motivate the girl, at the end of the flick, to release a bunch of dinosaurs into the continental United States because they deserve to live, they were ""created, just like me..."" Sure, little girl. Untold numbers of human beings should die in grisly ways because you were made in a lab. Jeff Goldblum is in the movie, doing nothing and serving no purpose. His tedious character testifies before Congress. And that's it. It was entertaining enough, though. Cool action, especially the volcanic island sequences. See it if only for the effects/spectacle.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
818,ricemuscle,Ignore the negative. Best sequel by far,10,11 June 2018,"Do not expect Jurassic park. It's a sequel. They will never give you a Jurassic park level movie again. This movie was an amazing sequel. 
I enjoyed Jurassic world but it was very ridiculous at times and very much geared for kids. This movie is much darker, much more graphic and pulls at your heart strings. There is one sub plot that is a disgrace to the franchise and I am pretending it never happened. That being said, this was the best the dinos have ever looked. They did what jp did mixing rain and darkness with cgi and animatronics. I hate too much cgi but the cgi was outstanding. Part of the plot I didn't like as much but it wasn't too bad. The actors and characters were much better than JW. the kid wasn't obnoxious and I actually believed she was scared unlike the last movie. The pacing was great, the bad guys were very good at making you hate them. I only watched the first trailer and am very glad. There were so many moments I didn't see coming that the trailers would have ruined. If you go in KNOWING this is a 2018 action blockbuster and not the original then you won't be disappointed. Realistically for me jurassic park is a 10. It's my favorite movie. Lost world is a 7.5 and would have been higher if the last 30 min wasn't so terrible. Jurassic park 3 is a 5. It was awful. Jurassic world is a 7 and this is an 8. There's a few things that could have been done better but I will def see this movie 5 times once it actually comes to theatres here. I watched it on fire stick. The people who say it's bad are ridiculous. It's a sequel. It's not Jurassic park but it's a fantastic sequel with a TON of throw backs to the original. People say tjey ""copied"" the original but it wasn't that. They did scenes that were a tribute to the original. This was nothing like the others. Go see this movie. It's the best sequel yet and sets up the 6th movie and makes you want more. Best opening scene of any of them as well.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
819,blaskofilms,JW: Fallen Standards ...,1,24 June 2018,"There's a moment in the Tim Burton film Ed Wood, when Sarah Jessica Parker interrupts Wood's wrap party celebration by screaming ""You're wasting your lives making s***. Nobody cares! These movies ... ARE TERRIBLE!""Oh, if only nobody cared. JW:FK is going to make it's money. It's going to draw in huge summer crowds internationally. But we, the audience, should raise our collective voices, and have the courage to do what Parker's character did. This film ... really IS terrible.Personally, I don't fault director J.A. Bayona. I've seen his other work, and I think that the film's only mildly positive qualities (gothic tension and color palette) are probably his doing. But I've seen Colin Trevorrow's work too, and this disaster of a story has his footprints all over it.It's stupid to think that Hammond and his team of scientific geniuses built the park on the site of an active volcano. It is idiotic to send a team through some huge underwater, remotely controlled gate to recover a piece of the Indominus Rex skeleton. Time and time again, from US Senate hearings to black market auctions in the CLUE mansion to lava that behaves more like warm JELL-O than molten rock, this film chooses the path of brain-dead absurdity. If you had the bad luck to watch The Last Jedi, the feeling you have watching this film will be ... well, familiar.Not even the dinosaurs, which should be at the heart of a JP/JW film, feel at all real. In Jurassic World, they were clumsy action figures; here they're little more than an afterthought. Gone are the brilliant colors and slow, lumbering entrances of the first three films. Now they are all muddy, pixelated and hard to tell apart. The new Indoraptor is a sleek exception, but apparently is so well-engineered by Henry Wu that it understands comedic timing. Wink, wink.If there is any real horror in the film, it is unintentional. For a film supposedly so progressive, smart and liberal (yes, the presidency of Donald Trump deserves all kinds of thoughtful critiques and pointed commentary; two stupid joke-jabs about ""nasty women"" and science denial don't cut it), it has an unsettling weak sense of morality. We're supposed to weep when a dinosaur is left on the shore, when even a fang is poached by an unscrupulous contractor. But the ""bad-guy"" humans? They get sliced and diced in the third act without even so much as a moment of cinematic empathy. Even at the end, our five leads decide to just let the dinosaurs roam, despite that they've all seen first-hand the carnage that these animals wreak. Incredulously, they are willing parties to the suffering of the surviving dinosaurs (what will they eat? where will they go?) and every living thing that crosses their path.And the music swells, and classic Jurassic image beats are repeated, as though we've got ourselves a happy ending and a billion dollars at the box office.Ed Wood didn't deserve much of the criticism he got. His films were the right kind of dumb: small affairs of the heart, built around a loyal team of misfits, trying to restore a sense of humanity in whatever goofy way they could do it. His films were terrible, but the best kind of terrible.JW:FK? This is the worst kind of terrible.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

But a review of the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet made me curious since it was the first time that I read that the film has two parts, meaning the island scenes do not take up the whole plot. So I decided to give it a try. My hopes were still not high. I mean how exciting can it be to watch people for two hours getting out of vechicles with eyes and mouths open, staring up at feeding dinos? But I was very positively surprised. This is an amazing and almost perfect production, very good action scenes, not a boring second. The chemistry between Chris Pratt and Bryce Howard is good and much better than in the last one which dwelled too much around their relationship problems. The only reason for not giving 10 points is that there are some cliché-ridden aspects; you will understand what I mean if you watch it. But they don't really ruin much of the movie. I had a really, really great time. I saw the IMAX version which was flawless with some fantastic effects. I have no idea how they make all the effects, but the dinosaurs look very real; respect to the producers and makers. And with a high degree of creativity they have come up with new and exciting creatures. Also the new castings are mostly very well done. In sum, one of the best action movies I have ever seen.

824,judeknicks,"Plotless and Pointless: Visuals can't make up for wack ""story""",6,4 July 2018,"As a kid who grew up loving dinosaurs and knowing everything about them, the prospect of seeing a movie with these creatures brought to life enamored me. However, after finishing every one of those movies, I was not too impressed by the final product. When Jurassic World was released in 2015, the excitement returned but quickly diminished after watching it. All that to say, I went into the theater without high expectations, and I left satisfied that I didn't expect too much.As my philosophy believes, I do not check movie reviews before watching a movie. Reading reviews alters what I expect. If the movie is something that I am interested in, I am going to watch it regardless of the reviews it gets. Plus, I have MoviePass so until that company becomes defunct, I will watch what I wish to watch. Anyways, I felt that Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom had a terrific first half. The action and visuals were great, the atmosphere created through the setting and music score was tense, and it felt like the movie was going somewhere. As I elaborate on this point, I will say that the main premise of the story is spoiled in the trailers.For anyone who watches TV or a lot of YouTube, you have certainly seen trailers for this movie. A blockbuster of this scale is certainly going to have a lot of marketing to back it up. The trailers show how a certain group plans to save a few dinosaurs from Isla Nubar, the home of the now-desolate Jurassic World theme park, and sell them to bidders. Naturally, whatever intentions that bad guys have must be brought down by the good guys. This premise is shown in the trailers, but the beginning of the film seemed to be building on that premise. It may have had a message about the effects of animal abuse and capture for personal gain, as well as potentially negative aspects about genetic modification. However, the second act of the film is a dud that takes the premise and crashes it, becoming mindless and dumb.I do not wish to spoil anything about the movie, but I will say that the second half is drawn out just to fill in time. It is effective in being tense and scary, with some jump scares, but it just doesn't go anywhere. The last movie also did not have an actual plot, but at least there was an objective that made sense.To summarize, the good parts about the film include it's visual effects, tension-building atmosphere, connections to prior Jurassic Park films appearances made by Rolls-Royce vehicles, and Chris Pratt. Star Lord is the best (or my personal favorite MCU) character, mostly due to Pratt being awesome. However, it is severely hampered by it's mindless second half and overall lack of a plot. I would give this film a 5.75 out of 10, which makes it at least worth your $2. However, I would also say rent it once and never watch it again.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

In transit the Alien escapes and kills almost everyone, until finally our heroine Ripley saves the day and flushes the Alien into space, thus preventing bad guys from weaponizing said alien.. Sound familiar?One huge difference between Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom and Alien is that Alien was a well crafted and truly frightening movie where JWFK was cliche, predictable, formulaic, and at times just plain dumb.I did give JWFK bonus points for special effects.

Bayona. I have faith in that guy and loved his works such as The Orphanage, The Impossible and A Monster's Call. If you haven't seen those movies or at least one of those, I suggest you go check it out. I was curious when he said in an interview that he wanted the sequel to be horror. Now, I've seen his movie The Orphanage and I have to give it to him that he can direct a horror movie. Now what I am really interested in is, having seen three of his movies that I mention, I notice that all three (for lack of better word) have ""heart"", I don't know but they just give you the ""feels"". But really, that's the reason why I am very excited to watch this one out and see if a gigantic and popular movie franchise like Jurassic Park which is popular for its park and man killing dinosaurs could ever give me the ""feels"". AND IT DID! I just can't believe it, J.A. Bayona made me care about dinosaurs! What I also loved about my movie experience with Jurassic World: The Fallen Kingdom is it was such a fun ride. The theater I was in felt like I was inside an actual amusement park and the reactions of other viewers made me enjoy the movie even more.

828,sedenhansen-61849,A darker and more ambiguous entry in the dino franchise,7,4 October 2018,"Picking up three years after the previous film, the story starts with Isla Nublar, now abandoned to the jungle and the dinosaurs, imperiled by an erupting volcano. People in America are debating whether to rescue the dinosaurs form the island or not. Clare and Owen, who have gone their separate ways between the films, are reunited in a privately financed effort to rescue the dinosaurs instigated by an old associate of John Hammond. Joined by a couple of workers from Claire's ""save the dinosaurs"" group (who seem rather a copy of the control room quasi-couple from the previous film), they travel with a group of soldiers-of-fortune to the island and start rounding up dinosaurs as the volcano rumbles. Unsurprisingly (though surprisingly quickly), nasty ulterior motives emerge, and the characters find themselves fighting for their lives, those of the remaining dinosaurs, and their own moral compasses. 
 The film is chock -full of references to earlier films in the franchise, which are fun to mentally tick off, and the audience is usually a step or two ahead of the action (what successes or setbacks will happen during the several escape efforts is usually easy to figure out). The film has an odd and uneasy relationship with violence; dinosaurs are seen dispatching humans in grisly ways, but person-to -person violence is handled squeamishly if at all. The filmmakers swing between a story of awed fascination and mortal terror, between clear-cut conflicts and moral ambiguities. Ultimately, the film can't quite decide on a tone or message as it zig and zags about the issue of the perils of the ever-expanding possibilities of science.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
829,njt-63687,Second best in the franchise...,9,5 March 2019,"While the original 1993 film remains my favorite movie (not just of the franchise, but of ALL TIME), this film is a very close second. From the trailers, it seemed like the Indoraptor was pure evil, but after seeing the film itself, I realized that it had been abused, teased, and tormented that drove the animal mad.I don't truly believe it would have killed Maisie Lockwood had it actually caught her in the iconic moment seen from two of the trailers. When it reached out from its cage, notice that it simply brushed her hair. It could have nabbed her, pulled her into the cage, and eaten her if it truly wanted to.The real monster was Ken Wheatly. He was terribly cruel and when the Indoraptor bit his arm off, I was hoping it would bite his head off. Other antagonists included Eli Mills and that dinosaur-selling greedy b*****d (Gunner Eversoll) who wanted to make a fortune, despite Henry Wu's protests.There are at least THREE tear-jerking scenes in this film, not just one.(1) The one everyone knows - when the Brachiosaur is on the dock before it's engulfed by the lava and smoke.
(2) When Zia operates on Blue and tries to remove the bullet in her leg while the poor animal struggles to stay alive - especially when Blue sheds a tear.
(3) When the dinosaurs are trapped in that room as it fills up with toxic gas before Maisie releases them.Those are the scenes that made me emotional, though I doubt those are the only scenes in this movie that have that effect on me.Since the Indoraptor isn't as evil as I had thought from watching the trailers before I saw the film, I must say its death scene is a little bit sad for me. Granted, it's not as emotional as the scenes above, but it still has some drama to it.I can't decide if Henry Wu is an antagonist or not. In some scenes, he appears to be, but not in others. It's like, he is, but he isn't.As much as I love this film, it still could have been better. For one thing, the Indoraptor should have bitten Wheatley's head off, rather than his arm. For another, Blue should have gone with Owen and the others at the end. He asked her to come with him and told her that she would be taken to a safe place. Perhaps, that place could have been at Owen's cabin after he finished building it.How is Blue going to take care of herself this time without Owen? Will Blue die in ""Jurassic World III"" (whatever its title happens to be in 2021)? Suppose she encounters deer/bear hunters in the woods and they shoot her between this film and the third one. Now that she's in the United States, there's no telling what will happen to Blue without Owen. While she wanted freedom, I think Blue would have been better off going with Owen and the others.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

I'll need to watch it again to tell whether I liked or hated it because in spite of everything the movie tries to throw at you to stay entertained, the ironically humourous quality of the whole thing becomes a bit tired by the end.

836,nikcoppin,Same Old Story?,6,22 June 2018,"Jurassic Park: Fallen KingdomWe've seen them running around a park in an island, then San Diego and then another park on an island, which was called a world, and now they are having a jolly old time running around an old blokes big house.That old bloke being John Hammond's original partner that we knew nothing about. I wonder going forward how many other secret partners David Attenborough's dearly departed brother is going to have had that get thrown in to support the latest plot idea.Speaking of David Attenborough, I wonder what he would think of what his brother did in making all these creatures de-extinct as is the phrase coined in this movie? However he referred to them, Morrissey would probably have a problem with it. But then he is an animal that should have become extinct years ago himself.So, the blind girl from The Village has split up with Star Lord, but needs his help to go and rescue a load of dinosaurs from a volcanic island that is about to explode. Yes, the old completely incompatible couple that get together, then conveniently have split up before the next movie, then we discover they still really like each other and all that business.We have the completely predictable story of people messing with things they shouldn't be messing with and they all go out of control. Again. No matter how many times the Grandmaster Ian 'Chaos Theory' Malcolm tells them, they just won't listen. No wonder he just disappeared to his own planet to promote and enjoy superfights between various space creatures and animated rock formations with Kiwi accents and of course, Hulk v Thor.We also have the renegade child running around the place getting saved and looked after by the in-love/not-in love/in-love-again incompatible couple as seems to be standard in this and similar franchises. Although there is a secret about the child that turns out to be an interesting little twist in the movie that is a nice little addition to proceedings.Then of course some of the dinosaurs have to have their little handbags at dawn fights and Blue and the ever-popular T-Rex have their little grandstanding heroic moments. Yep, it's all pretty standard and in fear of getting a bit like the Star Wars franchise. A watchable summer blockbuster, but far from being up there with others in the franchise and really nothing to write about.Oh, wait....",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

839,chris_reed-69842,Should have focused on the actual 'Fallen Kingdom',7,6 January 2019,"I'm a massive fan of the original trilogy, yes, even JP 3 despite its flaws with characters. I also loved the nostalgia of Jurassic World.This is a strong story in terms of the direction it's going, the arcs explored in each character from the political side, to characters turning over a new leaf and ethics of clinical trials and cloning however I mostly felt let down by two things. The first thing I felt let down by was the way the film ushered us away from the park too quickly. The opening scene was amazing and I wanted the rest of the film to have that terror and tone, I wanted to see more of the fallen kingdom and what it had become. They should have left the the transition of moving the dinosaurs away from the island in the last third of the film or at the end.
My second gripe was the bad acting of some characters. Three of the characters (Mills, Wheaton and Ken Wheatley) were so badly acted they were like DC villains and Franklin and Zia's characters were so cartoonish I felt I was watching Scooby Doo. I feel like these characters mentioned took away the integrity and the seriousness away from the story. Only Claire, Owen and Malcolm gave this a serious tone in my opinion.I think they should have kept the films simple, Jurassic World - Functioning Park goes bad, Jurassic World: FK - Revisit destroyed park to save dinosaurs from volcano, Jurassic World 3 - Dinosaurs saved from Isla Nublar and all goes wrong on the mainland.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

They introduce a character who is evil John Hammond yet we've never heard of him before.Competent actors doing mediocre work under a clueless director. Bryce Dallas Howard is the worst thing to happen to Hollywood since Justice Smith who's also in this movie.The characters are bland clichés who can't do anything original or different from the last Jurassic movie however this movie also manages to make the comedic relief aggravating.Someone rides a T-Rex. There's sexual chemistry at times when no one in their right mind would be feeling turned on. Not once, but twice does a character escape from a tricky situation by finding an exit a few feet away that they didn't notice before. There's hacking, there's an annoying child who's somehow smarter than the adults around her.I don't really like any Jurassic Park movies. The first is a good movie but it's not one of my favourites however there's a majesty and respect in it.

848,telavivid,"It could have been so great, but preferred to be generic instead",4,29 July 2018,"I've watched all five Jurassic movies so far. The original ""Jurassic Park"" was brilliant since it offered a brand new premise: revive dinosaurs for the first time ever and create a theme park. The second one (""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"") wasn't as good, but it was quite engaging and enjoyable nevertheless. 
And the franchise went downhill from there.""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" has good visual effects, but that's about it. The story is being re-done for the fifth time already with mild variations in the script. Unfortunately, there are good ideas in this movie, which are being thrown around like announcements and then neglected. If the scriptwriter/director took their time to elaborate just a bit, it would have actually gotten interesting.
For instance, they have the Indoraptor - a genetically engineered dinosaur! So, what's different about it? Does it have wings? Does it have 10 legs? Was it able to generate electricity (you know, like an eel)? Nope. It looks literally like every other dinosaur in the movie. 
And what about Maisie? It comes out she's a human clone. Pause right there! Are there any side effects? Will she live as long as her original donor? How would she cope with this? Psychological effects? We don't care! Let's just shout out this information and continue running - something we've done for 1 hour and 30 minutes already. As if the characters' fitness is more important than their identity.
What about some more focus on that island, on which the volcano erupted? Are all dinosaurs really killed? What if they started evolving into smaller, but equally vicious things? You know, in order to be able to survive cataclysms? I found the opening scenes of the movie really promising and then it let me down.

Partly that is true, but although the storyline is simple it does have a few unexpected moments. This film is like a rollercoaster, lots of adrenaline and great tension, too many action scenes can become boring, but in no way that happened here. It took us a while to come down from the rush. Good humor in the right moments. Also lots of cheesy moments and a lot of unbelievable jumps from scene to scene. But all in all a nice addition to the other films.

In a sense, the Park is a character - you know it's story, it's history, even it's layout and how it runs. That's what was refreshing about Jurassic World, we finally got to return to the original island and reminisce. Then along comes Fallen Kingdom and literally blows up your childhood. Dead. Gone. Destroyed. That was my biggest issue with Fallen Kingdom, I was also a little pissed that Goldblum was only in the movie for 1 minute! But something else about the plot also wasn't right... there's 2 islands, everyone knows this because The Lost World and Jurassic Park 3 were set there... so why a frantic rescue mission to save what seemed like 10 dinosaurs to take back to the main land when they could've shipped them the short distance to the second island which we know from the previous movies is already a bustling habitat full of free roaming dinos?

The movie is generally bad with a plot that is stupid. My only hope was that this director could bring some horror to this franchise (he did direct ""The Orphanage"" after all) and for the first three minutes I was like ""you know what, maybe this movie will have the balls to be a horrifying thrill ride"" but sadly no. I was excited to see the scene in the trailer where the big water dinosaur was gonna eat the surfers but guess what, Its a CUT SCENE setting up the next movie.

No. I give it this rating because it thoroughly thrilled and entertained me as a movie of this nature should do. Also, I can't in good faith give this movie a ten with the ending it has. Like I still can't comprehend how they just decide to let the dinosaurs free onto the world without even thinking about all the innocent people who could die as a result of that. Or, that the writers don't even choose to acknowledge that concern.There's also some very obvious writing decisions to help advance the plot. For example, one character as we've seen has been collecting teeth from numerous different dinosaurs to I guess make a necklace. Why? I don't know, but long story short he ends up in a cage with the Indoraptor created by Dr. Wu in a stupid attempt to retrieve a tooth from it, and ends up being killed by the Indoraptor. So with the cage having been open the Indoraptor can now escape and proceed to kill more people. It's not really a big deal when your watching just something I noticed and thought about after.Overall, it's great fun and good thrills and all the returning characters like Owen and Claire don't disappoint here, especially Owen. He's still very much a badass in this movie. Even Jeff Goldblum returning as Ian Malcolm I like here even though I wished he was in it a little more.

1) Superb VFX
2) Better plot than JW1 (Dinosaur Conspiracy VS Park is Open, Again)
3) Intense Screenplay, with several nail-biting and heart-pumping scenes
4) Technical Capabilities - including Background score
5) Tight Running Time, with no laggards
6) More importance given to the lead actors
7) No silly scenes or plot development like in JW1 (e.g Checking the missing dinosaur by going to the cage, security guard opening the gate to escape, Lead actress running in high heels, Two kids wandering off on their own with no proper safety measures or supervision, The same 2 kids fixed a decade old jeep jst because they have experience fixing their grandpa's truck etc)Cons:
1) Biggest Con - The main Dinosaur (Indoraptor) does not look as scary or magnificent as the Indominus Rex from JW1. As such, the sense of ""threat"" is missing.
2) Absence of large scale Action Sequences. In JW1, the climax fight scene between the mighty T-Rex and Indominus Rex was a major highlight. But in here, mostly it's only Dinosaurs chasing humans. Due to this, despite this movie having bigger budget than JW1, it does not look as ""BIG"" as its prequel.
3) Overall Darker Tone - though this gives a more intense feel throughout the movie, it somehow dilutes the spectacle of the dinosaurs. Plus, if you watch this movie in lousy screens, the entire first act will look blurry
4) Under-used T-REX
Let me start by saying I am a big fan of Jurassic World 1 and all 3 prior Jurassic Park movies (yes, including Jurassic Park 3). So naturally I had great expectations from this one. But did it fulfill my expectations? Yes, but only partially.Compared to JW1, this movie was more intense and can be categorized as a ""suspense thriller"". Plus, the short running time means there are generally no lagging scenes.However, on the downside, the Indoraptor hyped up by the villains just does not look as terrifying or exciting as the Indominus Rex from JW1. Not sure what they were hyping about. Plus, the capabilities of the Indoraptor was not properly explained or demonstrated. The Indominus Rex from JW1 had pretty cool ""superpowers"" - Camouflage, Intelligence, Alpha Raptor etc. which made it a GREAT Threat! But Indoraptor just looks like a slightly modified raptor.Compared to the ""Indominus Rex vs. T-Rex"" battle in JW1, the ""Indoraptor vs Raptor"" fight in JW2 just looks childish. If only they have changed the main dinosaur to something else, this movie would have been much much better IMO.Overall, still worth watching on the big screen.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Let me preface this by saying I've enjoyed all the Jurassic movies, some more/some less, & this was no different, 
I'll admit I wasn't excited about the idea of a new Jurassic series, even though friends went to the cinema & gave JW a 10/10. I waited until it was on TV & kicked myself for being such a cynic. 
So this time I was determined to see JW: Fallen Kingdom in IMAX 3D at the local cinema complex. 
How was it? It does what it says on the tin. 
Owen & Clair are back with the addition of brief cameos from the original JW movie (as a little icing on the cake). 
It also pays homage to JP2/Lost World by being much darker in tone than JP/JW too. 
Is it just another rehash of JW? No, not in this viewers book. For starters it starts a lot darker than it's predecessor even if the opening is slightly reminiscent of the original JP movie. 
The main characters are a little different too in that Clair is the one who has the respect for the dinosaurs, whilst Owen wants nothing to do with them & has chosen a more solitary lifestyle building his cabin in the woods. 
Then there's a raft of new characters. Some to root for, some to boo & his at. 
There's some nice little touches with connections back to Hammond (& Attenborough) with the inclusion of Hammond's partner thus developing the past storylines of the original movie, & Iris (played by Geraldine Chaplin) that made me smile remembering Sir Richard's body of work. 
Of course there's a key inclusion of the kid, which the franchise should have just to remind us of that sense of wonder most of us have about dinosaurs. Another box ticked. 
SPOILER ALERT (ish): Isla Nublar goes ""kablooie"" reasonably quickly in a first act packed with great SFX, plot twists, & more nods of the hat to the originals. Again, box ticked (though sufficiently different to keep me engaged & give this viewer a warm glow). 
So how are the production team going to further this storyline? Well, without giving too much away... they just do. With some nice character development, a bit of social commentary (on modern day avarice & even some political questioning) the plot carries us along taking the viewer to a darker, more claustrophobic final act where the tension ratchets up in the face off between the good guys vs the bad guys. 
By now in the series we've come to side with most of the dinosaurs more than some of the humans, so it'll be no surprise that the bad guys get solidly dispatched in a climactic showdown, much to appreciation of the audience. There's even a couple of characters make it out alive that at the beginning I was convinced were destined to be dinosaur fodder. 
Now... is it as good as either JP or JW? That's for you to decide in the fullness of time, but for me it ticked the boxes, took the story in a forward momentum & satisfied my appetite for more dino films. 
I've given it 9/10 & not the 10/10 of either JP or JW - let's face it, we all expect sequels to be less satisfying than the originals (cough ""Star Wars""). 
Would I watch it again? Absolutely I will. 
So if you like the Jurassic franchise I'd recommend going to catch it, especially in IMAX 3D. Just ignore the naysayers & make up your own mind if this one takes the series forward or tanks like a ""Last Jedi"" gasping for air.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
875,jag_avgudar_barca,How you run a franchise to the ground,3,30 July 2018,"Do you remember the days when the vibrations of distant dinosaur steps made you shiver? Do you remember the chill down your spine when you Heard the noise of a raptor? I'm sure we all do. But......Do you remember when Disney bought the rights to the Jurassic Park-franchise? No? Me neither, because they didn't. But watching the latest installment of Jurassic Park (this time called Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom) has left me wondering if all movies these days are made to cater young children.Right of the bat, we are introduced to the most cringe-worthiest characters in existence. Franklin Webb (played by Justice Smith) and Zia Rodriguez (played by Daniella Pineda) are two sidekicks that surely has to be written into the script by a 3-year old. They crack jokes during dinosaur chases - like any other normal person would, right? Neither of the two fill any function in the movie, other than filling the cringe quota to the maximum.Both Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt are dreadful. They never fear for their lives, no matter if they are running from a fierce lava volcano or giant monster dinosaurs. Instead, they are sort of super humans, that risk EVERYTHING in order to save cloned dinosaurs from dying. Still doesn't sound like Jurassic Park to you? Well, listen to this - they don't even use the original score made by John Williams. The special effects are okay, and is what makes it a 3/10 instead of a 1/10 for me. It is clear where they have spent their giant budget, but sometimes all the CGI used makes it harder to actually believe the things you are seeing on screen. This whole movie felt cartoonish, both in script and cinematography. I am very disappointed, and sad to see such a beloved franchise ruined. I miss Steven Spielberg.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Because I've seen absolutely all the Jurassic movies since the first one in 1993 and this is the worst for sure.But what is disappointing is not that is bad. The disappointment is that is bad after such a last great one from 2015 with the same actors. It is almost unbeliavable what I saw on screen.If you compare with the 2015 edition, you can see in this one there is a lack plot, content, direction, meaning, logic, etc. in a everlasting 2 hours sequel.My only explanation is the impact on the change of Director and writers.

Every shot from the silhouettes on the wall to T rex eating someone to a dinosaur opening a door has been seen before. Watch the original on dvd instead.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
881,ipacac22,Not terrible but has problems,4,6 September 2018,"I don't know what I was expecting from Fallen Kingdom but it certainly wasn't what I got. I'll start with the good stuff. The CGI was serviceable. The Endoraptor (Indo?) looked menacing and made for a decent non human antagonist. The rest of the dinos were passable. Jeff Goldblum's cameo as the beloved Dr. Ian Malcolm while short was nice to see. The cinematography was gorgeous. I liked the flyover shots of Isla Nublar which were reminiscent of JP1. The action sequences while kind of rushed and a little illogical were exciting.Now for the bad. Chris Pratt and BDH seemed like they were sleep walking in this movie. They didn't exude the personality and spirit that they had in Jurassic World. It's like they were just there to collect a check. The computer nerd and doctor chick were annoying. He was constantly screaming and whining and her SJW attitude was unwelcome and not needed. I was hoping one or both would be eaten shortly after they were introduced. Rafe Spall as the lead human antogonist didn't work for me. He was cartoony and his overall plan was just ridiculous, and killing a defenseless old man with a pillow? Do we really need to see that in a JP movie? This isn't Goodfellas.The little girl who turns out to be a clone. Why was this in here? They tell us about it but it doesn't go anywhere. I thought this was a dinosaur movie. The plan of Spall's character to sell dinos for millions of dollars so they can be used in military applications. Um what? Completely ignoring the logistical nightmare that would pose, how exactly is that better than our current weapons technology? Colin Trevorrow should stick to directing because his writing sucks.So yeah this film has some good points but overall it's problematic and makes me want to watch JW or JP1 again.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
882,bengiles,Obsessed with the wrong things,6,6 April 2019,"So the film begins and it says they're gonna rescue the dinosaurs from an erupting volcano and put them on their own island where they can roam about without cages etc, and I think, ok that sounds promising - I could get caught up in the emotional rollercoaster of this and it could really mean something if they succeed / fail.Then they link to the original Jurassic Park with a chum of John Hammond and the mosquito cane and I'm thinking, wow, this is really tugging on my strings.Unfortunately they then decide to ditch all that and make it 100 Dalmatians with dinosaurs, not to mention ANOTHER random creation cooked up in a lab. Does anyone really care about these fictitious creations and the prospect of some mega monster battle of CGI creatures?Stick with the original premise it could be a classic, but instead it's a mildly entertaining but ultimately meaningless blockbuster and from the ending it looks like there's plenty more where that came from.

885,SCIFIshant,Don't Listen To The Critics!,9,8 July 2018,"Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom is a movie about dinosaurs and people being eaten by dinosaurs. It is the most simple concept ever, but yet the critics still nitpick about it. The same folks who gave a film like Last Jedi a 91% gave this film 51%. I honestly wonder how much they were being paid! This film takes place after the first Jurassic World. A volcano is about to explode on the island and the dinosaurs are about to go extinct AGAIN. The mission? Save all the dinosaurs so that they don't go extinct once more. The film always kept me on the edge of my seat. The underwater scene with that huge dinosaur taking a bite out of that submarine was action-packed and epic! Soon things take a turn for the worst the main villain known as Mills is trying to get the dinosaur back not for the sake of saving them, but for turning a profit and selling them to wealthy bidders. John Hammond's former business partner known as Benjamin Lockwood finds out and tells Milsl to call the police only to be choked to death by Miills. Then the granddaughter of Mr.Lockwood goes to the lab and uncovers Mill's dirty secret to sell the dinosaurs. She goes to tell her grandfather only to find him dead. The team gets back from the island and witnesses the auction of the dinosaurs. Things go haywire and the star of the show the Indoraptor escapes and causes multiple fatalities. Owen and his friends save the day and Mills is properly arrested. My only pet peeve with this movie was the ending. I did not really notice it after watching the film, but as time passed I realized how dumb the end was. The little girl allows the dinosaurs to escape and Owen and his friends do nothing about it. This means that mankind is doing nothing to stop this self-inflicted extinction. Ian Malcom even says in the first film that god selected dinosaurs for extinction and I could not agree more in this case. The visuals were great! Some of the best visuals I have seen in any film. The dinosaurs were extremely lifelike and the lush landscapes were very well done. The music was alright, but it could have been better. I prefer the music from The Lost World Jurassic Park and the original film over the music in this film. I don't think you should listen to the critics to base your opinion on this film heck don't even base your opinion off of mine! Please watch the film yourself and make your own judgements.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

It felt like a mix of The lost world and Jurassic world. But half way everything became just less and less probable. The entire movie hangs together on chance and accidental luck.I mean there are great scenes, some dinosaurs look awesome, but it looks more like an action packed showcase, than an actual good movie. There is no real tension, because at the start of every scene you already know how it will end, it's really predictable.And the Disney plot... man.. There is nothing new, it might even be worse than jurassic park 3...If I was twelve, and this was one of my first big motion pictures i'd probably give it a big 8 or 9. And well..

Yes we all know movies have ridiculous things in them that defy logic and physics. They clone dinosaurs and people complain about whether guns shoot underwater or knives can open sealed bolts. People hating on this movie clearly have a need to feel smarter than everyone else and probably only saw it in order to complain about it.

Jurassic Park never meant to be a joke. Yes, was suposed to entertain us as audience, but not in a superficial way. I think everyone can see how bad was written this movie.

Fallen Kingdom is worse in every aspects compared to its predecessor. The escape from the island part was more entertaining than the rest of the movie, which pretty much goes into a nose dive from there on.There were a lot of illogical plot settings for the sole purpose of setting up the story to move forward. The giant dinosaur in the lake that escaped from the gate in the very beginning of the film for example. How do people in their right mind to even build a gate for a theme park lake. What were they thinking?Also, after the events in Jurassic World, I'm surprised the island is not in a complete government military lockdown, making the scenario where a group of mercenaries go in to take whatever they need far less likely.

915,nagertap315,THEY TRY BASHING TRUMP AND IT BACKFIRES SPECTACULARLY,1,15 July 2018,"First of all if you want to know if it's bad, it is much worse. The whole movie is a total and complete farce. Sure, you get some action, you get some dinosaurs and you get some scary moments. But it all adds up to a big mess in the end. It is NOT a Jurassic Park film. The most hilarious part of this movie is when you get a subtle reference about Trump while seeing a clip from BBC news (as surprising as that is). It's when the fact that the island is going to explode is revealed and in scrolling text at the bottom of a clip from BBC news it says, ""US president questions the existence of dinosaurs in the first place.'"" Now while the simple minded people laugh and go ""Lol! Trump would say something like that! (que the smirking)"" the smarter people are laughing at them and the writers. First let's go back to Jurassic World where Dr. Henry Wu states, ""Nothing in Jurassic World is natural, we have always filled gaps in the genome with the DNA of other animals. And if the genetic code was pure, many of them would look quite different. But you didn't ask for reality, you asked for more teeth."" So, I guess Trump was right after all! The creators of this film have unknowingly made themselves a joke. Sure, they will make some people giggle but they have highlighted a huge problem with the media in today's world. The media will always twist someone's words and the truth about everyday happenings in order to fit their (mainly leftist) agenda. The media being collective idiots is also how Trump got elected in the first place (so a round of applause is needed for the filmmakers who made proper @ssheads out of themselves). Oh and since Trump is apparently in the Fallen Kingdom (as we have done what no good film maker does and have brought current day politics into our movie) I have to genuinely applaud him for his statement as he truly gets it. There are no dinosaurs that exist in the Jurassic World movies just like they don't exist in the Jurassic Park movies (I still prefer dinosaurs that act more realistic and less like pet puppies though). Just like muscle cars, dinosaurs went extinct a long time ago. Developing dino puppy kitten hybrids or putting 6.0L V8 engines into two door Mercedes coupes will not change this fact. But yeah, apparently, none of the other characters understand that these animals are not even real dinosaurs. They are even less like dinosaurs in these newer ""Jurassic World"" movies since the carnivores act more like loyal dogs than they do actual predators. So with the characters being idiots, in mind, let's continue.Okay so instead of letting these dinosaurs die naturally on the island we're going to go and save them! Watch the scene where Claire is trying to convince Owen to go with her to carry out this ridiculous plan. You get to see a normal person contrasted with a crazy radical animal rights activist. It's hilarious (until Owen actually decides to go with her to save his pal, Blue.) Also about Claire: She has no kids of her own still. Now based on the events of the first ""Jurassic World"" you would assume she would have become a parent and also have developed more compassion toward animals (did she have any pets? Who knows). Well the second bit is sure true. However, to apparently appeal to all the feminists out there who hated the first ""Jurassic World"", instead of becoming a parent she just becomes more manipulative towards parents (she asks practically everyone she meets if they have kids). So, surprisingly no kids. oh, but don't worry. She makes up for it by being a crazy animal activist. After witnessing that dying ""Diplodocus"" in the the first ""Jurassic World"" she goes full animal rights. With Owen, himself the issue lies with the fact that he seems a whole lot closer to Blue then he did in the first film (making it all too obvious how they made up a bunch of plot filler). Oh wow isn't that nice that Blue is so loving and kind. But, wait, didn't Blue try to kill Owen in the first ""Jurassic World"" without a second thought? Well let me tell you. I saw the video clips and I now know the truth. And the truth is that Blue is an adorable puppy dog! :D He would NEVER attack people who were cowering in fear! Moral of story: It's dumb to try to pretend that this guy and his puppy had an amazing relationship when it wasn't established in the first film. Sure, we knew Owen imprinted on them when they were born, but it doesn't account for them trying to kill him or him not caring if Blue died. Don't get me wrong he was normal for a little bit and it was nice to hear a normal person talk for a few minutes in response to a crazy animal activist trying to risk her life for animals while trying to convince you to do the same damn thing. However, since Owen was the one to convince Claire to give a $hit about ""dinosaurs"" in the first place it contradicts his character. Now they go to the save the dinosaurs and people die and an obvious twist occurs and blah blah blah blah. It's guilty of doing what movies today do. Instead of making good movies and coming out with new material bty taking risks, film makers today revolve their films around leftist agendas while safely basing their whole movies on previous ones of the same franchise. The Force Awakens is a watered-down take on Star Wars IV: A New Hope just like this was a watered-down take on The Lost World. Okay so first of all, Pachycephalosaurus (the dinosaur with the rock for a head) most likely did not bash into things with it's skull and probably could not have escaped an enclosure designed to contain it. This one is nitpicky though. Second of all, why are we still trying to save them? Why wouldn't just let them die natural deaths on the island? Why now that you have had the chance to let them all die peacefully, did you ruin the opportunity? I mean do you think that once you open the doors and let the puppy dogs out, some magical fairy is going to take them all to a safe place? No, they're going to kill innocent people and then be killed themselves (in way more painful ways than being put to sleep)The evil Mills man who hatched a plan to sell all the dinosaurs makes a good point about how Owen and Claire have both exploited the animals and have learned from it. So why are we so happy to see him, Mr. Eversol, and a bunch of rich people perish? Do they not get to make a mistake and realize their error? Why does Claire and Owen get to make a mistake and grow but other people don't? Is it cause Mr. Mills and everyone else involved with selling the ""dinosaurs"" was rich? The writers are so unintelligent I would have to think this is the reason. Even though these people (like the Russian who bought the Indoraptor) really don't know the mistake they're making by purchasing one of these animals, they're rich so thy deserve to die. ""Yeah let em die they're all in on it! They're all being mean to the prehistoric puppies!""Lastly, why were Owen and Claire expected to care that Maisie Lockwood was a clone. Was Mr. Mills really expecting them to stop trying to end the chaos by telling them this? Its still a wonder to me why this needed to be in the script. Oh and ENOUGH of the T-Rex at the end curling itself up in order to expel a loud and menacing roar. And this time it didn't even make any sense. So the Rex attacks the Carnotaurus in the beginning of the movie just to break bread with it at the end of the movie? Come on.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
916,nagertap315,FAILS SPECTACULARLY AT EVERYTHING INCLUDING AT BASHING TRUMP,1,15 July 2018,"First of all if you want to know if it's bad, it is much worse. The whole movie is a total and complete farce. Sure, you get some action, you get some dinosaurs and you get some scary moments. But it all adds up to a big mess in the end. It is NOT a Jurassic Park film. The most hilarious part of this movie is when you get a subtle reference about Trump while seeing a clip from BBC news (as surprising as that is). It's when the fact that the island is going to explode is revealed and in scrolling text at the bottom of a clip from BBC news it says, ""US president questions the existence of dinosaurs in the first place.'"" Now while the simple minded people laugh and go ""Lol! Trump would say something like that! (que the smirking)"" the smarter people are laughing at them and the writers. First let's go back to Jurassic World where Dr. Henry Wu states, ""Nothing in Jurassic World is natural, we have always filled gaps in the genome with the DNA of other animals. And if the genetic code was pure, many of them would look quite different. But you didn't ask for reality, you asked for more teeth."" So, I guess Trump was right after all! The creators of this film have unknowingly made themselves a joke. Sure, they will make some people giggle but they have highlighted a huge problem with the media in today's world. The media will always twist someone's words and the truth about everyday happenings in order to fit their (mainly leftist) agenda. The media being collective idiots is also how Trump got elected in the first place (so a round of applause is needed for the filmmakers who made proper idiots out of themselves). Oh and since Trump is apparently in the Fallen Kingdom (as we have done what no good film maker does and have brought current day politics into our movie) I have to genuinely applaud him for his statement as he truly gets it. There are no dinosaurs that exist in the Jurassic World movies just like they don't exist in the Jurassic Park movies (I still prefer dinosaurs that act more realistic and less like pet puppies though). Just like muscle cars, dinosaurs went extinct a long time ago. Developing dino puppy kitten hybrids or putting 6.0L V8 engines into two door Mercedes coupes will not change this fact. But yeah, apparently, none of the other characters understand that these animals are not even real dinosaurs. They are even less like dinosaurs in these newer ""Jurassic World"" movies since the carnivores act more like loyal dogs than they do actual predators. So with everyone being idiots, in mind, let's continue.Okay so instead of letting these dinosaurs die naturally on the island we're going to go and save them! Watch the scene where Claire is trying to convince Owen to go with her to carry out this ridiculous plan. You get to see a normal person contrasted with a crazy radical animal rights activist. It's hilarious (until Owen actually decides to go with her to save his pal, Blue.) Also about Claire: She has no kids of her own still. Now based on the events of the first ""Jurassic World"" you would assume she would have become a parent and also have developed more compassion toward animals (did she have any pets? Who knows). Well the second bit is sure true. However, to apparently appeal to all the feminists out there who hated the first ""Jurassic World"", instead of becoming a parent she just becomes more manipulative towards parents (she asks practically everyone she meets if they have kids). So, surprisingly no kids. oh, but don't worry. She makes up for it by being a crazy animal activist. After witnessing that dying ""Diplodocus"" in the the first ""Jurassic World"" she goes full animal rights. With Owen, himself the issue lies with the fact that he seems a whole lot closer to Blue then he did in the first film (making it all too obvious how they made up a bunch of plot filler). Oh wow isn't that nice that Blue is so loving and kind. But, wait, didn't Blue try to kill Owen in the first ""Jurassic World"" without a second thought? Well let me tell you. I saw the video clips and I now know the truth. And the truth is that Blue is an adorable puppy dog! :D He would NEVER attack people who were cowering in fear! Moral of story: It's dumb to try to pretend that this guy and his puppy had an amazing relationship when it wasn't established in the first film. Sure, we knew Owen imprinted on them when they were born, but it doesn't account for them trying to kill him or him not caring if Blue died. Don't get me wrong he was normal for a little bit and it was nice to hear a normal person talk for a few minutes in response to a crazy animal activist trying to risk her life for animals while trying to convince you to do the same damn thing. However, since Owen was the one to convince Claire to give a $hit about ""dinosaurs"" in the first place it contradicts his character.

Pineda makes no sense in the role as the constant b*tchy and annoying and dislikable character surely put in there to please the feminist. Bryce Dallas is clearly out of shape for this physically demanding role. Chris pratt again has bore and dull acting and the story line is boring.

919,eric-312-417476,Jurassic House: Fallen Bedrooms,4,7 July 2018,"What could be more exciting than a dinosaur park? A house! A house? Yes, at least that's what someone thought. Maybe they were a fan of barbie's dream house? Maybe. Everything here is certainly plastic. From the look of the dinosaurs to B.D. Howard's performance. This is basically a retread of Lost World without the fun of the Dino's running through San Diego (the only watchable part of that film) at the end. It's over by the time they get to that. The scariest element of the whole movie is Chris Pratt's stranger-danger, pedophiie sounding, character. Though he does have the only good line in the film. If being in a large house with a dying man, some stereotypical evil old men, and politicians, this might be right up your alley. Or you could just stay home and watch the news for the latest Trump administration fiasco. Can't wait for Jurassic House: The Studio Apartment.

922,rorymarsh00,A missed opportunity...,5,22 June 2018,"'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' is, much like the Indoraptor it features, a confused mash-up of differing components, some good, some bad, that ultimately result in an inconsistent film, containing moments of both excellence, and inane stupidity.
As a sequel to 2015's 'Jurassic World', this originally had a chance to further the series in a new creative direction which, with the literal destruction of Isla Nublar around which the film is based, promises a new interpretation of the aged franchise. J.A. Bayona, therefore, proves both the films saving grace, as well as main provocateur of audience frustration. As an experienced horror director, his influence is apparent here. There are genuine moments of tension masterfully interwoven into an otherwise bombastic action blockbuster, these Gothic horror elements undoubtedly proving the highlight, only undercut by their scarcity and appearance late in the third act. They only provoke one to think how much better it could've been if these moments were cultivated and expanded, rather than suppressed by the generic formulae employed in the creation of countless other films of its kind. The action here is generally stellar, strengthened by the aforementioned directorial capabilities of Bayona. Despite this, the narrative remains formulaic, and resembles the same as the films that came before. Pratt remains a charismatic leading man, with Bryce Dallas Howard receiving a more well-rounded character, growing significantly from the first film. Besides these, the other human characters, particularly those intended for comic relief, make the film often insufferable, their irritating intersections proving more migrane-inducing at best, and dampeners to otherwise stellar sequences at worst. The antagonist is once again weak, and a re-hash of the one featured in 'Jurassic World', with the same transparent motivations. Besides these narrative aspects, the film is technically fine, with a conventional script and consistent cinematography helping to build this post-apocalyptic island world, as well as the Gothic splendour of a country mansion, with the creatiion of these digital dinosaurs appearing more realistic and grandoise than ever - their best screen incarnation yet, helping the audience gain an emotional connection with these prehistoric beasts, even stronger than the ones they feel toward the human characters. 'Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom' is a frustrating conflux of groundbreaking directorial vision choked by the irepressable constrains to a multi-billion dollar franchise, preventing a potentially groundbreaking instalment from coming to fruition.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
923,jetbatt94,Intense and exciting Dino Action,8,1 July 2018,"If you're a fan of the franchise and an average person who enjoys intense action movies, then you'll love it. Don't listen to the wanna-be critics and picky-poos, just check out and enjoy the ride! 
Jurassic World is an interesting twist for the Jurassic franchise, and Fallen World is an exciting ""middle movie"" for the new trilogy. 
The CGI is incredible and seamlessly matches the physical animitronics causing even more believability than the other films. 
I am a fan of the Jurassic movie, because I love the concept of DNA splicing to create dinosaurs. I could care less about ""character development"" and the other artsy-fartsy comments.

The basic plot is same as that of JP2 Lost world, and we see a repetition of those famous scenes( dinosaurs running in the open ground, dinos being captured by hunters, treating injured dino, helpful T Rex etc etc..) ..90s kids have nothing to see here but for their kids it will be a good movie to watch",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

926,chameleon-81660,Roller-coaster,6,20 June 2018,"This movie is hard to review. The quality of the film changes like you go up and down with a Roller-coaster. 
There are some great emotional scenes, sometimes the films give you the thrill you want from a Jurassic Park film. The director can use smart solutions.
On the other hand the film sometimes build on cliches, using bad type of humor killing the thrill you felt a moment ago. 
I can tell the same about the acting. The lead characters usually okay, but the new ones, especially the villain, are bad.
Plot also has some serious issues and believe me, you will be pissed off at the end. The next film will start from bad base position. Great moral weight imposed on the characters, which is hard to deal with. I recommend to skip that part of the film. Stand up when the last danger disappears and leave the movie. No matter where you see it.
The visuals however are pretty good. They put a great effort to the visual effects. Dinosaurs, environment all look cool.Jurassic Park films still have potential but they need to decide what kind of film they wanna make. Horror movie or action movie or anything else. They wanted to reach everyone, but ended up kinda failure. Just choose your genre guys before you lose your fans.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

It isn't Jurassic park but it is the 5th movie in the trilogy and having said that it does manage to throw some twists in the story throughout. I'm not going to ruin it for anybody but for me the movie pulled on some heart strings which I wasn't expecting going in. One negative...and it's consistent with most action movies is an overbearrance of CGI special effects. Rewatched original Jurassic park and what makes that movie great 25 years later are the characters. The action scenes in that movie weren't overbearing. In the latest Jurassic the CGI was running a mock. Especially the last 1/4. But Pratt, Howard, and the little girl who was excellent in the movie, lead a very strong cast. It was good fun. Just not hamlet",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
928,liberalareblowhacks,"Not terrible, not fantastic",7,17 September 2018,"Let's face it: The Jurassic Park franchise seems to be approaching the point where it's running out of fresh ideas. This movie, at least in my opinion, struggles with feeling like a Jurassic Park movie. The island portion is a nice slice of 90's nostalgia, making viewers of a certain age bracket reflect on the days when final exams and kissing the opposite sex were the priorities in life. It's actually quite depressing to watch Isla Nublar burn away to nothing before our very eyes, nearly mimicking the effect of watching our childhoods dissipate within a matter of minutes.In my opinion, seeing the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park/World once again on the screen is always a delight. My issue with this movie is that the plot almost seems to be too James Bondish. I mean, arms dealers and human to human murder almost seems too...""brutal"" for a Jurassic Park film. Don't get me wrong, I love dark and violent films. Send me to any Indiana Jones convention and I'll happily defend ""Temple of Doom"" as the best in the series all day long. I felt that this movie, however, was stepping outside of its boundaries in terms of the precedent already set by the franchise. Then again, it was refreshing in a way to be slapped across the face with the harsh realities of the world we live in. We live in a world contaminated by the lull of money and power and this film reflects just that. I don't know; this film left me with a strange feeling after it ended. I didn't know if I should be overjoyed that the dinosaurs we bonded with all these years are now running free and rampant throughout the world, or if I should be laughing myself silly at how ludicrous of an idea it seemed in terms of plot. For example, how in the hell am I supposed to believe that we would allow a T-Rex to stumble around as it very well pleases? With technology these days, it could be easily tracked by aircraft and swiftly eliminated. After all, it's only a matter of time before it comes across a city full of people. What about the casualties that are sure to follow? Also, the idea of a raptor running around? Yeah, Blue was a charming little gal for the duration of the movie, but I don't think her propensity for empathy is going to extend much beyond Pratt's character. 
That's basically where I stand. It was an entertaining two hours, no doubt; definitely worth a viewing. I just hope that they haven't let the overall story of the franchise escape into a territory that's just too far-fetched. If the next film begins with Blue, our beloved velociraptor, paying for dinner and calmly exiting a restaurant somewhere in the western United States, then I know it's time to put this series to rest. It's not 1993 anymore and Jurassic Park has over stood its welcome, but you could do worse. Give this movie a shot.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

 The movie's opening sets itself up for an enjoyable movie, but quickly turns into a generic thriller. Once they get the Dinosaurs off the island, it becomes a movie I'd expect to be a straight to DVD thriller.One of my main gripes with this movie, is the lack of the famous Jurassic Park theme music.

So I watched the movie in theatres let's talk about what I like (rarely) and what I didn't (mostly)What did I like?The movie starts with a blood curdling scene where a man is escaping from I guess Carnotaurus but out of the blue Mosasauras appeared and swallow the man. The scene was so intriguing. My heart was in my mouth.CGI of the movie was great. Especially in the scenes where Owen and the team are escaping and fell into the river. That scene was well shot.

I was stunned with the plot twist with the little girl. My mouth completely dropped! Well done on the plot twist with that. However... the Franklin character worked my last nerve. he was trying way too hard to be funny all the time. Like at some point can you stop with the jokes/sense of humor and process that everything is going to hell and you just might die? This is Jurassic World not Deadpool. I'm also a bit over the coming just in the nick of time thing. The girl stupidly climbed into bed and watched the dinosaur come in and make it's way to her to the point where they're nose to nose and like every movie, not a moment too late, someone comes to her rescue. (Side note) umm...why and how did the dinosaur know how to open the door. Yes, in a previous Jurassic Park we saw a raptor LEARN how to open a door but this one just automatically knew? (EYEROLL). Anyways, yes the film is a bit predictable and just a tad bit rushed. We don't know why these auctioneers want the dinosaurs other than the fact that it must be war related or maybe just for mere amusement? Lastly, when being mauled by a ferocious carnivore, you would think there would be more than a drop of blood. I get the director wanted it to be kid friendly but I was not sold when it came to the deaths. whether you're bit or stepped on, both should result in a decent amount of blood exposure. but overall, I liked it and found the T-rex to be my favorite.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Somehow Chris Pratt was dulled down to a complete bore in this- how can you do that? Dude has so much charisma- yet this movie somehow achieves to do this. A bad movie writes characters into situations just to extend the plot where the writer wants the movie to go- and WOW does that happen in this movie- nearly the entire time. And I'm not nitpicking - just sit back and think about what the characters do- their motivations - just horrendous writing. The ending is a straight up rip of Planet of the Apes - it's not even funny. The twist is laughingly bad - and the way it's told to the audience (exposition city here folks) is just awful. Clearly people who just want to see dinosaurs might enjoy this. If you like any semblance of a plot, character development, intrigue, suspense, then you're not going to find it here. Shame - because I admire the director a lot - but Colin T.'s writing is burning this series to the ground. Jurassic World (1) had some cracks. This movie is a smashed china bowl spread on the floor.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

If you felt like the last film didn't have enough action, then this makes up for it.This film is charming, humorous and action-packed. Nothing will beat the original Jurassic Park and this isn't the exception. But it is a film you should go to see in the cinema to really appreciate it.Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard have good chemistry. I recognised Justice Smith from The Get Down, and he's really funny in the movie. Not over the top, but just the right level of subtle humour.Jeff Goldblum's role is weird to say the least. They could have done a lot more with him and I expecting him to have a lot more screen time than he had. Overall I would have given the movie a good 7.7/10, but since I can't - I rounded it off to an 8. It's still a fun ride either way.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
949,mr_mega_drive,Jurassic World: Fallen Franchise,2,12 June 2018,"I didn't think one of my favourite franchises could sink any lower after the God awful mess of the first Jurassic World. It had no respect or reverence for the original and best movie of the franchise (Jurassic Park) and was a let down from start to finish. The ultimate insults being the ""Madeupasaurus."" and the Raptor/ T-Rex tag team fight at the end.Jurassic World's popularity and success was particularly depressing for me as it showed how low peoples standards have dropped in recent years regarding film making. Everything dumbed down and simplified for your average idiot.For me both Jurassic World films lose the point that Dinosaurs were real and treats them as C.G.I monsters rather than animals. No magic or majesty. Add in terrible writing, no character development and massively overused C.G.I and you have one big pile of s***, say Dr Malcolm once said. Jurassic Park captured the magic that Dinosaurs were real and people forget that because of the ground-breaking C.G.I in Jurassic Park you were 1993 in effect seeing realistic dinosaurs for the first time ever. That was a big, big deal at the time especially for a kid that was already a dinosaur freak like myself.Sadly kids today will never feel the magic and awe I did watching JP in 1993 aged seven. I still maintain the T-Rex ripping down the fence and roaring is hands down the greatest special effects shot in movie history. The characters were likable and believable and the writing was as good as it could have been considering the subject matter. Whilst the limitations of C.G.I at the time meant you only saw the Dinosaurs sparingly. At the end of the day the nearest thing we will ever get to real dinosaurs is Jurassic Park, Jurassic World on the other hand is just Hollywood flogging a dead horse mugging off stupid people who don't know what a good movie is, which sadly seems to happen all to often these days. In my opinion a Dinosaur movie should be more about the fact these amazing creatures once lived and breathed rather than endless action set pieces and the new Jurassic World fails to realise this as did the first which is why both films fail miserably.Jurassic World: Fallen Franchise, for God sake Hollywood stop!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
950,INmovielady,Everything sucked - except Chris Pratt,3,27 June 2018,"This movie sucked. The only redeeming part of this movie was Chris Pratt. But then, he could do a movie just talking about the mating ritual of a meal-worm and I would still pay good money to see it. There's so many holes in this story that this review would be too long. I thought Spielberg and Abrams were part of this movie? How could they be and it still end up so bad? Usually if one or both are involved in something it's a guaranteed amazing film. Not this time. I kept wishing a dinosaur would gobble up that little girl. She kept screaming! And who hides from a dinosaur in their bed? Bed covers do not make a good form of protection.

I guess that over time, you can never recreate the amazement of something which is totally new (as in the very first movie), so jadedness can creep in. But in this case I found myself actually distracted during the movie (not just due to the kitchen sink being thrown at me) as I found is fairly predictable also (""Ohh look - says I to myself - , there's the bad guy from Silence of the Lambs, I wonder if he's playing a baddie again....""). Right at the start I KNEW the ridiculously large monster fishy would leap out of the water and grab the guy off the ladder (that's some very precise biting right there). So my attention / mind wondered off a bit, together with some goofs (as listed in the goof section) which absolutely killed it for me. I'd like to see this franchise going right back to basics - the times when you didn't see everything in the first five minutes (today's attention span?), but where when you did see the monster/creature it had much more of an impact. Let's get back to some basics in movie making and create a sense of impending dread a little more; this was more like a crazy Disney ride, and one I wanted to get off.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

I also found myself rooting for the various dinos (so many different breeds now they all blur into one) particularly poor Blue, the mass murdering pet of Chris Pratt in its previously dismal rebooting.

964,aristevenhitchcock,A well Made Jurassic Film which actually made a very strong point.,8,22 June 2018,"Jurassic World: The Fallen Kingdom is the best Jurassic series film after the lost world. The way the film has been treated it was really awesome. Though the storyline is not very different from the lost world, but the treatment and narrative style of that same storyline is quite unique and different in this film. Unlike Jurassic World which was completely similar with the 1st film. In this film we can actually see the dinosaurs as what they actually are, as intelligent animals, just like a huge elephant or a fearsome Tiger, and not just powerful vicious monsters, which we humans used for our own profits. The ending scene of the 1st Act with the Brachiosaurus is very emotionally crafted and it brought tears to my eyes. That one single shot captures the whole inner philosophy of the Jurassic series, Which Ian Malcolm and Alan Grant talked about in the dinner scene of the 1st movie. ""Dinosaurs and man, two species separated by sixty-five million years of evolution have just been suddenly thrown back into the mix together. How can we possibly have the slightest idea what to expect?"". The emotional relation between Owen Grady and Blue the raptor is the heart of the film.
Yes, I do have to admit that some of the characters are not very well written specially the villains of the film is not very strong and one dimensional. But the inner conflict of the storyline is so, strong that we can easily overlook those small glitches. In a way Jurassic World: The Fallen Kingdom is a modern Jurassic series film, made for the Modern audiences, with some of the creative decisions which might or might not be appreciated by the fan of the Series, and obviously you should not compare this film with the 1st one, it's a whole different film then the 1st one, with some well place tributeable shots.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

969,grturner-59687,A mess,4,8 June 2018,"Suffers from a messy plot, annoying characters, predictability and a lack of fun.If you're looking for lots of exciting, CGI dino action, you won't get it here. The dinosaurs spend the majority of their time caged up. It has an 'animal rights' theme throughout, they seem more interested in that than giving us a fun movie. What action there is is very predictable, such as when a bad guy tranquilizes a dino then tries to take a tooth out, you know that dino is gonna wake up and kill him. Jeff Goldblum has a neat cameo, but he should have had a more meainingful part in this film. Instead we get a few new characters, who are very annoying. You have a computer nerd whose an utter coward, and a woman who works with him whose a stereotypical 'i don't take nonsense from any guy!' person. Neither are good characters although the nerds cowardice is mildly amusing. The baddies are all stereotypical corporate men who only care about money. There's absurd plot holes. Owen gets woken up by a dinosaur licking him after he's been tranquilized. WTF?? Soon after he's somehow able to outrun a erupting volcano. He also survives for ages underwater. he's got more powers than star lord! They introduce a new character who was John Hammonds partner, who was never mentioned in any other of the movies. And a human is revealed to be a clone, yet this revelation is met with barely any surprise and is never mentioned again. The film makes no real effort to make sense. The new hydrid dinosaur is a letdown, it does nothing except kill a few baddies. Can't even win a one on one fight with blue. This film and the last one makes a big deal out of dino hydrids but they don't give this one any screentime. A few positives are the volcano sequence, which is very impressive seeing the doomed dinos running from it. The opening score is good, and the end sets up a potentially good story for the next film. But there's not enough good moments. The story had a lot of promise, corporate men trying to sell dinosaurs is interesting, but this film is just lazy.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

973,blanston-25010,Better than I expected...,7,9 October 2020,"Fallen Kingdom, the fifth Jurassic Park film, seems to confirm this franchise's tentative rule of the odd numbered films being good (or at least entertaining in the case of JP3), and the evens being awful. It takes some strange and unexpected turns, but honestly these movies could use some of that.One of the things I dislike about pretty much all of the sequels are the kids. Lex and Tim are great in the first movie, but in all the other sequels they're either in the film for inexplicable reasons (parasailing near dinosaur island), they're doing ridiculous things (like using their special gymkata powers to karate kick velociraptors), or they're just downright unlikeable (I'm looking at you, Jurassic World kids). The little girl in this film is both likeable, and also serves a major plot function, so credit where credit's due. Also, no one intentionally brings her to, nor does she decide to sneak onto, an island populated by giant carnivorous lizards that have already killed many people, so someone with a functioning brain actually wrote the script.The subplot with Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) and his trained velociraptor was handled really well and comes off more sweet than stupid.They're still low-key toying with the whole InGen, genetic industrial complex merging with military industrial complex story, which still sounds ridiculous (then again, we did attempt to weaponize dolphins at one point, so who knows), but it's not a major factor in the story, thankfully.The first thirty minutes feels like a reboot of 'Lost World', but it has a ticking clock element to spice it up a bit. The film gets better in its' latter portion, in my opinion.All-in-all, I think 'Fallen Kingdom' is a very good movie, and I consider it the best Jurassic Park/World movie since the original film. Not a high bar, considering the quality of the other sequels, but this one raises said bar and hopefully the follow-up, 'Jurassic World: Dominion' breaks the series' evens/odds rule.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
974,inesargenzio,honestly,6,8 January 2019,I didn't like the movie at all but i just fell more in love with chris pratt,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
975,erenxmikasaever,Fallen Franchise,3,16 January 2019,"It really pains me to write this review. Mainly because I spent a year of my life following this movie's development, but also because I REALLY love Jurassic Park. I love the first movie, The Lost World, and I even adore Jurassic World 1. I am actually obsessed with the first Jurassic World, so I really had high hopes for Fallen Kingdom.The first time I saw Fallen Kingdom, I liked it. But that was due to the hype, and because I followed this movie's development for so long, I think a subconscious part of my brain denied me from seeing its flaws the first viewing. But it was with my second viewing...did I start to see the movie's massive problems.Let me just get the few pros out of the way, the dinosaurs look really good to me. The animatronics and CG look fine, and Bryce as Claire did a really good job. And oddly, one of the best things about it was its marketing, specially the DPG, Dinosaur Protection Program website they made to market the film. It was actually a fun and creative website where you could 'adopt' a dinosaur, similar to how you can adopt an endangered species of animal, and there's nice stuff for kids as well. Oh, and the scene with Owen, Claire and Franklin under water was the only suspenseful scene. And I guess I also liked the opening scene with the T rex and Mosasaur.But other than those few pros, the movie is a disaster. Not only did the constant repeating/ripping off of the original Jurassic Park get downright obnoxious to sit through after a while, but this movie is full of stupid and a lack of understanding basic science.Chris Pratt surviving being engulfed in volcanic smoke, and not a single burn from being paralyzed inches from running lava...look, I get its fun to make Chris Pratt tough, but this is CARTOON CHARACTER levels of ridiculous!I think the biggest annoyance was the new hybrid, the Indoraptor. A, we don't need yet another hybrid. B, the creation of this animal was completely pointless. Why train an animal to attack someone using the led light on a rifle when you can just SHOOT the person you're sicking the Raptor on?!And don't even get me started on the other issues, like the unrealistically low bidding prices for the dinosaurs, the dinosaur vet who's never actually seen a dinosaur before despite Jurassic World being an open park for a few years, and filled with dinosaur vets who worked with the animals, the pointless Re-Romance build up for Owen and Claire, and an annoyingly preachy tone.Oh yeah, and a human clone! Yes, a human clone is in this movie. They went there. Why? I think they were trying to be shocking and add something new, but it still falls flat because barely any focus is put on it, so it just leaves the viewer confused.I think the movie's biggest problem is that it doesn't know what it wants to be. It's a badly blended mix of black comedy, drama, action/adventure and even straight up cartoon levels of humor.In Jurassic Park, the human characters had intellect conversations about the dangers of bringing back dinosaurs, treating the viewers like they were smart and provided provoking thought material, spanning out each dinosaur attack scene perfectly so its not too much. When you build up to a dinosaur scene, it makes the scene more powerful because you're anticipating it.In The Lost World, we got a conflict on the dinosaurs really being like any other normal animal, and how cruel humanity can even effect them.In Jurassic World, we finally got to see the park be opened and how that would effect mankind, and even shows how the greed of humans have no limit because once sales dropped just a bit, they jumped into making a hybrid.But in Fallen Kingdom its just one dinosaur attack after another, with very limited dialogue, and what little there is doesn't even come close to being mature or smart writing. ""Nasty woman""? Really?It also doesn't help that Fallen Kingdom just feels like an obvious ripoff of The Lost World, even though Isla Sorna doesn't appear once and isn't even mentioned.Fallen Kingdom doesn't only contradict everything from the original Jurassic Park, but its even feels dirtier when you read the original Jurassic Park novel and have a better understanding of what type of story the author was trying to tell. I want to hope the final film will actually be good, since its the final one...but I'm not holding my breath after this mess. You know this is a hard pass when me, a diehard fan of the series, doesn't even buy this when it came out on DVD, and instead bought the Matel Big Bite T Rex figure. A collectible toy gave me more enjoyment and entertainment than this movie. If a 25 year can say that, then you know this movie has BIG problems.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

They went for superficial reasons why we should or shouldn't save the dinosaurs, and didn't dig deeper into these reasons, just expected us to buy it, and go along with that senseless adventure.
The film has several cliches that were unnecessary, like the way the two leads interacted and a lot of scenes that contain that old last second saving that make us roll our eyeballs.
The way the music was used was so underwhelming, that we could see a lot of missed opportunities to go for high emotional impact and just failed to do so.

Movie had a lot of original premise and circumstance. I actually got scared of dinos again, just like when I met the beloved T. rex as a kid. The only shame is how the plot came short and maybe a little hollow, but the love and inspiration was still there. It's obvious a JP fanboy made this film. Maybe a few more creative fans are what we need in Hollywood.
I feel IMDb is too full of righteousness. People who believe a film is bad because it only leads justice for the fans. That's wrong, which is why I gave it 10 to counter this unfair average. Just cause you don't ""get it"" doesn't mean it's bad.

I will admit I was pleased to see them finally use robotic dinosaurs when they were up close with them. Overall, the sequels need to stop because they are starting to blend in with the Sharknado movies. Jurassic Park was amazing when it first came out in what 1993? And it is still amazing in 2018.

988,EmilyApricot,The Next Episode,4,1 October 2018,"This is really disappointing after Jurassic World was such a great film and showed such promise for the franchise. I just rewatched JW 1 and it is still amazing with it's premise of opening the park and getting it right, irresponsible leadership and arrogance, and a suspenseful plot leading up to an exciting conclusion. JW Fallen Kingdom starts with a promising premise about an adventure to save the remaining dinosaurs from extinction, but winds up dealing more with corporate greed and politics than action/adventure or humanitarianism. There is a touching sideplot with a little girl and an old man who are somehow related to John Hammond, but overall, this is an episodic sideshow showcasing more dinos, more destruction, and more bad decisions. The threequel, Jurassic World 3 promises a plot involving dinosaurs on the mainland. THAT sounds like a promising plot that we haven't seen done before better in a full movie. Please, just put as much budget into the screenplay as you do into the special effects. Yes, they were amazing, but it is 2018, and there are a lot of effects movies.

994,zakmorrisotl,Motive?,1,10 May 2019,"Okay. I get that this is a Hollywood blockbuster but this is some of the worst writing ever. A good villain has a good motive and back story. Some times you even sympathize with them and in their eyes they aren't bad at all. The villain in this film runs the estate for a overly wealthy man who has amassed a fortune. His motive: make more money. The best way to go about it: run an elaborate billion dollar scheme to illegally smuggle dinosaurs and genetically alter them to turn around and sell for more money. I mean how much money must it have cost this guy to start this operation? Hire a small army, boats, top genetic scientists etc. Also, having a dinosaur is a weird flex but ok... but as a weapon? It's like having a ninja and dropping him into a war zone. He may kill ten people but eventually someone is shooting him. How many people would a raptor kill in an active war zone before getting shot? The hybrid raptor can be laser guided, which means you would have a man on the ground pointing to where the raptor would go and potentially eat people. I would think a guided middle would be both less expensive and much more effective. On another note, Bryce Dallas Howard was atrocious. She played the typical 90's action film damsel in distress and played it poorly. Jeff Goldblum was in the scenes they showed in the preview and that's it. I can't really reiterate just how bad this film is. Not only did someone write this but a billion dollar company green lit this and filmed it.

Instead we get a more serious and predicable puppet that nobody should like when it comes to Chris Pratt. Supporting cast was very weak and unlikeable too.

1015,jurassicsean,A Beautiful Mess,5,2 August 2018,"On a technical level, this film is very solid. Cinematography, visual effects, lighting, music, etc. All the behind-the-scenes aspects of this film are really solid. 
The biggest flaw is the script. The ""characters"" in the film are not really characters. None of them experience any growth or developement. They don't learn any lessons. They're just flat and boring. The dinosaurs are represented well (for the most part), except for Blue and the Indoraptor. Blue comes off as being more of a superhero, always there to save Chris Pratt when he's in danger, instead of being a real animal. The Indoraptor has a really cool design, but is ultimately useless. It runs through a house for about half an hour, stalking a little girl like a movie monster, then dies, not escaping with the others into the rest of the world, making it pointless to even have it in the movie. I also personally hate how it exists for the stupid plot of wanting to militarize dinosaurs. When the film takes place on the mainland, it honestly feels like a cartoon, not meant to be taken seriously. One last complaint is how disappointing it is that the film almost had a message, but only focuses on it for two minutes, then forgets about it. This film had the potential to be the second best Jurassic film, but utterly fails, like the others.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1016,scrampto-24790,A Little Dissapointed,5,27 June 2018,"Meh, I'd give it a 5.5/10. I thought #JurassicWorldFallenKingdom was okay. Not good, but okay. It was probably tied with JP3 for worst Jurassic film in the series and definitely didn't live up to the previous movie. I was just kind of disappointed. I left the theater unsatisfied. JWFK was drawn out, tedious, and predictable. Hell, most of the movie takes place in the mansion/estate. The best part of JWFK is everything in the first half of the movie up until the point that they left Isla Nublar as it was being destroyed by the volcano (if you've seen the previews, you've basically seen the entire movie). In addition, the plot was terrible and the acting was mediocre from everyone. Especially the little girl, Maisie, who just screamed the whole time and lacked any sort of basic survival instincts. Furthermore, how can they say ""the dinosaurs are becoming re-extinct"" if there's another island full of dinosaurs (Isla Sorna, Site B)? And am I the only one who thought the Indoraptor really wasn't all that scary, or threatening? I mean the Indominus Rex was stronger, faster, smarter, and was far more deadly and terrifying. My only other gripe is that the JP/JW carnivores are exceedingly one-dimensional and flat. The only thing they do is hunt, scare, kill, and eat any living thing in sight 24/7. No matter the situation. They have no emotions or anything else better to do. The only exceptions to this are Blue (Velociraptor), the Indominus (I-Rex), Rexy (T-Rex) to an extent, and that one random seen in JP3 with the Ceratosaurus and the Spino poop.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1017,pozahedi,Jurassic World? More like Jurassic Mansion,4,12 July 2018,"First of all I wonder why more than half of the movie is set in a closed enviroment. It decreases the room for movement and makes the dinosaurs less envoyable. Moreover being in the dark night increased that impression. (At some point I was wondering if Batman would join).So the film director didn't choose the appropriate surrounding to use the full potential of his creatures and even in the island part he found a way to put a scene in a drain. More daylight and natural landscape would have been more relevant. 
I was also disappointed by many other aspect of the movie such as the lack of charisma concerning the characters, the poor use of the T-Rex and the plot which is too simple. As a dinosaurs lover I didn't get value for money even if at some moment a very quick appearance of an Allosaure made me smile. 
One more advice, do NOT watch all the trailers on youtube...it basically sums up the best scene.
In conclusion I expected way more from this movie even if I knew that it wouldn't be even close to Jurassic Park 1 which is in my opinion a masterpiece.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

The movie is fast-paced, flashy and has more dinosaurs than it has time to properly show. It does stray from the formula of the original movie, but it probably has to. That doesn't mean the movie lacks depth, or that the story is bad. Sure, the story is nothing amazing and it recycles some of the ideas of older movies. But it shows a deeper level of human nature and it places Jurassic World into a bigger picture. It also manages to make you sad, probably more than any of the other Jurassic movies. The locations are gorgeous and the movie breaths a lot of atmosphere. One thing I can see people dislike is that the movie is split in two, with two completely different settings. It's spectacular, it has a lot of dinosaur action, it's pretty, funny and sometimes terrifying. I can't wait to see it again.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

What I don't like about Fallen kingdom is the fact that my inner boy and dinosaur fan gets disappointed when the movie is basically about human beings mistreating gorgeous animals. The Lost World: Jurassic Park had the same problem. People shooting dinosaurs and pulling out their teeth violently is not a nice thing to see. I know they're not real animals but it hurts to see the mighty T-Rex sedated and in a small cage.
Simple mayhem and survival action is what made Jurassic Park 3 and Jurassic World much better movies than this.

Ends up being total nonsense as the bad guys want to use the rescued dinosaurs as military weapons, where they basically become laser guided. Uh yeah, right. So what are they planning to do exactly? Fly a ferocious dinosaur weighing over a ton to where the war is, then point a laser at the target and set it loose? Gee, I have an idea! How about replacing the guy pointing the laser at the target with an expert sniper, who can take out the target with one bullet! But no, their proposal is to have the dinosaur charge in? OK, but don't people at war time have weapons that they can use to take out the dinosaurs?
So glad I watched this on HBO, and recorded, so I could fast forward thru all the useless footage towards the end. Other than the great CGI, this movie is a total waste of time.

1036,jd-538-793868,Fallen Kingdom is a new low for the Jurassic Franchise.,4,21 June 2018,"""The Park Is Gone"" is the log line for this, being the 5th entry in the film series, based upon Michael Crichton's novel, ""Jurassic Park"" - Steven Spielberg directed the first two installments, where due to a greedy computer programmer looking sabotaged the park, in an attempt to flee with a shaving cream can full of dinosaur embryos, during a storm. His escape attempt, unwittingly deactivated all the safety measures and the cloned dinosaurs run amok, as the first few guests must flee for their lives. And the second film, ""The Lost World"" followed a venture onto Site B, where the Dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, were being raised before moving to the main park on a separate island, to bring some dinosaurs to a new San Diego based park. The lackluster Jurassic Park 3 involved rescuing someone's son, who trespassed to the Site B island. The film franchise lay dormant for over a decade, until Colin Trevorrow, director of ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" was offered to helm a reboot / return to Pre-Cambiran theme park. Trevorrow brought some big ideas, which, largely meant ignoring all but the first film, and weirdly, ostracizing it. In 2015's Jurassic World, a parks system operator, played by Jake Johnson, gets chastised by his boss, Bryce Dallas Howard's ""Claire"" for wearing a 'vintage' Jurassic Park shirt, while working the renovated park, that still bore many holdovers and shoddy homages to the original. In the Jurassic World timeline, shortly after the events of the first film, a new investor began to work with John Hammond to fix and open the park, though apparently under a different name, where it has been running for over 10 years, updating features, rides, and various other experiences as the technology became available. Jurassic Park was already on the cutting edge in 1993, Jurassic World, in 2015 was on the bleeding edge, well beyond the quaint Thinking Machines and Super Computers. Fallen Kingdom, takes place 3 years after the events of Jurassic World, where a genetically modified 'designer dinosaur' managed to escape its enclosure and run amok through the park, because it just so happened to have enough of a little bit of every other kind of dinosaur, that it could control them. The MacGuffin-o-saurus could do anything and everything and was mean and smart and bloodthirsty and was, with 3 years of hindsight, boring to have such an over powered engine of pure malice. Jurassic World was a huge success at the box office, and the producers got Colin Trevorrow on to write the next two films, he was originally slated to direct Star Wars Episode 9, after Jurassic World, but had made a smaller film called ""The Book of Henry"" which, performed so poorly, and with the post-honeymoon conversations about Jurassic World not having the legs J.P. had, made Lucasfilm doubt Trevorrow was a directorial golden boy, and pulled the Star Wars film from him, and gave it to JJ Abrams. Trevorrow had also passed the torch to direct a Jurassic World sequel off to J.A. Bayona, the disciple of Guillermo Del Toro, whom had directed 2009's The Orphanage, 2012's The Impossible and 2016's ""A Monster Calls."" Bayona proved himself to be a powerful visual storyteller, though still had to play in Trevorrow's sandbox, as he was still the writer and an Executive Producer. Fallen Kingdom, falls short of being its own movie, and is more a remake of The Lost World than anything, with a group of goons led by a 'great white hunter' played by Ted Levine (The Silence of The Lambs), working for John Hammond's previously non-existent business partner, who wanted to rescue as many dinosaurs as possible, since Isla Nublar, where Jurassic Park/World is/was, faces a fiery volcanic destruction, any day now. Survivors from Jurassic World, Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt must go back to rescue ""Blue"" Pratt's pet Velociraptor, whom he had trained, and was the only person who could get close enough to the dino to offload her from the the island. Pratt's ""Owen"" tracks the Raptor down to, the same site, where, 25 years earlier, an electric Jurassic Park Ford Explorer had been knocked off its track and hurled into a tree by the T.Rex. Once out in the open, the Raptor gets tranq'd and we curse the sudden, yet inevitable betrayal by the Hunter and his horde, and we find out that Lockwood (James Cromwell)'s assistant Eli Mills (Rafe Spall) has no intention of relocating the dinosaurs to a safe haven, but to auction them off to a cabal of ridiculous rejected Bond Villains. The film is half, disaster porn and half sneaking around a mansion, but can't help borrowing heavily from The Lost World at every turn. The Story is by far the weakest of any Jurassic film, but attempts to open get the scope of the future films off the Island, and increase the dinosaur presence around the world and attempts to play philosophical with the ethics of do the dinosaurs deserve to live and even gets into the troublesome area of human cloning. Fallen Kingdom feels more like a ride at Universal, rather than its own film, as none of the stakes have any teeth, despite the constant threat of toothed carnivores. There are some fun moments, but they are far outnumbered by stupid sequences. I don't blame J.A. Bayona for the dull moments of the film, he's able to create some truly spectacular, impossible shots that must have taken months to render, because they were clearly shot in some green screen prison. The story also drags its feet by retreading the 'designer dinosaur' angle, this time with an ""Indio Raptor"" a smaller version of the ""Indominous Rex"" - The film's timeline, and even the dinosaurs felt inconsistent between shots, the iRaptor varied wildly from the size of a large horse to almost elephantine size, and then small enough to fit through a door. I went in wanting to like this movie, but i had more problems with it, than i could set aside and attempt to enjoy it. And rather than continue the path these films are on, Frank Marshall (the Producer) should take a queue from his wife Kathleen Kennedy (Head of Lucasfilm) and remove Colin Trevorrow from any future films, and also look at how Sony handled ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" films, and just sweep the Jurassic World Franchise under the rug, and start over. It doesn't necessarily matter if a film makes money, if it hurts the IP, and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom hurts the Jurassic Franchise. 4/10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

But this one, I don't ever want to watch again. This entry to the series is painfully dreadful. For me, the dinosaurs dying on the island was so heartwrenching to be unbearable, and putting the creatures so much at risk - even though they were in other films, but this was just devastating. This story though lacked any sensibility or cohesion. All the side stories contributed so little, it just left so little to want to see, not even wanting to see the end. It was a sorry addition.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

All the bad guys except D.B. wong getting killed off in the end by the dinosaurs is predictable.

1046,cameronsfx,Cringe-worthy cash grab by Universal!,5,2 July 2018,"The PlotThe island has a volcano that is about to erupt and will kill all the dinos. John Hammond's ex-partner, Lockwood, sends in Claire and Owen to save Blue (the raptor) and the other dinosaurs. But, his assistant is mounting a double cross and sends in a massive team to capture the dinos and sell them to the highest bidder.How much do the dinos sell for?All went for like $150 million. Not billion but million. Gee...the arrogance before nature is astounding. It is revealed in the film that the Masrani Corporation paid out $800 million in lawsuits to people hurt at Jurassic World's theme park. But, hey, dinos are only worth $10-20 million a piece.Anyway, they save 11 dinos and bring them back to Lockwood's huge mansion that also has a lab underneath it where his assistant has Dr. Wu creating a new Dino based on Blue since she takes orders....but he needs Blue's DNA to make it all work.Even more astounding is Lockwood's granddaughter is revealed to be a creation using the DNA of his dead daughter. She's a clone, which makes no sense whatsoever. Dr. Wu is one busy dude playing God with genetics.Oh, the last act of the movie happens in a mansion. Not the island. A mansion. Did they run out of money for sets? The budget was only $170 million compared to the Jurassic World's $150 million and seems way cheaper than the latter.Yes, the special effects are top-notch, but the script was written by teenagers for a high school project and it sucks.The Port Authority. Oh, yeah, a massive operation bringing in dinos apparently does not startle the port authority in California. Huge, unrealistic plothole. I guess since they did it at night, maybe the port authority just didn't notice a massive army of guys in military gear bringing in dinos.Unlike JW, there is no big dino battle at the end. No T-rex taking on an Indominus Rex. Two raptors fight with Owen in the middle all over a mansion. Yes, a mansion. How exciting.The ending is absolutely ridiculous and sets up a sequel, which will be another cash grab by Universal.The only standout character in the whole film is Daniella Pineda, a dino doctor. She's fun and terrific. The rest are forgettable. Daniella had all the best lines. Owen has been relegated to some wussy with Claire as the brave one.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1050,spencerjelmore,Lackluster,6,25 June 2018,"It's really a shame that such beautiful visuals and elaborate animatronics can be so meaningless unless they are nested in a good story. Jurassic World: The Fallen Kingdom is nothing but eye candy and that is where the entertainment comes from. Any audience member looking for a story with substance will cringe. Character choices feel forced, dialogue is poor, recycled plot points, and a lack of imagination in a universe that was forged on it. The same sequences just done worse than before; for example: a dramatic brontosaurus introduction or hiding from raptors in a house. The only plot point that was different from other Jurassic movies before is the dynamic surrounding the young girl who is cloned. This to me was the only new fresh element to this movie and it takes a back seat the first hour of the movie. There are too many plot holes to count so I will avoid getting into them. There are no risks to really explore any new themes in this movie, but took away any creative elements that might help us look past those. I really tried to go in with an open mind and hope the visuals would carry me through and they did, but start thinking for a second why characters are doing what they are doing and there really is no logical explanation. This is an entire team of people working to polish and salvage something great out of poorly written screenplay. This, to me, falls on the shoulders of the writers and is just another indication that writers of large budget studio films need to simply care more. Hard to believe that Spielberg approved of this script.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

The set pieces were great and unlike a lot of other people, i thought that the House scenes were a lot of fun and had a lot of interesting things about it. Despite all of that. The one thing that the film fails at is the plot and characters. The plot, at times, can be very messy and convoluted and the pacing was all over the place at points. The characters were very uninteresting and most lines of dialogue were jokes and placed for comedic effect. I think the film was extremely fun, but very lacking in the points that a film like this needs to be great. 8/10. Maybe a 7/10.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

I actually fell asleep the first time I watched it and had to go back to the movies and watch it again. I grew up on the Jurassic park movies and I really liked the first Jurassic world, so the only word I can think to describe this movie was disappointing. The only good thing I can say about it was the acting was not bad. It seemed like Chris Pratt did the best he could with a lousy script and a boring messy plot. And the whole clone type thing with the little girl was kinda dumb. I mean it was bound to happen with the whole making living things in a lab they were eventually going to try to make a human. I just thought it just added to the cheesy ness of it all. So I have to give it a 5/10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1054,michaelseanmcgowan,Like a Jenga tower of Stupid,1,26 June 2018,"Every time you wonder if Fallen Kingdom can get any more determinedly, aggressively dumb, the movie winks at you and says ""Here, hold my beer."" If you thought the lowest this franchise could get was an in-dream velociraptor barking ""Alan!"" at Sam Neill, then hold your nose- you're about to take a plunge into the deep end.I'm at a lost as to what can recommend the movie at all, since from the outset there's barely a moment that isn't at odds with common sense. It now turns out Isla Nubar, the site of both Jurassic Park and Jurassic World, is also the home of a dormant-now-turned-active volcano. Since the modern geological classification of a dormant volcano is actually ""potentially active,"" building your billion-dollar theme parks here now makes as much sense as building a new Disney World on the slopes of Mt. Saint Helens. Since this would mean extinction for these back-from-the-dead dino-critters, there's now a call to rescue them, including from Jurassic World corporate shill-turned-dinosaur-advocate Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard). This reversal I don't mind. I can see someone going from seeing these beasts as a source of profit to living creatures in need of protection, if we're taken along that arc. Alas, Fallen Kingdom has no time for arcs, character development, or any sort of nuance. It has its characters do, say, and act as the plot necessitates at any given moment. Full stop.The first third of the movie plays as a weak sauce parody of every other film in the series, as Claire and raptor-whisperer Owen (Chris Pratt doing his Star Lord shtick- minus the charm, charisma, likability, dance skills, etc...) scramble to the island to organize a kind of Cretaceous Noah's Ark at the behest of Discount John Hammond (James Cromwell). Of course, the Powers That Be are up to no good, and this is where Fallen Kingdom really begins its death spiral. Not only does it double-down on the absurd villain motivations from the last movie (yeah, the dinosaurs are wanted as potential military assets because that makes TONS of sense), but takes on the creepy-house shenanigans of a lame Scooby Doo episode. If there is any upside to Fallen Kingdom, it's that it might finally put the nail in the coffin of a franchise that's long-since run out original things to say or to show . ""Remember the first time you saw a dinosaur?"" Claire asks Owen at one point. Yes, Claire, we do. And it was in a much, much better movie than this.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Full of excitement, drama and cliffhangers, this film had both me and my friend on edge for the whole duration of the film. Everything was there; the setting was perfect, and there were many ups and downs.

The only thing I found thrilling and great about this film is the opening of this film that kept me in my seat but unfortunately that didn't last for another more than more hours of this film. Let me be more nice; the acting was alright and Chris Pratt and Bryce were fine in their role, the cinematography was cool to look at, and the CGI looked amazing for the dinosaurs design. Now the bad, this film is a total mess, the film introduces certain subplots that are all like a mess and the film is not good for a story. This film manages to find a solution to make dinosaurs a boring plot device just to put them like objects moving and nobody to care about. The villain, hm, the villain was very bland, very generic and only purpose in the film; Money. Hated the mansion subplot of the film,it was just there to make the indoraptor just run in hallways and that's it. The film is painfully average, and unlike the previous jurassic park movies, its not memorable either. Overall Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a painfully very average film that doesn't live up to any story but a mess of subplots that are just thrown in because it wants to, CGI was amazing though, cinematography was great, characters were fine but most were rather annoying and it's a film that isn't thrilling, nor enjoyable or memorable and I found it a mess of an unnecessary film that nobody wanted. 5/10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Clarie (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) are back to the roles of the previous movie (also dissatisfactory), as the antagonists of a system that just exploits financially the creation - and selling - of dinosaurs and similar specimens.

If I'm going to find an example that sets a good tone then will be most marvel movies, it knows that it self is a comic book movie, and it plays around it, not like DC movies. It is funny, but there are never jokes during the intense scenes. So back to this piece Jurassic shit, from the trailer I thought this is going to be more like a horror movie which I think it is good, but there are stupid jokes during the most intense scenes. So which one is it? Do you want me to be scared or be happy, because I really can't do that at the same time. This tech person which is the comedic relief of this movie, he is fking disgusting, he is the most annoying thing ever, every time he is about to die, he screams like a girl, and people will think it is funny, which is not btw.The story doesn't make any sense, it keep saying that we should save the dinosaurs, but through out the entire movie I didn't find any reason that they should be alive! If I were them I just let all those things die, they are dangerous and expensive, and beside, humans will always make more even they shouldn't. This army guys is super annoying, and he let out the dinosaur is because he wants it tooth, like WTF! It doesn't make any fking sense! There are so many thing in this movie doesn't make any sense that take me out of the movie so many times.Every time this movie try to build up tension it failed, you need time to make the audience to be scared, but every time it falls short or ends it with a stupid joke. And it is so obvious what is going to happen that if you make a prediction it probably gonna happen, so you feel no tension at all, you don't worry about them, if I don't worry about them, then why should I care AT ALL? Everything in this movie is lazy, the cinematography is lazy, the script is lazy, the actors clearly doesn't give a shit. The only scene that is not lazy is the scene where they collect the T. rex's Blood, which they use practicle affect, which means they make an actual dinosaur head, that scene looks very real and natural because there is some thing for the actor react to, and I very much appreciate that, but rest is total dog shit, the shot composition have no meaning at all, out of the entire movie, there are only two shots I like, and I only can remember one of them.

That being said, both Chris Pratt, reprising his role as Owen Grady, and Bryce Dallas Howard, as Claire Dearing, were wonderful- but the movie itself left me wanting more. Yes, visually it was a spectacle, but the story itself left me wanting more. Jeff Goldblum, returning as Ian Malcolm from the original trilogy, did a wonderful job of bringing up the idea of man trying to manipulate nature, but I, again, was left wanting more! It is my opinion that the film could have gone deeper into the ongoing discussion of genetic manipulation/reconstruction, in addition to the continued attempt to weaponize the dinosaurs.

The story plot was predictable, lacked suspense, and was just overall disappointing. Even the Dinosaurs seemed tamed and watered down.

1075,cmcelraft,Jurassic Auction,6,26 July 2018,"Jurassic Workd: Fallen Kingdom starts out with the question: if a genetically modified organism is on the brink of extinction, should there be efforts to save the organism. The premise of this movie basically answers the question with the two main characters choosing to rescue the ""terrible lizards"". The story moves on to a very far fetched (wait, I'm talking about a movie with cloned dinosaurs!) auction that involves caged dinosaurs. It becomes pretty ridiculous from there on, but then becomes the Jurassic dinosaurs on the loose movie we all know and love. Chris Pratt is, well Chris Pratt. Bryce Dallas Hiward does a good job, and I was glad to have Jeff Goldblum in the opening scene. Of course it's set up for a sequel, which could make for an interesting story.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1076,Irto_042,"It's not worried with delivering a good movie, but only with making money",1,8 January 2021,"First of all, the CGI feels like it has downgraded. The textures are quite bad.
Second and most important, the scrip is awful and it gets worse and worse throughout the movie. The villains constantly do things for no reason (like remove the teeth from a dinosaur or firing a tutor just because) just to show how bad they are. The comedy scenes are added before super triggering scenes of dinossaus and other animals being physically tortured (which happens ALL THE TIME).
And finally, during action scenes, the characters do crazy things to survive (like shooting a gun underwater, popping a glass with a knife, ""flying"" with a truck and now Cris Prat can controlany dinossaur).
But it's pretty nostalgic, it makes you remember the old movies with amazing technique.

The whole story is a garbage. It is really hard to get one or more piece out of it because there is simply no sense at all.
There are some logical decisions which doesn't make sense... well almost no decisions make any sense.SPOILER!!!The small girl lets out the dinosaurs to rampage in the city. Great idea. How people will love this idea when hundreds or thousands will die and at the end when the military kills all the animals the whole chaos will end. What a nice idea from the child.The whole story by the way is full of cliches. Honestly all the moments I remember from the old movies are somewhere in this one. No originality at all and no surprises...Btw, can someone explain me why would anyone... ANYONE who has millions of dollars would spend money on an animal who is an uncontrollable killing machine? And what will the dino do against heavy arms? Come on... Only 6 years old kids would believe this whole plot.

1081,jbdriesenaar,"Worst Jurassic Park movie, still entertaining",6,22 August 2018,"The good: 
Dino's. Great CGI, better than before. Nice looking lead actors. Pratt for the ladies, Howard for the men. Not complaining.The opening scene. It nicely sets a stage and raises tension.Special effects: yes I already mentioned the dino's but the actors running from an exploding vulcano and a stampede of dino's looked very epic.My 7 year old son loved it.The bad:
Bland characters. JP never was Shakespeare, but in the past actors like Sam Neill at least added some heart to the movie. Except for the lead actors (who are just flat people, but people), the rest of the roles are played like cartoon characters. The story: unnecessarily convoluted. Cloned girls, evil corporations. The movie just needs a simple reason to let dino's loose for suspension of disbelieve to work. This just distracted and detracted. The sets: the familiar island was okay but some mansion that could have been in Harry Potter and a bunker complex that seemed to come from Cabin in the Woods felt really out of place.The supporting actors: the latina tough girl and geeky black guy seemed added just for 'muh diversity' as they added nothing to the movie. They weren't funny or interesting. To be honest Pratt and Howard weren't interesting or funny either, but at least they were not annoying. Something about most supporting roles seemed off. I suppose that is down to poor acting and directing. Overall:
This wants to be a thrill ride, and taken as such it was ok. Not as good as the best thrill rides coming from Hollywood though, and it had the budget to compete. The special effects are great, but story and cast lack heart and inspiration. Probably worth a 4 or 5 but since my son loved it, I gave it a six. Some scenes show limbs being bitten off, but without those scenes it is actually a very kid friendly movie as the dino's are far more important to them than the acting.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1086,grahambrown26,"Awful in concept, plot and characters. CGI cannot mask forced acting.",2,17 August 2018,"As an actor in this sequel, even less involving than its predecessor, I'd be keen to move on to other challenges and file this outing under 'mistake'. None of the players comes out of it with credit. 
In their defence, the script they were handed is about as dire as they come. However, they could have declined. The money must have been too good for some and the second tier will have been extremely glad to be cast in a major and now legendary franchise. But even they must now know it could have a dampener on future prospects. The two tag-alongs setting out to save the dinos over-acted out of their skins in highly improbable roles, especially the geeky tech guy who thankfully seemed to have been largely sidelined by the second half of the movie. 
There were a large number of what are often called 'nods' to earlier Jurassic iterations. So many that, to me, it suggested both a lack of scriptwriter imagination and a patronising view of prospective audiences, who they must have expected to sigh with nostalgia at these blatantly constructed and clunky scenes. 
Overall I (and the three family members who watched it with me) feel it was a laughable attempt at extending this franchise long after its expiry date. The first two in the series became iconic cinematic milestones because the novelty value and highly credible acting was complemented by outstandingly good visual effects. This latest effort fails miserably in spite of great visuals because the other two were woefully absent.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

This time instead of trying to find a reason why the dinosaurs have to leave the island, they ""invented"" a massive volcano eruption. That way they could also incorporate the effects of an eruption (think Inferno, but on a larger scale) into this movie. By doing that this can also be classified as a ""disaster movie"" which means more people are going to want to see this.I've rated this one 4 stars, but it is in my opinion the worst movie in the entire Jurrasic Park series.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

It was cool to see one T-Rex in the The Lost World - but now it's a whole new can of raptors. Like many people have said, the writing isn't so great for the characters of Claire and Owen, but then again ""character arcs"" are a concept that people harp on about far too much these days. Ever looked at your own character arc? The actors managed to carry their roles well - and personally, I like them. The Indoraptor was incredible. Great design and it looked so real. Also, all the action being within the confines of the Gothic mansion was pretty awesome. The morality of the story was a bit heavy handed, but then again there was conflict. Do these animals deserve the right to live?On a minus - the musical score didn't feel like a Jurassic Park/World movie. It was heavy yet not memorable. Unfortunately, I saw too many spoilers before watching the movie - a bit of a shame and that has affected my rating. Not as much fun as the first movie, but it did serve to take the franchise in a very exciting direction. And I have to say, I look forward to the next movie!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

I also found that many problems involving the dinosoars could have been easily avoided if it weren't for the stupid decisions made by the characters. On top of this there were many random events incorporated into the plot (human cloning, another 'new special assassin raptor', a tooth collecting animal trafficker, etc.) to make it more interesting that were simply ridiculous and unnecessary. Suddenly, dinosoars are seen as sympathetic creatures that deserve a better life ravaging mainland america. Nobody listens to Jeff Golblum, who HAS BEEN THROUGH THIS EXACT SAME SITUATION BEFORE, when he says that if they let the dinosoars live people are going to die and chaos will ensue. On a positive note, the CGI dinosoars look great, and so does Chris Pratt.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

I was waiting for something to happen, but nope. Thank GOD for Bryce who had to carry the scenes on when they were together.I didn't understand why Malcolm was even in the movie. He was in the movie 4 mins, max. You could have taken the scenes out and it wouldn't have made an impact. I'm disappointed, because I thought we were going to see more of him. The trailer and all of the interviews sure made you think like that...I think it was clear that Maisie was a clone from the beginning. Come on, she couldn't see pictures of her mom... She is surrounded by people that play with genes, and you wouldn't suspect her? My favorite scene of the movie: The animals running from the volcano. Claire and Franklin and in the sphere rolling and going off the cliff. I just thought that was a really intense scene. It something you could happening, if it was massive volcanic eruption that killed all the dinosaurs. My least favorite scene of the movie: I have a couple. What was up with the Maisie hugging Owen? Weird...Indoraptor can basically do everything. He can be on a rooftop, find your location, open the door, and know that you are in bed hiding. COME ON!!! There are 5 people in the house, closer to him, and he wants only the girl. Is it because she is a clone? Unexpected Scene: Dr. Wu is up to his no good and he won't even sell Indoraptor, because it's not ready. I was wondering, if it's because if it was too much or too little for him. Also, I thought it was great when he found out Blue's DNA wasn't pure. That was awesome. The saddest scene: The death of the Brachiosaurus by the volcano.I'm a BIG Jurassic fan, and this totally had me crying. The Brachiosaurus is the first dinosaur that Dr. Grant and Elle saw when they got to Jurassic Park. It's also the same dinosaur that Dr. Grant and the kids were petting after the T-Rex attack. The Brachiosaurus was the first dinosaur that greeted Clair and Owen and the other two in this movie when they arrived on the island. Now they gave the Brachiosaurus that saddest death. :( This is my rating on Jurassic Films:
1. Jurassic Park
2. Jurassic World
3. Jurassic Park 3
4. Jurassic World 2
5. Jurassic Park 2There is nothing you can say, to make me think that Jurassic Park 2 is worthy of being higher than any other of those films.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1110,aaronbandley,Welcome to Jurassic World.,7,22 June 2018,"7.5/10Directed by J. A. Bayona and starring Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a great, yet flawed, film filled with terror, violence, and a lot of fun. The film starts with Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Owen Grady (Chris Pratt) getting hired by Eli Mills (Rafe Spall) to track down Blue, the last surviving Velociraptor, on the island of Isla Nublar. After getting abandoned by their crew of mercenaries, Claire and Owen discover that Mills has his own plans in store for the remaining dinosaurs...The story is fairly well written, with the fun and the terror of the story placed where it should be. With this, there were some poor decisions in the first half of the film, making it feel like it was dragging the island's destruction out as long as possible to say goodbye to this iconic landscape. Once the crew makes it to the mainland, the story gets more terrifying and interesting, with the introduction of the Indoraptor and the feeling of danger being prominent. This film went borderline R-rating with the violence featured throughout the film. In the very opening, a small crew of people are killed while retrieving DNA of the last film's Indominous Rex. From there, it gets more graphic, with one of the mercs getting dismembered by the Indoraptor onscreen and another getting torn in half by the T-Rex (less visible due to the lack of lighting, reminiscent of Eddie's death in 'The Lost World'). In all of this, it feels completely in line with what's going on and following in suit of the rest of the franchise. The characters of the film are mostly decent. Pratt, Howard, and a number of actors new to the franchise played their characters very well. However, there were characters that felt like they were written as over-the-top comedy routines. In addition to this, some of the human villains also felt like they were just there for the plot's sake doing what it needed them to. Overall, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom was a good movie to watch, despite the issues it had.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1111,jimbob-62783,Unfortunately Mediocre,5,8 June 2018,"Was really looking forward to this movie, as the director has made some great films in the past, but he really missed the mark here. Where was the suspense? The dinosaurs were just on screen unceremoniously, there was no teasing, no build up, you just get numb to them, and bored.Plus, what's with only having the bad guys die? There's no sense of peril if at least one goody doesn't bite it. Also, too many dumb bits, like Chris Pratt lying right next to volcanic lava and being fine - it would burn your lungs out being within a couple of feet of it. Then the girl getting into bed when a dinosaur is stalking her. They'd already established that she was meant to be bright, yet she does that. Overall, very frustrating film with a few good bits.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1112,alexandernaskov,A Suspensful Film with a Questionable Story,7,11 September 2018,"This movie is mindless enjoyment. If you go into it expecting anything anywhere near the likes of the original Jurassic Park, you are setting yourself up for disappointment.  Visually, I have no gripes, the practical and cgi effects were convincing and the cinematography is masterful. The great cinematography contributes to the overall suspense of the film. There was one particular scene that was filmed all in one take underwater which was downright the most suspenseful and intense scene in the movie, and it didn't even have any dinosaurs. The actors and actresses also did a fine job for what they were given.  The concept of the story is a step in the right direction however it was executed disappointedly due to poor writing. The less than average script can also be seen affecting the film's pacing since the first and third acts are paced generally well, yet in the second act the story comes to a complete halt. Where one scene our characters are running away from dinosaurs and an erupting volcano the next they're in a Manor trying to stop evil corporations which just slows the pacing down by a lot. Also in the second act, if the slower pacing won't throw you off, the change in setting will. The transition from the island to the Manor was too quick and the change may seem a bit jarring to most viewers. The characters were easy to get behind however that is mainly due to the fact that we witnessed the previous movie, they aren't really given anymore development other than Claire's transition between films and Owen and Blue's continuously growing relationship. Other than that the poor script the actors were given just made Claire and Owen seem alright and some newer characters bland, but interesting enough to understand their motivations. Lastly, this film is a fun rollercoaster ride of a movie and I am proud to say it is a Jurassic Park film I can recommend.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1114,robinxwonder,Depends On The Perspective,7,21 June 2018,"Looking at Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, or any of the Jurassic movies, on their own can be a great experience. If you see them all as stand-alone movies or remakes, then they are great movies, but watching them as what they are, a series/franchise, makes them all the same. They all have such similar plots and don't change much at all.I wont be focusing solely on that though.At the end of the movie it is realised that the little girl, Maisie, is a clone. At the beginning we learn that her mother died and near the end we learn that she is the clone of her ""mother"" as her ""grandfather"" missed her too much, so he brought her back as her own daughter.Now that's an okay plot, I definitely did not expect it, although I did see a lot of clues towards it throughout the movie. However, when it was mentioned, even though I was surprised, it was more in a ""really? They're going with that? Okay,"" but otherwise it's a fair plot twist, right?Well, no, not really. Her being a clone changed nothing, that wasn't a necessary point to have made. She could've actually been who we believed her to have been, nothing at the movie would have changed. Not a thing.Her character didn't seem to have a reason for being there either, though. Sure she warns her ""grandfather"" about what illegal things are happening, but then he is murdered and shares that information with no one and it doesn't go past there, so that was a pointless scene really, because it may have caused him to die, but he was already dying so they could have just killed him off naturally.So then she doesn't really have a point or reason to be there until the end. Claire wants so badly to press the button that allows the dinosaurs to escape the estate and live, but in the end, she refrains in order to not release the creatures to the world.But then, what I expected would happen, Maisie releases the dinosaurs because she wanted them to live. That seemed to be her only reason for being there, but once again it wasn't necessary since Claire could've just done that, and I feel as if Maisie wasn't there, Claire would have pressed it.Basically, I feel like Maisie's existence in the movie was pointless, however the ending set up to continue the franchise I think.I expect that in the next movie, Claire and Owen will be together and have guardianship over Maisie and in that movie she will actually have a reason for being there. Fallen Kingdom could have just been her introduction for the next Jurassic World movie, and that's what I'm hoping for.Other than the plot, the movie was extremely interesting to watch, made me jump and laugh quite a bit and definitely would not be considered in any way bad.It was beautiful to look at, especially the lava. My personal favourite part was when they were showing lava dripping and flowing before it became the logo. The lava was just nice and amazing to look at in that part, even though it doesn't count as part of the movie.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1121,han-yolo,"25 years later, 2 movies into the reboot and still a fan of the Jurassic Park franchise",8,26 August 2018,"Given that I spent my childhood watching and re-watching the original Jurassic Park films - it was a tough order to put together something that would live up to the enjoyment Spielberg gave me as a child. I enjoyed the first Jurassic World - it was well done, with a great modern tae and a pretty good premise for the film - so you'd better believe I was elbowing kids out of the front row ready for another dose of nostalgia when Fallen Kingdom hit the cinema. Is it my favourite Jurassic Park/World film? Not by a long shot.
Was it entertaining as hell? Absolutely. The CGI as always with the JP series is above and beyond. The throwbacks to the original films were a nice touch with the raptor coming for Masie while she's trying to slam the door, hiding behind the pillar while the raptor taps his creepy toe - and the story although not perfectly tied in to the backstory - was easy enough to roll with. No there wasn't a huge amount of character development, yes there was a lot of focus on essentially the same plot as the first film (in the creation of a perfect super soldier big scary dino-bot), but you know what - it was still a damn good film. I can sit here a 28 year old adult and say I shed a tear for the Brachiosaurus left behind, and cheered madly when Blue took that mutant super soldier dinosaur to school. Don't take this movie too seriously, and enjoy it as an adult as much as you did as a kid - and you won't be disappointed. Expect it to the be the topper of the series, and you probably will be. For the parents of young children - the mutant Indoraptor is truly terrifying, I don't know about kids these days as they didn't seem that bothered in the cinema, but it's a thing of nightmares - just an FYI.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

I was really sad that they took out the return scene of the Dilophosaurus from the beginning of the movie. If you listen closely in the beginning of the movie you can clearly hear the Dilo's Rour.

1124,trexhunter-26422,Welcome to Jurassic World,6,16 October 2018,"Every time a sequel is released the new sequel must have a new stick. Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdoms is blowing up the island that started it all and in the process creating an actual Jurassic World. The film is a fast pace and fun ride that never stops.The film does a good job at building tension and paying it off with good scares. As well as the cinematography are both standouts that improve the films quality and impact on the characters. The film does great with playing with light and camera movement is amazing and makes the film distinct from the other directors from the franchise. As well as allowing his directing strength in full display. In contrast this is the first Jurassic film that isn't just great to watch but also (if I could) pause because the shot composition is amazingly done. The plot is something similar to the one from the all to underrated The Lost World: Jurassic Park. Though quickly getting rid of that to use as a springboard to come into its own with new ideas and characters. There is a argument that the actions taken by the hero's were the best ones to be taken. However the movie follows the line from Jurassic Park III ""Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions"" (Sam Neil Jurassic Park III). The results of the characters intentions leads to a result that will have massive repercussions on the world. The characters mean well but cause multiple deaths and massive problems. While watching you can see that throughout. The film throws multiple curve balls that change what we know about the Jurassic Park universe as a whole elevating the evil Dr. Wu to almost a god. Each adding to the danger and craziness the world is. However the film doesn't spend much time on the island unlike me and manny hoped for. I hoped they would spend more time with the rangers tranquilizing Dino's and helping them out but spend little time. Also the lack of details about Site B or Isla Sorna where 'The Lost World' and Jurassic Park III take place to see what is going on over there. Also some of the interactions between Owen and Clare is odd and not written well. Though lacking in spots Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a fun romp that changes the franchise. Good or bad we have yet to learn but still diverges it into a new franchise that could change into something good or bad depending on the next film. Pros:

There were no surprises, the tension never reached higher than 'laughable' and most of the dinosaur 'stars' seemed to be as much in the dark as the audience.....and talking of dinosaurs, it's as well they are CGI as not one of them would've signed up after reading the script.

1132,connorwdrysdale,How people think JP3 is worse than this is beyond me.,2,13 September 2021,"This movie was in my opinion, an insult to the masterpiece that is the first Jurassic Park, and even the second and third movie, throwing away the concept that Dinosaurs are animals too away and turning them into generic movie monsters that roar and want to eat everyone, for example: That scene with Claire and Franklin with the Baryonyx, it's about to die from lava... WHY IS IT TRYING TO EAT THEM???The side characters in this are atrocious, Franklin and the other girl whose name I forgot were annoying and bland, also that little clone girl annoyed the hell out of me and the twist was awful and pointless.This movie also suffers from pacing issues, the first half on Nublar moves way too fast and the sections in the mansion feel like a boring slog.It also suffers heavily from physics issues, why didn't Chris Pratt die from the lava????Next we have the Indoraptor, which I thought was cheap, I didn't like the Indominus Rex, and I sure as hell didn't like the Indoraptor, just... we don't need hybrids! We have dinosaurs! That's cool enough!Speaking of dinosaurs, their designs (For the most part.) are awful, no feathers, shrinkwrapping, broken wrists, etc. And they even undid the (mostly) accurate Stegosaurus design from the previous films to make it look horribly inaccurate, removing the beak and the sloped tail... it's lazy design.I have absolutely 0 hopes for Dominion giving what's been leaked about the movie, oh well, maybe they'll pull a Revenge of the Sith, I doubt it, but I guess I'll give them a chance.I could go on all day, but I won't, this movie was terrible.2/10, or 23%",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1133,Arm-Lizard,"Far from perfect, but surprisingly good, and includes some of the most beautiful scenes in the franchise.",6,14 June 2018,"So, the first thoughts.A huge improvement over the corny Jurassic World. Far from perfect, but surprisingly good, and it includes some of the most beautiful scenes in the whole franchise. There are moments brought real tears to my eyes, and that has never happened to me before in a JP movie.The animatronics are back, and they are superb. They used them carefully and wisely to tell the story. T. rex is awesome. She is the most magnificent creature in the movie, and she got some really excellent appearances, in which she became a menace again.The movie starts with a great opening sequence, and it builds up tension slowly, then all of a sudden it turns into a non-stop roller coaster. The acting is well held this time, and there is little to no cheesiness at all.The nods to the first two films are subtle but well played. The movie is brimful of classic JP set-pieces and atmosphere. Bayona nailed it with set-pieces.As for the cons, the movie has got too loud sometimes, and this made me feel that I need a break. It also dragged for about ten minutes in its third act; these were the main two things that bothered me the most.All in all, it was worth waiting. Not great, but good, and really fun. It's suspenseful, scary, heartbreaking, wonderfully filmed, and visually resplendent. There are three scenes here any fan can consider them some of his favorite scenes in the franchise.Mister Bayona, after careful consideration, I've decided to endorse your park.Long live Jurassic Park.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Ofcourse things don't go their way and all hell breaks loose. Add in a new dino monster and that's pretty much the entire film. Unfortunately while this simple story worked in a B movie sort of way with ""Jurassic World"", it drops flat on its face with ""Fallen Kingdom"", with a very bad script, a miserable looking Chris Pratt and some very bad set pieces that rips off not only the first two Jurassic films but rips off most of the monster on the loose in a spooky house films. Nothing in this film is worth your time other than Jeff Goldblum's 3 minute cameo which book ends this film and reminds you on why Steven Spielberg's first two Jurassic epics ( The original ""Jurassic Park"" and Its true Sequel ""The Lost World"") were so damn good. The only thing the rest of "" Fallen Kingdom"" reminds you of is the horrible ""Jurassic Park 3"" where poor Sam Neill looks like he was about to jump off a cliff in order to escape the movie he was in.

Realistically, the movie has some flaws but deserves at least a 6.5/7. The initial setup is even more absurd then the usual while the connection with the first movie gives you a vague sense of déjà vu, at least for the first half of the movie. The pacing between the first scene and the beginning of the action is slightly tedious and abound of poorly written dialogue. Sadly, the new dinosaurs still have no feathers. Again, the bad guys are evil businessmen who this time around, seriously, and I mean seriously undervaluate whatever they're trying to sell. The movie kicks off with a questionable ethical decision and ends with one that is even more questionable. If you can see past all of that, Jurassic Park 5 is a fun, abate slighty stale ride.

What I like about this one, is there is nearly always the presence of a dinosaur in every shot and sequence!The tone of the movie is set from the start, with an opening scene and dinosaur typical to the franchise which I loved!!! It is also maintained as the main characters land on the island!!! They couldn't have chosen better actors for their roles and the humor in this movie is real and not forced, which adds to the suspense and action filled sequences!We see some development with some of the characters and dinosaurs present in the movie and get more information about how they came to be, and some turn of events concerning certain type of carnivores!This was epic, and the way the movie ends, leaves the audience glued to their seat wanting to see more!!!Thank you Jurassic World 2 for not spoiling the franchise for me!

I think the biggest thing that stands out in this movie is the flashy scenes, a couple of them really stuck with me and hit me hard! Even though the flashy scene's were used multiple times but with a little change to them, not necessarily a bad thing though!

Sadly the answer was no. Even Chris Pratt. 
I dont mind formulaic, i am happy to leave my brain at the door, but within that there should be something more to give you a hook and engage yet it all seemed 'by the numbers'. The best bit was the dino left behind on the dock.
And what was with all the nods to previous speilberg movies? Kid frantically pulling the shutter down like first jurassic park, guy running down a hill with quirky music like Raiders otla, panorama of LA like ET, and im sure there was a Jaws reference somewhere.....Plus, the indoraptor was basically an Alien...

The upgrade in technology since those days has resulted in some amazing looking and sounding dinos, and the start of this film promised so much! Two massive toothy dinos right off the bat, YES we are getting a movie focused on dinosaurs and not a shoehorned love interest that could have been copied and pasted from any film. But there are 3 major things that annoy me more than anything else about this film...The one thing that stops me from re-watching this film is that they start parading the morals of dinosaur cloning in front of our face. The whole 'Do Dinos deserve protection etc argument just doesn't fly at all with me, they died off for a reason, they were too big to be sustained, the climate has changed even more, and there is the main problem of them eating people. So that as the major plot kickstarter just removes me from the whole story immediately. Secondly, there is the whole unnecessary side plot about the cloned child that then releases all said toothy problems into the English country side. The whole film felt too preachy. Finally, the biggest issue I have is that...the idiocy of some of the characters is just special. And leads to pointless jumpscares, which I detest, but also, after 5 films, the recurring theme of Greed and Stupidity gets old.
I just want a slightly grittier Jurassic Park game, with less of these Mishmash Dino's and more of the true Dino's, like getting more than a Carno Cameo. As if seeing a Dino isn't awe inspiring enough to children, and hearing a T-rex shout isn't enough to put a smile on the big kids in the Cinema, but this 'moral' stance that was jarringly thrust upon a recycled rendition just resulted in a film that felt stale and unsure what it wanted to be...a fun romp with oversized handbags, or a film that was trying to be an award contender, but falling far short.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1169,jonathan_myersstu,Drastic World: Fallen Franchise Review,3,25 September 2018,"I'm actually kinda torn: is this the worst Jurassic Park movie or does that honor still belong to The Lost World? I can't answer that question at the moment, but I can talk about the new one. First of all, there are some positives. The section of the movie on the island is great. It's exactly what I wanted to see after watching the trailer. Lot's of explosions, lots of action, lots of dinosaurs: it's pretty cool. The score's also good, but that can be expected. I don't think I really had too many problems with the dialogue other than the fact that there was some forced humor. But it didn't make me cringe at any point, so it's not too much of a problem. Also, Chris Pratt was fine. That's unfortunately about all the positives I can bring to the table, because now we have to talk about the awful plot.I will keep this as spoiler-free as possible, but I simply have to talk about the plot setup.The film begins with some people who are working on Isla Nublar in order to find an Indominus tooth so they can extract its DNA. And some of them get eaten. Because of course they do. Then, we cut to Claire, the park manager in the last movie, working as a dino-rights activist (no, I'm not kidding). It makes even less sense when you remember that this same character explicitly DIDN'T care if the dinos had rights or not in the last movie. But now, she's basically the leader of PETA for Dinos, or PETD for short. The issue is that a volcano is about to erupt on Isla Nublar and kill every dinosaur that was ever created. Whoever wrote this movie must've forgotten about the other island that had dinosaurs on it: the one that was in The Lost World and Jurassic Park III. Then there are some court hearings with Jeff Goldblum testifying why Hammond made a huge mistake by creating dinos in the first place and why they should let the dinos die. And he's totally right; it's almost like the movie is self-aware in that aspect. However, Claire cares so deeply about the dinos that she joins a team of people that supposedly want to bring the dinos to a safe island. Supposedly. But silly, naive Claire says yes without asking any questions and drags Chris Pratt into it because otherwise, his velociraptor named Blue will die. But surprise surprise! The people that hire them are greedy and try to leave them for dead. However, our heroes manage to escape and follow the crooks to the mansion of a guy who worked with Hammond (yet was never mentioned in any of the other movies). And that's were the rest of the movie takes place.I just described what felt like a third of the movie. Meaning the final two thirds of the movie take place in a mansion.A movie called Jurassic WORLD is confined to the space of a mansion.So that's what I can say about the plot without spoiling it, because most of what I just said was in the trailer. There's more weird stuff in this movie that I'd like to talk about, but you can just see them for yourself if you do enjoy this series. Trust me, I haven't even scratched the surface. There is a plot twist that is going to make you scratch your head in confusion because it comes out of nowhere and makes absolutely no sense.Now let's talk about the characters, another major problem with this movie. One of the original's biggest strengths was the character development. It was something that actually allowed you to care what happened to the characters and empathize with them. In Fallen Kingdom there seems to be three types of characters in this movie, which is not enough distinguishable personalities for these characters to be interesting. I classify these types are as follows: underdeveloped hero, dinosaur meal, and annoying, screaming baby that almost kill the underdeveloped heroes. Chris Pratt and Claire are the underdeveloped heroes that you don't hate, but honestly don't give a rip about. Chris Pratt generally does a great job with making his roles very likable, but he had to make do with the script that was given to him. Claire was never a great character to begin with, but she was at least tolerable in the last one. However, she isn't in this one. Again, I don't blame the actress, because I think Bryce Dallas Howard can be a great when you give her a good script to work with (just watch The Help and The Village for proof). Her character is just so, so bad. Then we have the ""dinosaur meal"" characters. You know, the ones that you just look at and know are gonna be eaten by a dino. Of course, they have even less development than the thinly developed heroes. And now let's get to my absolute favorite type of character in this movie (not really): whiny, loud, obnoxious, screaming sidekick. There's two of these that I can specifically think of in this film. One is scared of all thing dino-related, yet works for PETD and decides to fly to an island full of dinos. And yes, whenever one is in eyeshot, he shrieks his mind out. Sounds like an annoying kid character right? Well this is actually a grown man. But don't worry: there's an annoying kid character too! There's this little girl (who is essential to the plot) who actually puts whoever she's with in even more danger then they are already in because she screams and attracts the attention of anything around her. I'm pretty sure there are other types of characters I didn't mention, but that's because I forgot them and didn't care enough to remember.This film did not work for me. It might work for other Jurassic Park fans, but I personally did not like it. It really feels like the studio is trying to milk the Jurassic Park formula and if they keep making them at this quality, they're gonna have some trouble. I can only recommend this to Jurassic Park fans, the only people who I can see enjoying this. But keep in mind that I identify as one of those and still thought it was bad. Well, at least I didn't buy a ticket.In my humble opinion, the best thing for the Jurassic Park franchise at this point in time is to go extinct.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1172,guzguzgarbit,Classic flawed superproduction,6,15 July 2018,"I decided to write a review here because I think Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a typical exemple of what is going wrong in nowadays superproductions.JWFK is not a bad movie. There are bad movies and very bad movies, but this one is not one of them. This one is in the interesting category in which lots of recent movies fit in of the technically good movies with almost non-existent artistic and scenaristic approach. And I'm writing a review of JWFK because it beats all the movies I've seen in this category. I will try to explain what point I'm trying to make and why.First why is this a technically good movie ? The directing and acting are quite OK and encouraging, the action scenes are well edited and everything seems very fluid, a lot of different and interesting ideas are present making the movie varied and always exciting. The dialogs are good and so the overall scenario. And that's where everything starts to crumble.I said overall scenario because in the mind of Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly and probably a lot of satisfacted spectators, I believe it was very clear. The scenario is supposed to be something like: ""After JW, al the dinosaurs are going to die, which is very sad and so an organisation including the female lead of the first movie wants to save them. And then they go to the founder of JW who wants to save some dinos to put them on an uninhabited island. But he's being fooled by his good-looking good assistant who actually wants to sell them in auctions. So the two JW leads go inthe expedition to save some dinos but they discover the truth and then set free all the poor dinos and defeat the bad guys."" I have nothing wrong with this, it seems perfectly fine to me. But the problem are not in the main structure but in the little details.First the fact that an NGO wants to save the dinos does not make sense. Because the dinos are eventually all going to die because they cannot reproduce and the species will go extinct no matter how sad it is. And even to simply save a few (something like 12, I don't remember...), which is not the point of the movie (""Do you want your child to live in a world where dinosaurs are extincts?"", well... duh, even if you save them, they'll eventually die way before the child...) it doesn't work because the dinos ALREADY have an uninhabitated island they're living on. Yes, there is a living volcano on this island, but I do believe some dinos will survive anyway (and probably more than the few that were saved) and the saved dinos will not survive very long in an island with just one of their kind (most of then lives in pack, at least in the movies).But that's not the main point. Just an idea that doesn't works and will define everything at stake during the entire movie. And everything works like that: OMG a giant thing wants to eats us and we're trap in a pit of lava what can we do???? oh well, there was a ladder we simply didn't see during the whole time. 
Or : This raptor lost to much blood, let's give it some T-Rex blood (is that real??) Or even better : Hmm, this incredibly strong and dangerous dinosaur trained to kill is returning safely in is cell, as the hero of the movie I must prevent this and then go away while I've put the most dangerous being ever born in the middle of a room full of people (but they're the bad people so it's ok I guess?). And then when the dumbest character opens the cage, nobody is trying to prevent him (because they're the bad people I guess??) But the worst is next: When all the dinos are going to die because some arsenic gas that have nothing to do here is released, a little girl (the grandchild of the founder) who just learned she was a clone, decide to set them all free in the continent, not because they're clones like her, but because they're ALIVE, like her. Well so were the hundreds humans you condemned by releasing lots (strangely a lot more than they saved) of deadly creatures in the wood. And nobody blames her and nobody calls the police or something. And eventually the army is gonna come in and kill all the dinos to prevent more hume deaths. IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MAKE SENSE?To really sum it all, the only thing in the WHOLE movie that actually make sense is the villains' plot (and what says Jeff Goldblum) and that's very strange because it's quite rare. Here, the villains want to sell dinos as weapons of mass destruction and genetic materials using the money of an old gullible billionaire as fund. And this quite intelligent. If you look at it from a different angle what bad things the villains have done? They sold (tryed to) well treated surviving dinosaurs and the main villain killed the old guy. Pretty malicious I think. But then wht bad things the heroes have done? They condemned every surviving dinos and lots of humans to certain death and killed more or less involuntarily ALL the villains, even the scientists, even the rich buyers. The villains could have killed, on many occasions the good guys but have they done it? No. But the good guys killed mercilessly every other characters. And nobody cares.

I've seen the other movies dozens of times, but that scene alone makes this movie impossible to watch again. I wish I could get the image out of my head.
The first Jurassic Park movie was the most fun movie experience I had as a child. I remember clutching to the seat in front of me, ducking my head and screaming with thrill alongside my bff. It was a ride! I was in tears in this movie - why would you want to take the fun out of Jurassic Park?!
In the first four movies, while still being used for human gain and pleasure, they win! Throughout Fallen Kingdom they suffer, and lose. It's unwatchable. I am in animal rescue. We see humans torturing and abusing animals every day on this planet. We don't go to the movies to see that. So disappointed.

They act as though they never met in the first one. I have to also give some of the blame to the script. It was just not as good as it could have been.

1182,theicephoenix,The same but different,6,23 June 2018,"JW2 is a mixture of great and bad moments. There is nothing to complain about concerning the visual effects - esp. the dinosaurs look hilariously great - or the acting of Chris Pratt /Bryce Dallas Howard etc. or Michael Giacchino's Soundtrack. But there are some problems that need to be mentioned:
The comic relief (here it's Franklin Webb) is for me boring stereotype for a computer nerdThe plot is, except some details, more or less the same as in JP2Some figures are nothing but useless or boring, like the expedition leader, that it was more emotional when a dinasour was left on the island and died there than when one of the main characters diedBut even though I couldn't ignore these things, it was still fun to watch this movie.

Take the best moments of the 4 Jurassic films and, put them in a blender. You have the Greatest hits, the best of the best. Sure, this isn't better than the Original, but it is superior to JP3 ( the underdog, with GREAT effects, some good moments) the lost world was grim, Fallen Kingdom RAISES the stakes, and BITES your psyche as you endure it's hooks, fine line structure and, laugh at it's jokes and good use of comedy, cry and emphasize with, both humans and dinosaurs, and you will SCREAM at the REAL use of A grade Horror that amateur pet projects like hereditary and the inflation of dumb plastic plot ghost house films lack.

1189,leantom-95768,La-a-a-a-a-a-ame. Worst of the series,2,24 June 2018,"This was, without a doubt, the worst movie of the series. The third Jurassic Park is Citizen Kane relative to this mess.Full disclosure: I'm a huge fan of both of the lead actors. With that said, the script they're given even makes BOTH OF THEM appear unlikable, at least from my point of view. Where to begin with this mess?The movie begins with a debate raging in Congress over whether to let the dinosaurs of Isle Nublar go extinct (a large volcano is set to blow and create a mini extinction-like event; of course, this conveniently happens three years after the park closes). Bryce Dallas Howard's character, conveniently, is an activist for rescuing the large, reptilian critters. She's contacted by the caretaker of a wealthy (but elderly and dying) geneticist (apparently a research associate of the recently deceased John Hammond, the founder of the original Jurassic Park) who also wants to save the animals from extinction. He - along with the elderly, dying geneticist - petitions her to return to the island, along with Chris Pratt's character (who - somewhat incredulously - only takes a slight prodding to return with Ms. Howard to an island filled with dangerous, man-eating carnivores). And, just like that, we're back on Isle Nublar (I'm not kidding - there are so many incredulous plot points in this movie that you have to suspend disbelief that people over 22 wrote it)!So, back on the (now-defunct) island, our two heroes are joined by two of Ms. Howard's pro-dinosaur-rescuing associates, a computer programmer and an annoying dino veterinarian (really - her actual profession), and a group of mercenaries also apparently hired by the elderly associate of Mr. Hammond. What our heroes don't know, however, is that the aforementioned caretaker is apparently a corrupt SOB who fired the mercs for the sole purpose of extracting the dinosaurs from the island so that they could be sold at auction to billionaire weapons technology manufacturers (who apparently believe in somehow weaponizing dinosaurs for combat - no, I'm not kidding; it's that stupid). Basically, our heroes are betrayed by the mercenaries and left to die on the island, but they incredibly manage to escape aboard a mercenary vessel with the corrupt mercs (kind of redundant, I know) and dinos in tow. Apparently, the mercs only wanted Chris Pratt and Ms. Howard's characters to come along for the express purpose of luring out Blue (the intelligent velociraptor from the first movie), which happens to have worked.So, Mr. Pratt and Ms. Howard are eventually discovered and imprisoned. They wind up escaping, however, while the auction to the military industrialists is taking place, and they then turn the tables on said industrialists by releasing the dinosaurs, whereby the dinosaurs wreak havoc on our said corrupt industrialists. The bad guys get eaten, Pratt and Howard escape unharmed (along with the two annoying associates of Ms. Howard - really, I was hoping that they'd get eaten), and the dinos escape onto the American mainland (the auction took place in the basement of the mansion of the dying geneticist - another ridiculous plot point - I suppose they did this to loop in the geneticist's granddaughter, who happens to be a clone of said geneticist's daughter - don't ask).Besides the ridiculous plot, the dialogue is atrocious. Hardly any intelligence and no humorous exchanges between Pratt and Howard like in the first one. Also, the two formerly-mentioned associates of Ms. Howard are very unlikeable. They have a few boring, cheasy quips but that's about it.I wish I'd have skipped this one. There's really nothing redeeming about it, save perhaps the CGI.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1199,slugermanuk,Predictable: more of the same,6,16 November 2018,"The trailer looked good, and it was a good move to bring in a volcanic eruption and have a mass breakout of dinosaurs in the USA. Good special effects as ever but having seen the movie, it really is more of the same and could hardly be called a reinvigoration of the franchise. Naturally the CGI dinosaurs are as up to scratch (excuse the pun) as ever, altlhough I wish there was a little more palaeontological adventure - some feathers on the T.Rex arms for instance. The mosasaurus (3 x bigger than it should be) is still the best of them, there is a very good clip at the end with the creature tracking surfers, but it's sadly very short. The plot is so predictable it is either tedious or a joke whichever is your point of view. As usual, we get the standard chases, hiding behind vehicles, running around obstacles with a dino on the other side, baddie hunter harming the dinos and then getting his comeuppance, a dinosaur loose hunting a youngster and failing to have it for dinner, and so on and so on, as with all the others in the series, in fact. Although I suppose we should be grateful for the lack of a marathon sprint in slingbacks that was such an utterly risible feature of previous movie.Further checkboxes all ticked as expected: computer geek; screaming chiildren (though Isabella Sermon as the grand-daughter is much better in this movie than all the other ""lost children"", with a deeper back story), various dinosaurs/people etc falling through plate glass, unexpected T.Rex attack alternating with unexpected raptor attack to save the main characters from certain death, remorseful senior wishing he hadn't set in motion the whole project, and the Ian Malcolm/Henry Wu characters being marginally less irritating than in the other movies but still saying the same sort of thing on and on. The two leads are better in this movie than in the previous one, and the villains Messrs Spall and Jones (British of course, as most villains seem to be) are really suitably unpleasant. But the end sequence implying that man will need to share earth with dinosaurs as a ""partnership'' really doesn't work.It's not a bad movie by any means, but the franchise could do with a genuine refresh, a much better story, and this movie doesn't do it.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1203,helmutherb,"A movie for the simple minded, easy impressed audience!",3,30 December 2020,"Idk how one can rate this a 9 or 10, except they do not rethink a single second from this movie.The story is predictable, and very poorly written!What's the matter with clone girl? She does nothing to the story, and seems only to be there for one of the last (very stupid) scenes.And you can clearly tell she's a clone from the first moment she appears, as its permanently stated how she's exactly resembling her mother, her mother who died in an accident, and her ""grandfather"" who likes to have her around (in the mansion with the big secret clone laboratory in the basement) etc.. Much too obvious!The whole auction is about the introduction of the ""Indo-Raptor"" as a prototype-""War-Dino"".But they're selling mostly ""normal"" dinos.
WHY would a warlord spend millions to have a uncontrollable, hard to transport and hard to maintain monster in the barn? It also can be easily killed by enough (and much cheaper) firepower. In addition the actual War-Dino miserably fails at killing people.
Btw: ""War-Dinos"" were a thing when I was 6 or so and watching animated series from the 80s & 90s.I can't believe that even in this fictional world can be a rational thought about setting dinos free on populated mainland (in sense of ""save the dinos"").Since this is not a remake or so, but a sequel to all the happenings from JP and the first JW, we know that DINOS + HUMANS = DESASTER!!! They literally proved it several times.
So it is just ridiculous where Claire has a hard time to decide about opening the gate. And of course it's clone girl who finally pushes the button (for some stupid ""they're clones, like me""-reason), because that's the only scene why she even exists.And the list goes on.

1206,peter_hemme,Rawr means i love you in Dinosaur,7,14 September 2018,"So i saw Rawr to the Jurrasic Park FranchiseLong time fan.. Watched the first one as a 8 year old kid, hiding behind a big plushy teddybear, Loved the lost world (2 T-rexes..OMG), survived the talking raptors from JP3.. And loved the soft reboot called Jurassic World, so ofc i was looking forward to this one..Well, Now i saw it..and, well, yeah..
It wasnt bad.. Not by a long shot, the jokes hit, the action was superb, the CGi was good, but still... There are things, that didnt work in my mind.1) Stop ignoring JP 2 and JP 3, There are dinosaurs on another island. Period.
2) I miss the days, that the JP movies where about ""real"" dinosaurs. Not about, Indoraptors, Indomusses Rexes and what not.I realised this a couple of times while watching, and i enjoyed the blindly t-rex a lot more then the whole ""blue vs Indoraptop movie plot"" Go back to that.
3) We gonna clone humans now to keep it going? When that plotpoint happenend...i said out loud, Well..thats something these movies defenitly DONT need. 
4) The kids keep getting dumber and dumber in these movies.. Where Lex and Tim where smart kids, who knew how to survive with the adults.. We now have..Clonegirl (Forgot the name) The Screaming girly..woohoo. 
5) The obvious road.. I could say, hey. thats gonna happen..and guess. what.. It did..(I dont trust those soldiers..hey..they arent trusted.what a suprise)
For the rest things that i didnt like where, well.. Not much..i enjoyed the movie, things that i felt that did work:
1) The 1st arc. Go back to the island, and visit/save the dinosaurs. I know it was a 1 on 1 from JP2, but it felt pretty epic. 
2) The winks/trowbacks to previous movies..Like that Brachiosaur wich was the same as the 1st dinosaur we saw in these movies.. Blue that jumped on the green rail cart, (wasnt that the old T-rex Paddock?), The door that the girl closed down while the dinosaur was rushing towards her... etc etc..The movie had plenty of it.
3) The Actors.. Jeff Goldblum's cameo.. Chris Prat in a great role.. Our favorite lady on heels... Again good casting.
4) It wasnt JP3
5) The story.. Yeah..it was a basic story, had gapes and holes..but i can also believe its getting harder and harder to come up with this stuff.. People dont want to see 1000 disasters in Jurassic parks over and over again. They have to keep pushing themself forward..And based on that..they did a good job..Not a great..No.. a good job.. If you want a nice evening of movie watching, without having to think things over to much..and you want to see dinosaurs..This isnt the worst movie.But really...Next movie..no more made up dinosaurs pls ;)",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

The Jurassic world film (2015) played on nostalgia and it felt fresh because the franchise was revived after 14years but it got old really fast with fallen kingdom. Don't get me wrong I still love the Jurassic park franchise I would rather watch dinosaurs than most other blockbuster films any day of the week. However, Fallen kingdom really doesn't have much of a story it's just lost world with a few tweaks and not nearly as good. A lot of dinosaurs a lot of running and screaming and then it just ends. I wish they had kept the horror/thriller element that made the first two movies really great. The dinosaurs aren't scary or magical anymore they're just loud and more colourful. I hope Jurassic park is rebooted into a great TV series that explores the origins of the science behind genetic cloning and Hammond's ambitions.

1228,tradeJmark,"In between the great CGI and somewhat decent directing and acting, the screenwriters think we're all idiots.",5,22 June 2018,"I've included the spoiler warning on this review because I want to highlight a particular scene as emblematic of everything that is wrong with this movie.
Riddle me this: You walk into a room, and see a large dinosaur safely contained in a cage in the middle of the room. Do you:
a) Attempt to kill the dinosaur, while definitely leaving it locked in a cage, because it would be foolish to unlock the cage?
b) Just walk right back out of the room, because as previously stated, this dinosaur is currently safely locked in a cage?
c) Shoot the massive dinosaur with two tranquilizer darts, unlock the cage, go stand in the cage, and then continue standing around until the dinosaur wakes up, eats you, and then walks out into the world through the door you left unlocked?
As you may have guessed, this movie seems to think it's reasonable to assume that some hypothetical person would choose option c. Or, what's worse, the movie at the very least expects me and anyone else who watches the movie to be Bso stupid as to think that option c is a valid choice.
I gave it a 5 because other than the obvious, glaring, and infuriating flaws, it has moments of being almost a decent movie. The effects are really incredible. The director seems to have a very good eye for visuals, not specifically CGI visuals, he just generally seems to know when a particular shot will be visually stunning, and the movie is strewn throughout with these fairly impressive shots. Chris Pratt is fun, as he usually seems to be. Bryce Dallas Howard is good, not really great, but about as good as she could be expected to be under the material. Isabella Sermon is quite impressive and gave me more than I tend to expect from any child actor. No, those people were all fine. If I may hazard a guess, I think the horrible parts of the movie are mainly on the heads of the screenwriters. The overarching plot was interesting enough, but the scene-to-scene dialog, and especially the wildly irrational actions that the characters take, were both completely infuriating. To make it worse, the new dinosaur (I guess maybe it's now compulsory to add a new one each time) is almost literally laughably inept at killing people, for a dinosaur that's been bread solely for the purpose of killing people. I did appreciate the good parts enough to give them the 5 I gave this movie, but the dumb parts got a 0, because I feel almost personally insulted that anybody thought I would be stupid enough to swallow some of the plot contrivances they just presented me.
I haven't seen a Transformers movie for many years, but from what I hear other people say about them, probably fans of that franchise (if any truly exist) are the majority of the people that will actually be able to enjoy this. Unfortunately for the rest of us, the movie gives us just enough actual thoughtful material in the first 20 minutes for us to switch our brains on far enough to be absolutely enraged by the garbage that then follows.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

There were some pretty good moments and likable characters, but the plot itself seemed VERY familiar. Although, it wasn't exactly the same as Jurassic Park 2, it certainly followed a similar formula. It seems they were setting up a MUCH better third film, but to me ""Fallen Kingdom"" wasn't too much to get excited about as a standalone film.Chris Pratt delivers well with his witty humor as well as BDH. They introduce a new character ""Franklin"" that is a well written comic relief, but other than this, the movie falls flat on its own.

The rest are kind of just in there. I was rooting for Fallen Kingdom to be great. Obviously, the special effects for Fallen Kingdom are some of the best, since they used the latest technology. Besides that though, it's obvious that the creators are running out of plot lines and sub-plot lines. While I watched this movie, there were several times when I said, ""Haven't I seen this plot/scene/situation in a previous Jurassic Park Film?"" Yes, I had. Further, the creators tried to create some new sub-plots, but that only murkied the storyline further, and the those sub-plots were never tied up nicely or understandably. I'm glad I got to see Fallen Kingdom in the theatre, but I will not be disappointed if I don't get this for Christmas. A great movie is worth watching again and again; Fallen Kingdom isn't. If the JP creators actually venture to add another film to this series, then I hope they try some new angles that they haven't thought of before. Maybe some prequels?

The far reaching liberties made me leave this movie but my wife stayed and I'm glad she did because I came back and I saw something I will never forget!

It kept things the same that I wanted to remain the same but it broke boundaries too. You can't go into this film expecting dinosaurs in a non-functional Park like JP, TLW, JP3 and JW. It inevitably had to step away from the park at some point but it did it extremely well with explanation as to why certain things happened. I thought the Indoraptor was going to be a terrible idea but it was surprisingly really cool. The film could have stood without it but it opened up avenues to do certain things in the beginning of the film. The little girls character could have been left out completely and I wasn't that fussed by her, she didn't leave me impacted but I'm not going to jump the gun, maybe her timeline is important to the next film? People are mentioning plot holes but it's a trilogy, there's massive hints that things will be explained in the third instalment, people are jumping on it just like Star Wars: The Last Jedi.I loved the use of different species of dinosaurs, the locations of the film, the darkness to it and how you can compare greed and power to the current world we live in.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

My favourite part of the first movie was watching the dinosaurs running around in all weathers, destroying everything and causing havoc around Jurassic world... so maybe the fact that the theme park is only shown for 15/20 minutes of the movie made it less exciting for me... there is some great action scenes in the movie, until the second act of the movie. Then let's just say, the dino's make themselves 'at home'. Meaning for the rest of the 2 hours they're trapped in a mansion. The acting was great as usual, Bryce Dallas Howard stole the show, knocking Chris Pratt off the top spot for me. Let's just hope they blow me away in another sequel to grab my attention back to the franchise... please!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1245,ihavemagicpants,I went with the old way...,8,27 June 2018,"I made sure I knew almost nothing about the movie before going. I avoided teasers, interviews where anyone talked about parts of the movie and even avoided reviews. I wanted to go in with a completely open mind like we used to before we went to the movies before the internet. As a Jurassic fan I knew from the start we aren't in Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park anymore. This is a very real Jurassic World with mutations from regular dinosaurs and genetic splicing being the major concern when confronted with human's ability and desire to create something of pure power and gain a large profit at the same time. I wasn't expecting to feel so heartbroken for CGI animals in their situation but watching them drown was hard enough (I can't swim so may have hit a little close home there) but the scene as they leave the island made me actually cry a little. Seeing and hearing that moment with the Brachiosaurus made me hate how vivid and breathtaking it was visually but I couldn't look away. And bringing in the sounds so crisp and real... this moment itself really pulled at my heart and still even makes me feel considerably sad for a non-existent animal. Ive seen a few other reviewers say the plot doesn't make sense and is choppy. I do admit some of the plot was choppy/ oddly placed and I'm guessing it's mainly because of the fact they had to put an end the island and begin to tie it in with the story of why and how they get to the mainland AND then get to the dramatic climax in a decent amount of time. It makes sense in my mind but I wish there was a little more development in some parts but my imagination can create links. It wasn't super hard to figure out or anything. The back story and clips of Blue and Owen's relationship is absolutely amazing. It made me smile and helped show more of the emotional level of their relationship and not just because 'she follows my orders and I trained her' relationship that was presented before. You really get to see a development, if only for a minute or two, how unusually unique their relationship was in the first place (by showing the others siblings) in addition to special. I will say being in a theater with good audio can make a HUGE difference on your experience with this movie. I know some scenes wouldn't have been nearly as intense. I mainly give this an 8 because of the visual and auditory journey you are on in the scenes in the beginning with the volcano and it's eruption, when they are in the cages, in the fighting, etc. The visual effects people in this movie did an amazing job creating such real creatures that it really does look as though they are in the situation, time and personal space of those actors in the movie. Incredibly well done. Plus, I adore Bryce Dallas Howard. I have to say love that they made a point to show her in heals in the beginning but show her 'ready to do this crap' boots. She earns my respect for doing that amount and speed of running in those heels. But, that's the other movie. Haha.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1246,yangsir9527,What's this movie all about?,4,9 July 2018,Fall asleep not just once but twice in Jurassic world. I think that's something.,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1247,anthonymcclutchie,Plain Stupidity,4,12 October 2018,Really annoyed that a movie with a good cast and effects couldn't deliver a decent plot. I am tired of movies that treat the viewers like idiots. I would rather watch cartoon if the story was better.,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1248,cissenschlacht,Good CGI - Average Acting - Bad Story and Dialogues - Missing Logic,5,7 June 2018,"Just came from the cinema. Watched this movie in 3D + OV and even though i am not a native speaker i was able to understand everything perfectly fine.You may not want to spend 5min+ reading a review so i will try my best to make it short for you. 
It is said that you should always start with the positive things first, so here i go. 
The by far best thing about this movie is the CGI + the costumes etc. So you will have some pretty good looking Dinosaurs (and actors) in this movie. Therefore the action scenes are pretty good too, even though i feel like they have been overloaded sometimes.
The acting is (imo) on point even though the things the characters say is completely ridiculous sometimes. Aaaand thats it (sadly) with the positive things i have to say about this movie. In todays time such a huge movie gets 5 Stars for average acting and good CGI, because 80% of movies nowadays are pretty much CGI -.-.Now lets talk about all these flaws. Here are coming some minor spoilers.The characters:
Are written without any creativity. We have the stereotype Hacker/IT guy, who also repeatedly makes annoying comments who are supposed to be funny. The super smart asian girl who is (of course) a doctor and contradicts the IT guy cause she's super brave and stuff. The generic bad guy who just wants to (SPOILER) not just ""save"" the dinosaurs. The female main protagonist who obviously could have never guessed that something fishy is going to happen. The male main protagonist who is never afraid of anything and handles every situation flawless. There is also the guy who wants to shoot everything and does this for the money only. So absolutely nothing new. 
No character has actual ""character development"" in this movie and each character is written very shallow. And this is not just a rant. I actually thought if there is a character who changes through the movie... but no sadly there is not.The dinosaurs:
have become things that adapt to the story (not the story adapts to the dinosaurs).They sadly lack any animal senses. There is a scene in the first few minutes of the movie where a person is trying to escape from a certain dinosaur.
 SPOILER: Certain Dinosaur fails to catch this person. The person escapes with a helicopter, hanging only on a ladder in the midst of a storm above the open sea. Suddenly the Morasaur (the giant sea creature) who somehow spots this tiny human on the ladder 20m above sea level decides to jump out of the Water to catch this guy. In comparison its like we would go outside in our garden to kill and eat a bug we just feel like we saw through the muddy window during a storm. Completely irrational. 
There are a lot more of these scenes in the movie, you have to blend out and stop your brain to keep watching.The Writing:
Is horrendous. Each action scene must be bigger and better. Each shown Dinosaur must be bigger and better (and more brutal). Remember the scene from Jurassic Park 1 where they treated the triceratops, or left the car to gaze at the Brachios for the first time? Well now it has to be a raptor who gets treated and there is no time for a peaceful moment of admiring. In fact you have not a single scene that is dedicated to a herbivor (except maybe one towards the end, but only to Assist the main chars). They only focus on destruction and killing and T-Rex + Velociraptor + Surprise Dino. Everything always has to ""escalate quickly"" and while the main characters whould die again and again and again in a real world they are always miraculously saved in this 'disney like' world.Best thing is: They build the entire park on a freaking active volcano which was going to errupt in the next few years? They put multi-billiion dollars of research and other things on an island with a volcano and didn't even check if it will be blowing up in the next few years. Thats some really incredible writing there. I mean ... why do these people even get paid for these kind of storylines? There is actually no excuse for this. If you are so bad at your job you could atleast look some story up on reddit you lazy folks!If you are going to watch this movie in the cinema i do not want to ruin your evening. All i can say is that i personally didn't like it at all. For the people who liked it, I hope you can forgive me for not praising this movie to be a 10/10. I hope I didn't offend too many people here and apologize for my writing. As i said i am not a english speaker. I wish you all a wonderful day.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1249,aamor73,Definitely the worthless move of this series,1,3 August 2018,"Do not waste your money and time on this crap.

1250,rubenfalcao_09,"Huge fan of Jurassic Park movies, didn't relate at all with the first Jurassic world",10,23 July 2018,"Completely loved the movie, from the plot with new important moral questions to how well made it is, graphics and the variety of dinosaurs is amazing. Not that kind of predictable movie where you already know what is going to happen. It surprised me sooooo much!!
I didn't relate at all with the first Jurassic world but this one fits so well into the first Jurassic park movies and it's so good. Also loved the scary parts.
You'll love it if you like dinosaurs and it's an amazing story.
Watch it!!!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1251,sparklequeen-47449,A real fun movie,10,21 July 2018,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I laughed, I cried, I gasped, I clutched my best friends arm as we both squealed about the throwbacks and references to the og movies. It was a grand time. Also Chris Pratt is a snack",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1252,rickyjhand,Unwanted Cristisim!,7,26 August 2018,Actually went to the cinema for the first time in years to watch this. And took my 4 year old son to the cinema for the first time as he is a massive Jurassic Park/World franchise fan. Really good film and thoroughly enjoyed it as much as the JW1! Only one part of the films storyline I didn't really like the idea of was to do with the child. As for that it's a really good watch! Don't bother comparing it to the original JP1 and take your critic head off and just enjoy a film that you don't need to think too much about to enjoy.,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1253,jpgamer-37327,Doesn't quite feel like a Jurassic Park/world movie but that's okay,6,25 June 2018,"While the previous installment gave us much of the same but pushed to new heights from the original trilogy, Fallen Kingdom chooses to diverge into a completely new direction besides the inclusion of a new Infominous Dinosour. The movie is a good self contained thriller with some side plots that leave much to be desired. In addition there is seemingly odd pacing that could be compared to the Lost World, but there is a interesting story at the heart of the movie.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1254,patalong,Roaaaaarrrrrrrhhhh?,3,26 July 2018,Yaaaaaaawn! More of the same. Even much more of the same. And then some. Predictable from start zu end. Even the new story-twist (I won't mention it: it would be the only possible spoiler) comes along as subtle as a Brontosaurus in panic.,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1255,markwayland,The movie that did not need to be made,1,2 July 2018,"Saw this with my grandchildren, our 8 year old walked out with tears. I just cannot get behind senseless violence, even if it is to computer generated animals. The dock scene with the dinosaur baying in pain as it is being burned to death, that is a visual and sound that I will never be able to get out of my head. It was not needed, and should not have been in the final cut. Very little of the suspense of the earlier films, which I enjoyed. This movie could have been so much better, but in a word, HORRIBLE. Wish I had never seen it. They should have given refunds at the box office. Do not take children of any age, and if you have a love for animals, do not see this movie. 
The ending, probably the worst I have ever witnessed, and I am well over 60, so I have seen my share of films.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1256,estescarl,NOT THE BEST,4,1 October 2018,This is not the best Jurassic film but I felt like to complete my collection I had to have it. It left a lot to be desired and I really did get bored during some of the slower parts. Actors were not believable just reciting lines. Maybe it will grow on me but right now I will probably not watch it again.,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1257,ruthjordan,Edge of seat,9,5 July 2018,"I was so glad I took my anxiety meds before seeing this. The movie doesn't let up at all, constant edge of seat and pop corn jumping, loved it. The only thing I didn't get was the bit with the mutant kid....or is this a possible xmen/jurrsasic Park spin off......please don't it won't work.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1258,edoardosanguineti,A bunch of cliche,3,12 June 2018,"When I sat down in the cinema I told myself: I bet there's going to be a scene where a character is being chased down by a dinosaur near a cliff but at the last moment a helicopter will save him just in time to be destroyed by something else afterwards. I was right, it literally happened in the first scene!
The rest of the movie was just poor and horrendous filled with plot conveniences such as: getting saved at the last moment before drowning, hackers can unlock everything by just smashing the keyboard, bad guy killed in the dullest way but satisfying to watch etc... The plot was just weak.
One thing that I like to address is that at the beginning there's the scene where the government refuses to save the dinosaurs which is reasonable because the dinosaurs are literally in another country so the US has no business to do with it. This is perceived by the protagonist and her friends like it was a bad decision made by some kind of evil administration. (Like the media depicts today any decision made by the current US administration). So the protagonist and her friends go on a crusade against the people who decided to not save the dinosaurs and join this rich guy who promises to save the dinosaurs. They kinda deserved all the bad things that happened to them during the film like this is what you get if you don't listen to people that have probably more wisdom and experience than you.
This is basically teaching to all the kids that watched the movie that it is ok to go against the law and the people who made it and implying that everything that the government does it's bad. Honestly, the protagonist would have deserved to perish in the ashes of the volcano.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1259,meemurthegreat,Zero out of ten Goldblumes,1,29 June 2018,"Guys. I feel like the premise of this movie (should we save the dinos or not?) is directly symbolic of saving this franchise itself. Saving dinosaurs and selling them for millions. A little on the nose, yeah?Can't we never hit that big red button? Can all the dinosaurs please die? Terrible script, terrible story, terrible directing. I'm not just disappointed, I'm mad. Let's add new characters, new backstory, And change the island. So many plot holes. So much unmotivated character decisions. So absolutely terrible.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1260,spgreen-36239,What crap!,3,26 June 2018,"The only redeeming quality of this movie was the wonderful special FX. The story was so rife with Hollywood special interests and PC BS. I will not be seeing another in the franchise. The ending is simply laughable. Glad Hollywood feels cloned dino's are more important that humans. Movies like this that get shown on 10 screens per megaplex while films that attempt to shine light on real issues like human trafficking (You Were Never Really Here) can hardly be seen. I guess we can all stand by while Hollywood continues to eat it own tail at a furious pace, blaming pirating for their failures.Say no to Hollywood's cash cow franchise mentality! Support independent films!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1261,cammentary,I don't leave films before they finish. This was a welcome exception.,1,21 June 2018,"What an awful film every step of the way.I don't normally pay attention to the score of a film. I did with this one. This was because it sounded like an 8 year old playing with a soundboard loaded with famous scores from other films. Distracting as anything - was waiting for the Imperial March to cue up as a velociroraptor turned up.The evil guy's plan is completely non-sensical from the word go. The ""I'll imprison you for some reason, despite having no reason to keep you around, seconds after I've just casually murdered someone less important"" part was pretty bad.It felt like a Disney straight to home video release from the early 90's. Over the top bad guy behaviour, no logical plot progression or character progression or motivations. Instead it had a 9 figure budget. Little Girl who saves day by overhearing bad guys is incredibly annoying and distracting, but still an upgrade on annoying and distracting kid from last film.Whose great idea was it to have Jeff Goldblum in this for a grand total of 5 minutes?",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1262,alexandertelfer,Leave your brain at home - view this as an action comedy and you will enjoy it,6,11 June 2018,"I went to see the movie yesterday with my family including 8 year old son and 12 year old daughter. I notice some people have given this film 10/10 which is a little baffling considering my 8 year old son only gave it 9 (an the younger you are the more easily pleased, and less critical you are).My wife and I left the cinema being a little confused - we liked it, but didn't like it, hence I have scored it 6. If you leave your brain at home and do not think about anything that happens in the film and the script then it is a good action/comedy - the original as more of an action/thriller/drama - so I guess the two shoudn't really be compared although they try to sell this one under the JP banner. Had they made a more serious film it could have got an 8.The film producers appear to think it is a good idea to throw in a comedy character without realising that it can ruin a film such as Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars. In this film they have included Franklin, who could have been a creditable character had they not provided him with ridiculously silly lines and behaviours.There are a number of parts which defy common sense and are there just to provide further action or a sequel - for example, after capturing Blue they leave Starlord unconcious in the jungle - I would have expected the female vet to insist that he was taken to safety with them (and the baddies to take him to help control and look after Blue). But the worst bit is the end where, although I do not wish the dinosaurs to be killed either, they let them loose to cause potentially massive amounts of damage and death (and a future film).Anyway, as I said, leave your brain at home and you will enjoy it a lot - if you take any intelligence with you then it may be a little frustrating.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1263,brendakoosed,This movie was god awful,4,27 July 2018,This movie was really bad if you want to watch something good you should go watch LEGO jurrassic world on Netflix because anything was better than this.

Advancing on from Jurassic World in a way that *maaaaybe* steers a little too close to The Lost World, but makes up for it with a perfectly paced plot, breathtaking cinematography, fantastic practical and CGI effects, one of the most avant-garde scores to come from Michael Giacchino and brilliant performances from the cast.

Compared to most sequels it doesn't fall too short of a good sequel and pays homage to the original but focuses on the dinosaurs survival and wether they can coexist with humans which already makes it unique to any other dinosaur movie and lives up to the title of the movie and fans anxiously waiting for another sequel.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1271,joelsave,"Too much action, too little dialoge and storytelling. But holy crap Chris Pratt is good as Owen Grady!",7,11 June 2018,"Let's be positive first: 
Chris Pratt again goes a really great job as Owen, he is funny, entertanting and always delivers the best lines. I also liked the girl and her storyline in the move, aswell as Blue and the moral question of the dinosaures rights in the world. There is one scene in particular that is extraordinary well done, you just feel empty and want to tear up during this specific scene. This made for a great first act, but unfortunatly the movie just falls flat after this. So let's be negative now!The main storyline in this movie is well done in the first act, but they never further explore it after that. You just see action scene after action scene and you never have a chance to breath. There is never a scene with a long interesting dialoge. The third act of this movie is just to long to watch with joy. You forget the second act of this movie and the third is too much and too long for you to like.Although I think 2 out of 3 parts of the movie is bad. I give it a 7 out of 10 because did like the ending and I really loved the first act. The ending has set up the third movie in this trilogy to be a really great one. And I hope they improve the storytelling and lower the mount of action scenes.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1272,bonbyrnes,Not great,5,25 June 2018,"I'm a huge fan of Jurassic PARK Jurassic World has been a wanna be from the beginning, sadly.A velociraptor has been feared as the most dangerous animal in these movies but in Jurassic World 1-2 it's almost viewed as a domesticated empathic pet. Which is annoying. I feel like thy try to make it funny rather than making it thrilling like the first 3 movies. Fallen Kingdom, tried to be more thrilling and scary with the new dinosaur but it still wasn't much of anything leading to a scattered plot. I feel Fallen Kingdom tries to be like ""The Lost World"" you have a few minutes on the island and then focuses it within civilization. There are even scenes that are identical (looking over a hill through binoculars seeing the animals being taken) which is another point it was a rescue mission just like The Lost World. Overall I gave it a 5 more like (5.7)- because I am a fan, I love Chris Pratt, I just feel like they are going the opposite direction with these movies.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Every film since the original has featured a dinosaur that was particularly dangerous and this film lazily continued, ripping off the ""uncontrollable genetically engineered"" dinosaur crown from the previous film's Indominus Rex. Chris Pratt was wasted in this film and Dallas Howard was her usual stiff, unbelievable self. The worst actor in the movie however, was Daniella Pineda.

1294,ridebaby,Fan Service Galore,3,12 June 2018,"SPOILER: While summer blockbusters are not the thought intensive movies you would typically expect. Jurassic World 2 is to lazy writing as light beer is to a drunk, inseparable. From your typical jungle mercenaries set on betraying our protagonist, to the redesigned 'indo-rapter' (really?) - the movie digs deep into film cliches from the 90s; to perhaps create an incubator for nostalgia? If that is so, the movie is right on the target, because the amount of fan service gets to a point where you go ""okay, we get it."" From raptors hunting in museums, to our ever present 'Rexy' the T-rex (how convenient it is for a blood thirsty carnivore to always be there whenever help is needed, and for it to scoot along out of scene without leaving a single scratch on our protagonist; remember we're talking about a 3000 pound carnivore here). Dinosaurs running in plains with our protagonist; raptors opening doors, that one scene with the goat?

Acting was also fine but whats the use of good acting and visuals when you don't have the story to back it up. Everything is just so very convenient for the characters in this movie that it just wouldn't make sense to a normal person , That's why it becomes extremely unrelatable, therefore you start to loose the interest in the movie.This movie looks forced just so that they can make a trilogy.
Watch it if you are a fan of the first one , But i would skip it.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1296,dannychenhh,Dinosaurs should be extinct.,9,19 June 2018,"Jurassic World is a movie based on a story of cloning. The story starts off cloning a dinosaur's DNA, to real life, and scientists found it interesting to have real dinosaurs in real life. So they start funding a dinosaur park, where people can visit wild dinosaurs and scientists observe all the dinosaurs, and they clone more types of dinosaurs, and they also combined dinosaur DNA. This leads them to a big problem.
 One day, the group of dinosaurs scientists tried to combine two types of meat-eating dinosaurs into a fierce T-Rex. They kept it in a very tough cage and monitoring it extra carefully. But until this day, the T-rex fled away into the boundless jungle. Soon, a commotion happened in the dinosaur park and dinosaurs didn't behave as usual, and people started to stay away from the dinosaurs. After the fierce T-Rex appeared in the dinosaur park, which destroyed all the buildings in the park, and killed hundreds and thousands of people with other dinosaurs, they are left in the wild. 
 So, should people clone more dinosaur, and protect them, or should they make all dinosaurs extinct again? I think that people should make the dinosaurs go extinct again because dinosaurs cannot live with human beings peacefully. Dinosaurs think that all the world is their home, which leads them to destroy all the cities, and downtown, causing human to have to move away from the dinosaurs. If there's no dinosaur in this world, then nothing like this will happen. Still, people will improve their lifestyles and technologies. On the second, dinosaurs can be extremely dangerous to human. Just imagine when you are surfing, a gigantic dinosaur is just below your board. Wouldn't it be scary? Or imagine a farmer or nomads riding horses on a wild grassland with a triceratops just running beside him. If that doesn't scare you, what about a pterosaur flying right beside you when you are in an air balloon or when your plane just took off? I think that dinosaurs are very dangerous to us human beings, so I disagree with cloning more dinosaurs and protecting them.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1297,ammarmancolt,Jurassic Park vs Fallen Kingdom,7,24 June 2018,"My first movie ever in a movie hall was Jurassic Park at the age of 5. Since then I have watched it many times and below are the reasons why I feel that it stands the test of time as one of the greatest movies ever and why its sequels fall short:1. The premise was simple: huge and hungry carnivorous dinosaurs are out to eat you and if you're caught in between, you must run for survival. This simplicity is critical for any survival movie because giving the impression of a clear danger is fundamental to evoking fear in your audience. Sequels of Jurassic Park have abandoned this simple premise in the favor of complicated plots where these humongous beasts are clever, intelligent, empathetic, know right from wrong, forgiving, and respect family bonds. More drama than thrill. If Jurassic Park is 10/10, Fallen kingdom is 5/10 on this dimension.2. Humans are vulnerable: Every character in the first movie is someone you can relate to. They are scared and just want to survive. Not in the sequels and it looks fake. Moreover, if characters onscreen are not scared, your audience won't be either. Kills thrill factor. FK, though did a better job at this. If JP is 10/10, FK is 8/10 on this dimension.3. Dinosaurs are beasts and humans are humans and humans will defend each other against the dinosaurs. IMO Fallen Kingdom is way off on this one. Characters that probably have no regrets eating chicken for lunch and mutton for dinner, have so much love for these beasts that they not only risk themselves but the entire humanity to save them. kills thrill factor as the lines between good and bad and right and wrong are blurred. If JP is 10/10, FK is 2/10.4. There are two types of dinosaurs: ones that eat humans and ones that don't. I remember having difficulty at the age of 5 understanding how in JP people could go so close to some of these animals without being harmed until I was told the difference between carnivores and herbivores. That's not as simple with current movies anymore. In FK, there are carnivores that only eat bad people, mutants that go after good people, human sympathizers that defend humans, some that can be trained to accomplish tasks, and others with individual personality and traits. This may not be a bad thing necessarily but it does make them approachable and beings that can be rationed with, in some cases even more than humans. It adds to the confusion of the audience and kills some of the thrill factor. If JP was 10/10, FK is 8/10 on this dimension purely because FK has good character development.5. The execution is about creating and holding tension. JP does this amazingly well with its execution. The setting is dark, gloomy with relatable,vulnerable, unsuspecting characters travelling through a scenic park with hungry and ferocious dinosaurs. The only thing protecting them from the dinosaurs are the electric fences and to some extent their jeeps. There is clear sabotage and defenses are compromised. This creates a self sustaining tension throughout the movie until the characters escape the park. In fact the tension was so strong that it survived the movie and lingered in our memory for days after. FK and most of JPs sequels fail miserable at creating this level of suspense and instead keep it limited to action sequences. If JP was 10/10, FK is 7/10.Having said all of the above, I must say I really liked FK. The acting, surprisingly, was top notch and the humor was good. There was a lot of action too and as previously mentioned, character development was good and the plot was well explained.I also liked how they used the old mansion on a full moon night to add a touch of draconion horror movies. Overall, I'll rate it a good 7/10.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1299,AkiriNim,Great entertainment but nothing more,7,28 June 2018,"Being the fifth film it can hardly come as a surprise that this isn't as good as the first, or second, well maybe the third but not the fourth.So I came in with low expectations and was entertained. It's mindless action (with dinosaurs!) that works in the moment but don't expect to think much about it afterwards.It actually starts really well. In the first few minutes I got the same old vibe from Jurassic Park but sadly this doesn't last throughout the film.
The time spend on the island seemed a bit reused. I found it a bit too repetitive with the whole running from dinosaurs and you've seen most of the problems and solutions in the other movies.
The part back on mainland worked better for me. Not that the plot gets better but I felt it was better paced and I couldn't predict the outcome in the same way (well other than things will go horribly wrong).
The subplot with the girl was the worst. It felt like they tried to make the film deeper which doesn't work. 
Other than that be prepared for a lot of facepalms because people make incredible bad decisions when facing dinosaurs but that's part of the fun I guess.So if you like dinos and mindless entertainment watch it. Otherwise it might be best to just skip it.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

This movie, without a doubt, beats Jurassic Park III, and even Jurassic World. I enjoy all of the Jurassic Park movies, but this one definitely made my day! Also, it even had the touches to make this a perfect 25th anniversary title to Jurassic Park!

Bad things

-the ending is some of the biggest bs I've seen in a movie in a long time, and the reason behind the bs is because of something a certain character says that is so dumb
-the ending was the way it was so they could just hype up another Jurassic movie
-""Dinosaur Lives Matter""

1315,zarvmg,New perspectives to a worn saga,8,1 September 2018,"This movie generates so much debate as to determine Fallen Kingdom is either the worst or the best movie of the saga, that it was a natural choice as subject of my first review on IMDB.The main challenge of Fallen Kingdom was to find a plausible reason for characters to get the stupid idea of returning to the island. Not only Bayona developed that in a smart way, but he achieved quite efficiently to move on from a déjà vu plot to bring his own view on how a Jurassic movie should be. And damn, I wish we never came back to Isla Sorna, Isla Nublar, or any other island from now on.This movie proposes new characters and plot developments, brings new perspectives to the jurassic park saga in such a way that we leave the present movie with more questions than answers.Juan Antonio Bayona's direction and photography is by far the most artistic of all Jurassic Movies and he has achieved to bring horror movies standards to a film with dinos, something I never expected to be so enjoyable.Although the screenplay is too predictable and suffer inconsistencies and irregular rhythm, I have really enjoyed how Bayona is able to generate many tensions, something I though only Spielberg was able to create with dinosaurs. I am not easily impressed, I just remember how I was shivering and feeling stressful when I first watched iconic scenes such as the appearance of the T-Rex in the first movie, and the rescue of the baby T-Rex by its parents in the Lost World. Well, I got that feeling in Fallen Kingdom, not only once, but several times in one single movie.Fallen Kingdom is really an excellent entertaining movie, as long as you watch it with an open mind.Lots of watchers give bad review complaining that it's not Jurassic Park anymore, but what do they expect, really ? Just pick up a DVD so that you can keep watching a movie you enjoyed.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

The CGI Dinosaurs in Fallen Kingdom are as good as ever but there's a law of diminishing returns applying here.
More dinos have replaced any effort at characterization and storytelling.
Do you remember how little screen time was given to the monsters in the original? That was because the script was good enough to make you care about the characters and story so that as the set pieces developed you were actually invested in the people.
Fallen Kingdom makes Jurassic Park look like the masterpiece it is.

Jurassic Park and The Lost World are consistent stories, both comes from best selling books written by Michael Crichton and directed by Steven Spielberg, Fallen Kingdom is the opposite in bad way.Here the story comes from a team with only marketing in mind, the result is painful to watch, you have a plenty of stupid scenes ripped off from the first movies of the franchise but in our time with a lot of inconsistencies.

And of course the dinosaurs and the memorable chomps!! Jurassic Park had it all for at least the first two movies. Then it becomes this....... Jurassic World fallen kingdom is a very weak cinematic experience. The first scene grabbed my attention but could've been crafted with more suspense. T-Rex is just never going to be the star in these films I wish it was. These genetic made hybrids only bring on more CGI. The movie was slow at times and got way off track when it landed at Lockwoods Estate. I feel like this was just overdone and rushed to basically end with a few words from Malcolm. He should retire!! The only thing memorable or at least worth seeing is the beginning with the encounter of Rexy in old fashioned Jurassic Park limelight and by the way it didn't last very long. Other than that I think there were only 3 or 4 chomps none of them intense like you're use too. This was in my opinion just about as good as JP 3 which isn't saying much!!!

1325,mattgsmith,The 2nd best Jurassic Park movie,9,10 June 2018,"After reading the mixed reviews, I cautiously approached the latest installment and on reflection, the movie surpassed my expectations, significantly. Visually, the movie is stunning, with epic wide angle shots. Light and shadows are used to excellent effect, heightening the tension. The dinosaurs look better than ever, especially the animatronic ones. The soundtrack, while never really blasting out the classic John Williams score, adds to the tension and excitement. The film has a great deal of tension and is probably the scariest since the original Jurassic Park. The opening scene is fantastic and sets the tone well. The movie barely lets up from here. The story is the most interesting of the sequels and while some twists are predictable, other moments are a surprise. The character arks of Owen and Clare progress well, though not in the direction expected. The new characters are welcome additions, though Toby Jones would benefit from more screen time for his rather obnoxious role. It's not all perfect, some scenes don't work. Chris Pratt trying to escape the lava is poorly executed and slightly cringy. Some scenes jump quickly to others, leading to a lack of contunuity. The music interrupts the flow of some dialogue. Despite these minor issues, the movie is a very exciting addition to the franchise. I was left thinking about one scene, a haunting scene, beautifully shot and filled with regret. The dinosaurs retain a serious threat, but we very much care about their survival. Well worth a second viewing, let alone a first!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1327,claeysm,could almost be a parody,4,24 June 2018,"I don't know when it happened, but at some point I realized that movie reviews mean almost nothing anymore. 9s and 10s are thrown around like pocket change, and ratings are often based on nothing more than personal entertainment. That isn't to say that being entertained isn't important, but what's happening is that people are forgetting what it's like to be moved by a compelling story at the same time.. to truly feel for characters and to actually be invested in their world. This art of telling a good story is sadly being replaced by spectacle and star power, where we're force-fed cheap gimmicks and dazzling effects in order to distract us from lazy plots and 1-dimensional characters.I think it goes without saying that the wonder and magic of Jurassic Park can not be replicated in this franchise. We've simply become desensitized to seeing dinosaurs on the big screen, and with each installment we've been bombarded with more and more. In many ways, Jurassic Park really did end with the first film.. That being said, what made the original so effective was how it used the viewer's imagination to create fear. The gradual building of suspense would then culminate in true terror once finally brought face to face with the creatures. The impending storm approaching the island would become full force in the dark of night during the Tyrannosaur's escape. It was this careful control of the suspense and thrills which made us appreciate what was happening and feel vested in the situations. In Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom however, the threats are often given little time to build and simply thrown at us then quickly overcome. An allosaurus suddenly in the tunnel.. a carnosaur circling the gyro-sphere.. even the storms have no approach. While the cinematography and direction for some of these scenes is quite beautiful and effective (particularly the allosaurus tunnel scene), they come out of nowhere and are resolved too quickly. To make things worse, childish ""comic relief"" has been wedged in to so many moments throughout the film.. a cheap way to distract the audience from the big issues like lazy story-telling and generic characters.This film resorts to so many generic character tropes it nearly comes off as a parody. A greedy corporate guy with hair slicked back in a tight blue suit, an old man smothered to death by a pillow on his death bed to hide a truth, evil bidders at an auction who look like caricatures of james bond villains, a ruthless leather neck marine who's meat-headed type we've seen a million times, a tough latina girl to keep things edgy, and a nervous nerd boy, Franklin, who somehow manages to surpass Jar Jar Binks in hate-ability. I give this 4 stars despite having left the theatre depressed by what the franchise has resorted to. Bayona has done some very visually compelling things despite the lousy script he had to work with. I am tempted though to rate it lower simply to counter the absurd ratings of 9s and 10s on here.. come on people. An entertaining pop-corn flick is not the same thing as a great film.

The backdrop volcanic eruption and multiple species of dinosaurs running for their lives was epic and exciting enough to look forward for what's coming... then in the second half, it falls into cliches and escape plots that we've all seen in its preceding films.

Plot was childish - with the ""Evil Corporate Guy"" wanting to exploit the surviving dinosaurs for militarization and money. And of course it's 2018 so the plot had to preach about ""dinosaurs are people too"" and the US government must intervene to save them. There was even a MSNBC scrolling headline about ""President denies the existence of dinosaurs"" and we all know the not subtle jab. Seriously, I want to watch dinosaurs without political undertones - we are surrounded by it everywhere else. Let me have 2 hours of not that.The script was written by a 4 year old. Well I don't know that for sure, but it was really bad. You would think there would be 10000 awesome writers willing to write something great for a famous movie. But apparently the PtB opted for not awesome writers and told them to make the worse script ever and they succeeded.

The acting was worse, the plot looked like a sieve, but its was a great rock-em-sock-em robot movie.Fallen Kingdom brings some great things to the JP franchise. Suspense is one of them. In the first JP, they had loads of it, the others between this one and the original do not. Where the ""sequels"" bring loads of action and explosions and running and screaming, this one has you chewing your nails. ""Are they going to drown?"" ""Dont look behind you!"" ""OMG its in her room!!""There are serious plot holes too, like how a massive sea beast survives for 3 years in a tank with no food, or not getting sick for whatever reason? Or WHY would anyone save these dinosaurs, after everything that happened in the past parks and attempts, how is this a good plan? Why would Hammond build his billion dollar park on a possibly unpredictable volcano? What happened to the critters on Isla Sorna? What possible value would these beast have to the military? A well aimed missile strike from a jet would make short work of a rampaging T-Rex.But in the end, its a fun movie, plenty of action and Spielberg Suspense as well as a wee bit of the McGuffin.As the title says, you either hate it or love it.I for one dont hate it.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1364,rajivsbookreviews,Much better than some of the others in the franchise,8,9 June 2018,"I enjoyed watching ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"". It is a great follow up to the previous movie and nice to see some of my favorite characters back on screen. The movie stays true to the franchise and is full of adventure and thrills. There is never a dull moment in the movie as something exciting keeps taking place and you find yourself in the edge of your seat. The CGI and effects are amazing as always and they feel more refined and real. There are also some heartwarming moments where I actually felt more empathetic towards the dinosaurs. Another good thing about Fallen Kingdom is you don't have to watch the previous installments to figure out what's happening. Even a newbie to the franchise can pick up on what happening and would want to watch the previous movies.The characters are a mixed bag. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are charming on screen as always, but there is hardly any character development between them. Daniella Pineda and Justice Smith are good supporting characters that provide comic relief. Isabella Sermon is adorable in her debut role as Maisie Lockwood and has done a terrific job. The remaining actors who played the villains are amicable but are easily forgettable, since they are very clichéd and don't bring anything new to the screen. In fact, Toby Jones seems to be look bored in his scenes, and Ted Levine's character was just annoying. The movie would have been better if the villains were more complex and interesting.Apart from the characters, the only reason I am not giving it a full star rating is because it was predictable. Since this is the fifth installment, we can expect that is going to happen in the next scene. While this is fun, I would have loved it the thrills deviated from what we are used to seeing. Having said that, ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" is a full-on family entertainer that is definitely worth watching in the cinemas. It is in no way close to the original 1993 movie, but it is much better than the others in the franchise.Read more of my reviews at rajivsreviews.com",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1368,martin-sykora,Don't waste your time on this!,1,28 September 2018,"I usually can't be bothered to write reviews, but this is so beyond horrible that I feel the need to try to save others.
I loved the first Jurassic Park movie and watched the franchise steadily go down in quality, as is the usual fate I guess, but JP 2 and 3 were still at least enjoyable.
Jurassic World felt like rock bottom, the material has obviously been bled dry of any new ideas. But hey, even beating a dead horse can still make money, I guess.I went into this with extremely low expectations, but boy was I unprepared. Lazy writing and directing doesn't even come close to describing it, I barely forced myself to watch to the end. The main characters are so shallow and irrational you don't feel a thing when their life is threatened, and all the ""close death escape"" scenes were so obvious and forced (and way WAY too many) I didn't feel a tingle of suspense. 
The ""plot"" is very ""original"", people want to save the poor animals from re-extinction, but evil corporate people want to make money of them instead, so they send ""tough guy"" hunter with some goons, but good prevails, yay! There, I saved you 2 hours of life, I promise watching the grass grow is more entertaining.And when you think it can't get any worse, you see them literally recycling scenes from earlier JP movies, like the girl closing a small door in front of the charging Raptor (yes, it was somehow stuck and then magically unstuck at the last moment, oooh so unexpected :-)) Or T-Rex saving them from a predator that's about to eat them, then doing his mighty roar thing, and since that's so cool and before unseen, they actually do that twice, seriously near the end of the movie he eats something and again and roars, just... wow! If only I could at least laugh at the stupidity, but I mostly felt just bored and angry about wasting my time. Sure, there's dinosaurs and volcano explosions, I guess us dumb pop-corn eating movie goers don't need more these days; well, I can enjoy a dumb action movie every now and then, but it has to make at least a little sense. I sure am never gonna watch another Jurassic movie after this, and will know to avoid products of these writers and director.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

This should have been one of this years highlights for me - but to be honest it's not living up to the hype generated by the previous movies and it's just disappointing. Giving away the greatest sequence of the movie after some 30 minutes I am wondering what the explanation of the writers and producers would sound like. Everything that follows after that amazing sequence about the destruction of Isla Sorna is only mediocre. The storyline with the auction of the rescued dinosaurs is pure insanity. The reason for me giving this movie 6/10 is because of the humor, the much improved chemistry between Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard and some good, but wasted ideas. Only the end with the dinosaurs finally freely roaming the US was kind of satisfying.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

I wrote this late because it has been my low comparison this summer.

JW was just okay. This movie improves on the formula by adding in the classic horror elements into it but fails to deliver a good performance from the cast.The dinosaur elements were much better than the human element in this film. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard literally dont have any chemistry what so ever, the good guys are just there and they dont really shine that much. 
The chemistry b/w Blue and Owen is much better than everything else. 
Many of the characters had limited activity and were just present on screen, nothing they did seem intelligent or added value to the plot/movie.

And worst thing is there is again another hybrid only this one is train to kill laser taged targets (yeah i'm not joking)

In the first film the dinosaurs were the enemy and in the last film they were bringing out this idea that there was something more to them and you felt that in this film.  I don't know about everyone else but there was that one part that definitely tug on your heartstrings if you're an animal person.  The theater was clapping in the end and this film manage to do what Ryan Johnson failed to do with Star Wars the last Jedi.  This is probably my second favorite film in the franchise next to the original Jurassic Park!  This film had adventure it had drama and attention never let up and then it also had those heartbreaking moments that were in the first one.  Good work Jurassic Park crew you guys managed to pull it off. You guys need to call Kathleen Kennedy and tell her how to do a movie right.

Yes the dinosaurs look great on the screen, yes there is a lot of action in the movie but somehow there's no magic around it. Remember you could here the t-rex coming with the sound of his big footsteps? that was so chilling and you didn't even see him. In jurassic world and fallen kingdom the dinosaurs just jump out of nowhere. The movie is reallly fast. 1 minute they are at home, 2 minutes later they're on the island. 5 minutes later they found what they were looking for. 10 minutes later they are back on the boat home. and the rest of the movie is in a big house. I just don't understand why the writers chose for the ""let's get them of the island to the human world"" direction. Stay on the island and write some good suspension. It's still a good action movie but don't get your hopes to high, that way you won't be disappointed. i don't know much about acting and i think the actors did a good job, not an oscar performance but good.

Honestly, it was just a rollercoaster ride that kinda made me want to throw up. The plot is all over the place, the characters don't really have any kind of development. The concept was very shallow. A little disappointing coming from absolutely enjoing the first Jurassic World. A little tip to help ease future disappointmen: Don't come to this movie expecting a logical storyline.

1395,cajros,A bit disappointing,5,27 August 2019,"As a fan of the 'Jurassic Park' movies I must say that I was disappointed by this one. It seems like most of the film was recorded indoors, which is a shame compared to all the previous films in which the main action took place outdoors on the island. Sure, there are some special effects and dinosaurs, but it's missing this adventurous theme - they've made it into a total action movie.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

The reviewer who (very boringly) listed the references-erm, I think you're missing the point mate, and there's no way this film is a 'mess'.

I'm not gonna lie, I enjoyed Jurassic World because it got back to the basics of the original but Fallen Kingdom just turned this into a joke. It's as if the writers and directors of Fast & Furious took over Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom and decided ""Hey, lets just create crazy new dinosaurs and throw non stop dinosaur action scenes at the audience, who cares if it makes any sense or not, lets also add a stupid nerd who isn't funny to try and make this an action comedy film."" The first opening scene was the only enjoyable part of this whole film, after that I was surprised Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Kevin Hart didn't appear randomly to fight some dinosaurs and crack a couple jokes.So dinosaurs are taken to an old mansion in Nothern california.. Really? And held for an underground auction for a few million bucks? Seriously? Who the hell agreed to make this the actual storyline? So a team of people actually sat around and discussed different ideas and this is what they agreed upon? They actually get paid for this?

1399,tornikebegiashvili,"Wow, this was next level of not giving a damn",1,6 September 2018,"So, Jurassic World turned out to be fun, engaging, tense in some moments, kind of cheesy here and there but it was fun to watch. Fallen Kingdom on the other hand not so much. Recreating the old iconic scenes to cash on, no new ideas, plot was weak and full of holes. Typical 2017-2018 blockbuster with nothing new to say. 
It was utterly boring. N:1 The main characters were literally invulnerable. Examples: Chris Pratt (Owen) laying next to a lava not getting hurt even a little bit and escaping death with shenanigans even tho he was in paralysis. The said recently recovered from paralysis Owen outruns the freaking volcanic eruption, then he and other characters outrun freaking dinos who are trying to escape from the island as well. Bryce Dallas (Claire) takes a fang in her leg from the Indoraptor at the climax of the movie and walks it out... Freaking kid outrunning an Indoraptor...N:2 Too many Ex Machinas. Not even going to bother pointing out scenes on this oneN:3 Plot holes: If Indoraptor is so ""advanced"" why can't it track down a smell of a human (before fanboys start yelling that it was the early version of Indoraptor, you are trying too hard to justify screenwriting laziness.) I am not going to point out everything wrong with this movie because if people who filmed this did not give a damn about plot and screenwriting why should I?",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

I will take the first ten minutes of this movie (yes the sea scene) as the Jurassic World two. And the rest of it as the prequel of Guardians of the Galaxy. No one has ever said the cabin he made is not in Missouri right?

1406,sideshowbob-07653,"Good, but not as good as the first Jurassic World",6,8 June 2018,"I haven't written this immediately after watching the film. I've slept on it to properly digest it so here's what I think. The film itself is decent enough, I'm a big fan of all the films (even the bemoaned JP3) and this one sits itself along the others quite well. 
I loved the first one, brilliant entertainment, Owen the swashbuckling hero and Claire the corporate employee who did everything by the book and wanted to preserve the company and generate profit above all else. It was a rollercoaster of a film and had all the elements you'd want from a Jurassic Park film (albeit with some ""suspend your disbelief"" moments)This film, however, still has some elements of the first one but has become slightly darker. The light hearted humour moments and one liners are rarer and the film seems intent to become more sensible and tell a more moral story rather than be more lighter entertainment. 
The film goes at a good pace with some good set pieces that you'd come to expect and the 2 odd hours flew by but I couldn't help, as much as I liked it, that it was missing something. The new director for this and I assume for the 3rd instalment has his own ideas on telling the story which is all good but this film feels different to the first, not in a good or necessarily bad way, but it'll make the trilogy feel a bit disjointed. The main protagonist Mills (Rafe Spall) doesn't convince as the main ""bad guy"" for me. He seemed very one dimensional and a bit wooden, his character never developed and maybe it should have been a little bit. Overall it's a good film and I took my 6 year old son and he enjoyed it but it left me a bit wanting. I hope the third one is an improvement. 6.5/10 for me",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1407,jgmart,It's a Jurassic Park Movie!!,7,5 July 2018,Put your notebook down. Like most movies there are things that defy logic in the real world. First and foremost there are currently no genitically created dinosaurs in the world today! Now that you are armed with this knowledge you can enjoy this movie. It wasn't fantasic but certainly entertaining. Those dinosaurs that don't exist were excellent as were all the CGI effects. Cast was good and funny at times. Overall a good popcorn movie.,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1409,jetblue-07399,Best Jurassic Park series movie since the first! A few problems however...,6,25 June 2018,"SPOILER: I had my suspicions after the first movie that this wouldn't be that good. The first Jurassic world left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth as it had annoying characters, and stupid sub-plots like ""the parents getting a divorce"" that nobody cared about. But I was totally wrong! This film revisits the island isla nublar, a team sent by Eli to gather DNA from the indominus Rex extracts the bone and after a couple casualties succeed in escaping with it. there is a now active volcano close to eruption killing all life on that island. The government decides not to intervene with the ""extinction"" of dinosaurs (I use quotation marks for a reason I'll explain later) with the help of dr. Ian malcom stating dinosaurs should be killed off, and that this was the correction for their creation.Claire dearing is running a group to save the dinosaurs, and after she's called by mr. Lockwood who's put together a crew to save the dinosaurs that he and Hammond were co creating, she agrees to help by going on the island for her high rank access, and to get Owen Grady who left Claire since she didn't want to live in a trailer while he built a cabin, to save blue he agrees to come along to track, and capture blue relocating her. When they get to the island they have a short time to extract a couple dozen dinosaurs from the island, when Owen gets through to blue they are betrayed by the gunmen, blue is shot and wounded when a foolish gunner shoots her out of fear, Owen is tranqed and left for dead, Claire and a friend is also locked in a control room with a baryonx hunting them they barely escape and regroup with Owen after coming to and running from lava, they all survive and manage to escape on the boat before it departs. Afterwards we learn that mr. Lockwood was betrayed by Eli who wants to sell the dinosaurs to further support his indoraptor project which will fully follow their orders using a special laser dot sight. Once they return they reach their destination they realize it's not a second island for the dinosaurs to inhabit but it's the Lockwood mansion, Eli and dr. Wu have been creating the indoraptor using indominus Rex DNA but they need blue's Raptor DNAOwen and Claire are found and captured and Eli being the villain tells them his evil plan.. cus... yeah... and they have a dinosaur in their next cell break them out.
They find a little girl that's lockwoods ""granddaughter"" (she's actually a clone of his daughter who deceased in a car accident) and they spy on a dinosaur auctioning, they show off the indoraptor and it's abolites and they decide to sell it, dr. Wu is outraged because he knows someone else will steal their Concept. Owen let's a pachysephlosaurs on the loose which destroys the whole room, when the room is clear the game hunter enters and finds the indoraptor in its cage, he shoots it with tranquilizers and it plays like it's knocked out, he tries pulling its tooth out for a collectible, but it bites into his arm ripping it off, he's mauled to death and the auctioneer tries to escape in an elevator while its distracted, the door closes before it can get in, but it as it turns around it's tail breaks the control panel and the door opens where he feasts on some auctionees.The indoraptor is now on the loose and starts hunting people, Owen, Claire and the girl are running in the dark when it finds them and digs into Claire's leg with its raptor claw, it focuses on the girl and starts hunting her, she hides in her room and it goes to the roof, scaling the side of the building it unlocks the balcony door and is about to have a tasty treat when blue and Owen enter and fight her off, they manage to get outside and are on the roof, the indoraptor is about to finish them when Claire uses its laser gun to make it go after Owen where he evades it and it nearly falls down on the triceratops horns below, it tries to pull up but blue Knocks it down and finishes it. Dr. Wu is trying to gather the dinosaurs and his research when Claire's dinosaur enthusiasts knock him out, and his guards drag him off (setting up another movie) during all this there's an explosion that starts pumping gas into the dinosaurs area, if they'd don't free them they'll all die from gas. Claire makes the decision not to release them. But the girl lets them loose and the government lets them... stay on the loose relocating some to deserts, etc.? Hmm okay?? And then Eli gets torn in half by the trex on the loose while he's trying to escape in his car with the indominus bone.The end. It's a good movie that's a lot different than the other films in its series, now here's some of my major plot holes and issues with it... 1) The island Isla Nublar is about to be toasted killing the dinosaurs yes, but this will not cause extinction on their race... remember Jurassic Park 2&3? Yeah we'll both those movies were set on Isla SORNA the second island, with hundreds of dinosaurs... so... are Jurassic Park 2&3 non-canon now and there is no second island? Or did they kill all of the dinosaurs there or what... 2) The intense scene with the indoraptor hunting Owen, Claire, and the girl is almost completely ruined when Owen decides ""turning out all the lights will make us invisible to it"" the sad thing is that it actually works, until the lights come back on, they're behind glass in the dark and the indoraptor can't 1. See them using thermal tracking? 2. Sense them with enhanced smell 3. Use common night vision almost all predators have? Cmon guys this was a major mistake...3) the government condones and actually helps relocate the Trex, Blue, and some other dinos to the desert, and in the end blue stares upon a neighbor hood... while dr. Malcom states that it's a new age with dinosaurs and humans and they'll have to adapt... I'm sorry but there's no way the government would release deadly carnivores like raptors and Trexs upon innocent people for them to destroy homes and eat them that's some serious problem.There were lots of mistakes, and little details that I noticed were wrong but besides those 3 major things nothing really bothered me. Go see the movie, if you enjoyed the first Jurassic world, Jurassic Park, and if you liked 2&3 then you'll for sure love this one. I'd rate it a 9/10 for the creativity in this series but I feel like the plot holes and problems with it really bring this movie down. I mean how do you completely forget about things like a second island, and nightvision/thermal vision/super scent in a movie. Oh one thing I will give props to about this movie is that it is definitely the most intense. So much action and yet a good story. 8/10 is a fair rating.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1410,evenxxx,Fallen Franchise,3,12 July 2018,"When I think about seeing a Jurassic Park movie in a theatre I think about defenseless human beings in a jungle, trying to survive their own creation: prehistoric monsters they can neither control or predict.
This has NONE of it.
If you want a bunch of hollywood clichés that will keep you from pondering about science and ethics and whether we should or not this is your movie. You've got your moronic villans, your over the top special effects and music, your predictable twists and all the things we've already seen before: the people hanging from abyssal drops, the deus ex machina T-Rex roaring, the shootings, the genetically modified species, the stupid ""I want to sell this to the military"" surprising *not* plot twist, the bridging a gap with a jumping vehicle bullcrap....
And what's with trying to tame a velocirraptor? We already did it with wolves, we have our custom designed pet-objects we choose by colour and size, do we really believe our work on taming nature so wonderful we need to imagine we could translate it to raptors? Were they so amazingly uncontrolable and dangerous in the first movie we needed to imagine we can teach them to sit and beg for treats? What happened with ambition and imagination? This storyline is just sad and pathetic. The red haired high-heels dudette was all about ""assests"" on the previous movie and now she's all about the dinosaurs, can we get a gap filler for that character hole? Nope.
No, you won't get any brains in here. You were promised lava and a fight for survival which you will fast forward through on the first 30 minutes or so of this 2 hours lenght torture.
Oh yes, if you missed the ""we're using a brontosaur for a kick in the feels"" you'll get that, twice. Enjoy. It's all down the hill from that point on.

It is the best movie of the year because of one simple fact: it is made by people who didn't just want to get paid but wanted also to make something that the audience would appreciate. If you thought that this was yet another blockbuster with not-so-witty one-liners (you know, a meaningful sentence followed by ""I don't know what I just said"", which seems to be in every movie after 2012, why, I don't know) you are mistaken. This movie is beyond an action-packed movie that you watch when you are bored, for many reasons: it has a very sad scene that can rival those in dramas, trust me. Not only that, there are many funny scenes and those very scary which can be funny just the same. Moreover, it is cleverly written, filmed and actors made all of that hard work show. 
This movie has one thing that I have not seen in a long time in new movies. The action is synchronized from the beginning to the end in terms of the plot. When you compare it to Avengers you can see clearly how in Jurassic World they thought of everything. That is why this movie is underrated, and because of the bad trailers.

-The cinematography and directing from J.A Bayona shines through in certain moments
-The story takes the franchise to a place it has never gone before
-The CGI is better than ever before, and animatronics were used which is a major plus.
Bryce Dallas Howards character has improved.About halfway through the movie when the volcano is erupting, the movie moves at the fastest pace from action set price to the next, giving high entertainment value.Suspense in a house in the last third of the film which Jurassic world was lacking. The second half of the movie in the house I didn't really enjoy, but it did take the franchise in a new direction.The score is pretty good.-The final scene sets up what could be an epic movie. And the opening scene is good as well.Cons
Chris Pratt's character has barely any development. The supporting cast are annoying and or paper thin, and the villains are ridiculously stupid and cartoonish.It is hardly worth comparing it to Jurassic Park, as it pales in comparison. This film is ridiculous when compared to the original in terms of realism.-Another hybrid, and the weaponosed dinosaurs subplot from JW reammerges which nobody really asked for.
There are gaping plot holes and flaws in the storytelling.Malcolm was marketed in this movie heavily, yet only has 2 minutes of screen timeSome of the protagonists make stupid decisions which severely damages the quality of the film as you care less about them.-the dinosaurs often behave in ways that are surreal.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Let me guess, the dinosaurs will escape in the end.""What was worse than this is the frustrating actions of the characters. I have never been in a situation where I am running for my life, but I tend to believe I would not be acting the way these fools do in the film. Examples:
Man in the opening scene standing there yelling ""I can't hear you"" while his comrades are frantically waving him down during a storm on an island full of dinosaursYoung geek character who stands staring at the dinosaur instead of climbing up the ladder to safety, until the last minute, of courseThe dinosaurs themselves, running for their lives from a volcano, seem to have the strong urge to fight and snack on the way. How is this even logical?? The adrenaline would suppress hunger so that even the instinct to hunt would be temporarily shut downThe bad guy at the end going into an elevator where people are hiding from the dinosaurs decides to push a woman out from hiding. What for?? She proceeds to scream and get the attention of the dinosaur, presumably killing them all. Where was the logic in that? He could have just hidden himself too.And don't get me started on the fact that the whole time, the main characters are trying to keep alive dinosaurs, which should have never been brought back. The little girl at the end releases them into the world. Do they alert the public? Do they even care? They've just unleashed these giants without any thought or concern for people, the environment, other existing species, etc. I left the movie so annoyed and maddened that whatever fun I would have had from the suspense and thrill was gone.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Logical inconsistencies, predictable actions, disappointing characters. I recommend to avoid it in wide arc.

Have to say though, I didn't go watch this movie expecting deep, philosophical, moving, thoughtful storytelling. I'll go watch Blade Runner or something if I was looking for that and from my understanding, critics loved that and so did I but it sort of didn't appeal to the masses because of the same reasons. I loved how the movie changed me into a kid again, especially connected with Maisy (don't know if that's how you spell her name) because she is surprisingly wonderful to watch. I usually struggle with the kids in the previous movies because the writers make them kind of irritating. But this movie, especially in the last scenes) puts a spin on it and makes her do something only a kid would do. There were some things that bothered me like the vet never having seen a real dinosaur before and the music was a bit overbearing in some of the later scenes at the manor. I had the feeling it would've been a little more grounded if they had made it a little quieter and just hearing the rain and the humans and dinosaurs moving around in the scenes sans the music. Just felt way too dramatic and snapped me out of the scene a few times. Other than that, I left the theater really happy. The ending was thoughtful actually and kind of daring. There is no putting a lid back on Pandora's box, so as Ian Malcolm says: ""Welcome to Jurassic World"" Humanity just got to deal with it I guess?

1426,msruss-33690,Legacy gone,1,17 March 2019,"Hardly ever review a film, but this film and it's predecessor are beyond a joke. I'd rather do just positive reviews and say nothing at all for films I dislike but the way this franchise has been handled is sickening. J-World was just about a 2 star from me but this film is even worse. None of the wonder or magic from the original 2 films exists in this franchise anymore. This could not feel less like a Speilberg movie and he set the example, he simply does not make films of this poor quality. I'm not clued up on what executive producer really means but how can Speilberg be happy with this (I'm guessing and hoping he's not and just has to ignore this trash like the rest of us with any sense of why this film is such a stain). I agree with the poster's comments about fake reviews; I know a worrying number of people thought this film was brilliant but you can also spot the fake reviews a mile off.I'm not criticising because of some nostalgic snobbery or bias towards the originals, I think the Star Wars franchise for example has been recovered reasonably well after the dodgy prequels, although I was not a big fan of Last Jedi. Force Awakens just about had the right balance of nostalgia and light humour and the actions scenes were well put together. Unfortunately These two recent Jurassic films have nowhere near achieved what the Force Awakens did. Watching these films now is like a cross between Fast & Furious and Transformers, all action and hollow albeit spectacular set-pieces, no soul or credibility. The exaggerated shots of a t-rex roaring just as the volcano erupts and the hybrid dinosaur on the roof perfectly positioned in-front of the moon are examples of the lack of subtlety portrayed.Cannot get behind or believe these characters or the ridiculous, but strangely predictable plot which may have worked in better hands but these reboots have been poorly executed. Irritating characters, far too many wise-crack lines you would get in your average US sitcom, it's a farce and unfortunately linking these films with the originals has simply pi***d over their legacy. Then there is the BD Wong character, his short appearance in the original is a far cry from the pantomime character of these reboots. Ian Malcolm's speech was the only half credible element of this film except for the stomach turning insertion of the title 'this is now Jurassic World' at the end. I'm not saying the original was not in any way a far-fetched plot but it was executed and acted in a way that made it believable, you understood the characters and the action scenes were so well put together and well backed up by a memorable score from Williams. The score for Fallen Kingdom is bland beyond belief except for the insulting and out of place insertion of extracts from the original score. The Lost World was a perfectly good sequel minus the San Diego scene and kept the series intact; it should have been left alone there after unless a seriously good script and the right director came along.Rant over, but wish the industry would stop tarnishing the legacy of such films. Peter Rabbit is another example of how not to produce a film associated with original cherished material; would Beatrix Potter or Crichton approve?",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Terrible writing makes the dialogue canned and generic, the ""jokes"" are ill timed and fall flat every time, and the plot is as predictable as it is dull.
Everything is predictable and overdone. Just like the original they're warned about what they're going to do, do it anyways, and suffer consequences. The run of the mill villains are all predictably killed by the new scary dinosaur or the old nostalgic dinosaur.

The thing with Jurrassic World Fallen Kingdom its a good thriller movie no doubt about that.You wont get bored but then its not Jurrassic ..no way . It simply misses the J factor (the awe and the sense of adventure that felt in the first 3 originals and even somewhat in Jurrasic World 1). I got no complaints if you focus on making money so much you forget that a decent script gives a movie a backbone, something to remember by.

Overall I enjoyed it more. The action was great, the claustrophobic feel of the mansion gave the movie something original and the scenes on the island were enough.The indoraptor, i thought was better than the indominous Rex just because of the look and creepy feel. CGI looks a lot better than last time, but the crowning achievement in effects, has to be the animatronics used. Overall it's not the best film ever made but go into it just wanting to have fun.

Chris Pratt is awesome as always. Bryce Dallas Howard is ok. The first half of the movie is really good, but then the film somehow loses its way. It doesn't really show anything we have not seen before. We have seen basically these type of things in Lost World. So its nothing new. The island exploding and Chris Pratt running is really awesome. The movie did have a lot of potential but they didn't really use it. They tried to make the second half, a horror film. Some scenes do scare you. But I feel they really aimed low in the second half. Nothing much happened. The supporting cast I don't really know why they are there. They don't add anything to the movie. Chris Pratt and Bryce are main characters. I did like the young girl. She was nice. But the other characters, supporting our main protagonists didn't really need to be there. They don't bring anything new to the table. I think Jurassic World was way better than this second installment. And definitely it is not even anywhere near Jurassic Park 1 and 2 as some other reviews proclaim.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1452,liamklotz,An Amateurs Review,5,3 July 2018,"Who signed off on this travesty of a remake? They must of pushed it through the pre-production process so quickly that the writers skipped the editing phase all together. Let us list the ways in which this movie became a terrible film. 1) The supporting cast is so generic (the tough, tatted veterinarian and the screaming nerd) and unnecessary that you completely forget they are in the film at all, until of course you hear the tell-tale scream of the aforementioned nerd and you are forced to remember. 
2) The villain makes ZERO sense. He has unlimited funds from his benefactor, with seemingly no downside. But he's greedy and wants to make more money when his life is already pretty amazing. Just kind of confusing. 
3) The cut scenes are weird as hell. An example would be when the heroine goes to recruit Chris Pratt, who she knows she needs to complete her mission. Cut to a scene of them grabbing beers where she is laughing hysterically, mocking him because he thinks that he was the one that broke their relationship off. I suppose it's an amateur film maneuver to get some backstory, but it doesn't seem to make any sense in the context of her trying to ask for his help. 
4) The new creation, ""Indoraptor,"" did not seem like a terrible guy. He ate a bunch of evil bad guys and then went for the heroes after they ran away (what happened to the whole part about showing no weakness, which literally never came back into the ending). It was like the director was giving us a red herring that the girl was going to connect with this new raptor by showing no fear. I kept expecting her to finally stop screaming long enough to stare it down and become its surrogate mother. Alas, no dice.
5) Finally, the ending was just stupid. ""They are alive, just like me."" So let me release a bunch of manic, extinct, killing machines into the wild to murder people who also happen to be alive, just like her. And c'mon there are like 30 dinosaurs out there, is the world really gonna end, is there no way to round them up like they did previously with a small crew.In the end, this movie was just a build up for the next film in the franchise where the dinos run amok in a post-apocalyptic world. They could've just started with that premise and made a far more interesting film. The only reason I gave this movie 5 out of 10 is because the dinosaurs, as always, steal the show and although they don't kill off ANY of the characters that deserved it for their piss poor acting, they were still cool as hell.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1453,japrile-95850,Not that bad,7,27 June 2018,Over all I was surprised since I had very low expectations for the movie. It was very suspenseful and funny at the same time. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. However the ending of the movie sucked. It made absolutely no sense as to why the dinosaurs would be let out into the public world. They should have take the part out about the gas explosion and left it as to what will have to the surviving dinosaurs and the scientist who created them. Overall it was not a bad movie at all. It was really good until the last ten minutes of the movie.,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1455,brianwhahappen,Preachy and Plot Problems,4,2 July 2018,"Save the Dinos, save the world. Well not quite. Dinosaurs are not pets and if you decide to let them roam free in your town because you think they should be free to live their lives over human safety then the Environmentalist wackos have brain washed you. Consider this: you have just been running from a ferocious bio-engineered eating machine at one moment and the next you decide to release dozens of likely as vicious creatures into a world to eat fido and fluffy and little Bobby and Susie. Such drivel. The last scene with Bryce Howard and Pratt driving their car away from the war zone made no sense. They look only mildly concerned at what they have wrought on the community just for the bleeding heart wishes of a little girl. Play the scene of a wailing Brontosaurus about to be consumed by a volcano as a added scene to the Holiday ASPCA ads for abused animals. Barf.No drama in the little girl being threatened by the Dinos as you know nothing bad would happen to her character. The bad bad corporations are again at fault but gosh darned if the Dinos don't eat the bad guys with little new scene plots.If evolution took out the Dinos, than so should the Volcano.

1456,hamzaamin-56353,Lays the foundation for something exciting,8,22 June 2018,"Comments:1. If you want to see dinosaurs, bad ones, good ones you'll see a lot of them. 
2. You'll also see a new version of bad guys who really are motivated by greed, are much darker and evil and the characters play their role pretty well. 
3. The CGI is great. 
4. The main dinosaur (Indoraptor) although short lived, but is very well executed and really gives a darker feel to the movie. 
5. The movie is filled with MORE TEETH, jump scares and less running and more killing. 
6. The good guys are MEH and are just there to play the part but in the end I found the greedy bad guys more interesting to the plot. 
7. The kid in this movie unlike the ones in the last film is useful to the plot and was the only character that has a connection with the good guys, the bad guys, the characters in the previous Jurassic Park movies and the dinosaurs at the same time and I really loved her performance. 
More about the movie:This film generally does the same thing during the first half i.e going to the island where dinosaurs live but this time the dinosaurs come to the people (permanently), so this is not like Jurassic World 3 where a T-Rex came to the city for 10 minutes and was sent home later. It tells us how evil people can deceive their loved ones for money, power and authority. And the best of all is that this film has provided us with a blank canvas to rewrite the story in a new way, where extinct animals possibly try to coexist with humans because this time there is no going back as we are left with dozens of dinosaurs including the T-Rex, Raptor and The Mosasaurus into the open world. So, in future hopefully we are not going to see the same plot where some good and some bad guys go to dinosaur world and later come back realizing they F'd up but instead a new version of real people and real bad guys trying to live with the new open-source dinosaurs and probably an experience we all can relate to if something like this happens in real life.
In the end I found the movie really interesting, not for what it is but for what it has provided us for the future. There were a few loopholes here and there but overall it was a film well executed with villains who can make you hate them and some characters you can't wait to see more and a story that connects the past with the present and expects a future.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

The girl was one of the characters I suspect to be a little Bland , but She was good playing her role. Chris Pratt still great from the last movie And Bryce Dallas , improved a bit but I think still she was okay like from the last movie.The dinosaurs were amazing as ever still and the Indoraptor, well... I think it needed a bit more screen time than it did, I loved the scene with her but I wanted a bit more of her in the movie. I think they used so much nostalgia in this movie and some ideas from The lost world like Eli mills(Rafe spall) who basically was the same villain from lost world and the time he died it was a almost exact scene, why did they not make him a bit more original.For one thing I believe this movie is better that Jurassic world but some stuff in that movie did do better stuff that's Jurassic world Fallen Kingdom.

1462,adam_kalad,Probably the worst movie in the franchise,6,27 July 2018,"The first part of the movie was great. Then it really started to get boring, as I noticed when the kids in the cinema started talking and simply not focusing on the movie. 
They talked way too much in this film imo. This is something they did not do in the four previous movies, where there was of course dialogues here and there, but in those movies they atleast still kept the interest up. Since the plot in this movie was very easy to get, it wasn't too interesting listening to their dialogues.
I like the fact that this movie was a bit dark, since that for an example gives us a picture of what situations many animals today have to go through because of humans.
The indoraptor was a very interesting idea, and it's the first time the main ""villain"" in the franchise was actually not a big carnivourus dinosaur, but rather a smaller, yet vicious carnivore. It was shown to be a very smart and aggressive dinosaurs, which suits the movie.
The indoraptor's death was kind of cheap in my opinion. Of course, Blue comes in and saves the day yet again, however he didn't really kill the indo, but rather let the enviroment do the work for him. I just didn't really like the indoraptor's death, since it felt more like an accident.
Also, dinosaurs like the t-rex and the mosasaurs didn't get much screentime, since this movie's focus was more on blue and the indoraptor. Why do they also never add new dinosaurs like the giganotosaurus, allosaurus or even the sarcosuchus?
As a fan of the series, who has waited three years for this movie, I'm a bit disappointed since I of course went in with high expectations.
It's still a good movie in it's own regards, but it wasn't nearly as good as the previous movies.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1473,akhileshms,Another successful addition to the dinosaur fantasy which treads the oft taken path for the narrative,7,15 June 2018,"Much like its predecessors, the theme of the movie is still the same. 'It's man's greed that he wants to control nature, but he ultimately fails miserably'. With the enormous budget at their disposal, the narrative could have been far superior, yet in the producers opinion, milking the already exhausted cow is a safe bet! This has to be the single most infuriating aspect of an otherwise wonderful movie. Contrary to the popular belief about that the narrative follows a dull plot-line without much excitement, Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom does have its highs and lows. The movie began with the most scariest entrance to the franchise, but gradually fizzed out as the movie progressed, however a few exceptions peppered in-between, gets the audience to jump up from their seats and makes great efforts to grasp hold of the audience's interest even when the movie deviates from its actual plot. All this added with the technological advancements ensuring that we are served with a wide spectrum of colourful dinosaurs, does make it a wonderful movie to reckon.
In the end, Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom, would definitely end up as a super hit, both commercially and critically with a better narrative, amazing performances by the complete cast and of course the actual Jurassic Kingdom. However, it might not end up as being the best Jurassic Park movie not just for the generation that grew up on dinosaur fantasy but even the generation that has been catered with a wide range of CGI movies.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

There are holes in the storyline bigger than the size of craters on the surface of moon. The characters could have died and reborn again in timeloop (Edge of Tomorrow) but they were always saved either by destiny or dinosaur or survived because the writer didn't know what to do next. There are two good things in the movie. Chris Pratt is a gem of an actor. He did his best despite knowing that the script was weak. And, few action sequences in the first 30 minutes of the movie are pure delight to watch. Yet, in today's time and date nothing less is expected. Music is average and Jeff Goldblum is not utilized to the max. There are few scenes that were copied from the first and second Jurassic Park franchisee and they make you nostalgic but the excitement ends right there. I can't imagine how a 75 year old man wouldn't find out that the dinosaurs are living under his mansion. Even if he couldn't, why is there only one helper in the entire mansion. And the entire bidding process on buying dinosaurs for war purpose is absolutely ridiculous. Not to mention the transportation of the 11 species from the volcano engulfed island and how no one found out that Chris Pratt and others were hiding in the truck overnight. I'm giving this movie 3/10 just because it has the name ""Jurassic"" in it.Save your money. Watch this movie when it comes out on Netflix. I wouldn't spend money on Jurassic World sequences until someone like Nolan or Abrams pick it up and make it exciting with their tight script and story telling.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Throughout the whole movie, i had question marks floating around me questioning me why i didn't just walk out, well the answer was Chris Pratt.Didn't understand why there was a protect the dinosaurs Org since they ate and killed a heap of humans during the first Movie (are they not afraid of being eaten??); Don't know what to say about the female lead, first using her past n guilt tripping Owen into the trip, got his life in danger, then later on, she chose to gave up on the dinosaurs lives because shes seen what they can do which she clearly didn't see in the first Movie,AND THEN!!THE DINOSAURS ARE COMING TO EAT HUMANS NOW!!

1481,ibisdoodle,Sort review 6 out of 10... Long review...,3,16 July 2018,"Coming out of the movie I had the distinct feeling of ""6"". This movie really seems like a 6/10 movie. Ya know the expression no one trains for second place... well this film feels like it was training for forth. The first Jurassic World was far from a GREAT movie but it was the best Jurassic movie we've had since the original and I saw a lot of potential moving forward. And Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom did the same thing The Lost World did, it dropped the ball and stared at it... except this time they are only half way up the hill. Their are a lot of things I like about the movie such as the use of flashing light to foreshadow a looming dangerous creature, the effects are slightly better, it was suspenseful (except in the third act where it fell into over used horror movie tropes), and the ideas of more dino experimentation was cool... that's about it. The way they tried to make the movie into a horror/action flick was really stupid, like if you're going to have this dinosaur- this killing machine chase this little girl or tool in this case, throughout the house just so you can have the dinosaur follow her into her bedroom to stick its claw out at her while she is under her covers is just pathetic. Great reuse of the last films ending Jurassic World I'm sure I won't notice. This film dropped the kids from the previous film for unlikable teen scream machines, say whatever you want about the kids in the previous movie but I at least cared about them and didn't find them irritating, the teens they used in this movie were just terrible from their ear piercing screaming to their terrible line delivery made watching them a choir. Let's recap in the last movie you had the I-Rex which is built up to be the killing machine of the T-Rex times 10 but it is defeated in 10 minutes by one T-Rex and a lonesome Raptor because they backed it close enough against the railings of a tank... fine. But you mean to tell me that when they do the same thing again but made sure to take all the best aspects of the two most legendary killers of world history that the I-raptor is killed by one singular velociraptor (who is infamous for being weaker alone than in groups/packs) and Chris Prat (who's character has become extremely disinteresting in this movie) because he was able to move away fast enough... I call bs. Is it the worst movie I've seen this year? NO, I've seen much worse. Is it a stupid summer blockbusters meant to be watch with your brain turned off and to sell toys? Yes, and as that... it does its job fine (p.s. If you thought they were going to let the dinosaurs die at the end of the movie you should have thought back to when the studio announced THREE Jurassic Park movie. Sit back because we still have one more film as of now. After the next one I'll be Jurassiced out for a while...)",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1492,blevy-53826,Just another let down.,2,8 September 2018,"So, this is my first review. This was so bad, I felt, I had to say something. I do not use big words like some of these people, my grammar and spelling will most likely be terrible and, I am guy easily entertained. My rating scale generally involves, guns, explosions, nudity, aliens, monsters, zombies, space or some sort of viral outbreak. Rarely if a movie doesn't have that, I am not a big fan of it. All of this being said, the, Jurassic franchise from it's conception has always had an appeal. Just the graphics/CGI alone brings me back to my childhood of LOVING dinosaurs. As a point of reference, I enjoyed the last movie and I understand after so many movies, that only so many plotlines can be used but honestly....It is the same plotline over and over again...the same mistakes, the same clueless people....I can't say much about the acting (I am a horrible judge) but just the plotline and the ""had to happen events just to carry the movie"" gets old. Sort of like those horror movies where the group of teenagers KNOWS a killer monster is in the house and they hear a strange sound in the basement and only one goes down there to ""investigate""....normally naked or half naked armed with a tennis ball....if that much. This was hands down the worse of the franchise. One obviously avoidable mistake after another.... If they make another one it should be something that is a century down the road and the dinosaurs have reproduced and it is an apocalyptic film where humans are fighting dinosaurs. Other than that....this can not go any further. Again this was a disappointment from the beginning to the end of the movie. The only reason, I gave this movie two stars was because of the dinosaurs. That's it. If they are going to make ANOTHER, Jurassic movie just fast forward. Whole new cast and bring in a completely different plot and for god's sake....wait a little bit. This is just as bad as what has happened to, Star Wars. Please...no more unless you are bringing something new to the table.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1493,freejoe-93623,"Its bad, terrible, awful, disgusting and a waste!",1,12 September 2018,"My God, not even interested in a sequel. This killed everything for me. I lost count of times i dozed off. Terrible plot holes that leave you wondering what's going on; one minute i am seeing a movie trying to pick up from the last one and in minutes i am seeing something else i can't quite connect to the franchise. I couldn't care if Pratt and everybody were eaten by the yellow thing whatever awful name they tried coming up with. And you know it's so funny how the big bad guys always get eaten up. They are always going to be in an elevator that an intelligent dinosaur can stop but will struggle eating three people held down by piece of wood - suddenly this aggressive animal can't push a log of wood out of the way? And 9 year old adults thought this was a fun movie. I like the dinosaur containment facility under the house- you know he couldn't get a place like some island far away for that- Classic! Then there is the blood transfusion thing, rain falling one minute - scene with dinosaurs running wild and everywhere dry like mid summer the next, how about having dinosaurs cohabiting with men for a sequel..I could be having a swell time on the beach and some supposedly extinct wild animal comes out from nowhere trying to eat me because a little girl had a conscience. Oh..and by the way she was cloned. It drives me crazy seeing how well people are taking this movie. The whole world has gone bunkers.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1494,bushmaster-79079,More Sharknado than Jurassic Park (*now with 53% new footage),4,21 September 2018,"Yes, I know it's optimistic to expect the fifth movie of any franchise to be anything more than switch-your-brain-off and gaze at the big explosions for 2 hours but my, has one of my favourite films lost it's way (and it's DNA).As ever the dinosaurs, the believability of their movement and how they interact seamlessly with the scenery, sets, and actors through a combination of CGI and puppetry is second to none.The rest (the story, the characters, the formulaic nature of each iteration) is just getting closer and closer to the precipice of ridiculousness, and as my title references, seems like the makers are more fond of apeing the stupidity of Sharkado (and other modern low-budget B-movies) than the comparative genius of the original JP.Which is ironic because, together with Jurassic World, these writers and directors can't seem to resist adding these godawful 'knowing winks' to previous moments of the series, with increasing frequency...""Hey! Did you see it? Yep we just did the close-up of the dilating pupil again! Remember that??""""Or hey, do you recall when the girl banged that ladle on the floor to distract the 'raptor from eating her brother? ... Yep that's in there too.""""Want to see a girl struggle to pull down a cupboard door she's hiding in again? You're in luck!""Christ. Just stop.
The recent Star Wars films are littered with them; Jurassic World itself was swarming with them - and this movie carries on that recent phenomenon in earnest. We're here to see ""new"" scenes, not shot-for-shot replicas like some internet fan remake.God know what Jurassic World IX or Star Wars XIII will be like ... some sort of ""30 Greatest Moments"" pastiche, stitched together from all the previous film into a 2 hour running time with little concern for plot or indeed continuity.A little reference back to an iconic scene or moment is quite a nice touch but for the last third of Fallen Kingdom, I think I'd given up taking any notice of the actual story and just sat counting the number of nods to previous Jurassic Park moments*. Doing it in every other scene is simply indulgent... or simply filler, demonstrative of the film maker's chronic lack of ideas of their own.*Fifteen I made it, for anyone who was interested.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1495,mrflibble_oz,"More of the same, but enjoyable nonetheless",7,22 September 2018,"I have seen the somewhat cynical review of this film, and the portrayal of the lead actors as struggling to relive their roles from the previous Jurassic World film.
I have to say that this was not my impression of the film, in the context of the previous films the plot was plausible and followed nicely on from the last film.
 Of course the plot is somewhat predicable, but that as been true of all the Jurassic films, why expect anything else?. While the first film was a roadshow for the latest in visual effects. this treats the dinosaurs as almost ordinary, in that there is no only a little 'awe' in their presence.
 No, I would advise if you enjoyed the past films you will get something out of this release. Its not ground breaking its not unexpected, but it is enjoyable.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1496,intcaol,Derek Flint made fun of this already,2,22 September 2018,"In addition to other ridiculousness which are many(insert your choice), this movie employed the 'main character is doing their best to thwart the bad guys activities' but either the bad guys are so inept they don't notice them hiding right next to them or are somehow so understaffed that no one is ever around to see the good guys upending their nefarious plans---'director' Bayona totally phoned it in--insulting",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

It doesn't have the same sense of wonder that the first film generated - although the writers do try to remind us of just how powerful those first moments were...What Fallen Kingdom does do, is give us the set piece encounters with danger that mark the series at its best. These have been part of the Jurassic Park/World story from the beginning - and they have not all been animal related. In the first Jurassic Park, the highest tension was created by a falling jeep, an electric fence and a threatening storm. In this movie, we have a volcano, a transparent pod and a gothic mansion - all used to great effect!The dinosaurs are definitely characters in their own right. Some of the most moving moments in the film are focused on the experiences and feelings of prehistoric animals. Their plight is as important as the risk they pose to the human cast - and the line between is sometimes very thin...Worth a watch if you enjoy some Jurassic thrills - but if you like prehistoric animals, you might be better off with a re-watch of Walking with Dinosaurs.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

The following movies have never been that good but the first Jurassic World had some good moments. This last one is probably the best one in terms of visual effects, Byona direction is neat and clear. It even has several easter eggs reminding us about the first movie but it has a huge problem: the plot. After a glorious setup that everybody will like, the hero journey gets confused, action timing is first too slow and in the end too quick. There is no tension, the enemy is known, the finale predictable. A devent movie, but not the masterpiece we were waiting for. The hope is all for the last one coming in 2021.

It should also drop the ""Jurassic"" word that shamelessly try to bait us with the movie magic conjured by the 1993 masterpiece but ended up needlessly bringing shame to the franchise.Movie couldn't be more formulaic. Plan to monetize dinosaurs gone wrong. Plant in a pre teen kid to l increase the stake cos we get numb at adults being chomp upon by dinosaurs. Body shots of amazing creatures bellowing for no apparent reason and demanding our shock and awe. They are probably saying, ""where is the Hollywood asteroid that is coming to wipe out our existence so that our good names can't be further sullied?""The thing I don't get is that one moment the movie demand u respect and fear these creatures, with another, the characters are cracking jokes with one another with the Dino snapping at their feet. Chris Pratt is more interested in looking suave and building his 14-17 teen girl fanbase than to act his part.In a sense I don't blame anyone but the money making motives of big Hollywood studios. There is just so little to work with dinosaurs. We can cross breed them, domesticate them and even gave them pet names. At some point you cross the boundary of being creative to being ludicrous.Overall, this is just another Transformer movie with more teeth and dinos who really really really love the taste of human flesh and will even stop for a bite will a volcano burning up behind them.p.s: is there actually a way to post spoilers in this movie?",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1517,ika_ika_ika,Mediocre at best,3,5 June 2018,"Really bad aftertaste. First thing you notice about this movie are giant plot holes supplemented by laughable (in a bad way) dialogues. 
Secondly you begin to wonder about strange volcano behavior and current obsession with lava. You would think that CGI had evolved enough since T2, but here lava mostly looks lame. Whole CGI department doesn't impress. I watched real3D version and it didn't help. 
Actions of characters are always questionable. Writers used up all of their imagination so that simple office chair becomes vital part of plot. There's no suspense, no nail biting moments. Actors were bullied into expressing exaggerated emotions without any foundation. Viewers are led to believe that giant dinosaur will use its nail to carefully and slowly open balcony door. 
Dinosaurs are... amazing. Surprisingly many of them are mechatronic. But whole dinos running for their lives along humans thing looks like showcase of different species. 
Strange transitions between locations and general mood make you cringe. Here our heroes run from volcano and next moment peacefully use binoculars to observe ships loading. Then well planned ship loading abruptly changes to hastily organized escape from island.
This list goes on and on. Tragically this film doesn't have any single joke. Public politely laughed in two or three moments but that's all. Don't waste two hours of your time. Go watch something else.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1521,peter_w82,"Great CGI, Terrible plot!",5,17 June 2018,"Like a lot of others are saying the first part of the film, where they are escaping from the island is great and quite exciting and sets the film up pretty well.However once the major action scene is over and they have to focus on the main story things start to go downhill. I think what bothers me the most is that a lot of the writing is just lazy and not well thought through or truely creative. Instead we get more of the same themes from the original JP films plus some more from JW. (Mutant dinosaur + evil corporate guys)All of the main characters stories are pretty unbelievable and there isn't enough investment in developing their individual personalities / backstory so we understand why they behave the way they do. Sometimes I feel like the major action scenes were thought up first and then the story was just sort of inserted between them as a glue so we have a way of getting from one action scene to the next.If you go and see this film you will probably enjoy it and it will most certainly entertain you for a while but after the moment has passed I am not left with the sense that I have seen something truely groundbreaking. Unfortunately I can't help but compare it to the original Jurassic park film and consider how it doesn't even come close to the terrifying moments of suspence and the brilliant portrayal of the different characters we got in JP1.Given that there are so many 9+ reviews on here maybe i am in the minority but I just feel like we are letting Hollywood get away with lazy writing, which contains numerous plot holes just so we can marvel at some cool CGI. We really should'nt be satisfied with this state of affairs. We should all be demanding better, more creative writing that continues to offer us something new and exciting. This will only happen if we stop rating these mediocre generic blockbuster films so highly. Was it was entertaining? yes without a doubt, but this is nowhere near a 9/10 film and you all know it. When rating these films please be honest with yourselves and send Hollywood a message. Don't let them think that lazy writing is ok.

1525,willcrook,"Surpasses the original, believe the hype",10,6 June 2018,"Before heading to the cinema after reading user reviews on here I was sceptical, could the 5th film in the JP series really improve on the original masterpiece which state of the art CGI, wonderful cast and excitement touched our hearts back in 1993?The dismal storyline and wooden acting of Chris Pratt in Jurassic World also didn't fill me with any prior confidence as Chris was to return as the prominent of Owen Grady, Velociraptor expert.I BOLSTERED myself in the cinema seats with an open mind.Any apprehensions about Pratts acting vanish from the first scene and by the time the credits roll I promise there will be no memories at all about Chris's mahogany acting in the first JP revival. He has redeemed himself with a bewitching performance here and is on the level of transformation reminiscent of Heath Ledger leaping from 10 Things I Hate About You to his epic premortem portrayal of the Joker in A Dark Knight.I will. not. spoil you with the plot of the new film but will affirm the opinions of others here at IMDB that it more than matches the thrilling awe of Steven Spielberg's first Dino adventure.I'm keeping this review purposefully short and devoid of specifics as the film has many unpredictable twists and turns which are much more thrilling when you aren't expecting them (we all remember watching the kitchen raptor scene in the first feeling paralyzed with fear)
 
Clear your mind of any expectations which have been formulated from the first 'World' film. This is the new metaphorical T-rex of the D'Saur kingdom.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1527,turtleboy95,A Highly Entertaining Addition to the Jurassic Franchise. I Don't Understand the Hate.,8,27 June 2018,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom was a thoroughly enjoyable, fun ride. The first half felt like classic Jurassic and the second half channeled Gothic horror elements. Bayona's direction is wonderful and the cinematography is stunning. The opening sequence in the rain is one of the best moments in the entire Jurassic franchise. All of the dinosaur scenes were fantastic and combined a great blend of animatronics and CGI. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was used just enough and it didn't feel like overkill. The Indoraptor was menacing and created a terrifying vibe in the mansion. Blue was a queen and stole the show every time she was on screen. Of course, the death of the Brachiosaurus completely tore my heart out of my chest; it was a fitting end to Isla Nublar and the imagery was brilliant callback to the original Jurassic Park. Owen's training video with the baby raptors was a wonderful creative choice; it gave depth to his relationship with the dinosaurs, especially Blue. The dynamic between Owen and Claire felt much more natural this time around and I very much enjoyed seeing them together on screen. The antagonist of the film is the ideology surrounding human greed. The ethical question raised regarding dinosaur lives was intriguing: humans made them, so should we save them? I can see both sides of the argument. These themes coupled with Ian Malcom's inclusion are absolutely setting up the real world implications of chaos theory and is a successful springboard for the middle chapter of a trilogy used to set up the final installment of the Jurassic World. I'm eager to see the conclusion!I've been rather surprised by much of the hate surrounding Fallen Kingdom. The entire Jurassic franchise was built on the premise of genetically modified dinosaurs that have always had a taste for human flesh and dues ex machina entrances; this in itself is reason enough to completely suspend disbelief when you're watching these films. There are plenty of moments in the original Jurassic Park that seem ridiculous if you take the time to step out of the film and analyze them:It was pretty convenient that Lex just happened to possess the necessary coding skills to operate the park's computer system, even under the added pressure of an impending raptor attack...It was pretty convenient how an enormous drop off suddenly appeared behind the fence on the once flat land of the dinosaur pen, allowing for Grant and the children to escape the T-Rex...It was pretty convenient how Nedry's hands didn't become numb after touching eggs frozen in liquid nitrogen without any sort of protection...It was pretty convenient when the Dilophosaurus jumped into Nedry's Jeep to set up a dramatic death scene instead of just attacking him after being blinded by the venom...It was pretty convenient how two clumsy children managed to escape the vicious raptors that killed Muldoon, a highly trained and proficient hunter who served as the park's game warden...It was pretty convenient when the T-Rex showed up at just the right moment to save everyone from the raptors during the film's finale...Further scenarios that could be discussed include Hammond's all electronic security locks within the park and Nedry's decisions surrounding his evil scheme. Every choice does not need to be supported by rationality; humans are imperfect creatures and will perform illogical actions during abnormal circumstances, both in reality and fiction. Few people will dispute the greatness of Jurassic Park, myself included. However, there are plenty of conveniences and flaws that are seemingly overlooked in the original film, possibly due to nostalgia. If you didn't enjoy Fallen Kingdom, that's fine. All art is subjective. I simply find it odd that the film is getting chastised for reasons that have been present in the Jurassic universe since the beginning. Overall I highly recommend Fallen Kingdom if you're a fan of the Jurassic franchise and enjoy action/adventure films.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1532,slewi027,Originality is extinct..,3,8 July 2018,"All three stars are based on the visuals of this film because that's all it has going for it. There is absolutely zero originality in the plot and it's quite bad to begin with. At times, the ""callbacks"" to iconic scenes of past JP films feel like reshoots and are so forced and deliberate that any viewer that recognizes them feels unrewarded. The scene in which the Indoraptor is looking for the characters in the museum area has so many elements of the ""kitchen"" scene that it feels like Trevarrow is yelling ""hey remember this?"" Right down to the claw tapping of the Raptor/Indoraptor.This same feeling comes as JP tricks are repeatedly used and literally reshot as JW tricks. The laundry lift acting as the stainless steel cabinet for Lex. The tapping of the gun reminiscent of the ladle. The almost exact shot of all of the characters watching from a rock cliff as ""evil corporation"" rounds up dinosaurs for a secret nefarious purpose. These kinds of callbacks should be rewarding for a movie goer to recognize and tell others about as they leave the theatre. Instead they are force fed to the point that the film seems like a mashup of old ideas.I was never a fan of the ""designer dinosaurs"" idea and wish they had simply stuck with known species. Do they not have enough to chose from over millions of years of dinosaurs inhabitance? Is a war T-Rex not enough of a weapon that they have to breed and modify it? The draw of this movie when we were kids were the dinostars (trademark?) because we had learned about and loved them from our natural history books. Now they just start making dinosaurs that we don't recognize or know. The sense of awe when your favorite childhood creature jumped off the page and into existence is gone.The acting from our heroes is serviceable. Nothing more, nothing less. The villains are absolutely abysmal and shallow. B. D. Wong creates some depth in his few moments of screen time andmanages to convey Wu as an accidental villain that is at odds with the ramifications of his advances but values those advancements more than their implications. The embodiment of ""your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they never stopped to think if they should.""I feel like the scene in JW1 where Howard is explaining that they needed something new to please guests that are no longer thrilled with dinosaurs is the exact conversation had at the writers table for JW2. I loved JP, I love Chris Pratt, I TRIED to love JW but I just can't. It's big, it's loud and the CGI is great. It's a summer movie and if that's all you want out of the experience than enjoy but if your looking for deeper or thoughtful movie, this is not for you.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1536,chris_murphy13,$10m for a dinosaur???,1,10 June 2018,"I'm a huge Jurassic Park fan but this movie is just not very good. It made no sense at all. Awful writing and acting with plot holes everywhere. In a world where top athletes are being transferred for over $100m, you'd think a dinosaur was a little more expensive than $10m?! But no, Mills' (Rafe Spall) eyes light up at the sight of selling a dinosaur for $10m. What's more, the total cost of all dinosaurs only totals at around $120m. That's less than the production of the movie! I'd love to see the overheads of the organisation for sending 100+ men in armoured vehicles with state of the art equipment to a dinosaur inhabited island in Costa Rica. They can't be looking at very high profit margins. Why not just sell the giant mansion with the secret underground lab and save all the hassle??

Action right off the bat and throughout. 
Oh never say ""I made it"" in the movies, most of the time it ends badly, this time as fish food, a really BIG fish.
Going back to the island was sentimental and nice. Nice to see how Jurassic World fared since the last movie and the fallout and abandonment of the Park.
Seeing some of the rides and things such as an abandoned monorail still on the track.
Volcano blows and everything runs to the water. I felt bad for the Dinosaurs since most seemed to sink. I hated seeing any of that.
Ship travels to Northern Cali and the Dinosaurs are being auctioned off. Well at the start. You feel for the Dinosaurs and cheer as the enjoy eating the greedy people at the auction.
The chase through the big house was awesome and scary. 
When the Dinosaurs were potentially being gassed to death due to an accident some young child in the audience yelled ""hit the button "" which would free the Dinosaurs into the World. Everyone seemed to chuckle because we were ALL cheering on the Dinosaurs at that point.
A glimpse of the World w Dinosaurs was pretty cool.

While movie begins without any serious issues, in the middle it becomes boring and the end is extremely idiotic, I will avoid to mention anything specific, but I guess after couple of weeks this franchise will leave its fans feel disappointed, just like it did to me.

Same again when I heard they were making another one. However, I had a different reaction when I saw this film. For lack of a better word this film made me feel heart broken and devestated. You have taken one of my favourite childhood film and destroyed it (literally). I don't understand what is entertaining about blowing up the island and half the dinosaurs with it. I burst into tear when I watched the scene of the island burning and the dinosaurs along with it. It was like you were destroying everything from the past movies so you can start fresh. I find this film insulting and cruel to the people who have love these stories for decades and you have destroyed story I loved so much. So thank you for that.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

The cgi is about a million times better than the story and acting, for which I give 4 stars. The rest is just not worth it.
There are terrible oneliners, a geek that doesn't like nature and is afraid, a nerdy girl that is beautiful but dresses like a nerd, the evil people have absolutely no depth or any basic brain functionality. As if auctioning rare dinosaurs will give you more money than just fundraising for research while also just asking for prepayment or investments to anyone wanting a killer dino.

It's hard to feel sorry for the Dinosaurs. Claire got emotional a few times about wanting to save them, which I found vomit inducing, It would've been safer for everyone to let them go extinct again. A few scenes were borrowed from previous Jurassic Park movies. This film pales in comparison to Jurassic Park 1 & 2. They should really stop making these now. Most of the main characters were just annoying. I did read some reviews on here before I watched the film. I thought 'How bad can it be'? I watched the film & realised the reviews were correct. Nothing felt original. Jurassic World was at least watchable but I kept having to force myself not to turn this one off.

On par with JW, but people saying it doesn't live up to the original JP ???? It never will JP was fresh and new and we hadn't seen dinosaurs on the big screen at the point!

If your a snobby ""purist"" who cannot except that the franchise isn't going to make the same original JP film, then don't go see it. I'm going to now backhand all of these poor reviews.1. The film touches on modern extinction. You get to watch an island burn and dinosaurs frantically panic as they burn, which was actually VERY hard to watch.2. There is a key character in this film, which I guaranty you will see again down the road. This character is a relation to an original creator of the park, and was also born in a science lab. I guaranty you that character was put in the film to lay future ground work.3. The film is visually stunning! You go from deep in the ocean, to the island, the island engulfed in flames and burning, to a beautiful multi million dollar gothic mansion with an indoor dinosaur museum. 4. The story made sense. The story touched on corruption, faulty technology and communication, one scene lead right into another, and you weren't left with any questions IF YOU PAID ATTENTION! The story was good, but not the best for a CGI dinosaur movie, still, it held up! You can be a snob and tear it apart if you want (it's your day, not mine) but I feel you are doing yourself a disservice to other potential JP films if you cannot accept all of the real entertainment value or if you don't allow yourself to see how they are leading into new stories from key elements of this specific installment into the JP franchise.Enjoy!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Introducing Dino's into the California eco system would be so detrimental to all of it's natural habitants, but we're just supposed to accept that saving the Dino's is the obvious solution?? Come on. Also, the girl is a human clone and there is no discussion on the morality of this?! She saves the Dino's because ""they're like me"", yet we haven't even had the discussion of whether or not we should support the way she came to be. Beyond all of this political statement Hodge podge that completely swings and misses, the plot is over the top with characters that were made to be MORE sinister, or MORE heroic, or MORE sympathetic, and as a result there are no relatable or truly HUMAN characters in the story.

Predictable and boring plot, characters who make absolutely the dumbest decisions, which for some reason work due to deus ex machina, villains straight out of the old comicbooks, and on top of that - a mediocre at best action. It honestly failed to even be what I supposed it would be - a dumb but entertaining dinosaur movie.

Got goosebumps throughout the entire movie...Also the most terrifying movie of the franchise as there's barely any censor to the most gore-filled sequences.As the author of the recent graphic novel series ""Congo - A Forgotten World"" this masterpiece sure inspired me, go give it a watch while it's in the cinema if you happen to live in Europe. If you're in the US wait for the movie to come out because it's not worth of watching in low resolution just for the sake of your impatience. Be patient.

Good: Safari dino-capture while fighting Marlboro men bad guys - but only for 30 minutes.
Bad: Bringing T-rex back to the mainland for suburban chaos and scary kiddo scenes - the rest of the movie.It feels like Fallen Kingdom's entire plot was written to land one scene - the little girl in her bedroom.

 It was fun and yes, a little predictable, but most movies are. I don't go to be surprised, it is fun to watch!

1635,JW_Fan_1,"Great movie, but not my favorite in the Jurassic Series",10,15 September 2018,"I loved the beginning of this movie - but I'm not a fan of the horror kind of feeling the movie has as it progresses. I liked the original Jurassic World much better because it had action, didn't fail to add a little comedy to it, and it just had an awesome feeling overall, I can't explain how I felt when I watched that movie but it was just such a cool feeling that transports you to another world with dinosaurs. Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom was kind of different, the dark scenes in the house, more horror like violence than the first one, I just didn't like it. I am a HUGE fan of JW, my room literally has a ton of JW fan posters and figurines all over, I love it so much, but I don't like horror movies.Edit: After watching it a couple more times since it has come out on DVD, I've grown to like it much more. Still not a fan of a few of a really violent scene in the movie where a dino gets revenge on a bad character (not going to go in depth on which scene so I don't include spoilers).

I felt it was better than the first Jurassic World due to it being darker, and full of paranoia. The villains were nasty, the violence was plentiful, and great character development. The soundtrack brought me back to the first film with glee.. I thought it was good that they included older franchise characters with the newer ones in the film. It bridged the past and reasons why certain things happened when they set up the first park. The kid was a great young actress and was believably petrified haha. She needed a hug badly after the trauma she endured. Plot was well explained and it moved the setting well off the island for a good reason. As I watched the emotional scenes. people around me were crying at some shocking scenes.. It got a lot of people choked up and made you think.. It included a few references that if you read the novels by Michael Crichton, you would catch. I really enjoyed that. Mainly focusing on InGen and cloning. The opening of the film had me jump back, and pretend to buckle myself up for a bumpy ride! My brother looked at me and shouted, ""Hold onto your b&tts!!!!""

Killing the brontosaurus was a gratuitous heart wrenching scene - not for kids.

Even though it's a film about dinosaurs even this film felt non believable which has lessened my love for the franchise.

It was just like the first movie where I can honestly say I felt that familiar ""chill"" of seeing a t-rex in the dark and rain silently stalking somebody. Those thrills are what made JP1 so good. I'm a little tired now of seeing a T. rex attacking another dinosaur, or a raptor coming to the rescue from a genetically engineered hybrid dinosaur. This series is missing the whole point I feel. Small hope for the next film now with the dino's out in the open - any decent writer worth his salt could conjure up something terrifying but the raptors aren't in the picture anymore.

1662,megncarl,Not a jurassic park movie at all!,1,24 June 2018,There are more things wrong with this movie than right! It's just a dinosaur movie and has nothing to do with the jurassic park franchise whatsoever. The plot has so many holes in it and makes no sense in most of the dialog. The worst part was when the viewer watches in horror as the dinosaurs that didn't make it on the boat die!!!! You watch them die! This is not necessary at all! There were very few parts of this ridiculous movie that were tolerable but for those jurassic park fans that have loved this franchise from the beginning see this movie as ridiculous and far fetched. Adding in the fact heat Hammond never had a partner not even in the books and then to have this clone girl in the twist is far from what this movie should have been. I will never watch this garbage again and don't consider it part of the jurassic park chain at all. All involved in the movie should be ashamed. The fact that they let a brand new director who didn't know what he was doing direct this film tells me they knew the script was Crandon the get go or else they would've had a seasoned director who knew what he was doing! This is just a dinosaur movie and nothing more. So very disappointing to say the least.,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

They bring out the hybrid dino as a special treat for all the people in attendance but there is no backstory as to how Wong created the hybrid species, it just skips ahead to what looks like a Russian man biding $25 million for the hybrid.As for the characters, Chris Pratt basically plays the role of lifeguard at the swimming pool in the movie, rescuing the little girl from her troubles.

1668,augcraftgaming,Flawed but not as bad as people say,8,13 September 2018,"I like to dissect movies to determine my true thoughts on it, and this movie is no different. But while picking apart this movie i just always couldn't help but think that a lot of the bashing this movie gets it extremely unwarranted. Yes there are flaws with the movie and I won't deny that. The biggest criticism I think I've seen is that 1: It's boring and doesn't have enough dinosaur action, and 2: It is too different from the original. The first criticism i find somewhat understandable, but then again this movie is a lot more story driven than it is action packed. There are balances between the two in most of the other Jurassic movies but this time around it decided to sacrifice one for the other. And whether you like or hate the story is completely subjective, but the bottom line is that it is trying to be a more story driven movie. The second criticism is actually kind of correct it is very different from the original jurassic park. Yes it's different from the original movie, but it's a lot similar to the BOOK that this series is based off of. This movie is making the franchise evolve in a way Michael Crichton planned for it to all the way in his first book which keep in mind was three years before the original movie. Does this movie have flaws? yeah. The way the indoraptor escaped was dumb, and in my personal opinion all the parts on the island are incredibly mediocre. But i think the rest of this movie is fantastic... Okay i'm prepared for the hate",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1669,chan-79434,"Captured, taken to a mansion, auctioned off and then allowed to escape just like that on our turf",2,13 June 2018,"I honestly don't know where to begin. More dinosaur action in the intro than in the rest of the film. Beginning of the film started out okay, had a logical story line set, then as it unfolded, everything slowly started to get worse. I've always been a huge Jurassic Park fan, have loved the majority of the movies until this one (and also that cringeworthy ending from the last one that will never leave me). The volcano idea I thought was quite good, but enough action in it which let it down slightly at that point, then they decided to take the story down the route of ""capturing the animals, keeping them in someone's basement in their mansion, not only to auction off?! But to auction off for only millions?! The dinosaurs supposedly being rare and hard to come by in this film but we'll auction them off for a million. Try a billion. They then introduce a new species they created, with no plot to it at all, which let it down completely. And eventually when there's some kind of chemical/gas leak, that threatens killing the dinosaurs stored in the basement and a button to press to allow them their freedom into our world, they hesitate initially but then the button gets pressed allowing them to roam freely into our world. If the writers were trying to find a way to introduce a storyline that could link them coming from the island onto our turf, just hire a four year old to write a better script. And supposedly they're making a trilogy, recipe for disaster if it's anything like this one!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1671,LacerdanGabriel,My vison of Jurassic Park: Fallen Kingdom,7,24 April 2019,"Jurassic World: Threatened Kingdom is the second film of the new Jurassic Park trilogy. It continues the universe of films begun in the 1990s with the first Jurassic Park, directed by Steven Spielberg, which has marked the history of cinema forever with its technologies developed to be produced.
As well as the first film of this new trilogy, Jurassic World of 2015, the new film rescues the nostalgic feeling of the classics. In a way, we are moving to the same narrative already seen before, but in an updated way for the new generations. But in the background following the same mechanics of the second film in the original trilogy, where the dinosaurs end up
civilization, outside the island where they were confined and thus causing the development of history. Although this time this happens in a new way and in keeping with the current society.
The play is clearly a popcorn movie that will age, but without losing the magic of having fun if viewed unpretentiously. It makes us feel the most diverse emotions, such as distress when seeing the dinosaurs fleeing, pity to see them dying to the point of causing crying, happiness in developing the adventure that at no time loses rhythm, always keeps the viewer entertained. And no
final leaves a wonderful ""taste of want more"", when it shows us what is to come in the wrapping of this new trilogy, also making us understand the title that was in our face from 2015.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

The movie is EXCELLENT when it comes to Business perspective. Congratulations to JA Beyona! However the story even if it is very interesting, it's 50/50 between the people who LOVED it and the people who HATED it. I belong to the first category but I respect a majority of people who hated it because they have sensible proofs to why they disliked the movie. The writters of the movie take a very CRITICAL move to lead the future of the franchise wich will influence the way people see the dinosaurs. I personaly have no problem with that because I knew and I'm pretty sure you also knew that the franchise had to take a different route to continiou the story because the old classic island theme, as well as the park theme is now same old same old, and that is a major reason why I loved this movie. In other words, a majority of dislikes is clearly each one's opinion on whether or not they like the new route the story has take. I personaly like how the story is progressing to a new level and I can't wait to see what follows in Jurassic World 3.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1703,harleymeaney,"Very maternal, Mr. Bayona",7,16 March 2019,"J. A. Bayona has a knack for creating lore regarding a specific theme: mother. The underlying theme for most of his projects typically revolves around the idea of a mother-to-child relationship. Precedent (previous projects): ""El Orfanato,"" ""The Impossible,"" ""A Monster Calls.""This latest installment of the Dino series isn't without the same essence. The newest breed of dinosaur (a.k.a. the antagonist) is said to be in need of a mother. This might explain said villain's thirst for blood via intelligent craftiness.The movie is not without its gaping flaws, but Mr. Bayona certainly deserves a bit of credit. It's hard enough to make yet another movie about dinosaurs in this arena, but at least he added his own touch, again. Overall, it delivers as another decent summer popcorn flick.

I've already forgotten a large amount of the first one and I've a feeling that, within a couple of years, that will be the case with this one too.I really like the main stars of the film but feel they all coasted through with their monotonous characters. This is partly down to the script where humour is almost nonexistent. The story is ok. Not sure why, after the mystery with the daughter and the 'dramatic' reveal, there was no follow up.

When you see that the movie is only « produced » by Steven Spielberg you know something will be off. I liked the first Jurassic world even if it was a little cheesy but this one is just ridiculous.
The plot could have been written by a 5 year old, everything is predictable and some plot elements are just thrown in there for no reason.
I thought the special effects were pretty good and the action scenes fun to watch even if ridiculous.

But first she has to convince her exboyfriend Ian Malcolm... I mean Owen to join her by going to the island with or without him. I know that doesn't make sense, but don't worry neither does the rest of the movie.so who is funding their little venture? Mr. Lock, Hammond's plot device partner who was there the whole time you just didn't notice because he was never mentioned before. He also looks just like Hammond and even has Hammond's iconic mosquito-amber cane. He's also the plot device that fulfills this movie's child endangerment quota. After all, it's not Jurassic Park if a little child isn't in danger of being eaten. Don't worry her special skill will come in handy later.So who is the villain? Basically next gen versions if the same guys from The Lost World except they are less competent, but somehow manage to accomplish way more.Now let's talk about plot armor. It's pretty common to see main characters with at least some plot armor, but, man, the plot armor is thick in this one. Even Blue the raptor gets ridiculously thick plot armor.What about Goldblum?

The story was weak, the acting was ugly, but you know you can make it back with good CGI... NO you can't! The CGI was not even great it was Ok. Not amazing just ok. Like the plot holes were stupid. Why did they have the little girl look at a picture of the housekeeper lady? Is she her real mom? If she is a clone of Lockwood's daughter, than what happened to her? These are not dinosaur movie questions. I should be asking, why did this movie suck so badly? What the heck is up with rick people auctioning on dinosaurs. For what? To have as a pet. But why did the guy want money didn't he have Lockwood's whole fortune? So he was like "" I have Dinosaurs, lots of money, omg omg I have an idea I will sell the dinosaurs for money!"" The only redeeming part is this movie is Chris Pratt. I'm biased of him because he is a good actor and he redeems the movie for being that cool guy why kicks the crap out of people and dinosaurs.

But i was positively surprised by this newest release of the series.Whereas the first reboot just tried to copy the original movie with a theme park idea and brought not much new into the series and was very boring overall, the second reboot makes alot different. For once the setting is different and not again on a secluded island. It is also alot more exciting with more suspense than the first movie. Also I liked the ending...I would give it 8-9 out of 10.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

I like the fact that the sequels follow the story of the old trilogy but they also follow the future,a new era of technology,medical and genetic revolution.

1724,b-12455,Just some comments from a not knowledgeable fan of the series,7,25 June 2018,"Well, the movie contains myriad flaws without doubt. I'm sort of neutral among so many critical comments, some claim that it's just a Dino film, let's just enjoy CGI and immerse in our memories in earlier episodes; some say it's the worst movie in all five films, too much CGI, plot is nonsense, doesn't reflect actors and actress's talent, adds taint to the series. Some flaws I noticed: 1 people didn't learn Shxt even though messing with dinosaurs always ended up with huge messes. 2 what kind of rich people trust to giv all the rights to control money and to just walkaround the house to a man with no blood relationship? 3 what kind of extremely wealthy people hav no security guards walking all over his/her place, the old boss seems to depend everything on the young guy, who ultimately screwed up everything. 4 how can Blue still trusts Owen after three years? Highly unlikely, even more when Blue still trusts Owen after Blue was ambushed in the forest. How can Blue tell if Owens on the side of mercenaries or not? 5 Blue solo with indoraptor, slight odds but still... 6what kind of imbecile is a mercenaries' leader and dare to walk in the a raptors cage while it seems to be tranquilized.... 7 the designs of elevator, gate, are just anti-homo sapien 8 time seems to be too precisely controlled by the protagonists... In a nutshell, I chose to watch it be cuz I feel like I hav too, no matter how bad is the ranking (not below5 I'll watch...), a Dino movie is sth many feel obliged to watch as a movie fan of any sorts. I understand many expect a bit or a lot more, but I don't think it's a bad movie. The plot at least is not too stupid, more like a teenage' fantasy... and it's quiet interesting to look back and find so many flaws.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1726,robjaques-74156,Most annoying character since Jar Jar Binx?,1,13 June 2018,"I don't even know where to start... I suppose Chris Pratt was ok. That's where the positivity ends. Some quality actors (Tony Jones for example) were given an awful script and the best most could do was scream for 2 hours. Franklin might be the most annoying character since the equally disappointing Phantom Menace. Mind you, if all you're given is a hollow character whose part is necessary as a convenient way to open doors then what can you expect? Then there's the score. It is incessant. Maybe it was an attempt to make the film seem more exciting since the storyline and script certainly weren't going to achieve that. Unfortunately, it didn't work since this was also poor. But Jeff Goldblum was in it and he's good right? Yes. Yes he is. He wasn't really in the film however as he was kept apart from the main storyline and reduced to moral commentary on why we defo can't live with dinasaurs. On occasions this narrative reminded me of his voice work in the Call of Duty franchise, but only when the script lives up to the same standards. If my girlfriend hadn't wanted to see this film, I'm not sure I would have gone to see it in the first place. I like Jurassic Park films but not enough to pay £12. What I am sure about is that if I hadn't been with my girlfriend, I would've made this only the third film I walked out of.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

The movie itself seems to be made for fans and those who have been so since part one, the little bits and pieces say it so. I loved the soundtrack, the imagery, the action, the science, it was all quite good. Could it have been better given the earnings of the previous chapter? possibly, yes. But I also think they have to store funding and invest for the next chapter, it is all an investment in Hollywood, as these things cost money. I loved alien covenant because I was a fan of Prometheus, and that was badly received, but i am pleased, the fans are pleased with these films being created for us.

1741,ashleykelly-59367,Ignore all the bad reviews this is a great movie,9,12 June 2018,"I have never wrote a review before for a movie so this is my first. I first read a good amount of reviews before going to see this. I was a little hesitant as people were saying it's bad. Ignore that. This start of this movie will rival Jurassic Park. The feeling you felt when the raptor grabbed the worker and pulled him into the cage that made you excited because you knew this would be a great movie the suspense you never seen the raptor, it just showed you have dangerous it was. Jurassic world fallen kingdom opening is that but 10 fold. It starts as workers are going back to the park but only in the water looking for the indomius Rex bones that's not giving much away. It then cuts to a guy on the land working on the gates so they can close the water doors once the water team are out. You see a shadow of the mossisaur go overhead then the lights on the water craft go dim and the mossisaur comes up behind the camera cuts to above the water and the lights go out in the water. A helicopter lands and is shouting at the guy working on the gates he turns around and there is a t Rex looking at him in the rain. This is when your heart starts to pump and you start getting exitced that the guy might not make it. He starts to run towards the helicopter as it takes off and drops a rope of steps. The guy is running as fast as possible T. rex chasing behind he jumps from the land to grab the rope in the water and you feel a phew, next the T. rex has grabbed the rope and not letting go. I will stop there as this is where I began to smile. The whole movie was fantasic. There was maybe a few scenes that could of been cut down more diaolouge that anything but overall a great sequel. In a world of remakes and sequels this is by far one of the best up there. The ending makes for cliff hanger until the next and last one comes out. This truely is a Jurassic world. The indorapter could of had abit more to do In this as the indomius had way more screen time in the first world movie. It sorta feels this went abit short with that. Great dinosaur deadly and smart but it was outsmarted by blue. Would love to see more T. rex or bigger since there is only the one rex left the OG from Jurassic Park. Would be good to see ingen massively produce dinosaurs to a ridiculous scale. I'm sure if your reading this you will wonder what I am going on about. I am only 25 and love movies. I didn't like seeing that this was being pooped on so much so decided to write my own review. I have been a fan of all these movies third one least of all but they all have great things about them. The spinosaur would be a great Dino to have next again. Even a spliced one with a raptor and allosaurus. I just know I will go see this 3 to 5 more times while it's on the cinema. Will be trying the 3D version to see what that is like.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

The reason why I have such a good review is because they put lots of jumps and frights in at all the right moments. The only thing i have against it is they didn't put enough Chris Pratt in there. He was going strong in the first half then he just was in the background the rest of the movie.
Overall 9/10",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1745,jonasbalck,Ignore the hate and watch the movie.,10,11 July 2018,"ALRIGHT. I've seen a lot of different reviews, some rating high, some rating low. And the way I see it, those who gave it a bad rating either didn't understand the plot or the metaphor/moral of the movie, or is just complaining because they didn't get to be nostalgic about the old movies. In my perspective you can't rate a movie by comparing it to an older movie - this movie is nothing like the old JP's, but is that equal to the movie being bad? No.I liked everything in this movie. The acting, the characters, the CGI and the plot. It's both emotional, horrific and exiting - full of action and great scenes. I would advise the people who didn't like the movie to watch it an extra time - but this time consider what Dr. Malcolm(goldblum) actually was saying - and compare it to the real world. I can relate to each and every word of his, and the moral of what he's trying to tell is both tragic but very eye opening. So please, ignore the bad reviews and go watch the movie without speculating to much about it being exacly like the old movies. Enjoy the movie as it is, and appreciate the art of this fantastic movie. And for those wondering - no, I do not hate the old movies, in fact those are some of my favorite movies of all time.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1749,zacharywhittier,3/10,3,6 October 2018,"This was the equivalent of a high school student copying someone's homework and changing it just enough that the teacher won't notice. Instead, they copied they're own homework from a few years ago. 
 The plot was almost identical to the first movie, with predicable villains and an even more predictable plot. I watched the first half hour of this movie and already knew how it was going to end. The ""new"" super dinosaur was not nearly as imposing as they planned for it to be. 
 The more serious and emotional moments were undercut by action or bad jokes. Speaking of jokes, there were barely a handful that made me laugh.
 The only redeemable character in the movie was Owen. Everyone else was pretty consistently wrong, except the sidekicks who were just kind of there. They never contributed anything to the story. No one had a character arc except the villain, whose arc went from being alive to not alive.
 The big ""twist"" of the movie, that a little girl they never really established, was a clone of her mother, while slightly surprising, didn't matter since we hadn't really been given time to invest in the character properly. The movie seemed to know that, since they glossed over it and never came back to it until she felt bad and let the dinosaurs out after the adults agreed not to.
 Also, (this might be biased since I'm not a big fan of child actors) her accent kept slipping through during her ""emotional"" scenes. I know they have a schedule to keep, but they probably should have reshot those scenes.
 Another problem I had was how they decided to edit like a first year film student. The cuts would be slightly before or after something happened which caused a nice jarring of the timing. This happened in a few action scenes also, where they cut back to right before the action and let you see it happen from three different angles. Unless I went to the wrong couch in my house and was watching MIB 3, that editing style didn't make a lot of sense.
 All in all, it was an okay action film to not watch while I have a girl over, but other than that... Ehh?",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

 All I wanted from this movie is some people run around an island from some cool big lizards. All I've got was a poor man's indo predator in a mansion.
Did they really ran out of real cool dinosaurs, so they needed to create their own? Million years of big lizards and you need to come up with this?
On other hand I got my running people, I got all of the running people you can wish for. If you make a super cut of the decision making in this movie you will get an A list comedy, and maybe then all the time spend on making this movie wouldn't be a compleat waste.

I would have left the theater if I hadn't gone with a group of friends. I suppose this is spoiler-y now, but anyway, Chris Pratt and crew are trying to escape from the antagonist's base, and they come across the antagonist who tells them that the little girl who's been with them for the whole act is actually A CLONE (dun dun duuuun), as if that's supposed to make Chris Pratt go ""eewww, clone cooties, get away from me you inhuman scum"" and punt this scared little girl or something. Anyway, they run through the mansion, the big bad dino is trying to kill them, and they come to the control room. They find out that there's a gas leak and all the dinosaurs are going to die if they stay in the building. What's-her-face from the first movie is about to let them out, but at the last minute, can't, cause, you know, that would be letting 2-odd dozen dinosaurs loose in california. But then suddenly, the dinosaurs are freed, and you see that the little clone girl let them out, and she says the most idiotic, unearned line: ""they're alive, like I'm alive"" as if she feels some kinship with the death machines because she's know that she's a clone for all of half an hour. Maybe Chris Pratt should have punted her then, I don't know. But regardless, that's when I started swearing at the screen. So the dinosaurs get out, and they're loose, oooooh noooo. The ending is set to Jeff Goldblum (remember? he's in this movie, too) saying shit like ""the dinosaurs are among us now. We will have to adapt to threats. This isn't just a park now, this is Jurassic World."" And that's when I killed him, your honor. They treat it like this is some massive, culturally cataclysmic change, and not an inconveniencing weekend for the Army National Guard. We already know that dinosaurs are weak against bullets. HELL, AN ENTIRE SUBPLOT REVOLVED AROUND THE FACT THAT THEY HAD TO SAVE A DINOSAUR'S LIFE BECAUSE IT WAS SHOT WITH A SINGLE BULLET FROM A HANDGUN. Which makes the rest of the evil plot pointless. They wanted to breed dinosaurs for military use, but we've already established that in bullets vs dinosaur, bullets will win most of the time. Also, dinosaurs are a huge liability and require resources and special care, and... AND when they reveal the special new raptor, they're all like ""it can be controlled by human commands. See? Just point this gun-looking thing at your target, make sure that the laser sight is on the target, and then pull this trigger, and the dinosaur will go try to kill the target. MOTHERFUCKER THAT'S A GUN WITH EXTRA STEPS.I'm going on for too long, so I guess I'll stop here. The movie was shit, and not so shit it loops around and becomes entertaining again.

The movie's plot was simple. A team goes in to rescue the dinosaurs from the island. However, there were a few problems I had with the film. There were a few moments in the film were I easily predicted what would happen. I won't give away any spoilers.Characters:
I enjoyed most of the characters from the movie. Chris Pratt was funny, but also charming. Bryce Dallas Howard did a good job with her character. Pratt and Howard's character had great chemistry on screen. However, I feel some of it was forced. If there have been more dialogue between the characters, the relationship would seem more natural. There were some new characters, but some of them were two-dimensional.Acting:
The actors and actresses did a decent job of acting. Nothing exceptional, but they performed well in the film.CGI:

The movie was enjoyable. For me however, it's one of those movies I'll watch once and move on.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

No one could be able to create the magic of bringing this history alive in a better way than Jurassic park.Over the years many version of this franchise has been brought alive while the central theme was always Scary dinosaurs, chase sequence between human and animals, Bad gang trying to capture them and good guys fighting to keep the freedom of Super raptors alive.This Version is no different from others, so while kids are usually excited as always but after following all parts, we kept our hope realistic expecting the same product with slightly different packaging.Moreover, that is what this movie is all about. Storyline :In the Jurassic park, there is an eminent danger of extinction of dinosaurs due to projected volcanic eruption on the island. While Govt decides not to plan any evacuation of these raptors, one organization working for dinosaurs welfare decides to save at least few species by shifting them to another island with help of a Billionaire Philanthropist. So after lots of drama sequence, they successfully capture few of them and transport them but the real destination is not what was proposed. *No Spoiler alert*Thumbs Up : Strong point of movie is the starting scene which rightly build up momentum like a Roller coaster ride.Thumbs Down : Till the time we reached half, the secret is out and second half looks like a below average low budget dinosaur movie with indoor shooting.Even our kid found it difficult to keep his interest alive in 2nd part and fell asleep.

1768,eriklof-58757,One of the greatest this year,9,9 June 2018,"This movie is so different, and it feels more fresh. Instead of 'Reboot of park goes wrong and island is abandoned', we get something new. There we're some plot holes that left me wondering, but mostly just a really good movie and in my opinion better than the last one. The effects are awesome, music is decent and the dinosaurs did not leave me disappointed. So i do really recommend this movie and i really am anticipating for a future movie. And to be honest this movie did make me shed a tear, pretty weird for a movie like this.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1769,morgans-90747,Great movie,7,9 June 2018,If you enter the theatre with no expectations and are wanting the sequel for the first movie this one will keep you happy no doubt. The cgi was decent some parts wearnt great along with the plot being a lil unbelievable but if you take it with a grain of salt and watch it to enjoy it this film will be great for you .,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1770,girishalath,Disappointed.,1,10 June 2018,"If the movie is about dinosaurs then it should mainly focus on dinosaurs. It appears as if all the scenes with dinosaurs in it were already revealed through the trailers and promo videos, so nothing more surprising or interesting was left for me to see. When I saw the trailer I was really excited and thought that If the trailer is this awesome the movie is going to be even better, but it turns out I was terribly mistaken. A lot of focus was on the background stories of other characters which sometimes made me forget that I was watching a sequel to Jurassic World, because the focus was shifting from the dinosaurs to other characters. I think that child had more screen time than the dinosaurs itself, which I still don't know why? Majority of the movie was shot indoors away from the Island in a silly mansion which is another reason I disliked the movie. All the scenes inside that mansion were just too boring.I know people have worked really hard to make this movie and I respect that but as it is said ""Rowing harder doesn't help if the boat is headed in the wrong direction.""In my opinion Jurassic World (2015) was 100 times better than this movie. Here is how I would rate the Jurassic movies released till now;1) Jurassic Park (1993)2) The Lost World : Jurassic Park (1997)3) Jurassic World (2015)4) Jurassic Park 3 (2001)5) Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom (2018) Dead Last! I hope the next movie will take the number 1 spot.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1771,yesiamhuan,Here's why it's 10/10 and my opinion for the negative comments,10,10 June 2018,"First, I don't bash any comments. We all have rights to express our opinion here.Okay, let's get to why it's 10/10. The actions are really good. Though it might be hyper-real sometimes, like Owen could really run really fast comparing to those dinosaurs... Nevertheless, you never know what humans are capable of when they are put in life and death situations.
The story line is absolutely new. I don't know why people keep saying it used the same factors of previous movies like villains trying to squeeze money out of the dinosaurs... I mean, do bad guys even stop? This is an endless reflection on the greed of humans. 
The acting is really good, too. I can see the love for the dinos in every action of Claire's. Maisie needs some practice but I'm sure she tried her best. 
Above all, humanity is perfectly expressed through the movie. That Mills guy, who knows Maisie is just a clone, but isn't heartless enough to harm her. Moreover, the death in this movie is not really much, which is quite suitable for a movie for some kid-teenagers. You can see this, some death scenes are not shown obviously, but rather left for us to imagine... Example, the scene when Mills kills Lockwood is not shown because kids might imitate that. But this makes a difference, the death scenes of Mills and the hunter guy are show mercilessly to show that these bad guys are unforgivable, especially the hunter guy, he did not just kill for money, but also for the misery of the animals. And that scene when a big herbivore dinosaur is left to die, I almost cried. And last but not least, when Clair had to choose between killing them and setting them free, she chose to kill them but Maisie decided to save them. It would really bring joy to us all, I would have done the same thing... I mean, it's hard to choose between your mind and your heart... This is really relatable. You see, movies are supposed to teach us lessons through it, not just a mean of entertainment. The character development is great, even for Franklin, a typical IT guy, he had been sure scared but he got brave after... Because we can relate to them, to the characters. The movie was never about dinosaurs, but it teaches lessons by the dinosaurs. If you just want a dinosaur movie, just watch a documentary.
Anyway, I hope my comment is helpful, I really hope everyone would find joy and happiness in this, because you should. I wish to thanks the actors, the director and the whole crew. Keep creating and wowing us.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1772,adamad-58944,"Honestly, Not a letdown",7,10 June 2018,"Personally i think that the first one was better but this one wasn't bad either.
I liked the whole movie from the beginning till the end. And the indoraptor is amazing. Hopefully the prequel to this is a better one.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1773,khchuang,People are so hard to pleased.,10,11 June 2018,"I watched the movie and came here to read the feedback. Oh my gosh, there are so many negative comments. What you expect when you are watching a dinosaur movie? For me I like the simple story line, the look-real dinasours, and the compacted action scenes. There is no time for you to take a break for toilet during the movie. Before this my intention is to watch first prior to bring my kids. But I think the movie could be too scary for them.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1774,twrightforsyth,Acceptance of what it actually is,7,11 June 2018,"Simply put this movie is exactly what you would expect from a movie about dinosaurs, and it does it well. People, specifically bad guys, get eaten and general carnage ensures, light comedy and your classic tropes. Is this movie incredible? No and it never will be because it is within a genre of movies that are simply dumb fun and nothing more. Is it awful and worth a 1, absolutely not and anyone who would put it as a 1 is simply a pretentious sod who wishes to look so much more enlightened than everyone else despite looking silly for missing the point of the movie. 7/10 good simple fun, extra point for T-Rex eating people.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

A. Bayona,The great Director.His quality is zero in this film.He tried his best in the first 30 minutes to engage audience..But after that,a PURE TORTURE..He can even make this movie a KING KONG type..But he diverted to somewhere..Dinosaurs,here are like lizards and they are running for no reason..Big ones are very rare in scenes..Dinosaurs Auction scene was the pathetic scene in this movie..Don't waste your time and money,if your are looking for an Action Packed Dinosaurs Movie.It's no way near any of the movies in this series..Waiting for the next....",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1777,amarsp,Keeping The Franchise Alive!!,8,13 June 2018,"As a huge fan of the Jurassic Park franchise and having watched the original JP trilogy multiple times I was more than excited to see the latest installment of Jurassic World. 
Fallen Kingdom begins in the classic way and continues in a very traditional JP framework. Jeff Goldblum warns us of the perils of human interaction with nature and Chris Pratt is his usual macho comedy self.
The movie is filled with everything you'd expect from a dino epic. TRex makes an appearance of course as well as the plethora of other dinosaurs every young kid dreams of. We meet 'Blue' the raptor again and learn more about the touching relationship between her and Owen (Pratt). There is also a new creation in the form of the Indo-raptor, designed to be a military weapon. Moving away from the idea of dinosaurs as entertainment, this movie portrays them as beings in need of saving or as commodities to be weaponized.
As in the first Jurassic World we follow Claire Dearing (Howard) this time not running an amusement park but instead a rescue attempt to evacuate the dinosaur population of Isla Nublar from the threat of an erupting volcano.
Overall definitely one of the most thoughtful Jurassic Park episodes, some laughs and great action and touching moments but the ending leaves you feeling bleak about the state of humanity...let see what comes next!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1778,ChakraSense,Action-Packed but Lacking a Meaningful Story,7,13 June 2018,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom was rich in action and suspense complimented with brilliant special effects and great production. Unlike its predecessors, this film was filled with dinosaurs throughout - around 95% of the screening time, I would say.However, the praise ends here. The story was bland and the acting was atrocious, almost cringe-worthy. Certain characters felt forced and didn't need to be included in the film - especially, Maise Lockwood. There were several plot holes and moments that left me very confused - I left the theater with an empty, unfulfilled feeling. The ending was rage-inducing and it's certain that a third Jurassic World is on the horizon (much to my distaste). I feel that this franchise is being milked of every last penny.All 7 stars are given solely for the extraordinary action, something which no other Jurassic Park movie has done.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1779,alberttyrone,Decent,7,13 June 2018,"It was refreshing to see a little bit of politics involved, because it was tiring seeing them open dangerous parks over and over again. I personally thought they would make the same mistake of having ppl visit another error prone island. But thankfully they used a little of common sense this time. It's interesting to see what the future Jurassic films will lead to (if there are any more).",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1780,josephmccarthy-08673,Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (Review),9,15 June 2018,"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom was amazing, to be honest it is probably the best sequel for a Jurassic movie. It takes the audience into a journey that is a huge turning point for the franchise as a whole. J.A Bayona did a good job as director, he gave us all the suspense and horror elements throughout the majority of the film. However my one problem is the timing for the second act: which is the rescue mission on the island. Now don't get me wrong, the rescue operation sequence was great with the volcanic eruption, the Baryonx attack, Blue's return, the dino stampede. Everything was great. Sadly though it was rushed, the second act of the film only lasted for about 20-25 minutes in the movie (along with scenes taking place in the Lockwood Manor cutting in-between the island scenes) which made the second act not only rushed but a little disappointing yet amazing at the same time (it had ups and downs). My favourite part was: The Lockwood Manor. J.A Bayona once again did a great job in this part of the movie. The Indoraptor wreaking havoc at the manor was brilliant, the suspence it delivered was ground-breaking. Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard stole the show as Owen and Claire in this sequence too, by being the badasses they are.Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is a brilliant movie!
 
Congratulations to the cast and crew for making this movie! Rating: 9/10Joseph McCarthy",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1781,a-97030,the best film ever!,10,17 June 2018,"The film catchs your atenttion all the time! all the scenes contain action and surpring things. Both actors Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard were awesome and I could feel what they were going through. There is no dennying that this sequel is the best one possible full of twists and turns and full of dinossaurs. The special effects are so real that I could feel how it would be to see a dinossaur, not couting that they used animatronics to make this dinossaurs real and it worked. 
I absolutely recommend this film!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1783,jarrettrizzonelli,Planet of the apes reboot,4,23 June 2018,"I found the film to be incredibly frustrating. We see yet another reboot from a great franchise that ruins what the great films originally were. I liked the first Jurassic world, but many parts of that movie were rediculous (oh my god it speaks raptor!). now they are adding human clones and having dinosaur arms dealer auctions in the basement of their rich friend's house (who somehow has no idea they made a gene splice dinosaur baby in a secret lab 3 floors down. This movie basically tells me not to trust my accountant, and to let dinosaurs into America to run rampid no matter how many people they kill (who needs a wall anyways right?) They also never explain how the accountant planned to make all these millions, when he was working FOR the millionare (who he just smothered with the stereotype throw pillow). The money would end up going to the granddaughter clone who was thrown aggressively on the floor after being caught snooping in her own house (does CYS protect clones?). Over all the movie is setting up to be a dinosaur based rip off of planet of the apes. They could do way better with that cast, instead they used Chris Pratt as a cutaway comic relief man who also does karate all of a sudden to distract from a movie that absolutely had no substance.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1784,jamesluthien,People actually take this franchise seriously?,6,18 June 2018,"Now I'm usually the first to crucify the Jurassic Park sequels for their inaccuracies and bogus science, and this movie is no different. People outrunning a volcano which appears to be a hybrid volcano in and of itself, goofy looking dinosaurs, a ridiculous plot, and other such things. However, when comparing this to its predecessors Jurassic World Fallen Kingdom stands as the most unique entry in a generally one note franchise, with the later acts taking place in a different setting with a different tone. Now this tone is somewhat inconsistent, and the emotional parts fall flat, but the suspense is good and some of the comedic aspects are fun. The film is an uneven mess, but it's certainly nice to see something new than something bland and predictable like Jurassic World or the other sequels.Also literally every call back it made to the first film was terrible please stop doing that it's really annoying",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1787,sanjeeva-99372,Better than Jurassic World!,8,21 June 2018,"I watched this movie on IMAX 2D (the 3D version wasn't available in India) and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The climax scene was a little long, but overall this movie can be classified as a popcorn entertainer. What makes this better than Jurassic World is because this one has a story incorporated in it. Except for a spoiler regarding the little girl in the film (something which felt out of place) I would recommend everyone to watch this film. The film isn't perfect and a lot of people will try to find flaws and look for logic, but it is a pure fun movie which will keep you on the edge of your seat and hooked onto the screen waiting for what unfolds next. Though I was hoping for an epic scene like Chris Pratt driving a motor bike into the jungle with 4 raptors. Overall, a great film and can't wait till 2021 to watch the sequel! An 8/10 for me.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1793,dinosaurjack,Welcome to Jurassic World,10,23 June 2018,"I've never written a review for a movie before, but after seeing some of the negativity, I feel that others on here are simply not doing this movie justice. Yes, there is some fan service, but what's wrong that? Why is that a bad thing? Yes, some of the dialogue isn't amazing, but it's tolerable and there is character development. Yes, the villains were sort of generic, but in a movie so full of original plot and some much needed new blood to the franchise, an overly complicated villain would have taken too much away from the dinosaurs and from all the ethical questions that this film explores. These villains are supposed to represent all the greed in humanity, to exploit the dinosaurs--living, thinking beings just like us--for money.Claire's character had perhaps the most character development. She has already changed so much from the first film and this one highlighted her new empathy and the breakthrough she had watching the Apatosaurus die in Jurassic World. But then the villain got to her, to suggest that she was also exploiting the dinosaurs, because she authorized the creation of the Indominus Rex, and that he was the only one who would admit it. It's this that got to Claire and caused her not to push the button at the end.The opening sequence was perfection. The silent opening credits followed by a transition into water and then the shadow of the mosasaur was beautiful and then the addition of Rexy on land was perfect, very reminiscent of Jurassic Park. The first act was well done, with Claire's introduction mirroring the one in Jurassic World, only now to show her change. The villain posing as the good guy was believable and the hunter was shown as a believable good guy until they got Blue. The Carnotaurus scene coupled with Rexy's return was a great addition that also showcased the new Sinoceratops. Once the hunter tore out the tooth of the Stegosaurus, he was instantly unlikable.Perhaps the most heartbreaking scene in all the Jurassic movies was the Brachiosaurus on the dock, calling out for help before being enveloped in fire and ash. The silhouette rearing onto its hind legs, just like the one in Jurassic Park did, was a good final sendoff to Isla Nublar. The little girl's scenes before the dinosaurs arrive at the mansion are good for foreshadowing, especially when she witnesses the argument between Mills (?) and Dr. Wu over the Indoraptor and that ""It needs a mother!"" The claw reaching out automatically made the audience afraid of the Indoraptor.In addition, the juxtaposition of the little girl watching the videos of a young Blue with the other young raptors and Owen showing how she displays empathy, coupled with the scenes of Blue suffering after being shot and then a small tear in her eye was upsetting and made the audience truly connect with Blue and feel pity for her. This movie finally made people truly care for the dinosaurs.When the hunters arrive with the dinosaurs at the Lockwood estate, it was good to show Rexy being forced into yet another cage below the mansion. It shows the horrible conditions the dinosaurs are being forced into and Rexy has long been a fan-favorite, so it evokes a sadness at seeing a feared predator reduced a cage barely big enough for her.The Indoraptor is introduced well and sets a tone for its inevitable escape. It was a fitting death for the lead hunter and it was perfect to see a long death sequence.The scene with the Stygimoloch is played for laughs and it certainly does its job. It was great to see this dinosaur introduced into the franchise and it had a satisfying scene in making all the buyers run. The Indoraptor rampage is perfect, very dramatic and intense, with some throwbacks to Jurassic Park. The terrifying part about the Indoraptor as opposed to the Indominus is that the raptor can be in a house and it was used to its full potential. The fight between the Indoraptor and Blue is nerve-wracking, especially since the audience has a true connection with Blue now. The use of the laser technique and showing Blue as a silhouette before she saves all of them was beautifully done, as well as the slow motion fall where the viewer will constantly beg for Blue to be on top and not be killed by the fall. The scene where Claire backtracks a little in her character development and doesn't release the dinosaurs is angering at first, especially following the Brachiosaurus back on the island. When the little girl is the one to push the button, and says, ""They're alive, like me,"" it shows the simplicity in the lesson the movie was trying to teach. A child can understand it. Grown men and women with their heads caught up in trivial things such as money can't see that the dinosaurs are living, intelligent beings. Mills got what he deserved with the stampede and then Rexy returning to be the one to finish him off, with the Carnotaurus ripping him in half and then Rexy doing the classic spin and roar from the first Jurassic Park. Fan service? Yes. Awesome? Absolutely. All in all, with the sadness and empathy and connections that viewers feel, Fallen Kingdom does its job, teaches its lesson, and sets itself apart from all the other Jurassic movies, even the original Jurassic Park.If you've stuck with me this far, I hope that this review has been helpful and has shown you that it is much more than a monster movie.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1794,eluell-81881,WOW,10,24 June 2018,"This movie gave me everything I wanted from tributes to the movies before this and jump scares the last Jurassic world did not. Overall great cgi, great concept, the only thing it lacked was a strong plot.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1795,rvwjvj,"One of the BIGGEST LETDOWNS of all 5 Jurrasic Park Installments! Smart, yet, very DECEPTIVE way to BANK BIG BUCKS by abusing 2015's Box Office Success!!!",4,24 June 2018,"I cannot speak for everyone, but being of of the people who watched all previous Jurrasic Park Installments/Franchaise movies, I was quite disappointed in 2018's ""Jurrasic Word: Fallen Kingdom.""I watched it in 3D and, frankly, the special effects were not there to create a true 3D movie....
Yes, there were few unexpected, somewhat surprising moments during the movie, including some of the special effects, which I liked. 
However, if I were to compare it to ""Jurassic World (2015),"" which made over $1.6 billion in the Box Office, I cannot help myself but to conclude that the ""producers, directors, Universals, perhaps some cast members, etc"" used the success of 2015's Box Office as ""Guaranteed"" way of BANKING SOME BIG BUCKS regardless of how this movie will be accepted or even criticized.After seeing the Box Office Proceeds just as of Sat, June 23, 2018, they got nearly ""400% return on their investments"" already....and I am sure I wouldn't be the only one who thought of the ending as ""Desperate Act"" to create future installment....In conclusion, if IMDB's overall rating of ""Jurassic World (2015)"" was 7/10, this Installment deserves 4/10 at the very most.
I would recommend to wait until this movie is out on DVD/OnDemand, etc and watch it then...
Some may disagree, but I feel that in uncoming week or so, I wouldn't be surprised to see majority of people who watched the movie have similar conclusion(s).",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1796,nwillard-90592,Good,10,24 June 2018,I don't know why this movie got so much hate. The part when the island is being destroyed was a good sad scene. The ending left opening for another movie that can take place other then the islands .,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1797,mj-40920,Wonderful,9,24 June 2018,"First of all, yes, I have watched all of the Jurassic Park films.
That being said, I feel that this film is a spectacular incorporation of everything that made me love the previous films, and then some. The pacing felt natural, and the CGI didn't borrow from that at all. I felt captivated by a story that made me sympathize with a fictional island full of fictional dinosaurs, and I feel that if you can pull that off, you've created something great. Whether you're a longtime fan, or just a casual viewer of films, please go see this!!
That is, unless you're one of the people on IMDb who nitpicks every second of the film, then please save your breath.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1798,lynzeeeball,SO disappointed,1,25 June 2018,"I was so disappointed in this movie. I always thought Jurassic Park III was the worst, until I saw this. I was crying through most of the movie and it left me with an uncomfortable feeling once it was over. I was not happy with the animal torture and this movie just made me hate man-kind even more. I loved the first Jurassic World. I am a die-hard Jurassic Park movie fan. The first was the best, of course. Lost World and III weren't great, but I thought Lost World was better than III. Jurassic World really redeemed the movie series, until Fallen Kingdom. I am glad that Jurassic World III will be the last because I think they are just ruining a great thing and just need to let it be. I don't think I will ever watch this movie again.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1799,jamstam-83096,Jurassic Waste,5,26 June 2018,"SPOILER ALERT. I went to this movie for the hell of it, just something to do. I liked ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Jurassic World"" this one was kind of meh. I went in with the anti activist mentality of hoping that anyone dumb enough to step foot on a dinosaur inhabited island that is about explode needs to die (thankfully some do).The majority of the film attempts to and successfully makes you feel sad about dinosaurs being either killed by volcanic activity or being mistreated by contractors caging them for sale as potential military hardware. All the way up to the end you're hoping for a nice and safe ending for the animals (and the human main characters) that were in danger but nope. The last half of the movie I'm thinking authorities will step in and have the dinosaurs sent to the original Jurassic Park island but nope. They get released by John Hammonds cloned daughter into the country side, to eventually get gunned down and die. I mean obviously that's what would happen, you can't just have Raptors and T rex's roaming the country side. I read an article that said this supposed to be setting things up for a 3rd Jurassic World movie, yawn no thanks. Let me guess another group takes the DNA from all the hunted down dinosaurs and makes new ones, I cannot wait to not watch that. In summation this movie is a complete waste of time.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1800,dparcher,It was about what you could expect,4,26 June 2018,"Yeah the Kingdom fell, and this latest installment is threatening to take a beautiful franchise with it. But I'll start with the positives.Acting was good, CGI was as always magnificent, and as with all Jurassic movies, it paid some fun homage to the original few movies with moments that made the audience point at the screen and go, ""hey... that's..."" excitedly. On the flip side, a better name for this movie would have been Lost World 2. That's all it was. It was essentially nothing new in the plot device from the original Lost World. People go back to the failed Jurassic Park island experiment, thinking they are doing something humanitarian and end up in the middle of a secret plot to capture and sell dinosaurs for recreational or nefarious purposes, bringing them back to the mainland and seeing how that works out. Sound familiar? Without giving up too much they went too far with the whole genetic experimentation element this time and brought Jurassic Park squarely into the wheel house of Resident Evil.These movies used to inspire awe and wonder. The last Jurassic World did that beautifully. This movie felt rushed, like Hollywood just wanted to strike the iron while it was still hot. One of the best things about these movies has historically been that some time has gone by between them and given us all a space in between so that upon the next installment we can sit spell bound in the theater and recapture the magic of the original. This made it feel like we're in for the next Marvel 5 part movie series or a Michael Bay movie with Dinosaurs and a few less than customary explosions. The ending was the most upsetting and probably because of the potential (such as it is) for the next movie which can only go in a post apocalyptic direction now that dinosaurs are loose on the world with unrestricted access to the modern day. They need to stop. Just stop and breathe before making another. Decide a better direction to go before they ruin something so magical.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1801,nicholasmannino,Don't Listen to the Critics--This is a great movie,9,28 June 2018,"I have seen this movie twice now and both times have really enjoyed myself. This film plays out like classic Spielberg and has all the thematic elements necessary for a fun and exciting summer blockbuster. The Characters- Yes, some are underdeveloped but they all play a certain purpose within the films plot. Yes, the villains in this movie are one dimensional at times but what Jurassic film is different? Consider Nedry from the first Jurassic--his character is borderline cartoony. I don't see why we can forgive a characters actions like his but not accept those like Mills, Wheatley or Eversoll. Claire and Owen have a great dynamic in this one and expand on their relationship. Bryce and Chris do an excellent job bringing these characters and their motivations to life. The action is top notch and the direction of the film is equally breathtaking. The Gyrosphere sequence is intelligently shot (all in one take believe it or not) and possibly one of my favourite sequences in the movie. The third act is completely different in tone from the moments they're on the island and you can feel Bayona's personal touches and style more. I personally loved the Indoraptor but would have loved a little more carnage from it just to reiterate how evil it was. I really like Bayona's style and creativity shooting the scenes at Lockwood Manor--it takes a totally different tone not normally depicted in a Jurassic film--AND IT WORKS. The twist at the end was VERY reminiscent of a Michael Crichton novel and I am surprisingly happy that they introduced human cloning into this story...it makes sense given that the technology is so advanced...why wouldn't scientists further their investigation in advancing human genetics? I wonder how it will be presented in the third film (which this one sets up for).Ultimately, craft your own decision about this film. Don't listen to the negative critics and craft your own decision. This is not supposed to be a thought provoking film...It's an action packed blockbuster with a ton of thrills, dinosaurs, and enough emotional beats to deliver exactly what a Jurassic fan would want.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1802,dinoleox,"Shallow plot, weak movie.",4,29 June 2018,"Plot is as shallow as the poster implies; all characters except Starlord and blonde girl are caricatures of what they're supposed to represent with the main villain being the epitome of ""mwahaha i like money im evil capitalist"" white dude, alongside his weird looking pal and the one hunter dude with the tooth fetish.
 The entire movie relies on Starlord's character actions and present the other protagonists only when convenient; the dinosaurs are at the same time presented both as fragile dumb creatures that can be taken down with a single pistol bullet and also huge menaces that not even trained private soldiers can hope to hit a shoot even when standing literally 10 meters from them. Jeff Goldblum character has less than 5 minute screen time and change the story in absolutely no way serving only as an intro and outro narrator.
 Although the CGI is good it gets very saturated too quickly from the excessive amount of dinosaurs on a single scene at a time and worns off, the animatronics are okay though. The entire sequence on the island have a blue-green filter that dosen't fit with the situation and makes it look more akin to Peter Jackson's skull island from King Kong than isla nublar seen in the first movie and the last entry. Acting is good but only so far as the actors can make it, since the characters themselves are horribly written.
 Overall, it's both a bad Jurassic Park movie and a bad movie as whole, specially when seen alone, since it serves no purpose other than setting up the stage for the third and final entry in the Jurassic World triology. Fans of said triology may like, but conservative fans of the Jurassic Park series as a whole probably will not; even though it have a considerable amount of graphic imagery this movies seens to be aimed directly at kids and will be a massive grind to anyone that may try to take on it as an chapter in the series.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

But Mr. Lockwood hires Claire to convince Owen to go save the dinosaurs. With the help of a doctor and a hacker. It turns out that Lockwoods assistant who was supposed to help Lookwood with the Dino's betrayed him and decided to capture all the dinosaurs and sell them at an oction.

Guess what, you got exactly that. It almost demands you comparing it to Jurassic Park: The Lost World, because it seriously has the exact same story: ''We want to bring the dinos to the human world, what could possibly go wrong? Oh, woops, everything.''.Trying to be a typical blockbuster action movie, this film really did a good job. But it could've been much more than that. Instead, it turned out to be a movie with easily predictable moments, characters that aren't given any depth what-so-ever (especially the nerd kid. I mean, come on) and just *yawn* moments. The good people CANNOT die. They can't. It's impossible. And of course, the bad men HAVE to die. Because that's how films like these work. If any good being had died in the movie, no matter if it was Blue, redhead, Pratt or what or whoever, at least then it would've had some sort of impact on me. But the movie ends up being, like I said, a typical, predictable, bland, blockbuster action movie.

1808,frogman-91772,Very Disappointing,4,1 July 2018,"*Spoilers*
I went into this movie expecting it to be really good I usually don't run into a movie like this. This movie is very disappointing and there are huge plot holes. The daughter character Macy was never explained or talked about other than when one of the characters announced she is a clone of lockwoods daughter which was a completely random. You will be surprised how cliche the plot is: you have a rich dude who sends Claire her team and Owen to the island and all the dinasours are suppose to be rescued by a military organization which to no surprise is a rogue organization in for the money and not to help they find out instead the rich dude is just gonna bring them back to the mansion and sell them for a profit so he will be rich and you know ""Weaponize"" the dinosaurs. Chris Pratt's character is highly dissapointing considering he is a well respected actor and usually has really good roles like Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers and he just wasn't himself and there was no comedy from his character and that brings me to that point there is no comedy I thought for sure but I didn't laugh maybe a smile that's it. The CGI and action and the ending which will bring questions to how people are going to cope with dinosaurs living with them nowyou have a rich guy wanting money and power",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1809,kallamsamad,"More like ""Fallen Franchise""",1,2 July 2018,"This one is more worse than Jurassic Park 3 (and that is saying something). Where do I start?!Well, lets begin on the advantages. Ok, the graphics are awesome, better than the other films by far (Just like JW 1). The film had potential, but like the third one there was NO PLOT. At least JW 1 was fun and creative (Although, still bad). The main reason why I hate the film is the idea that you can ""weaponise"" dinosaurs. The idea is just stupid. It would have made sense if the film was set in the ancient times (a giant war T-rex would have been an awesome addition to the 300 films). But the idea is impractical in terms of modern warfare, where are the producers going with this? It's not like war-dinosaurs will be used to ""rule the world"" (I won't be surprised if that is the plot for the next film) a single drone could have been used to wipe them all out (instead of letting people ship illegal dinosaurs onto civilian land, which for some reason is cool. I mean a T-rex rampaging around San Diego isn't going to make the government stop this from happening right?)
I think the film will end up like planet of the apes. So, the dinosaurs will learn to pick up AK-47s and rule the world. 
 
The Indominous raptor is also a useless element to the film. If it was so ""intelligent"" it would have wiped all those guys out at once. But instead, it lets people interrupt it so the characters can have enough time to run away. The acting was terrible. That nerd was over exaggerating the fact that he was scared and the scenes weren't funny; they were cringey, crappy acting. The bar scene where that women was laughing her head of looked so fake! The only lines that little girl hard was to SCREAM AT THE TOP OF HER LUNGs, because, you know, film-stereotype. Also, a tip to you guys, if you're being chased by a dinosaurs, DON'T HIDE UNDER YOUR BED COVERS. The scene with the idiot guy who opened the cage was also predicatble scene.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1810,indotransserv,A tense and thrilling ride with a surprisingly thought-provoking message,8,5 July 2018,"""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" picks up three years after ""Jurassic World."" The fantasy-filled theme park is no more and dinosaurs are roaming in the wild as nature intended. There's only one problem; Isla Nublar's dormant volcano is going to erupt. Without human intervention, all the dinosaurs will soon cease to exist (again).Here comes the moral dilemma. Do these previously extinct prehistoric animals, revived by a private enterprise, deserve protection of the U.S. Government and at the expense of taxpayers like other endangered species? When the answer is no, a company connected to Jurassic Park's founder, Dr. John Hammond's former business partner, Benjamin Lockwood (James Cromwell), reaches out to a dinosaurs protection organization led by now conservationist Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas-Howard, ""Hereafter"").The plan is to rescue these animals by moving them into an island sanctuary nearby. As the former operations manager of the park, Claire's expertise is needed to get into the old park's system and locate the dinosaurs. She persuades her ex-boyfriend and raptor trainer, Owen Grady (Chris Pratt, ""Avengers: Infinity War"") to go with her and her team, tech geek Franklin Webb (Justice Smith) and paleo-veterinarian Zia Rodriguez (Daniella Pineda).It's no surprise that things do not go according to plan. As a matter of fact, the plan is not what it seems. Mercenaries and profiteers (Rafe Spall, Ted Levine, Toby Jones, B.D. Wong) want to save the dinosaurs for their own self-serving benefits. These dinosaurs are worth millions and can be used for other purposes. Director J.A. Bayona sets up suspenseful set pieces and action sequences from the start. Unlike the sun-lit wonder of ""Jurassic World,"" 'Fallen Kingdom' starts off with a harrowing underwater nighttime expedition in the rain. Once Claire and company arrive at the island, they are trapped in an underground bunker, cracking with shots of hot lava and a monstrous creature coming out of hiding. Then out in the open, dinosaurs are running amok, trying to outrun shooting fire balls and engulfing smoke. Chaos descends on land and in the ocean, with a rolling and sinking gyrosphere.Once the dinosaurs are off the island, they are transported into the mainland, specifically an expansive estate in Northern California, the Lockwood Estate. Caught in the mayhem is Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon), Benjamin's granddaughter. Terror reigns in the manor. Hide-and-seek and attack occur in confined spaces, lending a claustrophobic feel. The filmmaker takes advantage of the Gothic setting with a play of light and shadow.The film is shot beautifully for maximum chill. A lone, gentle giant left behind on the shore, disappearing into a desperate silhouette in an ash cloud. A ferocious hybrid creature roaring on the rooftop against the backdrop of a moonlit rainstorm. A gigantic beast lurking beneath the sea surface dotted with surfers and swimmers. An intelligent dino roaming across rocky scape and looming steps away from civilization.The kingdom may have fallen apart, but life finds a way. There's also a twist that doesn't stop with loose dinosaurs. The ending sets up for a sequel where humans would have no choice but face the consequences of their action. ""Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom"" is a tense and thrilling ride with a surprisingly thought-provoking message.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1824,zesupergrunt,can someone check on Steven Spielberg?,3,26 July 2018,"This movie is garbage. I wasn't expecting anything amazing from a sequel to a spin-off, but this movie was so much more than expected. The plot is over complicated, so you don't get a satisfactory exploration of any plot points. And in all their half baked ideas, we're left with a lot to be desired.Stupid solutions to plots kept on appearing - for example, when Claire is being pursued by that raptor and she's cornered with that nerdy guy, I am 99% sure that the ladder they escape the room with appeared out of nowhere. Also why did that girl hide in her bed in her exposed bedroom as opposed to the laundry lift? The dinosaur couldn't get her there. I know she's a little girl, but that doesn't mean she's dumb as a bag of rocks.The characters are sooo forgettable. There's this nerd where I think his whole schtick is to scream like a girl. It was pretty ironic how often they tried to pass that and his lack of masculinity off as a joke, especially with the obvious liberal virtue signalling the entire movie. There's also some activist chick who is a ""paleoveterinarian"". Theres like, tens of dinosaurs, how is that a degree program? She also has never seen a real dinosaur. She probably got that degree from DeVry.The CGI is passable in the theatre, but in 5 years im certain this CGI (especially when the dinosaurs run) will be unforgivably bad. Like the CGI goat that got fed to the dinosaur - I wonder if the animator has ever actually seen a goat before? It would have been cheaper for them to use a real goat for the scene, but that would make their dinosaur look like hot garbage. So we got a gremlin goat.If you watch Jurassic World 2, expect all this and more.

It was sad to see that many described this empty plot as exciting and watchable.This was expected. 'Another cheap movie', I thought. However, second half of the movie brought me a pleasant surprise.

For example, Isla Nublar being destroyed by Mount Sibo (the volcano), that was taken from the first book at the end in which the island gets destroyed by Napalm. Also the story of Blue the Velociraptor and Owen Grady isn't finished yet. This film is setting up for the next and final Jurassic film set to be released June 2021.

All the trailers lead you to believe that the movie will have at least a large chunk take place in the wrecked park. This is not the case, in fact, it seems like they are trying to get off the island as fast as they can write into the ship's rear view mirror. The estimated budget was $170 million. What did they spend it on? The majority of the movie is shot in the same setting, a mansion. The movie also feels like it was written from the aspect of, ""We need to release the dinos into the world and spend 2 hours doing it."" and they just started writing the story knowing the end point and working backwards.

The previews for it did NOT do any justice to the film and actually tricked me into thinking we would get just a cut-and-paste of The Lost World, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was not the case.
In terms of CGI, the film was phenomenal. The dinosaurs looked incredible, and the Indoraptor had me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
As far as story goes, however, it was somewhat lacking. While I do have to give the film kudos for somewhat improved dialogue and plot originality as well as realistic world-building (as realistic as a dinosaur film can be anyway), there's not much else beyond that -- it's just your standard JP franchise film with people inevitably trying to hide from the big bad dangerous lead dino and screaming bloody murder, which is why I gave it 7/10 stars. Still, what they did have in regards to story was done modestly well, and was fairly enjoyable. I particularly liked the nods to older JP films that were included from time to time.
Overall, I recommend going into this with an open mind. While it may not live up to the classic JP films and isn't everyone's cup of tea, it was a pretty good movie for what it was, and I'm far more inclined to rewatch it than I was when I saw the first Jurassic World movie.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

Fallen Kingdom goes back to a more subdued, darker styling that shows over the top mayhem isn't needed to create gripping and intense entertainment.

It has issues like most films, but a lot of the 'plot holes' can be explained from previous film cannon. For jurassic fans, this film was a real tribute to the author of the novels.

Watchable if you can convince yourself it's pure schlock, but the 'horror' elements this movie insists on take themselves too seriously to make it easy. The Alien cribbing at the climax was too off putting to make this feel like it's own film. Its a for-profit studio franchise product made up of ingredients, rather than a story in its own right.At least no-one died on a toilet.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1852,xstrix,Sigh...,1,19 September 2018,"Not even worth watching.

Either people are just brain dead and will consume any trash that comes their way or something else is going on (payed reviews).From start to finish this movie was dumb, dumb, DUMB! It's trash. It was not worth my time. I just can't believe they made 1Billion dollars off this trash movie! People must be very dumbed down to enjoy this movie.This is THE WORST jurassic park movie I've ever seen. At the end this dumb clone girl human lets all the dinasaurs out to roam around and be free.

1861,phillipmckibbin,Insufferable movie,3,9 May 2019,"Finally watched this movie, and I'm honestly surprised I made it through the first ten minutes. I knew the plot would be insufferable when some fringe activists wanted to prevent the re-extinction. Every time any character brought up the point that the dinosaurs had to be saved from extinction, I couldn't help thinking, ""They already went extinct. That's natural selection.""I knew the characters would be insufferable when Zia got all uppity about being a paleo-veterinarian. Aside from the wildly unlikely scenario that she found herself in, that degree would be about as valuable as toilet paper - a paper towel, at best. Yes, it served a plot point, but to get as agitated as a grievance studies major when questioned about it brought on instant disgust with her character. Oh, and the predictable ""reluctant hero"" Franklin? Give me a break. Total garbage.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1864,mrneilwilson,Gutted... Just gutted.,1,21 October 2018,"I personally loved Jurassic World, it felt huge, it felt grand. That movie felt like a nod to the original film. This...this felt rushed, small in scope (laughable really when you consider the subject matter) and full of plot holes.
Let's begin...
1. Who the hell would build a multimillion pound park on an island with any sort of volcano on?
2. The use of dinosaurs as weapons is a ridiculous premise.
3. Who the hell is this old man who apparently used to be Hammonds business partner? We've never heard about him before have we?
4. How the hell did said old man not notice what was going on beneath his feet... in his own house?
5. Why was there a bloody exit on the island for the gigantic mossosaurus (excuse my spelling).
6. Blood transfusion for a dinosaur?
7. The deadly Indoraptor... pretty useless if you ask me. You've got to point a gun at your target and it will kill them... why not just pull the trigger?
8. Why basically copy The Lost Kingdom?? It was a terrible sequel. Jurassic World set up what could have been a fantastic sequel.
9. What happened to Isla Sorna?
10. Why introduce the cloned girl, why?
11. Why wasn't Clare in prison after the events of the first film?
Terrible movie that left me gutted and disappointed. And a third one sadly on the way...",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1865,britneydelacruize,I loved it,10,27 October 2018,I don't really ever get into the whole syfy-ish dinosaur or alien or all that majic wizzardy BS but for some reason the Jurassic movies have always struck my fancy and as I am watching this movie as we speak for the second time I have to say it's not disappointing at all. I honestly really like it and think it has the laughter the action the drama the thrill and kept me interested and eyes glued to screen the whole time or that could be the fact that Chris Pratt's sexiness is all over this lol and I love Bryce falls in anything she does. But I'm all honesty the only part I didn't like was having to see the dinosaurs that were left behind on the island that weren't saved die in the volcano lava it broke my heart and the fact that they didn't have good intentions for the saved dinosaurs other than for their own gain but thanks to Claire and Owen they changed that but all in all definitely watch this and you to will see it's a well crafted and delightful joy of a movie u won't be disappointed.,Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1866,katarinasigfrid,Best,10,30 May 2019,"Best movie ever! It has everything, even Jeff Goldblum!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
1867,gijscornelissendebeer,I beg of you Mr. Spielberg,1,10 November 2018,"Like the title says: I beg of you, Mr Spielberg. Please acknowledge us original Jurassic Park lovers and stop approving these follow ups. As a kid I saw Jurassic Park under the ideal surcomstances, it was raining outside, I was up beyond my curfew because it was Friday eve so it was dark, all my father said was 'oh, do I have something for you', everything a kid with a wild imagination wants to hear. From the first couple of seconds I was hooked, it was like I was in the movie, I wanted to be Dr. Grant, I wanted to be Tim, I wanted to be Dr. Malcolm, I still use so many phrases from the movie today. Whenever I get outsmarted by my girlfriend she knows I'm gonna say 'clever girl', whenever something goes wrong I always say 'could be worse John, could be a lot worse'. This is just to give you an idea of how much Jurassic Park is in my roots, just as it is with so many other people of my age. And this is exactly why we don't want any sequels to be made any more. Ofcourse i watched this one, because I had to. Even though I knew it was gonna disappoint me, just like the third and Jurassic World did. But please Mr. Spielberg, don't disappoint us any longer. This movie is so much a ripoff of a ripoff, that's it not even connected any more to the original. Just because you put a couple of characters from the original in this one, doesn't mean it's connected. Which makes it even worse. It's like you made a copy of someone who made a copy of the original. Know when to quit. There wasn't a single moment in this movie that gave me the feeling of being that kid again who sad in a tree and pictured dinosaurs around him. In fact, it made me extra sad because somehow you managed to kill more dinosaurs in this one than you did in the previous 4 movies. The scene with the Brontosaurus standing on the edge of the island while it's being covered in flames: just plain cruel. Please watch the original and Lost World one more time Mr. Spielberg, and realise it should've stopped there. For old times sake.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1869,andrewainslie,Actively routing against itself,1,26 July 2020,"Jeff Goldbloom was a large part of selling this movie, he has no relationship to the story and simply appears to be commentating on unrelated events throughout.. his part could be entirely added or removed in post and you wouldn't noticeThe ending was also a hilarious joke! They actively chose to release deadly dinosaurs into the USA because of what!? Some wee clone girl having an existential crisis?? Seriously wtf!? How is releasing them into the world possibly the happy good ending they then tried to claim it to be!?This film is a disgrace to the name it so easily abuses for the sake of ripping as much money out of the public as they could!Pathetic!",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom

1872,leblancbryan-80330,A sequel to a remake that's a remake to a sequel?,3,17 January 2019,"I had high hopes for this film and was severely let down.The synopsis and trailer make it seem like we are going to see an incredible race against natural disaster film that shows the after effects of the first film. Instead what we are treated to is a cataclysmic event that makes the entire first film almost obsolete. Especially considering that during the course of the movie it is shown that they could have just done all of this right in the mansion.While I do appreciate the ties in to the original Jurassic Park movie, putting Jeff Goldblum in at a hearing seemed more like an afterthought to cram nostalgia in instead of a plot point and story driver. (And that's from someone who could listen to Jeff Goldblum read the dictionary and would still listen because.... well.... it's Jeff friggin Goldblum) We could have just as easily gotten a voice over. It's not like we wouldn't know who it was.The entire time I couldn't help but think that even though we are being told to ignore the original second and third movie, someone liked the idea of the second enough to rewrite it in their own way. The entire thing feels like a knockoff of the original second film with a little more forethought and just updated for the times. If only that worked out as cool as it sounded.Side note: is anyone else as sick of the ""karma by dinosaur"" trope as I am? Because I think we got three in a very short time this time around.All in all, this outing seemed like a flashy mess. Maybe if the ideas had been broken up into more than a single film there would be more to latch on to, but when the audience no longer connects to the characters a lot of that veneer is gone. I found myself caring if Blue made it over anyone else. And leaving with that terrible cliffhanger didn't help. Because we all know ""Hot Mess 3: oops we cloned dinos"" is coming.",Jurassic World - Fallen Kingdom
