0,bkoganbing,The Wolf-Beiderman Comet,8,19 December 2010,"Deep Impact is a throwback film to the Seventies disaster movies. This disaster is going to be one of world wide significance. A comet discovered by some kids in a high school astronomy club is calculated to be on the way to earth and will be there in a few years. It all begins so innocently as the kids from a high school astronomy club are making their observations. Elijah Wood notices an object in space that shouldn't be there and it isn't twinkling as stars do. He takes a picture and sends it to astronomer Charles Martin Smith. Who tracks it on a collision course with earth and then gets killed rushing to give those in authority the news.The rest of the film plays like your Seventies disaster film as a cross section of citizens try to figure out what to do with what could be a very short remainder of their lives. Morgan Freeman who is the president of the United States institutes martial law and a lottery of selected citizens who are to be put into underground shelters in the limestone caves of Missouri. How that lottery effects the cast constitutes the remainder of the film.Some folks are chosen for their celebrity. Elijah Wood who discovered the comet gets saved with his family, his next door neighbor and fellow astronomer wonk Leelee Sobieski doesn't. Tea Leoni is the MSNBC news reporter who suspects something major is afoot also gets to go. She's torn between mother Vanessa Redgrave and father Maximilian Schell who are separated and Schell has taken a trophy wife in Rya Kihlstedt. She gets a pass because of her celebrity status in breaking the comet story.There's a team of astronauts up there trying to save the situation headed by Robert Duvall. Initially all they do is break off a small section of the comet. One of them gets killed and the rest go home to die. I have to say that I liked Morgan Freeman as president best. We haven't had as commanding a presence in the White House in real life for quite a few years now. He's the man in authority I would like to see in a crisis. Secondly Elijah Wood and Leelee Sobieski are really great as the young people who must survive, intelligent, progressive looking and free from a lot of the garbage that has passed. It was a matter of seconds before Sobieski in her telescope might have discovered the comet that Wood did. The unfairness of it all is truly frightening.That final scene of Washington, DC after the tidal wave has struck is impressive. It reminded me so much of the picture's Lincoln's first inaugural with the unfinished Capitol Dome in the background, symbol as commentators said at the time of an unfinished union. The Capitol standing disheveled, but still standing was a great symbol of humankind's unconquerable spirit. Gloria Gaynor said it best, ""I Will Survive"".Some nice special effects connected with a group of interesting stories with people that you care about, that's Deep Impact.",Deep Impact
1,Leofwine_draca,A solid disaster movie that threatens to be overwhelmed by sickly sentiment,6,12 June 2016,"A passable, diverting, but sometimes boring disaster flick. At least it's better than some of the ones they made in the '70s, mainly due to the improved special effects. They just weren't able to do them justice in those days, so this blows METEOR out of the water pretty well, although it's still far, far below stuff like THE TOWERING INFERNO. Mainly because effects on their own do not make a film (take VOLCANO for instance).What makes this film better than most is the focus on the people, not the special effects, which is refreshing for a blockbuster like this these days. We do actually get to know and feel for the characters (even if we hate them), so the ending will have some meaning. Unfortunately, most of the film is made up of slow-moving exposition, lots of dialogue and drippy sentiment which comes across as shallow and pointless, it's so cheesy and bad it makes you sick. There are some good scenes like the mission to Mars, but these are few and far between. I can safely say that the ending is worth waiting for though.The special effects here involve cities exploding as they get hit by the tidal wave. Just like INDEPENDENCE DAY, but with water instead of fire. While some look unrealistic, they're certainly a lot more convincing than in many other, lower budgeted films, so these expensive movies do have something going for them I suppose. Anyway, the effects look amazing and jaw-dropping, just as to be expected, although there are surprisingly few of them (the whole tidal wave thing can't last longer than five minutes). The spaceship scenes are also good, with excellent character buildings, we really feel for the guys and girls at the end of the film.The cast is populated by lots of famous names which also adds to the enjoyment level. Tea Leoni is a pretty bland and obnoxious lead, although to be fair she's not as bad as some. Maximillian Schell is heavyweight support and fits his expensive-looking, amiable role like a glove, while Morgan Freeman is excellent, as to be expected, as the first black President, although woefully underused. Robert Duvall is also good value as the aged, grandfatherly astronaut, and he's a character we really care about. In fact the only characters that really grate are the teenagers, with a wimpish Elijah Wood simply awful and his 'wife' nearly as sickly. Further down in the cast list we have cult favourite Charles Martin Smith as a nervous scientist (what else? This guy spends his life playing scientists), and one of my personal favourites, Kurtwood Smith (ROBOCOP), as mission control operator.Unfortunately, DEEP IMPACT is only spoiled by the overlong, boring sentimental scenes. What we needed was more action and more plot development, instead of endless romances and farewells. What did surprise me was the relatively high mortality rate, a lot more actors and actresses die than you would imagine. Overall I would call this solid entertainment, a little too family-orientated for my liking.",Deep Impact
2,SnoopyStyle,engrossing investigation but predictable disaster movie,6,29 November 2013,"Journalist Jenny Lerner (Téa Leoni) is given a lesser assignment of researching Secretary Alan Rittenhouse who resigned abruptly. She discovers he had an affair with Ellie. As she digs deeper, she finds the biggest story of her life. Meanwhile, high school student Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood) and astronomer Dr. Marcus Wolf discover a new meteor heading for Earth.The investigative reporting is very engrossing. It culminates to a reveal to the world halfway into the movie. The 2nd half isn't quite as compelling. It gets very predictable and by the number disaster movie. Some of it is overly melodramatic. Instead of an exciting ending, it peters out even with the CG disaster. I would give the first half a 7, and the second half a 5.",Deep Impact
3,kosmasp,Scratching the surface,7,27 May 2021,"No that is not what Deep Impact means? Well I'm European, I'm allowed to say/write that. Ok all kidding aside ""end of the world"" movies always have something dramatical about them. Why not express that in the title too? So Deep Impact it is then ... by the way, since you know what this will about you may wonder why the movie takes so long to take off ... no pun intended. I reckon those who had no clue and watched it either as test audience or in sneak previews might have gotten something out of that.That being said, even for those unitiated - early on you will understand what this will be about. And then we take a time leap and it almost seems forgotten. Until we get introduced to Tea Leonis character and her ... problems and issues. Some might not care, but it does make sense to give us some notion of who we have to deal with. Rewatching this was quite the throwback, but also a neat and interesting thing seeing some actors who later became known for other things ... Elijah Wood to name one - as quite the ""small"" kid here.What also was fun, some of the things people go through here, are the main theme in a newer catastrophe movie with Gerald Butler - Greenland. This kind of triest to dip its foot in everything. Which is either a good thing or something you will not appreciate at all. Good actors make this more than worthwhile, though I am surprised this won prices and stuff ... anyway a decent movie to say the least and very entertaining, even when it has some dull moments and could have been shorter ...",Deep Impact
4,gavin6942,The Less Happy Armageddon,6,22 June 2016,"Unless a comet can be destroyed before colliding with Earth, only those allowed into shelters will survive. Which people will survive? Because of the time this film came out, it is often compared to ""Armageddon"". Both are about a collision course with earth and how to stop it. The timing is somewhat suspicious, but we will just assume it is a coincidence.There are some differences. ""Armageddon"" has a slightly better cast, and a bigger soundtrack. Yes, ""Deep Impact"" has Morgan Freeman, Kurtwood Smith and Robert Duvall. But it also stars Tea Leoni, who is one of history's worst actresses. Where ""Deep Impact"" succeeds, though, is in its darkness. ""Armageddon"" somehow becomes a romantic movie, whereas this film does not shy away from the likely, inevitable deaths of millions of people.",Deep Impact
5,lee_eisenberg,"I shouldn't even have to explain why it's better than ""Armageddon"".",7,12 January 2006,"""Deep Impact"" was one of two collision-related movies released in summer, 1998 (the other was ""Armageddon""). Whereas the latter had no other purpose than to have Bruce Willis kick ass, the former was actually quite good. More than just an action movie, this one shows the human aspect of everything. One of the most interesting aspects is Pres. Tom Beck (Morgan Freeman). Whereas we usually expect black men in movies to be macho, this guy talks about his belief in God. I guess that the only thing of which I would have liked to see more would have been the shelters, but I guess that such an aspect would probably occupy an entire movie on its own. All in all, a really good movie.",Deep Impact
6,jboothmillard,Deep Impact,7,12 July 2005,"This was out the same year as Armageddon, but coming out before it I think helped it become more popular (with critics also), same premise, very good film. Basically scientists, including Dr. Marcus Wolf (The Untouchables' Charles Martin Smith) discover a large comet heading for Earth, but were killed before they could report it. At least eight months later, people including reporter Jenny Lerner (Téa Leoni) for one, lead their pretty normal lives, that is until President Tom Beck (a well cast Morgan Freeman), announces to the world that a comet heads for Earth, and that a team of astronauts will be heading out to send it off course. The team of the ship named 'Messiah' include Captain Spurgeon 'Fish' Tanner (Robert Duvall), Dr. Oren Monash (Ron Eldard), Andrea 'Andy' Baker (Mary McCormack) and Mark Simon (Blair Underwood), and as for everyone on Earth, the President wants everyone to continue like normal. The mission unfortunately fails, because the drill for planting the bomb in the meteor didn't go deep enough, so the meteor is now in two halves, one little, one huge. The President informs people however that in this event, there have been preparations for living in some protective caves, until the dust from the disaster settles, and there is a lottery to select other people to join all the important people (e.g. doctors, scientists) already chosen. So you can imagine all the hysteria made both by the people who have been selected, and those who haven't, Leo Beiderman (Elijah Wood) was sure marrying Sarah Hotchner (Leelee Sobieski) would guarantee both their families would get in, but it didn't. In the end, Jenny settles her differences with father Jason (Maximilian Schell), and Leo and Sarah ride away from danger, the smaller portion of the meteor does strike the Earth, creating the world's highest tidal wave going through New York and a few other cities nearby, but sacrificing themselves, the Messiah does destroy the remaining portion with the ship and two nukes left on board. Also starring Vanessa Redgrave as Robin Lerner, James Cromwell as Alan Rittenhouse, Jon Favreau as Dr. Gus Partenza, The Lost World: Jurassic Park's Richard Schiff as Don Beiderman and Enigma's Dougray Scott as Eric Vennekor. I think the title relates to both the meteor hitting, and the human relationships, but whatever, it is a very good all-star cast in a really engaging science-fiction drama. Very good!",Deep Impact
7,ccthemovieman-1,A 'Disaster' Sums It Up!,4,2 May 2006,"This ""disaster"" flick was just that: a disaster. It features too much talk and not enough actual ""disaster"" footage and too much profanity for a family to watch an action film. This reminded me of the old ""Airport"" films in which the life stories of the people took up most of the movie, not the airplane crash or near-crash. In this movie, it takes an hour and 45 minutes before the dreaded comet hits Earth. When it does, however, there are some awesome sights. The sound was great on the DVD and the picture very sharp.Tea Leoni, the main character, an MSNBC reporter (this network must have funded the movie with all the publicity it got in here), is flat in her delivery. She speaks in a monotone most of the time. Pretty pathetic to have her in the lead when you also have actors the caliber of Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall. Both of them are fine, as always. Also in the cast worth noting are pre-Lord Of The Rings star Elijah Wood and veterans Maximlian Schell and Vanessa Redgrave.",Deep Impact
8,rmax304823,Really Deep.,5,22 September 2017,"Nice cast, especially Téa Leoni, as a fledgling reporter who catches an important story for TV news, and Morgan Freeman, as president of the United States, caught between a rock and a bigger rock.Téa Leoni was never a bravura actress. Her emotional range varies from casual, matter of fact, to slightly perturbed. It doesn't matter. Those incandescent incisors. How I would love to see her eat corn on the cob at an Iowa picnic. Her sleek features are just about perfectly arranged and clothing seems to drape itself loosely but eagerly around her slender form.Freeman is fine as well. Even those who have been repelled by the idea of an African-American president must admit that this is the kind of president you want to be able to lean on in times of crisis -- and CAN. Unlike Leoni Freeman has a broad range as an actor. Polite and reserved in ""Driving Miss Daily"" and a vicious pimp who kicks you in the family jewels in ""Street Smart."" Robert Duvall is the pilot of a space craft trying to destroy a monstrous comet on its way to inflict more punishment on the earth than human beings already have. Unfortunately Duval is in his dry period with little to do except the occasional arid chuckle. Too bad because he's been capable of some fine performances. Max Schell is bulkier than we remember but is one of the finest actors of his generation. He's given no chance to prove it here. Still, it's Noah's Ark time around the world.Let's see. I think that gets the good part out of the way. It's actually a pretty dumb movie, an unhealthy blend of rude science fiction and bathos. The plot is cobbled together from most other disaster movies you've seen. There's even a motorcycle racing away from an onrushing tsunami which is copped, I think, from ""Earthquake,"" in which Los Angeles gets it. Vanessa Redgrave, an elegant matron, takes a long time before the disaster, carefully dressing, applying make up, wearing her most expensive but subdued jewelry, and then sits back in her opulent apartment to wait for it. (""On the Beach."") The least bearable part is when a two-year darkness appears about ready to engulf the earth and extinguish life. Fortunately, earth's governments have had time to drill and stock labyrinthine caverns in the limestone landscapes. In the United States the caves will accommodate some 3,000 survivors, including about 800 scientists and artists. The 3,000 will be chosen strictly at random. (Why do I doubt this?) No one over fifty allowed. Here I was experiencing nightmarish visions of Doctor Strangelove and his Gemeinschaft Gesellschaft. ""Of course dzha WIMMEN vood heff to be of a highly STIMULATING nature!"" The random plan means splitting up families and loved ones. Now I was worried about ""When World's Collide"" with a selfish and bitter billionaire offering to fund salvation only if he goes first. But no! When the time comes to bus the Select to their caves, it seems that NOBODY WANTS TO GO. Nope. They can't leave their loved ones behind -- their babies, their husbands, grand dad in his dotage. There's a great deal of sobbing. Kids are torn from their mother's arms. The armed and uniformed footmen of Unit Orange 245 must use their M-16s to force the survivors to get aboard.But not to worry. The world doesn't end -- yet. There is a disaster, yes, but a small one, a tidal waves that clears the coastal plan of the eastern United States of all the accumulated detritus. But Duval, his four or five passengers, decide to dive directly into the comet and blow it to smithereens with the nukes they have aboard. Plenty of time or parting words with the families via television. Tears abound. ""Whatever you do, wherever you go, I'll always be beside you."" God, I hope not.",Deep Impact
9,Tweekums,Not bad for a disaster movie,6,26 July 2009,"To be fair to this film I must state first that I'm not a great fan of disaster movies but do like science fiction. Like most of its genre there are rather too many characters who didn't do anything to further the plot; for example a lot of time is spent on the school boy who first spotted the comet even though he takes no further role in the attempt to stop the comet. Likewise once the story of the comet broke the reporter didn't contribute much beyond a human interest element although to be fair Téa Leoni did a good job and kept her character interesting.Morgan Freeman did a fine job as the US president although he is the sort of actor who could make reading the phone book seem statesmanlike and Robert Duvall puts in a good performance as the ageing astronaut astronaut leading the mission that is attempting to destroy the rogue comet before it hits the Earth.The special effects for the comet weren't too great by current standards but when I was watching that scene I didn't realise the film was so old until later on when we see that the Twin Towers were still standing in New York. I liked the effects of the tsunami when the smaller comet hit though. Given that it was a disaster movie surprisingly there was hardly anything after the disaster struck, the whole story was taken up by how people prepared for the impending disaster rather then seeing how people cope once an unexpected disaster strikes as was the standard in the 1970s when disaster movies were all the rage. Personally I rather liked this difference. I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you are a fan of the genre or it is in the bargain bin but it is certainly worth watching if it is on television.",Deep Impact
10,BA_Harrison,Just hurry up and die!,5,20 March 2011,"The classic disaster movie formula begins by introducing the various characters, hits with the disaster soon after and then ratchets up the tension as those who have survived the initial calamity struggle to stay alive amidst the ensuing chaos.Deep Impact does things a little differently: it introduces some characters, hints at the impending disaster, introduces more characters, verifies the impending disaster, introduces more characters, develops the characters further, has some characters try to prevent the impending disaster (but fail to do so), develops the characters some more, and only delivers the death and destruction minutes before ending. In short, it's all arse-about-face.The meteor crashing into the Earth causing a 1000ft tidal wave to flood the Eastern seaboard of the USA is an undeniably spectacular sight, but to get there viewers must endure well over an hour and a half of overwrought emotional dreck, difficult to take no matter how great the cast.4.5 out of 10 for the actual 'deep impact' plus an extra half point for introducing me to the lovely Leelee Sobieski, who has since grown into a fine figure of a woman.",Deep Impact
11,moonspinner55,An all-American disaster flick for the 1990s: better effects but the same old clichés,3,27 August 2007,"U.S. President (Morgan Freeman) announces that a 7-mile-long hunk of rock is on a collision course with Earth, and much of the last-act destruction we see is based in New York City. A great wave not only takes down the Statue of Liberty, it decapitates her! Director Mimi Leder and screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin are very big on tearful goodbyes: that ""let's keep a stiff upper-lip"" mentality which allows couples (married or otherwise) to stare lovingly into each other's eyes, whispering dedications as death looms above. LeeLee Sobieski's entire role is based on a series of these teary farewells; she's so dead-set on staying with her doomed parents that her character takes on a suicidal edge. Yes, she's in denial, but her suffering seems to go on forever, and by the end a frustrated viewer could possibly be excused for screaming, ""Stop whimpering and move!"" How are the effects? Very good when they finally arrive (about four minutes before the film wraps up). Some of the incidentals during the final devastation are suspect, such as a two-second shot of an elderly man getting hit with the wave from behind while he's sitting outside reading the paper (is he in denial too?). I would think that the lottery-aspect of the plot (wherein people are picked at random to live underground for 2 years) would be more exciting than reporter Tea Leoni sniffing out a juicy story. The movie seems to start at much too early a point, with introductions to the characters and to an asteroid exploration team that just chews up time on the clock. There's also the time-worn idea about what books should survive (not ""Huckleberry Finn"" and ""Moby Dick"" again! Hasn't Rubin's thought process matured beyond 1960?). Naturally, it's we Americans who suffer on the screen. There's a tidbit late in the film wherein Freeman talks about Europe and Africa suffering from the meteor's destruction, but it's shucked off as basic info. The filmmakers don't care about the lost lives and homeless injured of other continents, they have their own agenda. By letting the Americans scream and cry and crawl through the debris, they can also let them triumph over all this tragedy--enough for a feel-good finish. But if Bruce Rubin thinks these stock characters are the most powerful representation of America's suffering own, then it is he who has been hit with a 7-mile-long hunk of rock. *1/2 from ****",Deep Impact
12,wes-connors,The Sky Is Falling!,6,10 July 2014,"In Richmond, Virginia, starry-eyed teenager Elijah Wood (as Leo Biederman) notices something strange during an astronomy assignment. It's a star-like object – but this one appears where no star is known to exist. He sends a picture of the shiny object to a professional in Tucson, Arizona. After punching some information into a computer, the astronomer (Charles Martin Smith) seems to know exactly what Mr. Wood's object is and where it's headed – regrettably, his reaction shows the news is not good. Since everyone else in the huge observatory-type building has the day off, the information is put on a floppy disc to be transported on the road. Unfortunately, it is hit by a redneck truck driver gulping caffeinated soda while smoking an elusive cigarette...One year later, our heroine appears – she is pretty blonde MSNBC reporter Tea Leoni (s Jenny Lerner). How an attractive blonde newsreader is working for MSNBC instead of FOX News is unexplained. Either her skirts aren't short enough, or it's a sign of The Apocalypse. Also note, the President of the United States is played by Morgan Freeman (as Tom Beck). This could be another sign. When a member of Mr. Freeman's cabinet resigns to spend more time with his family, Ms. Leoni smells an extra-marital affair. That's logical, but incorrect. Immediately, the President finds out Leoni is investigating. FBI agents decide to contact Leoni in the safest way possible – they get in four cars and start ramming her car on what looks like a freeway overpass or bridge...Leoni and Freeman meet in what looks like the White House kitchen. The President wants Leoni to wait before reporting her scoop; in return, he will allow the MSNBC reporter to ask the first question at an upcoming news conference. It sounds like a fair deal. This is when we learn ""Deep Impact"" involves an approaching comet which is, of course, on a collision course with Earth. Naturally, we want to divert the comet's path, lest it destroy all life on Earth. Considering the importance of success, it is decided to hit the comet in the safest way possible. Shooting at the comet from Earth is too risky, so a different mission is planned – a team of astronauts is scheduled to board a spaceship, land on the comet, plant some nuclear bombs and KA-BOOM...The ""Messiah"" mission team is headed by retired astronaut Robert Duvall (as Spurgeon Tanner), who once walked on Earth's Moon. Before blasting off into space, the younger astronauts go out for a few drinks at the local bar. The crew snubs Mr. Duvall, but he coincidently has gone to the same bar for a drink. Apparently, this is a common way to prepare for space travel. Duvall joins the younger group for some bar-room bonding. It's good that Duvall is now respected by the other astronauts because he is to be the pilot and captain of their mission. Duvall helms the mission with a steady hand. He says ""Roger that!"" and manages to calm down the obligatory squirrelly Russian. You'll have to watch for yourself, to see if the ""Messiah"" saves everyone...Don't attempt to guess the ending of ""Deep Impact"" from what is written above. Something happens during the running time to open up other options. Now, in the event the comet arrives on schedule, President Freeman and the US have a plan for survival. A cavern shelter has been built in Missouri – it will hold seeds, one million humans (800,000 to be chosen by lottery) and pairs of animals. Yes, it's called ""Noah's Ark"". How to manage this with Doomsday around the corner becomes amusing. The silliest part of the story is the plot involving young Wood, the kid who discovered the comet. Told by a classmate, ""You're gonna have sex a lot more now than anyone else in your class!"" due to his fame, Wood takes giant step toward making that come true...Not only does Wood figure out a way to have safe (off-screen) sex, he can hop on his bicycle (and, later, motorcycle) and get anywhere he wants in under two minutes. Now, that's talent. Also, it doesn't matter where you are among millions of frantic people, all trying to travel on thousands of congested highways – Wood will find you. If there ever is a real Doomsday, your best route to safety would be to find and stick close to Elijah Wood. That being said, lucky Leelee Sobieski (as Sarah Hotchner) does well in her role. It should also be mentioned that Freeman, like the aforementioned Duvall helps by just being there. Freeman is simply good in everything, always delivering his lines and faces to the best possible effect – no matter what the character or script...Least favorite story goes to Leoni's distressed reporter, despite skillful support from parents played by acting veterans Vanessa Redgrave and Maximilian Schell. Of the other players and plots, Duvall and his crew wind up being best – once they blast off, you're on board with their mission. This is where director Mimi Leder really scores, as sketchy characters in the intimate setting really engage you more than the manipulative others. The real humanity is with Duvall's crew, and it peaks with an emotional scene involving wounded officer Ron Eldard (as Oren Monash) and his wife (Jennifer Jostyn). The special effects are impressive enough, and Dietrich Lohmann's photography looks great. This was Mr. Lohmann's last film assignment, and he deservedly receives a dedication.****** Deep Impact (5/7/98) Mimi Leder ~ Tea Leoni, Elijah Wood, Robert Duvall, Morgan Freeman",Deep Impact

14,sunwarrior13,Surprisingly Great Science Fiction Movie,10,8 November 2011,"Deep Impact is a science-fiction disaster-drama film.It was directed by Mimi Leder and stars Elijah Wood, Téa Leoni, Morgan Freeman,Leelee Sobieski,Vannesa Redgrave and Robert Duvall. The plot describes the attempts to prepare for and destroy a 7-mile wide comet, which is expected to collide with the Earth and cause a mass extinction.Deep Impact presents ambitious MSNBC reporter Jenny Lerner,who stumbles onto the story, prompting a White House press conference. United States President Beck announces the government's solution: a team of astronauts will travel to the comet and destroy it. The team leader aboard the spaceship Messiah is Spurgeon Tanner, who was once the last man to walk on the moon. However, the mission fails, splitting off a chunk of the comet, now due to land in the Atlantic with the impact sending a 350- foot tidal wave flooding 650 miles inland, destroying New York and other cities. The larger part of the comet, hitting in Canada, will trigger an E.L.E. (Extinction Level Event), not unlike a ""nuclear winter"" as dust clouds block out the sun and bring life to an end. President Beck reveals Plan B: a cavernous underground retreat constructed to hold one million Americans, with most to be selected through a national lottery. Since teenage amateur astronomer Leo Biederman discovered the comet, his family gets a pass to enter the cave, but his girlfriend Sarah and her parents will be left behind. Meanwhile, still in space, Spurgeon Tanner devises a plan for a kamikaze-styled operation that could possibly save the Earth.Deep Impact is surprisingly good as it is a disaster film that relies mainly on a good story and the characters involved rather than astounding visuals and special effects.It was engaging and interesting from beginning to end.Also,it tries to provide a dramatization of the emotions felt by different people upon knowing that the world may end soon.Special mention should also be given to the brilliant performance of the cast involved in the film.Overall,Deep Impact is a great MUST-SEE science fiction movie.",Deep Impact

16,hitchcockthelegend,Cities fall but they are rebuilt. Heroes die but they are remembered.,5,30 May 2009,"I gigantic comet is heading towards Earth, if it hits then life as we know it is doomed. Enter the president of the United States who launches a desperate plan to have NASA's finest blow up the comet before it gets here. In the meantime, all on the Earth prepare for the worst case scenario.Deep Impact was always going to be a tough sell to the movie watching world. In spite of its best intentions to blend epic disaster with a great big human heart, Deep Impact neither appeased the sci-fi crowd or fulfilled the effects hungry popcorn brigade's gargantuan appetites. ""Too talky"" said one side of the cinema, ""that's just ridiculous"" said the other, ""hey isn't this supposed to be a corny disaster film"" asked the balcony, here in lays the problem. Director Mimi Leder and her writing team of Bruce Rubin and Michael Tolkin are guilty of not taking a side from which to launch their picture out of the mundane atmosphere. Or perhaps maybe, it was just a bold gamble that didn't pay off? but i'm sure nobody involved in the picture would have wanted the viewers to be hankering for the effects laden finale, and that's what happens, ultimately it's the so-so carnage that most end up remembering. Worst still is that outside of Téa Leoni's news lady central character, Jenny Lerner, no characters are fully formed to make us even care if they and the Earth actually survives. Which in a film pro porting to be an intimate study of relationships and how mankind copes with impending doom, is nearly unforgivable.It's odd that in the same year as Bruce Willis and Michael Bay firmly went for the popcorn crowd with Armageddon, that Deep Impact was offered up as the thinking mans opposite side of the coin. Yet the reality is that Deep Impact got confused about its worth, and sadly falls some way short of being the fine movie that it obviously looked like being down on the page. A good cast is wasted and a brave move is sadly unrealised. 5/10 because deep down it does in fact pose some rather interesting questions, questions that at least make Deep Impact worth a revisit on a quiet and boring Sunday evening by the fire, but it's definitely a case of so near and yet so far far away.",Deep Impact

Perhaps the best example is DEEP IMPACT and Armageddon which feature a giant comet going to collide with planet Earth . I should point out though that both movies were pitched to different audiences . Armageddon is marketed to the unthinking macho American audience . It stars Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck , is directed by Michael Bay and is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer so unsurprisingly it's a pile of expensive effects laden bubblegum . DEEP IMPACT came out a couple of months previously and is by far the better movie . However it is flawed I think the problem with DEEP IMPACT is that it's probably produced to appeal to women . The main protagonist is female and there's several sub plots involving family issues ( "" Gee Mom I hope the end of the world doesn't ruin my weekend "" ) , oh and a bit of romance too . This doesn't ruin the movie but I did find the heroine's trembling lip and tears in her eyes in every emotional scene grating and the movie does lapse into terrible mawkishness several times . I also found the concept of a "" lottery draw "" to send people into deep bunkers where they have a chance of surviving the apocalypse unconvincing . Yeah right I sure the American president is going to give trailer trash and red necks to chance to come live with him . America might be a classless society but it's not that classless and considering Bill Clinton ( Often described as "" America's first black president ) was in the White House at the time do we think that either men or ugly women would have a chance of being selected ? About as much chance as Bill inviting Hilary into the bunker I imagine There are a few good points about the movie that stops it becoming an overproduced disease of the week movie . One thing is the cast , Armageddon had Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck while DEEP IMPACT has Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall . Do I have to spell out what movie has the better cast ? Okay DEEP IMPACT isn't a career highpoint for either actor but they do bring serious class to the production and there's lots of familiar faces on screen like Frodo Baggins and the bad guy from MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2 . The special effects are very good and there is one absolutely superb scene on a highway where thousands of bickering people are in gridlock , they slowly stop arguing and fighting amongst themselves as they look up and see the meteor pass overhead . On paper this scene might have seemed ineffective but on screen it's breath taking with a deep emotional impactSo in my humble opinion DEEP IMPACT is the better of the two movies and is probably the best comet/meteor movie ever made . It is flawed and could have been better especially if the producers cut out of the chick flick stuff but a good cast and some good scenes stop it from being worse than it could have been",Deep Impact

Yes there would be a Tidal Wave of Tears, but that is not a good thing in a Disaster Movie, at least not to the point of drowning everything else in a Sea of choke you up Sentimentalism.Add to that the Catatonic Lead Actress that seems Depressed even before she knows that an Extinction Level Event is imminent. When She gets on TV, this Investigative Reporter is so full of Monotone, with Zero Screen Presence and Believability, it looks like this is some sort of Alternative Reality and maybe it is a Zombie takeover and the Comet is a Cover Story.This is a Catastrophic Failure of a Film that is Melancholic and Over Ripe. It Sacrifices Special Effects and the usual type of Action in this sort of thing, for Spielberg type, gut wrenching Emotionalism. There are too many Heart Breaking Goodbyes, one Child or Baby more than it needs and more time is spent on Family Breakup than the World breaking up.Maybe not as tedious as, say, reading Moby Dick (how many actually have?) but if a Big White Comet ever comes close to hitting Earth, no worries, just propel a Nuclear Harpoon straight at it while a lot of nice Suburban Folks weep endlessly, and that will be a Modern Epic Tale to tell.

Téa Leoni is a television journalist assigned to investigate the resignation of a senior US Government official (James Cromwell) during which she discovers that a comet discovered a year earlier is on a collision course with Earth. President Morgan Freeman convinces her to hold off on broadcasting the story whilst they finalise their contingency plan - a joint Russo-American space craft called the ""Messiah"" charged with a mission to divert this monstrous chunk of rock from it's path of destruction. Robert Duvall manages to conjure up some sort of gravitas as the navigator of the ship but otherwise a good cast - on paper - including Maximillian Schell, Jon Favreau, a very young Dougray Scott and Vanessa Redgrave as her mother, all really fail to make any, well, impact!

20,Boba_Fett1138,Uneven movie,6,12 July 2003,"The movie mostly consists out of over dramatized moments, but between those over dramatized moments there are also some real emotional scene's that do work which makes the movie very uneven.The cast is full with stars. Most of them were already famous at the time, others were not (such as Elijah Wood and Dougray Scott) but the amount of stars isn't an overkill (such as is the case in A Bridge too Far). However, most of the characters are not interesting enough and it makes me wonder why we are following them throughout the movie. Most of the dozens of story lines seems to come straight out of a soap series. Maybe the movie would have been better to watch if the story had focused on others and lesser characters. Another thing that disturbs me is that almost none of the characters are busy with surviving, all they seem to care about are their personal problems and feelings, surviving is not important. Some of those scene's work but most of them don't.The cast gives overall excellent performances. I'll especially mention Robert Duvall.Another thing that deserves to be mentioned is the music by James Horner. Even though most of it is a copy from his older work (what else is new...), it fits the movie well.Perhaps if you like soaps you'll appreciate this movie better then I do.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Deep Impact
21,neil-476,The less gung-ho version,7,17 August 2010,"You can always tell when someone's been touting a good idea round Hollywood - you get two (or more) versions of the same story hitting the multiplexes the following summer. Clearly, 1997 saw someone doing the rounds with ""Asteroid due to strike the Earth - mission sent into space to destroy it - mission succeeds - only major mayhem on Earth, not total destruction."" Armageddon concentrated on the mission to destroy the asteroid and how heroic they were (by gum, that Bruce Willis, what a hero!). Deep Impact, on the other hand, concentrated on the stories of the people remaining on Earth to face the worst. In that respect, it became standard disaster movie soap material - who is going to survive, who isn't, who is going to sacrifice themselves so that someone else might survive, who has a damaged relationship which is going to be repaired just in time...I understand the principle - you need to identify with people so that the disastrous happenings carry some emotional weight. My main criticism with this movie is that there was a bit too much soapy stuff, and rather too little mayhem. When it came it was very well done, but there wasn't very much of it.Oh well, roll on the next disaster (or Roland Emmerich's 2012 as I like to call it).",Deep Impact

He then informs his teacher who sends it to an observatory for their opinion. At the observatory ""Dr. Martin Wolf"" (Charles Martin Smith) who then focuses in on the object and discovers that it is a undiscovered comet-and even more alarming is that it is headed directly for the earth! Naturally, his first concern is to tell the government about this but as he is racing to get his information to a nearby town he is killed in a car collision. The scene then shifts to almost a year afterward when a television journalist by the name of ""Jenny Lerner"" (Tea Leoni) uncovers some news about the sudden resignation of the Secretary of the Treasury, ""Alan Rittenhouse"" (James Cromwell). Initially suspecting that his resignation had to do with an affair he was supposedly having she is shocked when the President of the United States, ""Tom Beck"" (Morgan Freeman) breaks the news of the impending collision to her in front of a nationally televised audience. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting film which took a familiar plot and tried to incorporate a more human feel to the situation. It succeeded in some parts but not necessarily all of them with the inclusion of the scene involving Leo Biederman toward the end being one in particular. Regardless, while this may not have been an outstanding apocalyptic type of film, it was better than a number of others and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",Deep Impact

In a speech the President announces the comet and that it can destroy New York City and more. A team is sent into space to destroy it but only succeed in dividing it in half. We are bludgeoned with several of these idiotic disaster films every year and they are all pretty much structured similar to this one. Fine production, which is about the only element of compliment but the screenplay is hardly interesting. Director Mimi Leder brings forth the emotional aspect otherwise she is creating a film that is every bit as dumb as her previous film The Peacemaker. The cast is at odds with cardboard characters that they cannot resurrect. Robert Duvall plays a veteran astronaut who reads a book to a fellow passenger because it is more interesting than the script. Morgan Freeman plays the President who makes big speeches regarding hope and despair. Elijah Wood tries to warn ignorant people as well as out speed a tidal wave on a bike. Tea Leoni is featured to patch things up with her father and perhaps she should begin with an apology for involving him in such a shitty screenplay. The result is another disaster movie that makes no impact let alone deep. Score: 3 / 10",Deep Impact

Where as Armageddon released in the same year is more for guys this one was for the ladies.  And boy do ladies like boring movies where there is a lot of failure and tragedy.  The movie even seems to be kind of gray and depressing for the most part and did I mention boring.  Two comets are heading for earth so everyone seemingly prepares to die.  There is a ship sent up to stop it, but their heart doesn't really seem in it, and I do believe it would be impossible to catch up with and match speeds with a comet anyway suffice to say they do get on, but mess up.  They hold a lottery to see who can live in an underground shelter and a woman who has nothing, but her career has to go hang out with dad and just waits it out so she can die.

For one, President Beck's lost the over 50 vote. He's also lost the votes of the millions who missed out in the lottery, big time. No way President Beck would even win the party's nomination.

Each and Every Impotant Character has a proper ark. The film begins with a bang, and never loses it's momentum. The final 30-35 minutes are the mainstay of the film. Those portions are highly, highly engaging & emotional. Mimi Leder's Direction is Outstanding! A Highly Talented Filmmaker! Each and Every Actor excels in 'Deep Impact', as each gets something great to do. Téa Leoni is phenomenal. Elijah Wood is excellent. Morgan Freeman as The President of the United States, is subdued.

Deep Impact premiered two months before the summer end of the world blockbuster Armageddon (1998) that was released for Independence Day holiday. Even though Deep Impact had a bigger opening weekend, Armageddon started slower but then caught fire. What Deep Impact presented to the audience as a more family oriented, high-minded action adventure focused not so much on the special effects but on the smaller but intimate stories and Morgan Freeman's riveting performance as the President of the United States. For those people interested in the more somber and realistic presentation of catastrophe, Deep Impact has the dialogue and a few gigantic big moments whereas Armageddon relies heavily on repeated instances of high adventure drama like a roller coaster almost out of control.",Deep Impact
31,ironhorse_iv,"I don't know about everybody else, but this disaster movie left a deep impact in me. I kinda like this film.",6,24 January 2019,"In 1998, two disaster movie involving celestial object collision were released, during the same summer. One of them, was director Michael Bay's fast, over the top, explosive action blockbuster 'Armageddon', while the other is a lot slowly, but emotional driven, science accurate motion picture directed by Mimi Leder called 'Deep Impact'. While, it's true that Bay's flick fared better at the box office, as it was a lot more fun to watch than this movie. One thing that this Paramount Pictures film has over its rival, Touchstone Pictures flick, is that, its story is better written. This movie is a drama, first and foremost. Unlike Bay's version, these people are not one-dimensional cartoony figures, but complex, human beings. This movie really does lets you connect emotionally with the characters for nearly a full year, before the comet's impending arrival. That's plenty of time to flesh out their stories within 121 minute runtime. Screenwriters, Bruce Joel Rubin and Michael Tolkin did a hell of a job, with that, working within the deadline pace. It made for, some quite emotional somber scenes, like journalist Jenny Lerner (Téa Leoni) having to learn to deal with her loving mother, Robin (Vanessa Redgrave)'s decision to end her life & her estranged father, Jason (Maximilian Schell) wiliness to connect with her, before the impact. Another key moment is when teenaged amateur astronomer Leo Biederman (Eljiah Wood) has to tries to save his high school girlfriend, Sarah Hotchner (Leelee Sobieski)'s family, only to find out, that he might not be able too. Then, there is the story of the astronauts sent out to stop the comet including Captain Spurgeon ""Fish"" Tanner (Robert Duvall) having to question to risk it all in order to save as much people, as possible. All of these are complex dilemmas that the movie challenge us with; by inviting the audience to experience it from a real-world perspective without sugar coating too much. It's a lot heavier, film & every performer did a hell of a job, showing that. Still, I can understand, why some people might not like this movie. It's not the escapism brainless popcorn flick that they wish, it can be. However, I found this approach to cinema, more engaging than playing it safe by dumbing the stakes for fast action. I like that this movie took some risk. While, it's true that some of the characters are not as interesting as others & they do not make the best rational decisions when face under high stress situations. The people here, are lightyears more tolerable above the characters that 'Armageddon' gives us. Another thing that the movie does, that 'Armageddon' doesn't do, is give us a brief glimpse into the kinds of chaos, pandemonium and breakdown in social order that would arise during a potential world ending catastrophe. However, I wish, they would focus a little more heavily on it. We told that rioting and looting is taking place in major cities in the months before the comet's arrival & the president, Tom Beck (Morgan Freeman) declared martial law. Yet, there are people calmly going about their business in downtown cities like New York City, even though the President has warned that the Eastern seaboard is about to be destroyed by a tidal wave. Shouldn't that metropolis, be a ghost town? They nearly had half of year to prepare for this, yet, it's only, when the comet is coming down, that people start to evacuate and panic. It come across as very jarring! At least, the movie should had done, a better job, establishing that there was a nationwide travel ban in effect. After all, Beck's character is pretty much, just that, an exposition dumping ground, both in on world storytelling and scientific jargon. While, most of the science that Beck talks about in the film is somewhat accurate. There were some things that he said that was really hard to believe. To start with, blowing the comet up with nukes might be a very bad thing to do. Even if you destroy the large object into smaller pieces, all of that energy is still going to directly effect, Earth, across the entire facing side of the atmosphere rather than one punching through into the ground. At a bare minimum, the atmospheric heating from that much material would burned North America & South America to a crisp & blinded anybody who looks at the object's descent if you can even had time to see it. Regardless of what would happen, the film in real-life, would not have a happy ending. Not even, a bittersweet climax with this choice. Instead it would probably be better to push the comet with a ground-based laser system, but that technology is not yet, ready, even today, nor in 1990s standards. Regardless, in real-life, years long deflection efforts like the one such in this movie is nearly impossible, because unlike asteroids, which are much easier to detect and track. Comets spend the vast majority of their lives out in the dark depths of the outer solar system, giving astronomers far fewer chances to spot them before they may come through our neighborhood. Nevertheless of the few science errors, the film was good enough for scientists like Neil deGrasse Tyson to overlook them for entertaining value. As for the visual and special CGI effects, it was fine for the time. Parts of them, hasn't aged well, but it still look realistic enough to pass by. As for the melodramatic soundtrack from composer, James Horner. It was beautifully done. It's easy listening. It just sad, that parts of it, sounds like it was reused in the 1997's film, 'Titanic' OST in tone and timbre. Regardless, in the end, 'Deep Impact' is a motion picture worth checking out. Like a comet heading toward Earth, it will be a massive hit with you. Trust me, it's worth the watch.",Deep Impact
32,The-Sarkologist,Shallow and pointless,3,23 December 2011,"My main comment about this movie is that there is a lot of emotion used to conceal a thin plot. It is a disaster movie, nothing more, nothing less, with a lot of special effects. It is a movie, like Independence Day, that you go and see to watch New York get completely smashed. Generally it is not really worth the money to go and see except for watching the special effects on the big screen.The movie begins with a young boy, who happens to be a genius, discovering a comet heading towards Earth. A report is sent to a professional astronomer who dashes off to warn everybody but is killed in a car accident. This car accident adds absolutely nothing to the plot except to show a car crash scene. The whole thing is covered up but something is revealed when the vice president resigns because of allegations regarding a girl named Ellie. A reporter is put on the case and soon learns that this Ellie is a little more important than simply a sex scandal in the White House. Actually it deals with what is termed as an extinction level event.There are three stories running through this movie, as tends to happen with such movies as they are too shallow to hold a single plot. There is the kid who discovered the comet and his relationship with the girl. This is probably to appeal to the teenagers, and there is the reporter (Tia Leoni) and her desire to become an anchor and her relationship with her mother and father in light of the end of the world. Then there are the astronauts who are on a mission to stop the comet.A lot of people claim that the movie's examination of the end of the world is what makes it good and they believe that this is what will happen. I am somewhat sceptical because the end of the world will be a sudden thing, we won't see it coming and when it does we will be powerless to stop it. In Deep Impact, they were able to save the world, but in reality we cannot, because it will involve fighting God and that we cannot do. Movies like Deep Impact try to create a hope that does not exist. We want hope that we can survive without God but the truth is we cannot. The American President will not save us nor will a bunch of cowboy astronauts. The only person who can save us is Christ, and all we can do is to trust him.",Deep Impact
33,filipemanuelneto,A disaster film with feelings.,6,5 February 2017,"This film tackles the end of the world in the traditional American perspective: a newly discovered comet threatens to destroy the planet and the US leads the crusade to eliminate the threat. Despite the obvious American imperialist propaganda implied here, the film is good, especially for those who enjoy catastrophe movies. His story bears a strong resemblance to ""Armageddon"" and some scenes remind us of ""Independence Day"", but there are big differences between these three films. One of the most notable is that this film gives more attention to the characters than to the tragic events. Unfortunately, this makes it a lot slower and monotonous than we might at first glance. There are people who see it as good, others want more action and they will get a little frustrated. I, in particular, have been able to appreciate this more leisurely way, although some scenes are perfectly expendable. The special effects have been quite well made and are grandiose, although they seem a little unbelievable.The characters have been very well developed, much better than most of the films of this genre, which helps a lot to catch the attention of the public. Elijah Wood and Leelee Sobieski can be particularly touching and, despite their young ages, get a good chemistry together. Even so, there are times when they exaggerated in sentimentality. The rest of the cast (where we can see experienced actors like Robert Duvall, Vanessa Redgrave or Morgan Freeman) has a much more contained and uninteresting record, which is a little surprising. Still, Freeman and Duvall have always been a little better than the rest of their peers, though their characters are relatively minor in the story (we may even think that the talent of the actors has been misused).

38,barnabyrudge,"The world faces destruction from an asteroid  a serious look at this concept, undone by an absurdly hopeful ending.",6,25 March 2007,"1998 saw two films that explored the ""asteroid-on-course-to-blow-up-the-world"" storyline. One was Michael Bay's preposterous macho action movie Armageddon, the other was Mimi Leder's more serious Deep Impact. The idea was first explored in a very bad late '70s flick entitled Meteor (a Sean Connery film that even Sean Connery fans tend not to remember!) Of all the films to use this admittedly terrifying storyline, I think Deep Impact is probably the best. That's not to say it is, in itself, a great film  merely that it is preferable to the others. Earth's peril in the event of a catastrophic asteroid strike is a terrific concept but one that has never quite been given the treatment it deserves.Young astronomy enthusiast Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood) discovers an uncharted object in space. When his discovery is checked out further, it is discovered that he has sighted a gigantic asteroid on a collision course with Earth! The terrifying news is kept from the public to begin with while various scientists and world governments plan their next move. But ambitious TV news-woman Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni) gets wind of the plot and confronts the American president Tom Beck (Morgan Freeman) about it. Shortly afterwards, Beck allows the news to go public  a stunned worldwide audience looks on as he announces the countdown to global extinction. The only hope is if a team of American and Russian astronauts led by the experienced Spurgeon Tanner (Robert Duvall) can land on the asteroid and detonate a nuclear device capable of destroying or diverting it. This dangerous mission becomes mankind's final hope of survival. And Jenny Lerner finds herself the news celebrity covering the most important story in the history of the world, as it is she who reports on the space shuttle Messiah's rendezvous with the asteroid. The unthinkable happens - the mission fails, with the nuclear explosion merely splitting the asteroid into two pieces, both still on course to hit the Earth. As time ticks on, everyone braces themselves for the end.There are some flaws with Deep Impact, of that there can be no argument. The characters on Earth who face up to their inevitable doom are a somewhat dull bunch, and their assorted personal dramas hardly make for engrossing viewing. But the film does become engrossing in certain other aspects  the space mission itself is very interesting, and tries mostly to be believable and serious (very different indeed from the mission envisaged in Armageddon). Also, the decisions made by Morgan Freeman's president are very thought-provoking, especially the concept of a series of caves being prepared so that a handful of humans can ""go underground"" for several years, and hopefully one day repopulate the planet. Another flaw with the film is that it falls foul of Hollywood's insistence on optimistic endings. Deep Impact looks set to provide that rarest of commodities - a daringly bleak, hopeless and depressing climax. But at the last moment, phony sentimentality and improbable hope take centre stage, as the film swerves off into the realms of feel-good fantasy. At least we get a glimpse of the scale of destruction an asteroid might leave (the smaller of the chunks does strike Earth, and wipes out the Eastern seaboard of America in a spectacular and quite believable sequence). But this film so nearly had the nerve to go all the way, only for it to wimp-out at the end. Still, an interesting and well-assembled film on many levels.",Deep Impact
39,dwpollar,Well done disaster thriller movie with a heart...,7,22 April 2009,"Well done disaster thriller movie with a heart. The real plus for this movie is the idea of sacrifice displayed throughout different points in the movie.

The info is passed onto a scientist who is killed but somehow gets the information to the authorities and they start preparing for what needs to be done and the consequences if it doesn't work. They decide to send a group of astronauts out to blow it up and send it off course so it won't hit the Earth.

She becomes anchorwoman and we also get to find out bits and pieces about her life as the movie goes on. Another storyline that is kind of wacky is about an underground tunnel-like lair that the U.S. build to house important people and also those who win spots in a lottery. This part of the plot is a little lame but the heart of the story is really still intact. Overall this movie is an enjoyable and learning experience about the positive impact on humankind when they are put under these type of circumstances. This is really where the movie shines despite some of the silly plot twists and this is why I recommend this drama/thriller about the possible annihilation of mankind. I'll let you watch the movie to find out what really happens.",Deep Impact
40,davispittman,Pretty entertaining disaster movie,7,28 March 2017,"Deep Impact was released in the time of the disaster movie frenzy. In 1996 we had Independence Day, then in 1998 we were brought this and also Armageddon. Not that that's a bad thing because I'm a big fan of Independence Day and of this film. First of all, I really liked the cast and their acting. Tea leoni, Morgan freeman, Robert Duvall, Elijah wood, and Leelee all do really well with their roles. For me, this was leoni's film, out of all the actors, I think she outshined them all. She really showed her dramatic acting chops. Freeman was very good as the president, he just is a perfect actor for a powerful role. And Duvall fit his retiree astronaut role well, he was just a good fit for it. The writing isn't just all cheesy and phoned in clichés, often times that can happen in disaster movies because they just wanna mainly focus on the visual effects aspect of the film. But I didn't think that was the case here. I really loved the dialogue between leoni and her parents (Redgrave and Schell). Especially with her father, the movie really focuses on their relationship, just like it focuses on wood and Sorbeski's. And the film did both story lines justice. The visual effects are impressive, especially for 1998, not quite to the level of Independence Day in my opinion, but still pretty well done. I enjoyed this trilling movie and I know you will too. 8/10.",Deep Impact
41,gcd70,Special Effects Show with Human Element,7,5 January 2010,"""Deep Impact"" immediately conjures up visions of another special effects fest, yet although the visuals of this disaster film are great, this is not the true focus of the film.Unlike ""Independence Day"", which definitely falls into the above category (with an awful plot line added ""post mortem""), ""Deep Impact"" centres around the human effect of an ""Extinction Level Event"", or to be blunt, a huge meteor on a crash course with earth. We see much here of how people will react in a life or death situation, and at times it is greatly moving. Yet, the film is full of highly unlikely scenarios, but I guess Hollywood now expects audiences to overlook plot contrivances.As I've said, the movie looks, and sounds, fantastic, and a strong cast lend their support. Tea Leonie surprises in a most convincing role as the young journo who stumbles across the story of a lifetime. Robert Duvall, the ever-reliable, plays experienced astronaut Spurgeon Tanner, Vanessa Redgrave and Maximillian Schell are the estranged parents of young Jenny (Leonie), and Morgan Freeman fills the shoes of the President of the United States.

Armageddon focuses on the Bay-isms, America prevails over everything, big explosions, bravado and a lot of pseudo teenage angst and hormones. Deep Impact goes a different direction, instead choosing to focus on a harsher reality, one where the world isn't prepared this kind of disaster and all our efforts fail, leaving us to face a grim reality as society begins to eat itself.It's this social psychology element that I really enjoy about this one, the sense of realism. If it happened, we might fail and in that event things would go crazy south, something that has proven itself throughout the disaster that has been 2020. The fact that this decides to take the disaster movie concept and have the world fail is endlessly interesting to me.Weirdly, as much as I prefer this to Armageddon, the fact that they're so different makes them good for different things. Deep Impact is good for those times when you want something serious and a little dour whereas Armageddon is more fitting of that craving for a big dumb action flick. I'll stick with Deep Impact because I like the social implications and discussion presented here and Armageddon kinda drives me nuts. If you've missed this one, it's absolutely worth checking out.",Deep Impact

A journalist (Leoni) learns what's happening and what the government is doing about it.

Yet they do it again and again. it's almost as if the studios are all spying on each other and strive to outdo one another. Red Mars and Mission to Mars are one example, and so, of course is Armageddon and Deep Impact.Why is it irritating? Because inevitably, one film is better than the other and the remaining movie seemingly automatically gets hammered as rubbish by critics. Here, Deep Impact was the loser.It's an OK film, providing you're not looking too deeply at the content. As others have mentioned, there are things which are a bit silly. For instance, if the scenario in Deep Impact ever came to pass, I seriously doubt the President would go on TV and basically tell people they're all going to die. Way to go Pres! You just created the world's largest (and shortest-lived) anarchy. It's not enough that people are going to be killed en-masse. No, you have to have a good old fashioned dose of lawlessness, with raping and pillaging beforehand.And what was with the comet's stately procession across the sky? These things travel at kilometres per second, not a few hundred miles per hour. This was moving about like a distant airliner, not something travelling at hypersonic-plus velocities. Where was the shock-wave it would have generated even before it hit?A silly film, just like Armageddon. But Armageddon was meant to be pure entertainment.

49,screenman,Another Wash-Out.,5,31 December 2008,"The best entertainment value of a disaster movie is the disaster itself. Now that may seem like a statement of the obvious, yet directors consistently forget. 'Deep Impact' had the potential to be an 'intelligent' interpretation of a cometary impact upon Earth. Unlike the tongue-in-cheek space-hokum that starred Bruce Willis, it could have been the real McCoy. All the right elements were there. The science, the terminology, and the blockbuster special-effects. There was a sly, almost sinister build-up, with 'men in black' kidnapping a troublesome nosey-parker (female) journalist, and confusion over what 'ELE' actually meant. It had shades of 'Pelican Brief', and handled more vigorously could really have emphasised the conspiracy of silence. As the plot moved forward and the truth became clear, tension built extremely well. There was some fine acting at times, with Robert Duvall giving one of his best and most understated performances ever. But the directors just couldn't do the do. They had to turn it into a schmaltz-fest. They had to cast a kid as the hero. There had to be innumerable complex and fractured relationships with endless tearful soul-searching and chest-bearing. On and on it went. By the time the first piece of debris arrived it was almost incidental to the 90 minutes of soap-opera that preceded it. Every time there was an opportunity to ratchet-up tension, the directors copped-out and threw us back into the deep-end of maudlin schmaltz. Even the special-effects were interrupted so that we could witness a last goodbye, a final tear. And then there was the unexplained technical incongruity. Why would they risk the safety of the spacecraft by approaching the comet through its tail? Just one piece of ejecta striking the vessel would have ended the mission there and then. Why did the demolition crew walk about half a mile from the vessel in order to place the bomb? Why not do it under the ship and save themselves a lengthy walk, and also have the shadow of the ship over the top of them to protect them from the rising sun if they got delayed? Why bother returning to Earth when it's gonna be destroyed anyway? The OBVIOUS thing was a suicide attack on the comet. It was a no-brainer.Every time Hollwood makes a disaster epic, it's the same old story. The thing is served up as a basically decent meal, only to be drowned in emotional gravy. It happened at 'Jurassic Park'; it happened in 'The Day After Tomorrow'. It happened in the lamentable British 'Flood'.It seems to me that what has occurred in modern cinema is a blurring of what constitutes an 'adult' and a 'juvenile' movie. In order to get as many bums on seats and therefore as many bucks in the bank; the movie is released with the most child-friendly certification possible (this has a '12' rating). That way families can go and watch it, instead of just adults (who might otherwise not even bother turning-out as it will be available for rental within a few weeks). As a result, the 'adult' theme is dumbed-down in order that it can appeal to kids - hence the child-hero. But what these mogul-dummies don't seem to realise is that that's exactly why adults WON'T bother going to the cinema by themselves any more. Who wants to watch a 2-hour juvenile movie to see 5-minutes of adult special-effects?I got this movie as a 'special edition' from the local supermarket bran-tub. It was £3, and that was quite enough. I've watched it once. If it had been an adult movie I'd have awarded it 8-stars and watched it several times by now. 'When Worlds Collide', is a much more intelligent piece of theatre, despite dating from 1951. The director had the brains to keep the story moving, and not get bogged-down in endless personal dramas; there was enough and that was all. It's much more watchable despite the primitive special effects.Here's the blurb: ""Oceans Rise, Cities Fall, Hope Survives"". Yeah - and clichés never end.",Deep Impact

Paradox? Yes. True? Yes. Both films have the an almost similar plot outline in which a comet is headed towards earth yet the films are completely different on the tone of the two films, the characters, and the action.Deep Impact is a drama and Armageddon is an action film but I must say that Deep Impact is a better film than Armageddon. Deep Impact is a perfect title of the film. Not only does it mean that the comet will collide to the earth but it is also a metaphor of how emotionally driven the characters are in the film.There's not as much action as Armageddon.

One of the most memorable ones were: 1-when the president (Morgan Freeman) was talking about the size and the speed of the waves, and Elijah Wood in the next scene is running of the waves in a motorcycle! How a motorcycle can be faster than a wave in the speed of the sound? 2-The traffic jam is also exaggerated, because everybody knew what was going to happen many months before the Impact really happened. 3- In the last scene, when they are rebuilding the White House before making houses,hospitals and really important stuff for people's health.''Armageddon'' is much more interesting than ''Deep Impact''.

Thanks to Mojo Mag video on YouTube, I finally learned about this movie and finally saw it. Well, what can I say? 1. The movie was unjustly overshadowed by Armageddon, although both presented stellar casts and superb video effects. Deep Impact is by no means worse or weaker, and sometimes even better than that one in means of delivery or efficiency. 2. The cast is excellent - Tea Leony, Elihah Wood, Morgan Freeman, Leelee Sobesky, Vanessa Redgrave and my personal favorite Robert Duvall are among the many greats filmed here. And yes, there is a great Russian actor Aleksandr Baluev as a Russian space ace, and he does speak good enough English and very clear unaccented Russian. 3. The plot is nothing new, it is a disaster movie, and still, it looks nice, as it dwells more on human feelings, personal tragedies and sorrow than on the disaster itself. 4. Special effects are good, very good for 1998, and they are utterly convincing, as well as decent and thrilling. 5. The theme of personal sacrifice is very strong here, and it works well. 6. Well, why 7 out f 10? There are weaker, hammy, cheesy, overly sentimental moments in here, unnecessary teary scenes and prolonged silent scenes.

54,tomsview,Goes deeper,8,6 June 2014,"James Horner, the composer of the score for ""Deep Impact"", has often been accused of paying too much homage to other composers, but he can do a heroic anthem to stand with the best of them. The music for ""Deep Impact"" is almost another star of the film.However, music is just one of the things this film has going for it. It has believable characters that are not totally overwhelmed by the epic nature of the story or scale of the production.The film begins as scientists discover a comet on a collision course with Earth. A TV reporter, Jenny Lerner (Téa Leoni), inadvertently discovers that the US government has known about it for some time and has put in place a plan to save people who will be useful for the survival of mankind. She also follows the space shuttle mission led by Captain 'Fish' Tanner (Robert Duvall) to deflect the comet with nuclear warheads.The final scenes are powerful ones with plenty of lump in the throat moments as people on earth either flee the impact of the comet or meet their end with stoicism.When the film was made, it probably seemed novel for Morgan Freeman, an African American to play President Tom Beck, but now that Barrack Obama is well into his second term it actually seems quite prescient. Although Freeman was a little older, with his great voice, sense of authority and even the dignified greying at the temples, it has proved to be an inspired piece of casting.Téa Leoni is also good in this. Overly strident reporters in movies can be grating, but she brings a human dimension and vulnerability to the role. The fact that she is a reporter also allows her to give information without it coming across as laborious exposition.The big theme in the movie is heroic sacrifice. The film has an uplifting spirit and doesn't dwell on panic stricken humanity or breakdowns in society. The film shows humans at their best and willing to help others – after all, humans are about the only species that will sacrifice themselves for each other. The film doesn't overdo the special effects. Where they are used they are awe inspiring especially when a piece of the comet hits earth. They are also used in imaginative ways such as when the comet passes over the stranded traffic and we see it reflected in the windows of the vehicles.""Deep Impact is virtually a remake of George Pal's ""When Worlds Collide"" but is superior in every way to that film and not just in the improved special effects. As far as other end of the world movies are concerned, it gives Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" a run for its money, and has more substance than films such as ""Meteor"", ""The Day after Tomorrow"" and ""Armageddon"".",Deep Impact
55,mjw2305,A Good Film for the Right Audience,7,10 October 2007,"Deep Impact is really one of those films that could be easily mistaken for something that it is not. Being too easily mistaken for an all action/heroes saving the world film is not a bad thing, but it is has probably contributed to the lower than deserved rating given here.Deep Impact is indeed a disaster/end of the world movie, but instead of using a cheesy, gung-ho approach, like in Armageddon; we have a far more delicately paced and more realistic attempt at how the human race would react if faced with such a situation.Personally i enjoyed both Deep Impact and Armageddon for completely different reasons. Both approaches have different appeal, but Deep Impact probably came out second best because it is less commercial than the afore mentioned film, not because it is worse.Deep impact is a fine movie in its own right, and it is appreciated as such by its real audience, it certainly carries plenty of emotional impact, a solid story and some excellent visuals; it also has plenty of fine talent in the cast to help the story entertain well, but i say again if its action your after then this isn't the right film for you. This is a more calculating, more sentimental and more emotionally dramatic than most others in the genre. Its far from flawless, and its still has the usual clichés, but it is worth a viewing if you like your films to have a little more depth.7/10",Deep Impact
56,MartianOctocretr5,"Entertaining, but impacts with some problems",7,26 April 2008,"Apocolyptic tales of malicious meteors blasting the Earth have been a recurring story since some of them were tracked hitting Jupiter back in the '90's. Deep Impact came out about the same time as a Bruce Willis/Michael Bay vehicle about the same subject, and this is, by far, the better of the two.The discovery of the unwelcome rogue extraterrestial piece of space rock is done very well; with students and scientists happening upon the impending doom by accident; this is followed by intrigue and mystery involving an aspiring TV reporter (Tea Leoni) and involves many politicians, all the way up to the president himself (Morgan Freedman). I don't usually think Leoni is all that good, but her performance in this movie was dynamic and believable. Freedman is great, as always, and does the patriarchal chief executive role with all due sentiment and strength. Another strong actor, Robert Duvall provides a strong leadership role for the group of astronauts dispatched to demolish the incoming behemoth before it reaches its destination: us.The film takes on too much of back stories of characters, and the stories being told about the people, unfortunately aren't all that interesting. The actors make the most of the script as written, but many of these back stories are just too sappy and contrived to identify with. The movie, it should be noted, does have its moments: the scene with the astronauts communicating with people on the ground is very touching. Special effects are accomplished with precision, and accent the doomsday premise of the film very well. Throughout most of the movie, it endeavors to be faithful to known scientific facts about asteroids. However, the closing scene is just done so poorly that it's ridiculous. The scene with the teen astronomer Bederman and his young Helen Hunt-look-alike wife on a toy motor bike ""running away from"" the destruction is just woefully executed. Whoever directed this sequence should be launched into space and fed to the attacking meteors.All in all, a good story.

And it's Robert Duvall doing the shouting oh, ye gods! Not the legend Duvall! A meteor discovered by Frodo is speeding towards Earth and not even Bruce Willis can stop it! Morgan Freeman is a black American president  which should give you an indication of what a far-flung fantasy this movie is - invoking just a little too much ""god"" for us to believe that America has the brain capacity to separate church and state, who sends up astronauts Duvall and the lovely Mary McCormack (and a cast of dorks with hastily-invented science resumés) to plant explosives on the meteor and rip off Arthur C. Clarke and any other movie with Bruce Willis in it.Some of the characterizations are very poignant (Tea Leoni and her estranged dad, Elijah Wood desperately driving girlfriend Leelee Sobieski and her infant sister away from their parents stranded in clogged traffic), but when the tragic astronauts are saying goodbye to their other halves on earth, the movie trips over and bashes its face on Maudlin.And then Morgan Freeman gives an inspirational speech that makes my flesh crawl.",Deep Impact

The special effects, particularly the waves that hit the beach and NYC are very memorable; just the same, there's something off in this movie that I can't describe. The makers scoffed at the un-realism of Armaggeddon, released at the same time, but at least they don't spend so much time jawing in that one. Or maybe it's the wrap up with those mountains near the Virginia Beaches (!!), on a par with Harold & Kumar's New Jersey cliffs. Or maybe it's the painfully protracted goodbye scene with the shuttle crew. Or maybe it's that they sit on their collective hands for eight months while the comet gets closer and closer. All the same Duvall outshines everyone as the aged and experienced shuttle pilot; Freeman is superb as the Prez; and Schell is spectacular as Leoni's dad, their final scene together is a haunting and memorable movie moment.

59,baumer,an excellent film. very emotional,9,26 July 1999,"What would you do if the end of the world was near?  How would you react if you knew that there was no way you were going to survive what was about to happen?  Would you want to survive what was about to happen?  Deep Impact is an excellent film that tells the story of a giant comet that is heading towards earth and unless it is stopped it will destroy everything.  It contains many inter-personal relationships, and it examines how people would react if the end was near.  It doesn't get as deep as ""Last Night"" at examining those issues, but what it does better than Last Night and even Armageddon ( another film that I loved ) is it shows a little more about relationships.  It has a father and daughter trying to patch things up before the end is upon them.  It shows young love, parental love and the love for a country and the world we live in.  Deep Impact had a deeper impact on me and I really admire both Hollywood summer films that came out and dealt with this issue.  But Deep Impact has more to say than Armageddon does.One of the things that I admired so much about this film was how Tea Leoni was so hell bent on uncovering a story so that she could move up in the ranks of reporting, and in the process she uncovers something bigger than any political scandal could ever be.  At first she is following a tip about some senator that has retired from office rather urgently.  She has transcripts with him talking about a girl named Ellie.  And she is determined to uncover who Ellie is so she can embarrass the senator and quicken her pursuit to greatness.  She finally confronts the senator on the dock where he is laoding a boat with what looks to be enough supplies to last for a year.  She tries to bully the senator into telling her the story but he refuses.  She then does some research on the Internet and finds out that Ellie wasn't the name of a woman, but an acronym for the comet. E.L.E. Extinction Level Event.  She is horrified.  The beginning takes up a good half an hour of the movie and it is during that thirty mintues that I became hooked.  My emotions were manipulated to the point where I felt like I should  be at home with my family.  The direness of the situation was very well executed.  And the rest of the film is on the same level.  It does a great job at making us ask questions about ourselves.  And we examine our own lives and wonder if we would be prepared if something like this ever happened.  I realize this may be getting a little sentimental and perhaps sappy, but this film really tapped into my emotions and I think it did that to a lot of people.  I highly recommend htis film for all that it is.  The acting is top notch, especially from Morgan Freeman.  He conveys the hurt, confusion and utter regret as the president of the United States.  He knows that it is impossible to save everyone but he has to do what he can to save as many as possible.  He truly is a great and gifted actor.  The score is also a moving orchestra and the direction by Mimi Leder is swift and appropriatly crisp and dizzying in some ways.  I have never heard of her before this, but I heard that Spielberg picked her himself for this project. And he was smart to pick her.  She really does a wonderful job here.Deep Impact is more than just a movie, it is an experience, and one that should be had by all.  A wonderful, wonderful film.",Deep Impact

61,vip_ebriega,"Deeper, more dramatic 'Impact'.",8,29 March 2008,"My Take: One of the most convincing end-of-the-world movies in a long time. Since the dawn of the CGI era, Hollywood has spun box-office gold after box-office gold, enough to make more box-office... well, you get it! Since it was popularized in James Cameron's nonstop thrill machine sequel TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY and Steven Spielberg's first-rate creature feature JURASSIC PARK, CGI has enabled Hollywood directors/special effects wizards to create images so realistic, it's nearly identical to the real thing. This followed many other big-budget so-called ""event"" pictures, one of which is the reworking of the long-considered forgotten sub-genre, the 1970's disaster genre.Back in the 70's, only the AIRPORT series (the first three actually), THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE and THE TOWERING INFERNO were the real box-office, or at least, commercial and critical successes, while notorious flops like AIRPORT '79 and WHEN TIME RAN OUT... would completely kill off the genre. But believe it or not, like it or not, the genre is back, and on a winning streak once more. While James Cameron's TITANIC became the most successful film of all time, thanks mainly for an involving love story that we all loved. Then here comes DEEP IMPACT, foretelling the biggest natural disaster: extinction by a giant comet. This isn't a new formula, even for the genre. This has been around since 1979, in the film called METEOR, as Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer's other meteor movie Armageddon which came out just the same year, but wasn't out 'till summer.Of course no one really expected DEEP IMPACT to be any form of art, considering its roots. It may just be another 1970's disaster movie scenario, but, it is, this is one of the best 1970's disaster movie of the CGI era. While it ain't free from the disaster movie clichés like TITANIC was (elevating it from being another CGI 1970's disaster offering), DEEP IMPACT is more high-concept and better written. This one, unlike the rest, devotes itself mainly to the effects rather than the source, allowing us to better relate to the characters. The opening, of course, devotes to introduce characters and hint on the impending doom. The film opens with the introduction of one of the main characters, this is Leo Beiderman (Elijah Wood), the youngest character, who also one of the first top predict the ominous disaster while stargazing with his Astronomy Club. This is marred with, of course, a back story featuring his family as well as juvenile yet sweet and gentle relationship with the next door girl Sarah Hotchner (Leelee Sobieski).One year later, we are introduced with another character, an eager reporter named Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni), currently having problems with her divorced parents (Maximillian Schell and Vanessa Redgrave), as well as getting caught into a discovery of an E.L.E, which she misinterprets as a presidential scandal. Turns out, its an Extinction Level Event. Hidden from the public for over a year, President Tom Beck (Morgan Freeman) has finally come up with a plan to save the earth. The largest space shuttle ever constructed called the Messiah, manned by veteran moon-walker Spurgeon ""Fish"" Tanner (Robert Duvall) and a crew of young yet experienced astronauts, will land on the comet, plant nuclear weapons in its base, and blow it out of space. Will they succeed? Of course, Hollywood won't deny us the big-budget, special effects laden destruction of earth, so no questions asked.Still, with its clichés, DEEP IMPACT had me hooked, not by the expectations of special effects (which doesn't actually occur during later on), but of the surprise, unexpected focus on character and drama. Director Mimi Leder wants us to care about these characters, which are nicely written by Ms. Leder's crew of writers (Bruce Joel Rubin & Michael Tolkin). Even the supporting characters were given sufficient focus, except, maybe, the expendable ones. The performances were better than the usual affair, considering that others in the genre let the special effects do most of the acting. Of course, the special effects were impressive, but its not frequent that they are overshadowed by the real actors and those behind the camera. DEEP IMPACT still ain't close to the likes of TITANIC, but its still a great disaster film, considering that the talents don't get wasted under the shadow of special effects, big crowds and large budget.

64,jrarichards,Great piece of work that more than holds its own after nearly 2 decades,10,5 December 2015,"If one was asked to think of a list of actors with real screen presence, then how about Morgan Freeman, Maximilian Schell, Vanessa Redgrave, Robert Duvall and James Cromwell? You could do a great deal worse, and all of them appear in ""Deep Impact"", giving a backbone of gravitas in a film that takes itself seriously and gets the dividends in this case, being compelling, as well as profoundly moving at regular intervals. It works - we do care about the characters we meet, their fates do matter to us, as of course does the fate of our beloved living, blue planet that has nevertheless had to take its fair share of knocks, had to earn its right to go on over aeons of time. Special effects are entirely adequate here, but they rightly take second place to a great story (well, the biggest possible story, really), and one that is presented realistically and effectively. This is how the film has remained pertinent and effective through to our higher-tech times, and it's very much the above faces that give us an anchor to keep us at least partially in place as one of the biggest storms in history is poised to break on our planet, delivering the same kind of coup de grace that the dinosaurs faced more than 60 million years ago. And then of course there is the remaining anchor in every sense of the word - Jenny Lerner of NBC (shades here of the role played by the real-life Daily Express in the film ""The Day the Earth Caught Fire"", which is also still worth watching, though it was made in 1961). Jenny hosts the news programmes that take us through to almost the last moments. Tea Leoni is the ""fresh face"" that stands out from the old-timers in the cast, and this is so right, given the role she has to play in the film, as a slightly confused initiate to the biggest news story ever, thrust into the limelight as the person telling it to viewers straight, as the dramatic story unfolds. Tea is utterly, almost breathtakingly, gorgeous in this film, but her slightly dreamy, lost manner endears her character yet more fully to the viewer. Jenny is without a partner, has divorced parents, has devoted herself to a career that has not quite gone anywhere (until now), and thus comes over as someone very much in need of love, and doubtless many members of the audience would be more than happy to oblige, falling for the character, hook, line and sinker - as I do each time I see the film! For this film does indeed repay watching, let's say every 5 or 6 years - possibly forever. To end as I began, I would venture to suggest that Elijah Wood has screen presence too, and he's in the film as well - if in a still quite junior version. So what's not to like here in this great, if perhaps under-appreciated piece of sci fi that is (like all good sci fi) far more than just sci fi...",Deep Impact
65,Libretio,"Thoughtful, character-driven disaster movie",6,11 February 2005,"DEEP IMPACT Aspect ratio: 2.39:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDSMankind is threatened by a huge asteroid on a collision course with Earth.Mimi Leder's thoughtful drama arrived in theaters shortly before the release of Michael Bay's ""Armageddon"" (1998) - a flashier, trashier riff on the same subject - and appeared to suffer in comparison with its outrageous counterpart, due to a script (by Bruce Joel Rubin and Michael Tolkin) which emphasized human drama over extravagant pyrotechnics. But DEEP IMPACT is enriched tenfold by this deliberate shift of emphasis, even though the film adheres to a routine formula established years earlier in such disaster pics as EARTHQUAKE and THE TOWERING INFERNO (both 1974). Here, the contrived melodrama of those older movies is replaced by a sincere contemplation of unimaginable catastrophe and the subsequent effect on mankind, highlighted by Morgan Freeman's authoritative presence as the beleaguered US president, who commissions a group of astronauts (led by Robert Duvall) to land a spacecraft on the comet and attach a series of nuclear devices to the surface.Proceedings are hindered slightly by Téa Leoni's blank-faced performance as the TV journalist who stumbles onto the impending cataclysm whilst researching an apparently unrelated story about a 'philandering' senator (James Cromwell). Thankfully, the film is redeemed by its tremendous supporting cast, including Vanessa Redgrave as Leoni's proud mother, struggling to cope following her divorce from estranged husband Maximilian Schell, and a pre-hobbit Elijah Wood, playing the juvenile lead. It's to the filmmakers' credit that all these characters (and more besides) play vital roles within the overall structure, adding depth and resonance to an otherwise crowd-pleasing commercial enterprise.The climactic scenes of destruction - involving a huge tidal wave striking New York - are brief but potent, precisely because of the human dimension stressed by Leder's intuitive direction. True, the outcome is fairly predictable, and there's a slight lurch into artificial sentimentality towards the end of the movie, but these are minor drawbacks in an otherwise worthy production. Fine music score by James Horner.",Deep Impact
66,rebeljenn,Not good impact,3,13 November 2005,"In the late 1990s, we had news that the Earth may be destroyed with a huge rock from space. (Though, maybe this renewed theory was just to bring our attention to two new films being released.) In 1998 (or around that year), two similar films were released. One was 'Deep Impact', and the other was 'Armageddon'. 'Armageddon' was the more 'scientific' of the two films. 'Deep Impact' was more of an emotional and character-based thriller describing more about the people who would be caught up in the disaster.Again, cue the typical thriller storyline here. 'Deep Impact' encompasses a little bit of romance, family relationships, disaster, loss, and plenty of action. It's nothing more than that, and it is certainly not a memorable or great film.

For Deep Impact, I make an exception, have the DVD and have watched at least ten times if not more ! Why ? Because I love the emphasis placed on the human element and human reactions in the face of impending disaster ! Only this film seems to portray the necessary emotions in this kind of situation.Many disaster movies start off with the disaster followed by the humans struggling to come to terms with the situation, this one is different, the disaster only arrives at the end, so we have the whole film to see how the humans prepare for it.The story is COMPLETELY PLAUSIBLE and I don't doubt that one day a comet WILL HIT THE EARTH and cause unimaginable damage.The special effects, though limited to the end of the film are BRILLIANT and remain in your memory. As a comparison, I have just seen the film "" THe Day AFter Tomorrow"" and have already forgotten the special effects as there were so many of them.The secret of special effects is to have just a few, but placed at strategic moments in the film so as to remain indelebile in the spectators mind.Above and beyond the special effects in Deep Impace, is the cute, almost pathetic figure of Tea Leoni and the MOST EMOTIONAL moment of all is when she is huddled to her father ( after so much misunderstanding ) on that beach in the face of that impressive and impending tidal wave .........aaaaaaargh, every time, my eyes melt when I see it !!!!!!!!!!!The various interplay of emotions contributes greately to the film and the impending disaster is just a backdrop to the development in the relationships between the protagonists.

72,virek213,A Piece Of The Rock,8,1 August 2001,"If you want an end-of-the-world spectacle with sound, fury, and testosterone, DEEP IMPACT isn't your film.  There's always ARMAGEDDON.But DEEP IMPACT, besides having special effects that are every bit as spectacular as ARMAGEDDON, and far more believable, has something that ARMAGEDDON sorely lacks: a human dimension.  This is a really thought-provoking ""what-if"" movie about the extreme emotional and social impact on the world when it is announced that a seven mile-wide comet is on a collision course with Earth.  Supposedly, one such uncomfortably close encounter with a space rock sixty five million years ago obliterated the dinosaurs.  This one will have the nightmarish effect of a nuclear holocaust (minus the radiational fallout), and it COULD wipe out the human race...unless a space expedition team, captained by Robert Duvall, can nudge the comet out of its collision course.Co-starring Morgan Freeman, Elijah Wood, Tea Leoni, Leelee Sobieski, and Maximillian Schell, DEEP IMPACT is effectively directed by Mimi Leder (THE PEACEMAKER); and though the Bruce Joel Rubin/Michael Tolkin script doesn't entirely avoid the melodramatic pratfalls of the 1970s disaster films, it does give the film a humanity that was woefully absent from ARMAGEDDON--not surprising, given the fact that this is from Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks SKG factory.James Horner, who scored TITANIC, AN AMERICAN TAIL and APOLLO 13, gives us another very effective score here, ensuring that the very deep impact of DEEP IMPACT lasts longer than the sound and fury of ARMAGEDDON.",Deep Impact

Since the release of this film and Armageddon, I've been unsure which of the two I liked better.  I have always been leaning towards Deep Impact, so today I watched the film again to be sure.  I definitely believe that Deep Impact is a better film.  Although, Armageddon is a fantastic movie in it's own right.  I like Deep Impact better because I feel the story is much more realistic and slightly more interesting.  Also, the acting in this film is just fantastic (but again, Armageddon was well-acted as well).  After viewing the film again today, I thought ""ya know, there is virtually nothing in the film that I really disliked"", whereas there are a number of things in Armageddon that I really disliked!

Not at all. He prob just needed some cash, and I don't blame him at all. That's normal. But the film is just your typical American end of the world/hero flick where some guys volunteer and do a great job and show commitment, sacrifice and all that good stuff, and there are tears and cheap sad music, and there are little sub-plots and mini-stories within the story between other secondary characters...I mean, it's not even enough to be watched once, let alone a good movie that requires any more effort or thought going its way.",Deep Impact

How do you think governments of all kinds would deal with the problem. Would you want to survive and have the responsibility of continuing the human race? It is well written for the most part and the cast acquit themselves well, especially Duvall and Freeman. It manages to be unpredictable and that is to its credit. But I was not as moved by it as many other reviewers here. It has more depth than Armageddon but is not quite the roller-coaster ride that that movie was.

It's as if director Mimi Leder, who did a good job in her previous film, THE PEACEMAKER, was making up for the lack of emotional hooks of that film.  Unlike, say, INDEPENDENCE DAY, there was no bad acting, just wasted performances; you're left wondering why Freeman (who merely declaims), Redgrave, and Schell even bothered, and the teen romance subplot had no place here.

Of course, they have one important thing in common: the end of the world is nigh and only a few brave astronauts can save us. Other than that I would say that the two films play on two different fields and they only have the basic premise in common.Having said that, I must say that while ""Deep Impact"" is far from a masterpiece it is better than I had expected.

""Deep Impact"" is, at a first glance, more scientific, more of a drama than anything else. But then I started thinking.The plot itself isn't so unbelievable as some comments claim. But there are so many things that this film lacks that simply fails to make it anything else than a very average disaster flick.First of all, I was hoping this movie would be more logical and true to reality. But building ""immense caves"" and a complete spaceship with an ""experimental nuclear engine"" in less than a year is quite a feat, not to mention the fact that they manage to keep this secret. No way, not the spaceship anyway.How do they get around the comet to land on it? They suddenly approach from behind, as in ""Armageddon"" - but there they at least give a plausible explanation. What happens here? To turn a spaceship of this kind around in space would be near impossible, or in the least very, very difficult. A fairly long logic leap.As for the acting, I'm convinced, performances were pretty good. But the tears, the goodbyes, the unbearable brainwashing that Hollywood wants people to sit through is just too much.

Elijah Wood gives an excellent performance as the young man who first discovers the comet, and later rises above his age to save the life of his girlfriend.

Isn't the looming death of millions of people a good reason to be sentimental?  Yes, but the film's sentimentality is always hooked to individual stories, the masses form faceless cannon fodder.

They have also been building some big tunnels which will hold a million people safely underground until the dust has cleared in case Plan A fails. The story though is stumbled upon by an intrepid reporter (Tea Leoni) from MSNBC big product placement here).In the tradition of the Irwin Allen disaster flick's of the 1970's (Towering Inferno, The Poseidon Adventure) we have a big cast and all sorts of story lies to build up a really big human aspect to the impending tragedy, and just in case that wasn't enough we get more than a few children in peril sequences. We have a student astronomer (Elijah Wood) who co-discovers the comet and young love in the form of Leelee Sobieski. We have the aforementioned reporter's parents (Maximillian Schell and Vanessa Redgrave) who have divorced because the father fell in love with a much younger woman. We have the heroic young astronauts and the older veteran astronaut (Robert Duvall) who put aside their differences and go forth bravely to try and stop the comet. But in all that we don't have anything that really stands out, lots of decent performances and a fairly compelling story if you ignore some of the plot holes, but it ends up being fairly routine. Not a bad movie and probably worth seeing if you really loved those Irwin Allen disaster pictures.Of the two comet pictures from 1998 (the other being Armageddon) this was the better film, it seems an odd thing to say but this by far the more credible and realistic story. It was also more compelling due to its character development.",Deep Impact

It gives Armageddon a run for its money, which was released in the same year. A bunch of ordinary people connected to the meteor heading towards earth find they have a slim chance of survival. A 1/150 chance in fact. All of them have very different stories. Tea Leoni and Elijah Wood are at the forefront, yet neither of them are directly saving the day. Director Mimi Leder chooses to focus primarily on the people on earth. Deep Impact is a drama. The comet and the astronauts tackling it are bit part characters. No one can fault its ending though.

93,benoit-3,A very handsome package!,10,17 June 2002,"I have seen this film 4 times now, once in the theatre, once on VHS, once on TV and tonight on DVD. Even though the DVD is not anamorphic and deserves another edition for today's high-tech widescreen TVs, the sound is unreal and the film is still a phenomenal piece of work. The all-star cast gives it its best shot, the suspenseful moments are gripping but above all the human drama reaches the viewer, unless they belong to the type of protohumans who prefer a meaningless testosterone shake like ""Armageddon"" (that unspeakable piece of cosmic debris). Perfect casting: Freeman, Redgrave, Wood, Leoni, Schell, Duvall and all the others are just right. The score by James Horner is derivative as usual (army drums mixed with whatever melody crosses his mind, this time from ""The Madwoman of Chaillot"" (1968) and ""Do you love me?"" from ""Fiddler on the Roof""). But we'll forgive him because the ensemble work gels and stands firm and this is a film for the ages. As close to an art film as Hollywood can make them while still respecting the conventions of the sci-fi/disaster genre and catering to the greatest possible public. What a ride!",Deep Impact
94,cosmic_quest,Superior to 'Armageddon',8,26 August 2006,"It seems 1998 was the year Hollywood turned to the idea of the world being decimated by objects from outer space to fuel their disaster films. Both 'Deep Impact' and 'Armageddon' were released in that year but while I did enjoy the thrill and special effects of the latter film, I find 'Deep Impact' the superior of the two.The film begins when a teenage amateur astronomer discover a comet on a direct collision course for the Earth. The world is then thrown into turmoil has humanity has to accept their possible extinction. While NASA sends a shuttle up with the intention to try to blow the comet to bits, the US government selects people to be saved in a cave they are building to withstand the event. Focusing on various unrelated characters, the film shows how people react differently to the destruction of all that they know.The brilliant cast, including Morgan Freeman, Vanessa Redgrave, Robert Devall, Elijah Wood, Ron Eldard and many others, all given great depictions of their characters. It is because of their ability to bring their respective characters to life that 'Deep Impact' stands up so well as it is a very emotional and character driven story, as opposed to 'Armageddon', which relied much more on humour and special effects to sell it. Téa Leoni is the only one who doesn't shine through like her co-stars as her performance is quite bland and doesn't capture her character's turbulent emotions. However, as the rest of the cast give great performances, it's easy to overlook her. And even though there is much attention given to establishing the characters doesn't mean the film skimps when it comes to the special effects. Both the scenes in space and those on Earth when the comet hits the planet are well-handled visually. It features some of the best special effects of planetary annihilation that I've ever seen (and I'm a big fan of these disaster flicks).What makes 'Deep Impact' rather unique in terms of disaster films is that it gives a very human side to tragedy and devastation by showing how ordinary people cope in times of crisis but it avoids the trap of being trite and overly-sentimental. It's a shame the film is so underrated then as it is a film that would appeal to sci-fi fans and those seeking an interesting story with strong characters.",Deep Impact

96,fimimix,..very plausible movie...,10,30 June 2008,"Not having seen ""Armageddan"", I can't compare the two as most users did. I do not usually enjoy sci-fis, but ""Deep Impact"" is a very entertaining film, which I always look for. The development of characters was adequate, Michael Tolkin's script was good, the cinematography excellent in all scenes, and the score didn't intrude.Of the comments I read, no one mentioned the edge-of-the-seat scene of the astronauts drilling in the comet. I didn't read one who remembered the space-ship slammed-into the comet, which caused it to break-up with the help of several atomic weapons. ""Let's go home"" was a major part of the film, as it showed the astronauts' families, and the acceptance of death by the ship's crew. Very touching.All were excellent in their roles. Robert Duvall (""Capt. Fish"") and Morgan Freeman (""Pres. Tom Beck"") always do their jobs well. I'm not too familiar with Elijah Wood (""Leo Biederman""), but enjoyed his performance. Vannessa Redgrave (""Robin Lerner"") added a touch of elegance; I was shocked to see how Max Schell (""Jason Lerner"") has aged; he used to be one of the best-looking actors around, with such a small role - but, played well.Tea Leoni (""Jenny Lerner"") was o.k. in her role; what dazzle do you expect from a TV-anchor ? The special effects were just enough, not too exaggerated. I thought all of the extras were great - the scene when the smaller comet skims the ocean was very convincingly real-looking. Seems like not many folk realized they only had to get to higher ground to escape the tidal wave.All-in-all, ""Deep Impact"" keep my interest and entertained me, too. that's all I ask from a movie.

101,BadWebDiver,"Muddled attempt at a ""serious"" action movie",4,31 March 2002,"This seems like an action movie made for people who don't like action movies. Any potential suspense the story may have is smothered under pretentious plot developments interspersed with melodramatic hysterics.SPOILER WARNING!!!The opening astronomy class scene shows a little bit of personality, but the story rapidly deteriorated from there. The worst scene is the contrived, over-the-top hysterical bus-leaving scene. By the end of it, I was seriously wishing the bus would blow up like in SPEED! I had a little bit of sympathy for Leo when he stood up for himself in front of the tunnel; but it didn't compensate too much, and was quickly squelched by the soap opera-style freeway scenes.A lot of people have commented how that thought the tidal wave sweeping away the reporter and her father was farcical. I also thought the shot of the Statue of Liberty head floating among the Manhattan skyscrapers was absolutely ludicrous. And when I saw this film in the theater, the shot of the wave heading towards the home town was the most amateurish looking effect shot I've seen in modern cinema. It looked like it had been shot in someone's bathtub. Even Ray Harryhausen did better shots than that! Admittedly Morgan Freeman's President does show some dignity; but he can't save this movie!Let's hope that film-makers and professional critics have learned that it's ridiculous to expect every type of story to fit strictly to the conventions of an angst-ridden character study. Story plots work a lot better if they play by their own set of rules they're designed for. The 80s-90s policy of analyzing every single film but the same one-size-fits-all theoretical criteria was a WAY stupid idea.

There are some scenes, particularly those involving the astronauts on the comet and the initial discovery stages of the comet where on a second viewing its hard to remember which scenes belonged to what film- as there are quite a few similarities.  However, they are totally different films.  This one deals more with the human reaction/emotion side of a disaster.  The films focus is not with the fx disaster, but more with a possible scenario of how people would react when they know that human/animal/plant life will be wiped out.  I thought there was some good acting in this film, casting some heavyweight actors such as Duvall and Freeman, with more lightweight and less experienced actors such as Leoni worked well, it gave it a good balance.  Even though this film takes a more human approach to the earths impending doom, the special effects when the tidal wave generated from the comet finally does hit NYC the results are nothing less than spectacular.",Deep Impact

108,allyjack,Pretty disappointing movie just cries out for a rewrite,3,25 October 1999,"Pretty disappointing movie just cries out for a rewrite, for an extensive rethink of what would have been worth concentrating on in a scenario such as this. The ""big picture"" aspects of the scenario are mainly confined to Freeman's exposition-oriented dialogue, yet his scenes provide only the merest hint of the political and personal anguish that drives his decisions. Otherwise the movie's focused on a few inexplicably bland personal stories - it's impossible to know why	Leoni and her estranged parents were considered to be worthy of such attention. Despite the gravity of the situation, the movie maintains a pretty evenly bland tone, with an extreme failure to register tension - the ultimate saving of the world is almost anticlimatic. By far the best moments are	the special effects-generated impact of the first comet - which are awesome in fact - but even these are undercut by cutting away to Wood's mediocre personal drama, not to mention simply by being too short. And of course, there's little sense of the huge loss that's been incurred by mankind nor of events in the world beyond. Independence Day was not only far zippier but actually managed in its bubble-gum way to convey a better sense of a comprehensive portrait of the event.",Deep Impact
109,gcsman,Here's a surprise - an apocalypse movie that is gently paced and reflective.,7,19 March 2019,"Deep Impact, and Armageddon, both premiered in 1998, and both were built on the theme of a comet (Deep Impact) or asteroid (Armageddon) on a collision course with the Earth. How to save all life on Earth with the clock ticking? Armageddon got the bigger profits and press (perhaps inevitable with Bruce Willis starring), but it was practically the definition of a sci-fi plot based on painfully bad junk science. It will be justifiably forgotten.Deep Impact was so much better. Director Mimi Leder decided to take a very different direction: the story resolutely concentrates on its interesting cast of people, and on one very big question. What, really, would you do if you are actually facing the end of the world and if you know exactly when it's going to happen? There's just one slim chance for salvation, which is if the crew of the 'Messiah' spacecraft can successfully rendezvous with the comet and explosively deflect it from its path. BTW, this approach isn't that far from actual discussions going on in recent years about just how to handle real Earth-crossing asteroids, though there are thankfully none known as large as the things used in these movies. The individuals in the story that we get to see a good deal of are the astronauts and their families, the US President and his cabinet, the staff of a TV newsroom and the parents of the main reporter, and the teenager who discovered the comet with his girlfriend and their families, among others. It's a wide cast of characters and they are generally quite well handled and balanced out. Though everyone is racing against the clock, there is a pretty rich vein of character development that is totally unlike most ""global catastrophe"" movies.The music score, by James Horner, constantly reinforces this reflective approach and creates an almost elegiac feel, as if the main characters are already looking back on their own lives with a mix of sadness, quietness, and some pride. There are just two places where the special effects take center stage: one is the sequence at the comet itself. The second -- and the big payoff -- is the comet fragment finally striking. It's a doozy, and it still (20 years later) has the power to impress, all the more because it's done completely without background music. The visuals do it all.It's an amazing cast: Vanessa Redgrave, Maximilian Schell, Robert Duvall, James Cromwell, Morgan Freeman are tops. Secondary names include Tea Leoni (who's workmanlike but doesn't quite command the lead-role load she's been given), Elijah Wood (seen here just before moving on to the Lord of the Rings trilogy), a very young Leelee Sobieski, and a wonderfully warm Mary McCormack as the spacecraft pilot (she's someone who richly deserves more and bigger film roles).

The first 30 minutes are great in my opinion, just the opposite of the last 30 minutes. I thought that the relationship between the reporter and her father has taken too much time of the film. There was much sentimentalism on it. However, there are some good points in ""Deep Impact"". The story cares about people, and that's a good thing in comercial films.

114,RIK-22,Complete pants,1,15 December 1999,"First of all, this is an atrociously bad film.  The fact that people found this film moving is so so sad.SpoilerWhere do I even begin.  The opening scene of the film is a complete waste of time.  One astronomer spots a comet and in about 10 seconds realises it's going to hit the Earth, so what does he do, he tries to send an Email which doesn't work.  Now as this comet is about a year away what does he do.  Does he try to send the mail later, use the phone, send a disc in the mail, no that would be silly.  We must get this disk to Washington NOW.  Of course the car crashes, he is killed and you assume the disk is destroyed in the ensuing fire.Now some time later the president is perfectly aware of this and even has the now destroyed disk, so what was the point of the first scene. The film carries on is this pointless stupid manner.  There is a brief part of the film where there is some intrigue, but even that's handled is such a ridiculous way.   Why would the president personally meet a reporter to scare her.The rest of the film is some drivelling soap opera that bores you to tears. I spent the last third of the movie hoping the comet could hurry up a bit and wipe out these sad whinging losers.Now the Earth (i.e. America) has a year (I think) to be able to come up with a number of ideas of how to stop this comet.  So what we (when I say we I mean of course America who represent the whole of planet Earth) do is send a bunch of young gun-ho Americans on some stupid mission to blow up the comet. With comical timing they fail miserably.  So what now, bugger, we don't know, of course no one else on planet USA knows how to stop this thing.The stupidest scene is at least kept until the end.  There's a group of fleeing people who decided to flee a few hours before the comet turned up, I mean they only had a year and are stuck in traffic.  A few minutes later they were all kicking themselves from their watery grave.  All they had to do was run up the mountain about 100 feet away from where they were.

Do the plans set forth to halt extinction succeed or fail? When it's a Hollywood product should you even have to ask? Turn your brain off. Meanwhile be prepared for a lot of shallow characters to be thrown your way. They antagonized me start to finish. I refer to them as ""the beautiful people"". I say that jadedly because everyone in this movie aside from the aging Vanessa Redgrave are too perfect.Tea Leoni plays a snobbish reporter for MSNBC. Seems her life is in the crapper. Her father (Maximilian Schill) has just dropped her mother (the aforementioned Vanessa Redgrave) like a sack of potatoes for a younger woman. Label mama/poppa break-up unnecessary sub-plot number one. Elijah Wood is the kid who co-discovered the huge meteor and now is famous. He lives like families do in suburban America.

Where Robert Duvall, the tried and true veteran, leads a crew with the fate of earth resting entirely on them. Not to mention, Morgan Freeman stars as the most perfect US president ever.Let it be official. The disaster genre generally produces horrible movies. This is one of them. The way Deep Impact paints the world, combined with atrocious characters, make this the worst of the worst. Highlighted by some of the most utterly stupid, unintentional humorous scenes ever captured on film. The Elijah Woods dirt bike tidal wave escape sequence at the end was pure gold.

116,Sankari_Suomi,"Leelee Sobieski, and a plot. But mostly Leelee Sobieski.",7,29 October 2017,"In 1998, everyone was getting ready for the big Year 2000. People had mixed feelings about the whole thing, with many predicting global disasters on an apocalyptic scale. Hollywood decided that the best way to address these fears was to monetise them, and created two movies—Deep Impact and Armageddon—that shared the same basic plot:* giant asteroid is heading to Earth * it's going to hit and wipe out pretty much all life on the planet * we might be able to stop it just in time * this will involve sending astronauts up in space to land on the asteroid and blow it upToday Deep Impact is widely seen as the ginger-haired step-cousin of Armageddon, but I personally believe this is an unfair assessment. Both movies were released in summer, and both performed extremely well at the box office, although Deep Impact (with box office returns of $350 million against a budget of just $80 million) was easily the more profitable of the two.Deep Impact begins strongly, with an innocent scientist burning to death after just three scenes have elapsed. It's a great start. Twelve months flash by, and we're introduced to Téa Leoni, who was smoking hot at the time this movie was made, with no suggestion of the sad decline that would later follow.We also meet Elijah Wood, playing some awkward little scrote that nobody cares about.Morgan Freeman naturally gets a part, because if the world is going to end we need a decent voice-over.Most of all, ladies and gentlemen, we are graced with the presence of a dangerously jailbaity 15 year old Leelee Sobieski, who looks as though she just might be legal, but absolutely is not.The plot unfolds pretty much as you'd expect, but unlike other movies of its type, Deep Impact commendably resists the temptation of a predictable 'everything's-going-to-be-OK-now' conclusion. Earth still gets hit, squillions of people die—including Téa Leoni!—and the Twin Towers are destroyed by some reasonably convincing CGI.It's not without its weaknesses, but when compared with other summer disaster films, Deep Impact can hold its head up pretty high. And it gave us Leelee Sobieski, for which I am eternally grateful.I rate Deep Impact at 23.31 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a perky 7/10 on IMDb.",Deep Impact
117,KFL,"Uninspired, but reasonable",8,24 July 1999,"Disaster movies that involve threats to a dozen or so people can afford to give us character development and the like. Movies like this one, in which all human life is at stake, have a much bigger job to do. Deep Impact makes a reasonable effort to do that job, including token efforts to develop characters, but it is not wholly successful.Some of the science here is wrong, but not wildly so. Given the premise, of a comet on a collision path with earth, the single most unrealistic development in the movie (occuring in the last couple minutes) is unfortunately very hard to believe...one wishes the scriptwriters had avoided the temptation, but I suppose they had their reasons.However, the issues of triage, the who-will-live-who-won't gut-wrenching decisions, the prospect of mass pandemonium and breakdown of society that such an event would trigger, were fairly well done, and perhaps sufficient to remind us of how fragile ""our way of life"" (President Freeman/Beck's words) really is.Though this is not a great movie, it is quite a good one, with (mostly) a credible storyline.

118,masterjk2,Deep do-do,3,8 January 2008,"It starts out OK. The plot, for about the first 45 minutes makes some sense and then everything goes balmy. Part of this has to do with very poor directing from someone (Mimi Leder) who should stick with TV drama and soaps. It's her métier. The whole movie just becomes maudlin as soon as everyone finds out that it's DOOM, DOOM I tell you. These people don't try to live at all. They just commit suicide or sit in the tidal wave's way waiting to be engulfed. Is that reality? If you thought there was going to be a comet hit and that it would probably submerge a good part of the earth in water... wouldn't you head for the high ground, early? Or, if you thought it was going to blot out sunlight and you weren't chosen as part of the 1M cave dwellers, might you not band together with others to find a way to last 2 years? OK, all that aside. After our young hero is told his bride's family can't go and she won't go, wouldn't you get them all together and head for the hills? Why wait until you get to Missouri, which has to be at least 2 days from the East Coast by bus, to go back. And somehow, you hitch back in time to rescue her (how many days would that take... cars going toward the disaster... and ride off on a bike, doing maybe 30 MPH and yet still beat a wall of water going 1100 MPH? None of the numbers work out, nor do the emotions. It's all a lot of ham acting and people acting like sheep, instead of human beings. The special effects weren't bad. The acting was OK, when they weren't crying. Really, a very poor movie. PS. We won't even talk about back up systems. Scientists, good ones, never proceed in any project without a back up system.

119,vasco_cid,A Truly warming experience.,9,19 September 2002,"Coming out in 1998, as one of the two movies about global catastrophies, Deep Impact, was, most definetly the best of the two. While Armageddon pushed hard and strong on action, SFX and testosterone, Deep Impact prefered to go the other way. The plot is very good, the characters have depth, and throughout the movie you feel the director building up the atmosphere until the final veredict. As I've seen Mimi Leder's work the year before in the also excellent ""Peacemaker"", I knew she would be a good choice for the job. So much was said about women taking control; she actually did a great job putting all her efforts together, working not only with very well known, actors, giving them depth and emotion; she still payed atention to the script, and also thrilled us with the action, thrilling and dramatic sequences. We all know that the general audiences prefered ""Armageddon""; which is shown by the slight difference of money earned, but Deep Impact was also a great experience, if not better than Armageddon.

Certainly no-one with even a basic high-school science education. In fact, I wonder if they had any education at all. It certainly shows a new level of zero skills (negative skills?) to be unable to write something dramatic that has a modicum of fact and common sense about it.Lazy writing. Stupid characters.

Entertaining, and always a pleasure to see Morgan Freeman unless the script is truly awful -- here it's just fair, and he makes the scenes he's in more than they would have been with anyone else. There were too many sub-plots, and the reporter (the ever-mediocre Tea  Leoni) and the kid (the apparently not as good as I'd hoped after ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"", Elijah Wood) could have been dumped entirely. More time with Freeman, and better astronauts to work with Robert Duval, and it would have been a better movie. The special effects on the comet were quite hokey, and the only astronaut that I cared about other than Duval was the woman pilot.Also, I have to agree with Mr. Cranky's review -- what was everyone doing waiting on the beach for the comet to hit?

125,basilisksamuk,Surprisingly literate script,8,2 March 2013,"Let me tell you about the audience and then I will tell you about the film. Sometimes I am a little nervous about audiences, thinking that they are going to crunch popcorn and talk through the film whilst spitting on the ceiling etc. Sometimes I am right. In this case I was not happy to find myself in the middle of a bunch of young men who were greatly amused by the fact that they could annoy their neighbours by making their seats squeak and who broke out in gales of laughter over an advert featuring a weak joke about frothing beer cans and babes in swimsuits. I fully expected to spend more time trying to filter out their noise than watching the film. The film began without titles with an attention-grabbing opening. The previously noisy lads subsided immediately and never made another sound throughout the two and a half hours of the film except to laugh at the funny bits, gasp at the gaspy bits and surreptitiously wipe away a tear at the emotional bits. Now, if I was a clever Guardian-type critic I could leave it that and not tell you a single other thing about Deep Impact. The audience reaction says it all.An Everest-sized comet is heading towards the earth and threatens to extinguish all life thereon. But we know, because we've seen the trailer beforehand, that a brave group of astronauts will be trying to head it off by placing nukes on it. We also know that at least part of the comet is going to hit the earth because, again, we've seen the trailer. In between finding out about the approaching nemesis and the final effects-laden ending we follow the lives of a young man who discovered the comet, the president of the US of A (Morgan Freeman), the team of astronauts led by a grisly bit lovable old Robert Duvall and a journalist (Tea Leoni) who breaks the story and becomes the top news anchor, broadcasting the events as they unfold. This is also a film which makes full use of a large cast of supporting actors often culled from TV shows like Hill Street Blues and E.R. The whole thing is directed by Mimi Leder, herself a graduate of E.R. and the recent Clooney-led Peacemaker.One of the first things to strike me was how good the script is and what a verbose film it is. People are talking to each other all the time and many of the scenes are full of busy newsrooms or presidential Q and A sessions or mission control rooms. I suppose I shouldn't be too surprised, given the background of the people involved, but the busy scenes with intercutting dialogues and story strands work just as well on the big screen as they do on TV. Special mention must also go to the idea of how Leoni gets into the plot – this was a really clever idea, well written and expertly handled. To tell you what it is would be to spoil it, though you can figure it out from the trailer (damn trailers! I think the time has come to ban them). This is a people film as much, if not more than, it is an effects film and the script mostly does a good job of making you care about them and believe in them. Just occasionally it strays into heavy-handed manipulation of the emotions but it is difficult to see how this could be otherwise, given the subject matter. The American gung-honess also comes out in Freeman's president but it's best to ignore these bits as they are few and far between. (What do you expect? This is an American film made by Americans primarily for consumption by Americans).As far as the acting is concerned everyone with a decent bit of script does well. Leoni is particularly good and always manages to convey that feeling of ""I really don't know what the hell is going on but I'm getting away with it "" that the story demands of her. Robert Duvall, an American national treasure, is excellent as the world-weary astronaut and this was a bold piece of casting when you imagine some suit trying to argue that the part should be played by Leonardo Di Caprio or some other infant. I suspect that the film could have managed without the young astronaut part but Elijah Wood manages to look suitably youthful and enthusiastic, as does his girlfriend. Morgan Freeman gets away with playing the president because he is Morgan Freeman though his was the most cardboard cut-out character in the whole piece.So what is wrong with the film then? Well I've already mentioned the president – ugh! I was a little disappointed with the depiction of events on the street. I feel sure that there would be much more violence if this happened for real and the rows and rows of motorists waiting patiently for death by drowning were far too stoic about their fates. The FX were also a little patchy. Sometimes they were really excellent but at other times you could see the joins and the models. Perhaps we are all getting too blasé in these days when every other film destroys half the world or flies starships twice around the universe. All the same I was faintly disappointed by a few of the FX shots.",Deep Impact
126,bcheng93,"...definitely superior to its counterpart "" Armageddon "" and more character driven",7,18 March 2014,"i agree with the critics and reviewers who say that this movie is vastly under-rated at 5.9. what?, it doesn't even warrant at least a 6.5 it would be a travesty.first of, this is not a big genre and there are not that many movies like this and not many of them are that well done anyway. i personally give it a 7.0 and it is in my top 5 disaster movies all time. i remember watching this in the cinema and not thinking much about it...it didn't really stay with me like a good movie should. Armageddon wasn't even that good but i remembered it cause it was fast paced and entertaining. over the years this movie has grown on me big time, as i've seen this movie 3 times in the last year. this movie got low ratings probably because the pacing was a little slow at times and there weren't a vast amount of cgi. the cgi in this movie still stand up to this day and some of those disaster scenes are in my favorites all-time.OK, this movie was a little sluggish at times but i thought the story was very good, especially how it started as being potentially explosive white house sex scandal maybe involving the president to being an extinction level event. the ensemble cast was very good with a pre-frodo elijah wood, morgan freeman, james cromwell, kurtwood smith, tea leoni the list goes on.... all the actors did a fine job and i have to mention robert duvall had a main role cause hes one of my favorites. this movie was so much more believable then Armageddon and it didn't need as much cgi or over the top action for it to be good because its more character- driven.like i said good movies in this genre are not easy to find and this is definitely one of the better ones. as a matter of fact...i want to mention the cgi in this movie which was outstanding because i remember the images from this movie more than any other disaster movie. oh well...hope it goes up in rating.",Deep Impact

Morgan Freeman, Vanessa Redgrave and Robert Duvall must be embarrassed to their toes that their names are on this. I haven't seen Téa Leoni for quite awhile, but has she always been this wooden and cringingly unwatchable? Not that I didn't enjoy looking at her, but if only she hadn't opened her mouth. Reminds me of Scarlett Johannson in early days. Neither Elijah Wood nor his pointless character contributed anything.The blame for this hysterical mess must fall squarely on the director. Attempting to turn an extinction-causing event into a maudlin soap opera is something only a woman would do, and only in America would this happen. The fact that there are so many nine and ten star reviews speaks volumes. There are masses of shallow people who just eat this stuff up, and that is a worry in itself. The producers know this and deliberately set out to manipulate these kinds of people. Yes, Spielberg had a hand in this, and it shows.The FX are a joke, even for 1998.

Superior in concept to the global disaster films that followed it like ""Armageddon,"" this was clearly my choice for the superior model. With thoughtful and nuanced direction by Mimi Lederer leading a stellar cast, this film clearly surpassed many others of the genre, avoiding many of the clichés that marred the competition. With a beautiful and atmospheric score by James Horner rounding out the beautifully crafted film (for once a movie where the special effects provide just enough of the action without overwhelming it), it will remain a science fiction classic for the ages.

131,BB-15,Disaster Movie with a Heart,7,22 November 1999,"Disaster movies have become like action movies filled with explosions. Die Hard started this trend which continued with Independence Day and Armageddon. In the 70's this type of film like Airport or Earthquake focused more on the characters than the fireworks. Deep Impact is a return to this more mellow style. For the hard core action movie fan, all of this mushy stuff is horrible. For those like myself who like many types of movies, it was a refreshing change. Deep Impact has several good things going for it. The script was co-written by the talented Michael Tolkin (The Player) which gives it more depth than expected. Unlike almost all science fiction, the story is believable. The supporting cast which includes, Robert Duval, Morgan Freeman, Vanessa Redgrave and Maximilian Schell, is excellent. The special effects are effective and under the direction of Mimi Leder, Deep Impact moves smoothly from emotional scenes to outer space to action sequences.
The core of Deep Impact is the characters including government officials and how they would deal with the coming doom of our planet. The hard, gut wrenching choices are what drives the film. My only problem with it is that the star, Tea Leoni, is just not good enough to carry such a big movie. Mostly she stares with her mouth open as great actors perform around her. With Ryder, Blanchette or Paltrow Deep Impact could have been great.
Deep Impact breaks the mold of the standard disaster/action movie. Underneath the science and explosions are real people that you begin to care about and takes the time to show how they deal with a terrible event and how they over come it.",Deep Impact
132,WasiReviews,"A Mess Full of Annoying Characters, and a Boring Plot",6,25 March 2021,"For a so-called disaster movie there was a disappointing lack of any actual destruction. Most of their budget went to the actors such as the god awful anchor lady that completely ruined the film for me. She was just so annoying not because she was blonde, a woman or dumb but because she had no character, no emotion ffs. This isn't a slight against the actress. I don't condone direct attacks on Hollywood casts because they did a poor job but it's not really her fault anyways. The anchor had poorly written dialogue and she was supposed to be the main character yet somehow she has no husband, no kids, literally no friends just a dad she hates... wow slow clap great job writers you really reinvented the wheel with that characterization huh. Her voice didn't bother me. I actually thought it was kind of like a female Nicholas Cage voice with a higher tone. This movie suffers from Independence Day syndrome where you get like 4-5 different storylines across different locations in America and try to interweave the narrative. The only damned problem is the fact that in Independence Day the CGI was good, the practical effects were good and the disaster aspect was good. Even the actors like Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum were entertaining and charismatic, despite it's dumb reputation; at least Independence Day has some things going for it. I don't care how realistic the science in Deep Impact is;the fact of the matter is the whole MSNBC news report nonsense about them breaking the news every single time and showing how competent they are (which is clearly sponsored they don't even shy away from the fact the MSNBC logo is shown 100 times) is somehow even more annoying than the blonde anchor lady. That isn't to say the film doesn't have some positives. Morgan Freeman does a fantastic job as president giving God-fearing speeches and bad a** monologues for the brief 20 minutes or so he is actually in the film. The space crew had a lot of heart and believable backstories which I empathize with at least a few of them. The whole virtual meet between the crew and their families was a touching moment in the film. We get to see them leave their families earlier on before they went aboard the ship if we just spent the entire movie with the president (a little), the teenage married couple on Earth falling in love in the middle of doomsday and the space crew on the way to blow up the comet heading to Earth I would have given this film a far better rating.

142,seige-hound,"Impressive at parts, confusing and dated at others",6,3 April 2016,"I started watching Deep Impact out of curiosity. The premise itself is quite interesting; a world preparing for the inevitable extinction-level-event that will occur, but like the work of Roland Emmerich, the story is stretched far too thin, exploring too many characters.Any aspect of the story; the child who first found the meteor, the journalist who first uncovers the government conspiracy, the astronauts who try to stop the comet before it hits earth, or the older woman facing her inevitable demise, could've been their own standalone film, but instead the filmmakers decided to push everything into a single film, making every aspect shallow and rushed.By far my favourite part of the movie are the astronauts. The scene where they plant bombs on the comet in attempts to destroy or alter its course, is by far the most dramatic and emotionally resonant aspect of the film. The effects were also very good for the time. Thankfully, a movie called Sunshine with a similar but different premise explored this sort of story further. The worst part of the story is the kid's story. This kid discovered the comet that would destroy the earth, and all he cares about is boning some girl (and this is made clear in the film, when one of his classmates says in front of an entire school ""You can have sex with any girl you want"" for discovering the comet), to the point where he convinces her to marry him to save her family. That is really offensive and creepy, and shouldn't have ever been treated with the whimsy this film did. He could've used his apparent authority to save more people, perhaps his entire class, but instead he marries a 14 year old girl.The rest of the film is decent to mediocre. The President, played by Morgan Freeman, is incredibly interesting, as there is an air of sinister around him when he captures a journalist. But as I said before, most of the film is shallow due to how spread out the film's focus is.In Conclusion:Pros: -Astronaut storyline -Morgan Freeman as President -The Landing on the Comet scene -The impact of the first cometCons: -The Soundtrack -The kid storyline -The dialogue -Too many characters6/10",Deep Impact

145,joncheskin,"Cool Sci-Fi Action, Dumb Human Drama",5,12 January 2015,"Deep Impact is a movie out of a venerable Hollywood tradition, namely the disaster/Armageddon flick. This movie has a clear predecessor in the 1950s When Worlds Collide, which has about the same plot, and also in its focus on the human stories of the disaster, owes much to the nuclear catastrophe film On the Beach. My verdict is that, due to its upgraded 1990s special effects, it is clearly superior to the former movie, but due to its really dumb script, it is very inferior to the latter. The plot revolves around an accidental discovery by a high-school astronomy club. Leo the high school whiz-kid (Elijah Wood) notices something out of the ordinary in his telescope and gives a photo to a mentor at the big telescope in Arizona. The mentor concludes that it is a 7-mile long comet headed straight to earth to extinguish all life. The President (Morgan Freeman) covers up the bad news for a year, but a reporter with MSNBC (Tia Leoni) stumbles onto the story and forces his hand into a press conference. The President reveals not only the ELE (Extinction Level Event), but also a plan to stop the comet with nukes on board a space-ship, and it is game-on.If this movie had chosen to be either a action movie like Armageddon or a drama, like On the Beach, it probably would have worked a lot better. The action-sci-fi part is good with cool action scenes and monumental end of the world special effects. It is the best part of the movie.The human drama stuff, however, falls flat. Tia Leoni's and Elijah Wood's characters both are a bit annoying and the drama seems artificial. Maximillian Schell gives it his best as her estranged dad trying to reconnect before the big boom, but something just doesn't seem quite right. A romance between Leo and Sarah, in which Leo marries her at a young age to make her eligible for a survival lottery, has plenty of potential, but the romance has no chemistry and again seems rather artificial. Morgan Freeman is awesome as the President (I think he could be President), but there is not much focus on his part of the drama either--he just stands around looking presidential.This is a big contrast to a movie like On The Beach, where, in response to an end of the world radiation cloud, Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner, Anthony Perkins and Fred Astaire give amazing performances that seem to take you right to what it would be like if you were faced with a situation like this. In contrast, Deep Impact seems shallow, with a lot of plots and none really given their justice.In some ways, Bruce Willis's Armageddon, which came out in the same year, is a bit more consistent--Willis does not make any attempt at profundity, the movie is just a lot of cool action. Deep Impact might have been better a bit shallower.",Deep Impact

In Deep Impact, I was rooting for the humans and was really feeling the hopelessness of the impending annihilation.For the first time ever, I have absolutely nothing bad to say about a movie that is in the disaster category. I like that feeling...a lot.",Deep Impact

It has a good story , superior special effects and good acting led by the ever reliable Robert Duvall. There is a really touching scene near the end where the astronauts say goodbye to their families.The movie contains enough excitement and tension in the first 90 minutes to hold one's interest.

But Deep Impact is certainly the least cheesy of those I've seen to date - rather it's the most realistic in terms of the human relationships that are a big focus. And as others have mentioned, it's not an unrealistically triumphant outcome for humankind.One of my favourite aspects of this movie was that in the end, the U.S. had to seek sanctuary with foreign powers, and for once they weren't the saviours of the planet.

It came out the same year as the dumb, but fun ""Armageddeon"" and , yes, coming from me it's the superior of the two, but it's overall pointless to say which one is better seeming how many people here seem to enjoy both extremely equally.Anyway, it's full of fascinating science thrills, intense outer-space shuttle trips, political debate which is headed supposedly by the first Black president ( Morgan Freeman ) and is heart warming and heartbreaking all at the same time!ANyway, the rest of the cast become part of the drama and not one feels out of place ( not even a young Elijah Wood! ), it's executive-produced by Steven Spielberg ( a wise funder ) and was Mimi Ledar's second feature-length film with the first being her other under-rated action film, ""The Peacemaker.""

The President (Morgan Freeman) has devised a plan to keep as many humans alive as possible. Scientists have built giant caves big enough to hold a million people, and the government is going to have a lottery to pick 800,000 people to live in the caves along with 200,000 scientists, artists and doctors. Deep Impact has enough depth and story to keep the audience interested, but everything takes too darn long. The story moves at an extremely slow pace, and the actors seem to tire with the script. Also, the scenes in which the bunch of astronauts try to blow the comet up are entirely unbelievable and pointless since we know that the comet is going to hit Earth anyway.

That's not to say that there is not some good sci-fi in there, or that the special effects are weak (they are quite good actually) just that ""Deep Impact"" has more on its mind. It is the interaction of the characters that is front and center, and for the most part those relationships ring true.Tea Leoni plays the overwhelmed-by-events thing a bit too hard, but Morgan Freeman is quite convincing as the President, and Robert Duvall and the rest of the shuttle crew are also good. Leelee Sobiesky and Elijah Wood did well playing worried young lovers, forced by events to grow up a bit too fast.This movie was not the self-proclaimed ""blockbuster"" that ""Armageddon"" was, but it does not seem to have intended to be one. It's a slightly more thoughtful look at the same subject, and profits in the comparison.

155,jmmustchin,One of the best films ever made,10,6 May 2018,"""Deep Impact"" is definitely the greatest disaster movie ever made, and one of the greatest films of all time.
It does follow most other disaster movies in focusing on special effects and disaster sequences. Mind you, I'm not condemning those other disaster movies; they are often quite enjoyable. Deep Impact, however, focuses more on the lives affected by the incoming comet. The disaster sequence is literally saved for the end.
The plot is scripted brilliantly, marvelously combining the stories of two different people who never cross paths. Two people whose lives are deeply affected by the incoming catastrophe. One is a news reporter name Jenny Lerner (played by Tea Leoni), the other is a teenager named Leo Beiderman (played by Elijah Wood).
The government and NASA, after discovering the incoming comet, come up with a three-fold plan to save the planet - or at least a portion of the population.
The government's response to the disaster is mostly realistic. They really WOULD declare martial law, ban travel, etc. They WOULD NOT, however, allow anyone other than themselves to be saved (apart from those that might be useful).
The special effects scenes are quite good and were quite revolutionary for its time.
The movie is powerful and emotional. A good family movie.",Deep Impact

The FX are great, but used in service of the story. I really care about the people - even the terminally bland Tea Leoni. Technical accuracy is impressive - far better than the laughably bad Armageddon.Mimi Leder has quickly joined the ranks of my favorite directors.

159,FANatic-10,Meteor movie hits with a big thud,4,4 April 1999,"Given the great cast and Mimi Leder's semi-promising direction of ""The Peacemaker"", I had hopes ""Deep Impact"" would be superior to the usual disaster film.  Wrong! Instead it seemed to spotlight everything I hate about these films-cardboard characters, cheesy special effects, gaping plot holes, etc.  Basically, you have too many plot lines filled with too many characters you don't care about. I have to say Tea Leoni really embarrassed herself, and I had liked her on TV and in ""Flirting with Disaster"".  Here, though, she's laughable as an anchorwoman who makes Deborah Norville look like Journalist of the Year. All I can say is that I hope Morgan Freeman, Robert Duvall, Vanessa Redgrave and Maximilian Schell were all paid very well, because if they weren't they really wasted their time!

They are men of intelligence,character, emotion and depth(Clinton came close), they are not puppets or showbiz freaks who think that the world is their stage. They have a lot of responsibility for the lives in their domain so they need to empathise with them.  I think his character resonated with strength cos it's a quality that people in identify with but what really brought him alive was the quiet dignity with which he fleshes his roles.  Tea Leoni was annoying in her role; she seemed lost and didn't quite make out to be the powerful career girl that she was playing.  Max Schell was touching as the father trying to re-bond with her.  Their final scene was moving, choosing to go out together.  Ms Redgrave as always was classy as the mom dying of cancer and Elijah Wood and Leelee Sobieski were rivetting as the youngsters who had to break away from their parents and start anew with her youngest sibling. 
The astronauts last scene was poignant as they bravely made their peace with their cause and loved ones.

Instead of audiovisual spectacle this disaster movie, and it does conform to the genre, offers something different on the human element with a complex and well-developed ancillary cast sub-plot mesh with everyday issues all suddenly coloured by the threat of heaven-borne apocalypse. There's great actors and genuine humour that gives this film a lot more heart and soul than your usual sci-fi or end-of-the-world-is-nigh film with all the best special effects and CGI the new millennium can offer. A more more incisive and more thoughtful film than many critics seem to have admitted. With all the news media focus I even thought of Network. A disaster flick more touchy-feely than scream-like hell. With just the advent of IT evident it's also a little naive and cute, a testament to the brave Nineties.

Also the love story thet developed between 2 prepubescent teenyboppers that get married is so fake.

I hope that they read these words before such a thing happens:1) If a massive tidal wave is sweeping towards you at 100 mph, then running away won't do much good, or at least you should have thought about doing that much sooner.2) If everyone not hidden in the underground shelter is going to die, then giving your son an expensive watch to use as a bargaining tool might not be very useful.3) If your newlywed wife would rather get smashed to pieces by a massive tidal wave, than spend the rest of her life with you, then things aren't working out, and maybe you should spend some time apart.4) If your daughter would rather stay with you and die horribly under a massive tidal wave, rather than spending the rest of her life with the nice young man she just married, then for heavens sake, speak up!5) If you are the head of NASA and have to produce a mission plan to save the world, try not to include such points as; flying through the comets tail, giving the astronauts less time than a commercial break to complete their mission, giving them bombs that don't work properly or having a crew who suffer from ageism.However, in the slew of meteor films (we'll, 2) that came at us in 1998, Deep Impact had one major advantage over Armageddon, it had an accurate title.

Make sure you have a woman, black man, and old guy on the space crew, a black man for president (with a team of black advisers) and a crew of female White House reporters. Oh, but for Mission Control, get that guy from That 70s Show--he looks
like he could work there.Usually, I have no problem with actors--they usually way outclass the writing. But
Tea Leoni is AWFUL as a White House reporter--she speaks like a dumb blonde.
She is not sharp and articulate, and her family backstory of her not forgiving her dad for leaving and marrying another woman--is not convincing.The space crew OF COURSE has a couple mavericks aboard, who, even though they signed up to follow orders from Mission Control (which was largely absent in this movie, btw--unlike Apollo 13, when Mission Control was a real entity), choose to make their OWN selfish decisions, putting everybody at risk. So the one guy actually says, ""I'm going in!"" to dislodge a nuke-drillbit from being stuck (it didn't go deep enough). Of course, there's plenty of room for him to plunge into the depths, even though the nuke drillbit itself is narrower than his waist. And of course, he has almost ONE MINUTE to spare to get back to the surface, before the sun hits, and starts creating steam geysers all over the place. As for that, the crotchety old pilot (Duvall) decides to make his OWN decision too, and so much for discipline. Everyone just does what they want. And what about the stupidity of following a comet in its coma (tail), where all the rocks and debris can hit and vaporize the spacecraft? If they can go as fast as the comet, why not come from the outside? Stupid. Of course, the spaceship gets hit by boulders, and it's like a Star Trek episode for a few minutes, with smoke and electrical sparks flying, but they fix everything, so it's okay. Realistically, their mission fails, so later on they decide to ram their nuke-filled ship into the 2nd big comet chunk, and go out in a blaze of glory, while it disintegrates harmlessly before hitting Earth.Another huge problem I had with the movie was the ""lottery""--where 1 million people are chosen to live in a vast underground bunker in Missouri, but 200,000 engineers and scientists are already chosen. So of course, they pick Tea Leoni, because that's probable, right? And the entire family of the kid? I thought it was RANDOMLY selected by a computer? Such BS. If anything, it shows that you cannot trust the government to pick randomly--those in power just take care of their own. And if that Elijah Wood kid isn't enough, he decides to MARRY his girlfriend, so she can go as ""his wife"". But she doesn't WANT to go, and would rather hang back and DIE with her parents! Her parents don't force her to go, so she stays back. But Elijah, once he and his family travel from VA to MO and are ready to enter the bunkers, says, ""I'm not going"" and his parents sob, and say ""good luck, son"" and give him a watch to trade in barter. First of all, what parent would think a 15-year old kid's ""love"" is worth his life? Most parents would demand he stay, no matter what. Secondly, who's going to want that watch, in a world that will experience an extinction-level event?So he travels with Mexican immigrants (what?) and goes back to the house of the girl, but she and her family have left. So he takes the motorcycle and heads to the highway and finds them, and THEN she wants to go with him?? Oh, and the first comet hits already, and the tidal wave it causes is traveling the SPEED OF SOUND, but Elijah takes the girl, and a baby (where did that come from?) and outruns the tidal wave with the motorcycle! Yay! He heads to higher ground, and all is well.Oh, and while all this is going on, there's a lot of schmaltzy music cloyingly dripped over every single scene, and lots of people saying tearful goodbyes to each other.And Tea Leoni also sacrifices her own free pass to give to a fellow reporter and her baby. How heroic! Come on. She chooses instead to die at the foot of a massive tidal wave on a childhood beach with her estranged father. Oooh.The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because of the screen presence of Morgan Freeman, Robert Duvall and Maximilian Schell. The rest of the cast (even Vanessa Redgrave) was forgettable. Also, the tidal wave and destruction was pretty cool. Those who complain about special effects will ALWAYS complain, but I had no problem with the effects, but the schmaltz, the unrealistic maverick decisions of the space crew, the unrealistic heroism, the music, and the bad acting of Tea Leoni (a major character).If you don't mind schmaltzy ""blockbuster"" family-type movies, then you might actually find this movie enjoyable.",Deep Impact
186,brijess-2,Very moving.,7,12 July 1999,"I found Deep Impact to be a very good ""study"" on how we has humans, may react to an E.L.E. (see this movie for details on that.) The special effects were good, but the best thing about this movie was the focus on the characters. This wasn't loud and stupid as ""that other asteroid movie."" This film will entertain you and mostly, touch your heart. You actually feel the doom that is about to reach these people, and to me, that is good film making.About the only thing I could pick on would be the performance of Téa Leoni. To me, she was never convincing. She seemed down and depressed all of the time, even when she was doing the news. Very odd performance.I give this film a B+",Deep Impact
187,Thaleia,A Moving Force,8,8 September 1999,A movie about an asteroid on a crash course with earth.  It concentrates on the survival of the human race for the future rather than the cool stuff we can do while we're still here.  Family relationships become the primary focus as each person contemplates life as they know it coming to an end. Definitely the better of the two comet movies (the other being Armageddon) it plays on emotional effects rather than special ones.,Deep Impact
188,philipposathina,"for the ones who have not seen this film yet: It' s never too late to watch one of the most honest, touching, realistic and scary movies Hollywood has ever made!",10,19 December 2016,"When i was young i used to be easily impressed by movies. As time went on getting me less pure and innocent, this strange relationship of mine with ""fiction"" started to fail, which i think is healthy and understandable. And then of course there was a time when i got really demanding as a viewer, not been impressed and influenced easily by every single film that tried to shock me this or the other way. ""Deep Impact"" has been one of the very few films -maybe the only Hollywood made one- which influenced my deeper feelings that much, as to make me have nightmares about it. ""Deep Inpact"" is not totally Hollywood cliché free. Yet they are not annoying and seem totally acceptable given the story the film is about. And unlike ""Armagedon"" - its ""twin"" film since it was released at the same time and had more or less the same story to tell- which was full of cliché and stereotypes from the beginning to its end and therefore predictable and boring to death, ""Deep Impact"" manages to avoid easy solutions and focusing on real world characters makes the viewer live through them the feelings of the ultimate desperation and agony the unavoidable hyper disaster of the end of the world, their own and their beloved ones end, make them feel. This film is not just another ""science fiction"" movie. Actually its a 99% science and only 1% fiction one. And the events as they are illustrated in it, from the beginning to the end, are so convincing therefore upsetting that may enter the world of your nightmares too -like they have mine. For we all know that a deep impact like the one this film depicts is anything but an impossible real world scenario and if, or better when it occurs the way people will be informed about it and will speechless have to face and experience it will be more or less exactly like this film shows.",Deep Impact
189,thirdi,"A good disaster movie, but could've been better",7,22 February 2004,"To compare ""Deep Impact"" with ""Armageddon"" is natural of course, due to their similar plots.  I'm sure the makers of ""Deep Impact"" feel their version is the superior one due to its supposed ""realism"" and its wider focus of the planetary social ramifications of such an event.  Indeed, it is pretty interesting to think about what governments and people would do down here on Earth in this situation.  And ""Deep Impact"" is slightly superior in this respect, as there are a wide range of Earth-bound characters and plotlines that reflect the sense of doom this scenario presents.  This was not really explored much in ""Armageddon"", as they chose to concentrate primarily on the mission to stop the comet.Most of the actors do a fine job here, and its always great to see Morgan Freeman and James Cromwell work.  Sure, some of the moments are a little cliche, and despite having the always reliable Robert Duvall, there's a good amount of cheesiness in the space sequences.  (Not near as much as in ""Armageddon"" though, one of the corniest movies of all time).  It seems Tea Leoni is a source of some criticism, and while I'm not her biggest fan, I thought she was more than adequate.  Elijah Wood and Leelee Sobieski weren't given enough to do, given their talents, but both turned in good performances.The special effects in both movies are nicely done, if not realistic.  But I would've liked to have seen both films explore the science behind this phenomenon more in depth.  I suppose they felt it would be too boring for the masses who want to see a bang-em-up disaster movie, but I think they underestimate the interest the public would have in learning more about how and why this can happen.  In ""Deep Impact"", the presidential press conference was a perfect oppurtunity to do this, maybe bring in a scientist to get more technical and put things in perspective, but they basically just skimmed over it.I really wanted to love this movie, as I was a little disappointed with ""Armageddon"" and find the subject of both films fascinating and scary.  But unfortunately, ""Deep Impact"", while overall an entertaining and solid disaster movie, also falls short of the grand masterpiece this idea deserves.  In other words, the ultimate ""end of the world asteroid"" movie still just hasn't been made yet in my humble opinion.  Eventually, someone will come along and ""think outside the box"" and really delve into a realistic exploration of Earth Crossing Objects and the hazard they represent.  And how amazing it is that in a matter of hours, the entire human race and every living thing on Earth could be wiped away without a trace.",Deep Impact

191,zaisjr,Amazed that people liked this movie.,3,2 February 2010,"This movie is a perfect indicator of what Hollywood thinks are REAL human emotions. It also shows how Hollywood has a complete lack of scientific knowledge. Sure, if this movie were released in the 80's I'd understand. But it wasn't. I really thought this movie might be good, but I left the theater wanting my money back. I know this movie will always be compared to Armageddon, but let's be honest here. We expect special effects and crappy plot structure from Michael Bay movies. Yet Armageddon had better plot structure than Deep Impact. Matter of fact, I wasn't all that sad about some people dying on Deep Impact. It's like watching a cheesy horror movie where everyone is stupid... and you get so sick of it that you finally just say ""Aw heck, just kill them will ya?"". The acting was mostly awful. The plot was predictable. I remember telling my girlfriend ""How much you want to bet the attempt to destroy the comet will fail and the astronauts will blow themselves up in a desperate attempt to stop the comet?"" A few minutes later.... you guessed it. The only actor or actress who I really saw with genuine acting in this movie was Morgan Freeman. Even Robert Duvall had a lackluster performance. I thought the love story between the boy and girl was lame. The movie had all sorts of symbolism that went to waste. There was only one good thing about the movie. The music. James Horner's music was beautiful. It was so good, but yet wasted, that he practically copied the music and used it again for Bicentennial Man. There are so many better movies out there than this one. Please do yourself a favor and don't waste your time watching it.",Deep Impact

In some ways, it was better than the other movie that came out around the same time, Armageddon. I liked some of the relationships, including that of the reporter and her father. I like some of the philosophical questions which are addressed about out relationships and sacrifice. The main drawback of the movie is that it absolutely drips with sentimentality and appeals to God and patriotism. The blinded astronaut talking to his newborn baby who is waving a stuffed rocket!!!

193,juanbks15,5 out of 10 just because of the ending.,5,18 June 2020,"I always have liked this type of movies, where the main theme is about a coming natural disaster and stuff, and I'm really looking at them these days.This one is... not bad but not good either. First, it was an interesting plot (kind of cliche, but come on, an asteroid crashing our planet is the first idea coming in mind when thinking about apocalyptic scenarios), and I think the main thing I didn't liked and made it hard to watch was the characters. Personally, no one generated anything on me, I didn't care about them and I think this was a problem. Here's the thing: When this doctor dies in the mission, no one ever talks about him, no one even cared about him and the commander guy just saying ""it's okay, sit down. It's okay."" WHAT? Or even Leo's parents letting him go searching for Sarah with hours left for the impact and just saying ""Take care."" made me wonder what the hell did the writers where thinking. The story following Jenny and her father was really boring, I didn't even care. Her performance was below average, didn't even showed emotions, I didn't feel them.But, wait, there is a little positive I got from this. The ending. When the tripulation was about to destroy the comet and their families say goodbye. That was well portrayed by everyone, it was emotional. Just because of that scene I give it a 5 out of 10. The crashing of the first meteor was pretty impressive too.Overall, I don't know. If you like disaster movies you can give it a go but don't expect to be mind-blowed by it. And like me, if you found the main character's stories weak, it's going to be a long journey, believe me.",Deep Impact

197,Kane20,Review - Deep Impact,10,9 July 2012,"Deep Impact is an excellent title for this equally excellent movie, and it fits the movie both physically and emotionally. This movie came out not long before Armageddon, but it seems like it was pretty much pounded and bypassed. I think the summer movies that came out after it stole a lot of the thunder, which Deep Impact deserved. The critics were also a bit harsh on it, and I don't think they should've been (but that's just my opinion). The apocalyptic disaster concept is similar to that of Armaggedon, but instead of an asteroid in collision course with the earth, it's a comet, and it's a great movie. Yes, it is. I got it from the library on DVD and watched it, and I loved it.The story starts out as Leo Biederman (Elijah Wood) in Richmond, Virginia, discovers an uncharted object in the night sky and report it to an astronomer in Arizona, who determines that it's a comet and it's on a trajectory that will bring it into collision with the earth. While driving to release this news, the astronomer is killed in a car accident. A year later, in Washington D. C., MSNBC news reporter Jenny Lerner (Téa Leoni) is investigating the resignation of U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Alan Rittenhouse (James Cromwell), who says he's resigned because his wife is sick. But Jenny, as she investigates further, comes to think he's been cheating on his wife with someone called Ele, and resigned because he was about to be found out. Soon, however, at her computer at the news station, and then at a press conference at which the president (Morgan Freeman) makes an address, Jenny learns her error: it's not a mistress named Ele, it's E. L. E. (Extinction Level Event), specifically the comet we learned about at the beginning of the movie. After this, the story really starts to develop, leading to a movie full of emotion, soul, great plot points, recurring themes, and much more.There have been many different types of apocalyptic disaster thrillers, with many different types of plot, tone, characters, and action. Deep Impact takes an excellent approach at the story. It allows one to feel the emotion of the movie, enjoy the special effects, and the action near the end, and at same time feel the emotion of the characters, and still feel the great effect on everybody worldwide. It has an excellent tone and balance. It has very dynamic and developed story lines, and great themes, including, especially in the second half of the movie, the value in life, in the world, in the environment (not mentioned in the film, but can be felt), etc. It even gets a bit existential toward the end, which I like. All of the story lines are fully appreciated, an none really outdoes the other. They balanced them very well - the Jenny Lerner storyline, the Leo Biederman storyline, and all the others. Also, the movie was well- cast, and I thought it was well-acted, and the characters were very well set up and developed. Man, it's really hard to put into words what I felt about the movie.My viewing experience of this film was great. This film started out, and then gradually captured my interest and liking more and more, all the while developing it's dynamic tone, characters, story, and emotion. The actors, even the well known Morgan Freeman, really blended into their roles - I really saw them as their characters. By the time the movie ended, I loved it. It also has good special effects which I enjoyed, but the core of the film, what I really loved about it, was the story, the soul, and the emotion. The movie certainly pries deep into emotions during it's nearly two hour running time. It has everything a great movie really needs. Even the action at the midpoint of the film and near the end was good, it has the strong emotional and soul-filled background and tone to back it up – it's not just full-out summer action - and it actually matters what happens to the characters during these action scenes. What if the world really were coming to an end soon? This movie really pries deep into the emotional aspect of that question. Deep Impact is an underrated, misunderstood gem.My Rating: **** (out of ****)For more reviews, please visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com",Deep Impact

199,JonB-2,No Impact is more like it...,1,13 December 1998,"If you want to see a good ""The World Is About to Be Destroyed By A Giant Asteroid"" movie, rent ""When Worlds Collide.""  Deep Impact is so full of calculated audience manipulation and unlikely character behavior that it strains credulity (almost as much as the bad science in the film.)On top of all this, what was hyped as a special effects spectacular really isn't; if you saw the trailer, you saw 90% of the Apocalyptic effects shots in the film...Now, ask yourself this -- you're a journalist with connections who has a chance to escape the disaster.  Do you turn that down to go visit your father, who you don't get along with, and probably die in the process? Or... you're the parents of a teen-age boy who suddenly decides to give up safety to chase half way across country for a girl he only just met.  Do you let him go because, well, gosh, he's in love?  Or do you drag his butt into the shelter and smack him back to his senses?Oh, a final quibble -- and this isn't a spoiler, because the shots were splattered all over the trailer...  Explain to me how an asteroid that's seen streaking across the sky (i.e., in a shallow trajectory) manages to then hit the ocean coming straight down.  Loopy physics, treated with about as much care as the character development in the film.  If you want big-time destruction from above, see the aforementioned ""When Worlds Collide"" or, if you must, ""Armageddon.""  Otherwise, skip this soap opera, because it truly has ""No Impact.""",Deep Impact
200,imap-05232,The best within the genre,10,22 October 2021,"Intelligent script regarding an often told story. For me as an expert in the field, the by far most realistic, and exiting catastrophe film ever made; at least up to now.Excellent acting of a superb cast with no 'comic relief characters', as it has already been said in the the top review.IMHO the movie is tremendously underrated. It obviously is not serving the mainstream, preferring the max. Overrated testosterone-dripping 'Armageddon'.Highly recommended!",Deep Impact
201,pitabox987,The more serious Armageddon,6,14 October 2021,"Just like Armageddon an object from space threatens to destroy humanity (one is a comet the other is an asteroid, quite simply its a somewhat more realistic story than the other attempts to view the scenario from a serious point of view While the other is a more 'fun' story.The story isn't bad but the over sentimentality detracts from the story, in some ways is too much. - I also wonder how much actual research the writers actually did as the more serious aspect is ruined purely by bad science, some are obvious ones, like the tail of the comet facing the wrong direction, or the fact that tsunamis actually slow down as they reach the shoreline.The acting is about on par with Armageddon, the more serious aspect is captured pretty well, but it's hard to compare with it's rival movie as it approaches everything from a different viewpoint.If you were to ask which of the two movies was better I would probably reply Armageddon, but such a question is like asking is whether Skittles are better than M&M's, a lot of people like both and don't really favour one or the other.I just say enjoy the movie for what it is.",Deep Impact
202,hoju_31,meh,5,14 April 2009,"Firstly, ""Armageddon"" makes this movie look like an Oscar-winner. That being said, there are plenty of problems with this one as well. Why would you give yourself only one chance to stop a comet? If the entire human race were at stake, you would think countries would be throwing money around hand over fist to build as many spacecrafts as possible. The whole estranged daughter crap was pointless and had no place in a disaster movie. Why can't you just give people what they came for, a disaster movie? I think Morgan Freeman is a great actor but he didn't do very well here. I think a funny scene was the toward the end when the astronauts were saying goodbye. Doesn't the Russian get to say goodbye to his family? Of course not, because he's not an American. Robert Duvall did the only decent job in this movie. I wanted to kick that kid in the skull (the one they named the comet after). Why did he run away from the ark to find that girl? Did he think it was better if they both died instead of just her? Good thinking. At least it didn't have that spontaneous death-inducing Aerosmith song in it or the antichrist, Ben Afleck.",Deep Impact
203,Kiwi-7,A satisfactory Friday night family video,6,19 February 1999,"Judging by other comments, most people either hate or love this movie. Well, my family and I thought it was okay.  We weren't bored, we weren't moved...but we did talk about it afterwards.The biggest problem is that it tries to be too many things:  a disaster flick, a ""realistic"" response to crisis, a ""people"" film, a ""science"" film, a special-effects film, even a bit of a comedy (at least in spots).  It does well with none of these.  And in the end, you don't really care that much about the people who end up dead...or the ones that don't.My 11-year-old raised several questions after it finished, though, which we went on to discuss.  What would happen if a meteor or asteroid this big WAS coming towards the earth?  Wouldn't a nuclear blast deflect it?  It wouldn't take much deflection if you hit it from far enough away, would it?  If a big meteor or asteroid hit the ocean, would it make a wave that big?  What about earthquakes?  If it did make a wave that big, what would happen down here in New Zealand, a long way from the impact portrayed in the film, but where most of the population lives along the coast?  And, wouldn't there be a problem with genetic diversity if you took your ""ark"" animals 2-by-2 as they implied in the film?And then we went on to talk about the making of the film itself.  We all agreed that there were some scenes ""missing"", like the finding of the computer disk near the beginning, and perhaps one before the first attempt to approach the meteor to build up the anticipation...and we talked about how those scenes were probably written and maybe shot, but somehow ended up on the cutting room floor...and for what reasons.  We also talked about the computer graphics manipulation that allows for disaster film special effects like we saw here.My husband and I give this film a 6--okay for a stay-at-home Friday night video but nothing remarkable.  My daughter gave it an 8.  I reckon the discussion afterwards was worth the video rental cost, though, and think this is a fine film for science-oriented families who talk about what they watch...there's plenty of fuel for thought.",Deep Impact

205,TexVanWinkle,NBC's most expensive made-for-TV movie yet,5,15 April 2001,"When I first saw it, I thought, ""That's going to be the worst movie I see for a long time.""  Then I saw Armageddon, which surprised me by being actually *much* worse than Deep Impact.  Having just now watched D.I. for the second time (on television), I have to say it's not as bad this time, maybe because I've seen so many bad movies since then.But it's still not something that deserves to be on the big screen.  It's pure television melodrama, with a huge budget.  It has its moments, namely in the script.  Tea Leoni does a better job than I gave her credit for the first time.  And I give it some credit for having the courage to kill some characters you're urged (and you are urged) to care about.That doesn't change the fact, though, that it's still woefully contrived, predictable, and downright unrealistic to the point of being annoying.  But perhaps the most annoying part is the epic product placement.  Forget six degrees of Kevin Bacon; let's see how many connections to NBC we can find in Deep Impact.  We have MSNBC practically painted on each frame of the film. (Which only made it more unrealistic.  MSNBC as a primary news source? Gimme a break.)  We have a former director of ""E.R."" as director, and Dreamworks (produces E.R.) as the production company.  And we have a veritable who's who of current and past actors of NBC programs: Tea Leoni (The Naked Truth), Laura Innes (E.R.), Ron Eldard (E.R.), Richard Schiff (The West Wing), Blair Underwood (L.A. Law.), Bruce Weitz (Hill Street Blues).  Am I leaving anyone out?  I don't know how much NBC forked over for this two-hour long commercial, but they didn't do themselves any favors with it.  It just makes me question their judgment that much more.Better than I thought originally, upon second viewing, but only because I was watching it on TV, where it belonged in the first place.",Deep Impact
206,Kylic,Deep Impact A.K.A Too Deep *Spoilers*,8,18 November 1999,"Deep Impact certainly has a more plausible concept than the cartoonish ""Armageddon"" which can't seem to take its self seriously, but the film still suffers from some noticeable problems:1.) Waaay too much time was spent on Jenny Lerners boring family feud triangle as opposed to other characters such as President Tom Beck.
2.) Does ""every"" disaster movie have to have a romantic subplot?3.) Don't see this movie for the sole purpose of the CGI effect since 90% of them were shown in the trailers.4.) Nice for the producers to act PC by tacking on the token Russian who was so cardboard you could punch right through him. And he didn't even get a chance to say goodbye to his friends/family. What was up with that?5.) And since we're on the subject... Gee, it would have been nice we were shown how other countries were handling the impending doom from the sky, but all we got were a couple of lines from Beck on how the comets impact affected other nations, ""Oh ya, the wave hit Europe and Africa too, millions were lost, the Dow Jones dropped five points, high today was 75, yada, yada, yada, yada.6.)

Just because Deep Impact didn't have everything going ""BOOM"" like Armageddon did, doesn't make it a boring movie. I was caught up in the narrative, the characters and the ""heart"" in this movie.

209,TanQ,If a comet falls in the ocean will anyone care?,5,9 July 2009,"In a way, Deep Impact was very lucky it opened opposite of Armageddon and thus will forever be remembered as being the better film. The problem, however, is that Armageddon didn't set the bar very high.In a strange way, Deep Impact shares many things with Dante's Peak, another disaster movie released alongside it's dumber cousin, Volcano. Both movies concentrate mainly on the personal relationships of the characters rather than the actual disaster, they both contain some laughable science and both movies climax in an orgy of destruction. The difference, though, is that Dante's Peak does it better.In my opinion, it all comes down to editing.Dante's Peak clips along at a good pace while Deep Impact drags it's feet like a movie on smack. Stereotypical characters drift around in a haze of self-importance, trying to impart upon the audience that they are engaged in something relevant. But in the end, does anyone really care about them? We're given a stock selection of wunderkinder love, a 30-something year-old journalist obsessed with her aged parents divorce (Jenny, freakin' get over it, already!), ageist astronauts, and, the standout performance in a film that exists to shame actors, Morgan Freeman as the president. Surrounding them are a bevy of characters that muddy the film so much that it becomes possible to take extended breaks for popcorn/bathroom breaks/phone calls to your entire extended family.And that is the heart of the films problem. Too many characters. Now I know, the title Deep Impact is most likely a clever reference to the emotional impact the comet has on the people dealing with it but the film loses it's focus rather early and never truly regains it.Being a fan of the genre, I was disappointed in Deep Impact. As a disaster film, Deep Impact, ultimately, is a disaster. It has none of the emotional impact as When Worlds Collide - another cosmic collision flick where people actually behave realistically when faced with their annihilation. Nor does it have the sense of fun that all disaster films need to lighten the moments of darkness - like those provided by Helen Hayes in Airport. Instead, we're served stereotypes, and a too-short city crushing.I think the worst crime that Deep Impact commits is that you have all of these people halfheartedly trying to survive the cataclysm but none of them really know why they are bothering. In The Poseidon Adventure you really feel that everyone is trying to live for something. It's gritty, dramatic and there is a feeling of urgency. Deep Impact has none of this. And, because of that, it comes out as not a drama or a disaster film, but more of a drasaster - we're given the story of too many people we care too little about and too few of them suffer horrible, on screen deaths.The only things that really stood out for me were the lines not said in the film. Maximilian Schell telling his adult daughter that he's a lot happier NOT being married to Vanessa Redgrave and that she's an adult so grow up, already.

I think very interesting is the way the Americans try to rescue themselves. There are caves where about 1 million people can survive. The rest has to die.

213,Fiona G.,"Flat, boring, predictable",2,16 January 2000,"It is interesting to see that somehow the whole world only consists of the US and only the US is capable to handle the ultimate problem. The patriotic stick was swung at you in ""Deep Impact"" big time, much like in its rival ""Armageddon."" For example, the complete destruction on the other side of the Atlantic - England, France, Germany, etc. - is mentioned in a single sentence. The russian crew member on board of the shuttle doesn't even deserve to say good-bye to his family. Mainly he seemed to serve only lines to the rest of the cast. And the music score did its best as well to make you want to hold tight to a ""Stars & Stripes.""It might, just might, be possible that instead of sending a bunch of twenty-something Americans up there to save the world, to use the time of one year until ""deep impact"" to gather specialists from around the world to handle the problem. This is not even to mention some of the highly illogical moments in the movie (how is it possible to outrace a wave of water which is moving at supersonic speed on a motorbike?).So, what was positive about this movie? I mentioned the Russian protagonist as flat? Well, that doesn't make him much worse than the rest of the cast - although the actor here probably even didn't have a chance to show he can act. Most of the cast would do better by staying in sit-coms. Only Morgan Freeman and Maximilian Schell stood out in their performances.

214,joseph t,Pretty good...,7,21 January 2007,"Yes, the story is a bit short on scientific accuracy, but, come on, it's a movie, not a science documentary. Suspend disbelief for a bit and go along for the ride. It was a bit of a twist to actually show a fragment of the comet hit the Earh's surface, and the resulting devastation. The other mega-disaster film out that year, Armageddon, avoided this unpleasant outcome. So here is a bit of realism. The idea of a nuclear explosion fragmenting the comet nucleus into two pieces rather than pulverizing it is also a nod to scientific accuracy, as some theories about comet composition predict this effect. But, two films out in the same year with a similar premise had me on comet-asteroid overload.The cast is fairly strong. Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall add their measure of gravitas to an otherwise unknown cast. Tea Leoni is not very good in this film, delivering her lines with a somewhat wooden and dry cadence. Also, the estranged child syndrome is in full force with Tea trying to reconcile her feelings for her remarried father (Schnell) and her still-living mother (Redgrave). I'll admit to having a bit of a crush on Mary McCormick, so I liked her in the role of a crew member of the doomed space mission. Still, I had the feeling hers was a bit of a token appearance, the addition of a female crew member in a nod to ""diversity"" and political correctness.The notion of the new-age Ark preserving a select few in the deep caves of mid-America reminded me of the scheme Dr. Stangelove hatched at the end of the movie of the same name. Here the world-ending event is natural rather than man-made, but the idea is the same. It is an arresting and sobering thought. On the one hand, we want humanity to survive, but what is to become of those left behind? How to they deal with their fate? An interesting dilemma that might make a decent movie in itself.Anyway, Deep Impact is a good film.

What you'll never see in a Michael Bay movie, and what puts ""Deep Impact"" on the map for me, are performances with the subtlety of Robert Duvall's and Billy Bob Thornton's; brutal, heart-wrenching scenes like the final moment with Tea Leoni and her father on the beach; and rich character development that leaves you unable to ooh and aah over the destruction, because your connection with the characters leaves you horrified at the loss.

I liked the whole spaceship crew, and, unlike a lot of others it seems, I would've liked to see more of the Elijah Wood-Leelee Sobieski romance. Morgan Freeman was someone I'd like to have as a president, but the one person I could have really done without was Tea Leoni. Her whole story with her dad was boring and she never seemed to have any emotion.The special effects were pretty good, I liked the tidal wave.By the way, this doesn't compare with Armageddon, they're so totally different. I liked both, but Armageddon is mostly comedy and action, while Deep Impact is more drama.This movie is okay, but it would've been a lot better if they would've left Tea Leoni out.

Armageddon was scientifically inaccurate and in usual Michael Bay fashion a lackluster movie with an incredibly obscene waste of money on special effects and A list talent having to work with lackluster scripts and only being hired to be big names in the credits. What made this movie much better was the disaster was the main focus of the movie, it was more scientifically accurate, and most importantly the cast was an ensemble who were believable as normal people trying to figure their way around the coming calamity. Morgan Freeman gave an incredible performance as President Beck and he was believable as a president who was grappling with his own conscience as he knew what was coming would mean for the country and it's people. That is perfectly displayed in the scene where he solemnly tells the world what is coming after he believes it's too late to stop the comets.

221,scubergmu,"Realistic, Entertaining, Underappreciated",8,25 June 2001,"The film ""Deep Impact"" often draws a lot of comparisons to 1998's other Earth vs. Celestial Body film, ""Armageddon"". Aside from that concept however, the two could not have been more unalike. While Armageddon got by on its big-time stars, rampant sense of humor, and the best special effects $140 million could buy, Deep Impact managed to be much more substantial with an ensemble cast of Hollywood midlisters, life-like earthbound drama, just roughly one half the budget of its summer competitor. What is impressive and interesting about Deep Impact is the way it manages to present a reasonably realistic depiction of people dealing with a situation such as a possible apocalypse. The ensemble cast from all walks of American life is reminiscent of other worldwide disaster pics such as ""Independence Day"" and ""The Day After"". Although the film is not exactly free of technical flaws, (such as my personal favorite) the suggestion that the largest spaceship ever built could be completed, in secret, over a period of just eight months. As well as casting mistakes, such as Tea Leoni, who is given a major role, but in the presence of such real Hollywood pros as Robert Duvall and Morgan Freeman comes across as a lightweight. Morgan Freeman, by the way, with his wonderfully dignified performance as the President, is not used nearly enough. Even in its limited capacity though, his role was one of the most memorable Presidential performances of recent years. Despite a number of minor problems, overall Deep Impact is the rare big-budget Hollywood movie that manages to be an entertaining summer popcorn flick, but at the same time finds a way to be semi-realistic and avoid completely insulting the audience's intelligence. The dramatic element of the film was effectively played out, especially where the astronaut crew is concerned, all in all making it a powerful sci-fi drama. Unlike some other films of that summer, this one didn't constantly try and make you laugh your ass off with the threat of total destruction looming. To sum it up, Armageddon may have been a bigger hit in the summer of '98, but it was simply getting by almost solely on Bruckheimer style. Unfortunately for the makers of that film, it is substance that endures, and that is why people will still be watching substantive films like Deep Impact, long after hokey fare such as Armageddon has been forgotten.",Deep Impact
222,isenberg-e,"The best (and most accurate) of many ""comet hits Earth movies""",10,17 April 2001,"I actually think this movie is underrated and underappreciated. Usually the characters in a disaster film are either completely undeveloped or have ""pseudo-personalities"" which are stereotypes, such as in ""Airport."" In this film, the characters not only have fuller personalities but act in surprising ways that are still consistent with those personalities.The way that the film portrays the actions of the U.S. government and the news media are to me some of the strongest points in the film. I could believe it all without any trouble.The scenes in outer space were realistic and for the most part reasonably accurate science-wise. There were a few goofs:    MINOR SPOILERS NEXT PARAGRAPH The Orion nuclear rocket uses nuclear explosions, so it would look completely different. The penetration of the atmosphere of the smaller comet took a long time in the film; at roughly 15 miles per second it would have been over virtually instantly, and anyone who saw it would be blinded. I couldn't believe people would try to evacuate by car on a highway that skirts the Atlantic Ocean; wouldn't they go west? Finally, there would have been room for many people in other caverns such as Carlsbad, and provisions (literally and figuratively) could have been made for those remaining above-ground.
   NO MORE SPOILERS As many have noted, Morgan Freeman not only made the best film President we've had in a long time, but seemed like someone you'd WANT as President if something like this situation ever arose. Inspired casting. I had more trouble with Leelee Sobiesky, who distracts me partly because she looks exactly like a younger Helen Hunt, but more so because of some of her actions in the film. The hardest part to swallow was two people even trying to find each other in the chaos towards the end, but that's what ""willing suspension of disbelief"" is for.In short, I think the movie deserved a B. Since it was released shortly before Armageddon, one almost has to give it a second rating in comparison. In that case it definitely deserves a B+ for avoiding not just cliches but the ""cowboy in space"" attitude of Armageddon (which I found awful).",Deep Impact
223,moonlightreflections,"Can you say ""Waste of time""?",4,15 June 2000,"Garbage is not extremely difficult to encounter when it comes to films of an apocalyptic nature.  In this case, I acquired ""Deep Impact"" solely to take a look at Sobieski's performance, though I opted for objectivity and watched the film in a neutral fashion after following the advice of a close friend.Unfortunately, that didn't cause my negative predisposition to waver, for the only worthwhile element of this film happens to be Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall's performances, which proved believable and emotive.The performance of all of the other characters in the story simply revolved around shallow ideals--stereotypes that are presented for perhaps a total of five minutes of screen time.  While the acting itself is not horrendous, there is not enough of it to convey the type of emotion that the producers appear to have wanted to evoke.One of the more ignominious mistakes in this movie would undoubtedly have to be in the casting of Tea Leoni for the main role.  The pretty face does not override the fact that the woman cannot act, and a number of scenes in the movie--particularly those in which she acts as a news anchor--proved nothing short of repulsive.The film would possess some merit if it had discussed the plan for humanity to survive in greater detail, showing more than the couple individuals whose lives we are supposed to find an element of poignancy in.  Yet as it stands, five minutes' worth of screen time for each of the minor  characters fails to evoke any kind of empathy.

Her character gains zero empathy from me cause she's pretty much a total bitch. Here's how a scene goes:Wood: ""Guess what! I'm just a high school kid but I'm willing to marry you so that you can come get saved with me!"" Sobieski: ""What? Just me? Go @#$% yourself; I'm not going anywhere without my family!""You ungrateful bitch. And she actually does this twice in the movie! That, and pretty much nothing else.

Alas, I nearly dozed off while watching it. The action sequences are so few and far between, and so out of place that I often had the distinct feeling of switching between two different movies every now and again. Another shortcoming of this movie was the overdevelopment of the characters. Although intended to bring the viewer closer to those involved, it actually pushed me further away from them.

Not only can meaningful things be accomplished without help but a person needs human connection in order to thrive and be happy. Whether this is personal connection or done through online methods or letters; people yearn for connection. For some it is an absolute priority, they seek out as many friends and acquaintances that they can and for others they prefer a very small circle of friends. The common factor being people are happy when they have someone that they can talk with, and express ideas and most importantly feelings.In the film ""Deep Impact"", humanity as a whole is faced with the impending doom of a comet colliding with the Earth destroying all life. While the world's governments attempt various plans to stop the comet they all fail until a small group of people are able to sacrifice themselves for the rest of Earth. While at the same time the remaining main characters on Earth are able to find reconciliation among various emotional differences with other people in order to find happiness.This is no coincidence. The title may not refer to the impact of the comet into the Earth but rather that we have deep impact amongst others in our lives. This ranges from all forms of relationship types to at times people that we haven't met.

The good news for DEEP IMPACT in this case is that it is both different and better than ARMAGEDDON; not necessarily a difficult task, but a positive nonetheless.  The bad news is that it plays like a Lifetime Original Feature with a huge special effects budget.  The stories we are forced to follow revolve around nearly flawless, heroic characters whose new-found obstacles are presented in a fog of sentimentality.  James Horner's musical score is a combination between his compositions for FIELD OF DREAMS and TITANIC (and, let's face it, everything in between), and its job is clear: to force the intended emotion upon us.The performances were sufficient, but no character's story was developed enough to allow the audience to truly care when the tears start flowing. I found myself scanning the background during the busier sequences, interested more in the reaction of the masses than the characters we're stuck watching. I'd rather see how the cashier at my deli would deal with the comet than an MSNBC reporter.Ah, here's a shred of light:  I did find myself considering The Inevitable at one point during the film, and damned if I wasn't a little spooked.

The movie revolves around 3 main characters and their family backdrop and also the space crew is shown in between. The emotional interchange between each and every character and how they strive to survive during a natural disaster was shot realistically!!!
Though the movie defies logic and some CG shots look amateurish, it doesn't matter much. Just remember, that this movie was shot before 23 years!!
The background score by James Horner is magical and pure bliss.

Everything about the movie are straight wins: fantastic storyline revolving around a reporter, the sub plot characters were all believable and you start to care for them from the moment you see them.

244,Mister_Anderson,A great movie,9,30 January 2005,"This is a great movie. I think the people who don't like it are (1) people expecting it to be a summer blockbuster popcorn movie with a million special effects, or (2) people upset because they think it's cheesy / has scientific errors. Let me address both points.First of all, this is not a disaster movie in the style of Armageddon or Volcano or any of them. It's a movie about humanity's struggle to deal with an impending disaster. And in doing that, it succeeds. Most of the film is supported by strong talent, including Robert Duvall and Morgan Freeman. In smaller roles, Max Schell, Vanessa Redgrave, and Ron Eldard really shine. I was disappointed by Tea Leoni's acting. And Elijah Wood and Leelee Sobieski didn't really do much for me, although they weren't bad.Second, while the movie is not standard Hollywood flair, it doesn't altogether escape the Hollywood curse. There are a few fairly ridiculous moments and plot points. HOWEVER, compared to disaster movies, I have to say this are extremely minor. To counter this, there are some very touching scenes. I don't want to give anything away here, but most of them occur near the end of the film.This is not the best movie ever by any means, but it comes as close as a mainstream Hollywood movie dealing with the end of the world is going to get. Also, James Horner's score was terrific.Definitely worth a watch.",Deep Impact
245,badman-2,Deep BS,6,5 February 1999,"I haven't seen Armageddon but if this film is supposed to be the better of the two disaster films of '98, then Armageddon must really be bad.  Deep Impact is not a poor film (Director Mimi Leder, formerly executive producer of ER, is too talented) but is in the same class as ID4, another overly cliched and unrealistic disaster movie that gives the viewer absolutely no intellectual stimulation.  There are story lines in this film that don't need to be there. Basically, Tea Leoni's whole character could go and the premise of the film would still be intact.The film is supposed to be about an asteroid overtaking the earth and killing millions of people.  How do we choose who gets to live?  How to people deal with that?  The film does explore these issues but not in enough detail.  Too much time is spent on Tea Leoni's character.  The film would have been better if it focused more on what the goverment of the world was trying to do to stop the asteroid and the crew that tried to stop it and failed. I don't have anything against Tea Leoni.  She's a fine actress who played her role well in this film.  However, her role should have been a lot smaller.  Mimi Leder turned the film into a chick-flick instead of a disaster movie.  In the end, it made the film more of a disaster than the one that took place in the film.",Deep Impact
246,Rick K,Abysmal,1,14 February 1999,"This was undoubtedly one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. I like many of the actors in this film, and they should all see that they're removed from the credits.  I considered erasing the movie before returning it to the video store, as a humanitarian move.  Awful script (if they paid more than $2.95 they have a good legal case), cardboard characters (the sets did better acting), not even a decent special effects movie.  Every scene rang false, not a scintillion of credibility.  The characters just sleepwalked through their parts.  As one reviewer accurately pointed out, you find yourself rooting for the comet.Armageddon was worse, but at least A. didn't purport to be anything other than what it was.  If this is ""a disaster movie with brains"" then this is proves there is no hope for America.Do yourself a favor: watch something on PBS or the Home Shopping Club.

247,BLDJ,Yaaaaaaaaaaawn!,4,3 October 1999,"*************CONTAINS SPOILERS*******************When I watched the TV trailer, I though I was going to like it. That huge wave, destroying New York, a comet... it sure looked cool. I didn't read the papers' comments, so I though it was some sorta action movie...Hmmm... first of all, this movie looked like 5 hours long. I felt like I was going to sleep. Yawn! People running for that underground maze or something, people crying because they were gonna die, and stuff... everything was old. I mean... the world was going to end, but the ""Oh my god, we're gonna die!"" melodrama was the same as the one in Alien, the Shining and other much, much better movies. Because a comet can fall on your head, a volcano can appear in your town and dinosaurs can eat your head... but you're going to die anyway, right? And this isn't a scary movie at all, so I don't see their point.Another point is that I don't think that NASA is going to find out that a comet is going to collide with the Earth one week before it happens. I mean... a lot of people check out the comets' speed, the comets' orbit and compare them with the Earth's speed and orbit, and then take the conclusion that the comet is going to collide with Earth... more or less... 20 years from now. But one week? Give me a break! NASA people aren't that stupid! I guess they could make the movie telling us about ""How would it be if the world was going to end 20 years ago?"" Beats me.Hmmm... well, anyway, it shows (unoriginaly, but at least shows) the people's doom before the Earth's end and that New York destruction, caused by that huge wave caused by that small comet part, is cool. So I guess I give it a 3,5... 4. But I was really hoping that the movie... I mean, the Earth was going to end. It would be more fun that way. Yawn. No such luck.",Deep Impact

249,almaa31,Spare me the sentimentalism,3,4 December 2008,"On the contrary of other comments, I found rather the special effects rather good (though running up a hill with a tsunami like wave is not gonna get you anywhere). Again another movie that insults my intelligence. I sometimes don't understand American directors. Do they have any pride whatsoever? The lottery thing, what kind of nonsense was that? In whole logic, we all know that in order to survive we would need to spare women and children first. If we start thinking of survival, then it would have some serious ethical questions. It just does not make any sense at all.Let's say we're not going to dwell too much on this, what about this tiresome sentimentalism, these contrived pseudo-acts of heroism (I leave my 'seat' to this poor woman with a child, we're going to sacrifice ourselves to save the planet, I'm marrying my classmate so she can come to the Ark with me - but if so, this would mean there's one more person than the 1,000,000 people allowed in the ark - aaah crap!).

Morgan Freeman was very good as the President, and it's always a plus to get Vanessa Redgrave, Elijah Wood or Leelee Sobieski in anything. The script had a few smart moments, using Moby Dick to fore-shadow an important moment at the end, but, as a whole, it felt like a made-for-TV spectacle, designed to keep the eyes busy and the brain otherwise dis-engaged.

Sure, both DI and ""Armagedeon"" have cardboard characters, a predictable plot, and no relation to science or reality whatsoever.  The main difference is that ""Armagedeon"" recognized this, while DI did not.  DI actually took itself, and its story, seriously.  Big mistake!  In order for a movie to take itself seriously, it needs everything that DI does not have: believable characters, believable story, believable science, etc.  The movie makers should have realized that this is a summer blockbuster popcorn movie, not a film with Oscar potential, and was thus immune from the regular movie making standards.  With summer blockbusters, the only real rule is to sit back, have some fun, and make money, not to worry about getting caught up in the drama, or the story, or the plight of characters we don't care about.  By violating this rule, DI's makers ruined the ""film"".

No, it is not something we can relegate to inevitable act-of-god status.  We are thinking, conscious beings -- of far more value than the ravens and lilies that share the earth with us. And as such, we must make use of our cognitive abilities to ensure that we have a more secure existence.Astronomy and mathematics could one day pinpoint every single cosmological disaster in our planet's future.  Quantum mechanics and physics could one day allow us and our biosphere to simply move to another planet.  Out goal is sophisticated existence, perpetual in nature.

DEEP IMPACT is extremely realistic and proposes situations that would most likely happen if a commit would hit Earth. The scenes were done beautifully, especially when the first commit hit. Acting wise, the character portrayed the images that we image ourselves to be if we discovered a commit would hit our beloved planet. The only setback that this movie has is that fact that it started off relatively slow. You are brought into a couple subplots wondering, ""What does this have to do with anything?""

254,Foxy-16,Damning with faint praise,8,21 February 1999,"To say this movie is (at least) an order of magnitude better than ""Armageddon"", while quite accurate, sells it somewhat short.  This film has several flaws, most of which have been noted in prior reviews.  Most distracting for me personally was that the character focus was too diffuse: there were too many ""central"" characters, and those emphasized (notably the teeny-bopper lovers) struck me as the wrong ones.  On the other hand, this film (like ""Contact"") takes a thoughtful -- and thought-provoking -- look at the sociological impact of an extra-human event.If you LOVED ""Armageddon"", watch ""Deep Impact""; the general plot and special effects are similar, but the movie goes well beyond it in terms of philosophical implications.  If you HATED ""Armageddon"", watch ""Deep Impact""; plot similarities aside, it is an entirely different (and better) movie. Either way, watch it and decide for yourself.",Deep Impact

What?? I mean, can you REALLY feel empathy for anyone in Armageddon prior to falling asleep?""Deep Impact"" isn't a masterpiece either, obviously. There are some flaws in the plot, both scientifically and as regards continuity and some coincidences that basically don't happen in ordinary life. But there is quite a lot to enjoy. I'm not an avid fan of flicks dealing with the possible end of the world or of the human race (like, as I said before, Armageddon - and then Independence Day, Godzilla, and so on) but this one shines in its own right, as an earnest attempt to create a series of three-dimensional characters in an action-based film and take time to show their intimate side. The writers and the actors deserve some praise to have put up a gallery of men and women you can't help to care about. A lot of critical reviews about this film deal with the ""boredom"" they have suffered from watching ""Deep Impact""... but what about the hour and a half of total mess and dumb dialogue ""armageddon"" is filled with? And you tell me that you care about the characters? Please. There should be characters first!For example, like Téa Leoni's Jenny: a young reporter in search of a scoop who finds herself projected in front of a camera having to tell the entire world what destiny it is facing, while she is struggling with her family's complicated and sad past. Vanessa Redgrave's Robin, Jenny's mother, a woman who should have been born in another century, devastated from her not recent at all but painful divorce - yet, still worried of saving her seventeenth-century desktop by donating it to the National Gallery, and concerned about her make-up and dress when she decides to commit suicide. Robert Duvall's brave but sweet Captain Fish, last man on the Moon, who gradually becomes a father for his crew and, ultimately, for all mankind. Elijah Wood and Leelee Sobieski's Leo and Sarah, the two teenagers strongly in love with each other, a symbol for all the people who desperately struggle to survive. Morgan Freeman as the President, and then Laura Innes, Maximilian Schell, Mary McCormack, all provide touching supportive performances.If you feel in the mood of watching an action flick with a different perspective, watch ""Deep Impact"", and you won't help but care about the men and women involved in a believable enough disaster. If you want to eat a popcorn after another, rent ""Armageddon"" and enjoy the mess.",Deep Impact
258,Seasuzie,Great cast,8,6 June 2020,This is one of my favorite end of the world movies. It has a great cast. I love Tea Morgan Mary and the other great actors in this cheesy disaster movie. I can't really say why I like it so much because it's one of those things with movies. I don't take disaster movies very seriously but they are like an amusement park ride for me. It started with the Poseidon Adventure and I'm always waiting for the next one to come.,Deep Impact
259,fmcchris,Poor script and lack of focus hurt this movie,3,2 November 2006,"As Rick K. from Virginia so wonderfully pointed out: ""I considered erasing the movie before returning it to the video store, as a humanitarian move."" Believe me, he would be doing a lot of folks a very big favor.This movie fails on many levels, not the least of which is James Horner's overblown score, which turns any attempt at pathos into bathos. But my main gripe is with the poorly written script, the lack of general focus, and the overall insipid acting. Tea Leoni, especially, seems to sleepwalk through her part, never once bringing any conviction her role. Morgan Freeman is wooden throughout and his platitude-ridden speech at the end of the movie is painful to listen to. Just about every major character comes across as boring and I blame the script and director for this.The main problem lies in trying to depict so many different characters' lives in the space of two hours. If the focus had been on one or two people, the script would have been far more cohesive. Lacking this cohesion, we are left with undeveloped characters that we care nothing about. So when Tea Leoni and Maximillian Schell get killed by the tidal wave, we are happy to see them go. The director allows us little vignettes that are supposed to offer us insight into the lives of the characters, but all it does is destroy any focus the movie might have had.A good movie should draw you into its own unique universe, such that your emotional involvement is held captive. When you start looking for the fast forward button, you know you're in trouble.",Deep Impact

You expect boffo special effects. Deep Impact gives you both. Far superior to Armageddon, (which did much better at the box office) there is very little here to nitpick. Most of the science worked (as opposed to Armageddon) and the movie managed to be thoughtful and touching as well. It forced you to think about what you would do if you had to choose between your family and life. In no way superficial, DI is a great movie, IMHO.",Deep Impact
261,BealeFan,"Shallow as it could be, but they don't want you to know that.",1,27 January 1999,"Deep Impact. Armageddon. How stupid could anyone be, to think that releasing these two movies at almost the exact same time would be a good idea? And who could be stupid enough to think that either of these movies would be great? Time has told us repeatedly that disaster movies, especially natural disaster movies, fill a laughable space in movie-dom, where soap opera characters, lame plot twists, and poor writing fill every inch of the frame, every minute of the film. And this one is no exception. (Neither is Armageddon, but that's a different story.)Deep Impact fails miserably on a few levels. The first is the shallow attempts at characters. There were too many, as is usually the case in these films, and they have no depth. Instead, they are given obvious, average traits, and made to act in ways that would allow the audience to easily identify with them. They were stand-ins for the audience, where most people could say ""that man/woman is just like me, or someone I know, and wouldn't it be horrible if that happened to us?"", and the movie could get away without developing them past the lowest common denominator of all generic characters.All the emotions, then, are simply there to manipulate us, and take our emotions in the direction the movie wants. Many fine movies do this, in one way or another, and I'd let that go, if it were the only flaw: It isn't. None of the emotions come off as genuine. The acting is flat, the direction weak, and the script isn't concerned with any development beyond manipulation. None of it means anything, in the context of the film.And then there's the special effects. I assume some intern on his lunch break over at ILM did the worthless excuse for effects that we saw all of during the preview. Yeah, all the effects were in every commercial, and they only filled about five seconds there. The comet FX in both comet movies were poor, which is strange, considering they were largely the subject matter. But otherwise, Armageddon did serve up the effects, good and bad, where Deep Impact skimped on them at every possible turn. And that isn't a plus, ultimately.The direction, if we're to call it that, is bad. Mimi Leder has yet to do a good job directing anything, and from the bland cinematography to the uninspired acting, this is no bid for respectability. Big script disappointments include never even glimpsing the underground haven, and having the end fizzle with some rather unrealistic, last-minute, feel-good moments that are as implausible as anything in Armageddon.I guess, because this movie is very conventional, and because it's a lot nicer than Armageddon in tone, people might like it more. Armageddon never strays, in content, from being exactly what it tells us it will be. And at least it does it well technically. (I'm not interested in any old lady comments about it being ""too loud"", or ""too fast"". Those traits alone don't make it bad.) But this one lies to us, telling us it's about so much more than it ever even comes close to, and doesn't have the technical skill to make it work, and for that, I can't forgive it.",Deep Impact

Where ""Armageddon"" was an annoyingly over-testosteroned over-patriotic mess, ""Deep Impact"" takes a human approach. It focuses on normal people's reactions to the fact that their society will soon end once a meteor strikes Earth.It forces the viewer to think, ""What would I do if I learned I only had a few days left to live?"". The characters are realistic and the screenplay keeps our interest without having to throw millions of dollars of special effects at the screen to keep our attention span.The acting is great - any movie that pairs Robert Duvall and Morgan Freeman is worth seeing and Tea Leoni shows a solid dramatic side - and the special effects are amazing (without being over-abundant, like that other movie...).Highly recommended - I gave this one an 8.

Without him the whole thing would have fallen rather flat. Vanessa Redgrave is also wonderful but I'm not sure the little sub-plot she was involved in gelled.

This one was more genuinely sad because the characters seemed more realistically depicted, but still much of it was a ""let's see how many characters we can kill off"" kind of attitude.

It is realistic and may supply tactics to use when a comet does head towards our home. Deep Impact is not only a brilliant and engaging movie in itself, compared to Armageddon, Deep Impact takes the cake.  Armageddon sent up half a dozen idiots to save 6 billion people while Deep Impact actually thought about it and sent up a group of educated and realistic astronauts.  The Russian in Armageddon would NEVER have been let out of the asylum he was in to live on a shuttle (this Russian was portrayed as such a negative stereotype as well I'm surprised Boris Yeltsin didn't sue!)  The Russian in Deep Impact was educated and realistic.  The alternatives to blowing up the comet in Deep Impact were well thought out and realistic.  Armageddon didn't have any alternatives.

I am tempted to say it's a ""thinkpiece"" but that seems so pretentious.The film sincerely explores the possibility that humanity might be wiped out by an Extinction Level Event (ELE) -- a comet named after a young man played by Elijah Wood who spots it at an astronomy club event.The pacing of the film is excellent. Upon announcement, there is a one-year timeframe before the comet is predicted to hit Earth, which is much more realistic than the couple-week asteroid doomsday deadline of Armageddon. The science in Deep Impact is much saner than Armageddon which is utterly ridiculous in its science fiction.The best parts of the film are the explorations of how the comet affects the people on Earth. With excellent music, the film goes deep into many peoples lives and shows us how such an event would affect anyone.I think the film spends a little too much time on the Messiah space mission. It was well done, that's for sure. But Deep Impact took a completely different route than Armageddon, and I think they should have stayed on Earth even more.

276,dirtybeatles,I love this movie.,10,12 June 2005,"Deep Impact has always had a soft spot in my heart. Man vs. Nature films almost always crash and burn (though I still love them), and I feel that Deep Impact is one of the elite few (Jurassic Park being the only other I can think of) that realizes it's true potential, and is a great film in it's own right.The plot seems fairly straightforward. Comet is discovered by Leo, a young kid, and astronomers confirm that it is on a trajectory to earth. In order to prevent a panic the government plans in secret. Jennie, an ambitious reporter covering an adulterous scandal stumbles upon evidence of the comet, and bullies the president into going public.However the story has far more facets. While Armageddon flew by with a typical romance, idiots in space comedy, and special effects, Deep Impact relies on it's characters to move the plot forward. Leo is forced to grow up far before he's ready, and abandon his childhood in order to make adult decisions and save those he loves. Jennie suffers from a strained relationship with her father, who has remarried a woman only two years her senior. Astronauts must sacrifice themselves for a higher cause. Though screen time on each of the stories is limited, just a few lines really get you inside each character's head. They're extremely easy to care about.Morgan Freeman also happens to be the best movie president I've ever watched. His acting, along with the rest of the cast, is top notch. There won't be a dry eye in the house after this film. The director makes this feel almost like a Spielberg film. Plenty of action, but more than anything, heart.",Deep Impact

I was fascinated by many aspects of this movie. Characters: I actually cared for the characters. I did not want many of them to die, especially Tea Leoni. I was very impressed with all the acting in this movie, particulary Robert Duvall, Vanessa Redgrave and Tea Leoni. All did superb. Plot: I liked the sudden twist in the plot. I kept thinking throughout the movie that something would destroy the comets and everything would then be ok. I was shocked when a comet hit and killed almost every main character. Special Effects. I have not seen a movie with such great visual effects since the Jurassic Park trilogy. The overhead shot of the gigantic wave sweeping over New York was truly amazing. Script: At times this script was very touching. It was written with great accuracy. The acting did it justice.Forget Armageddon! See this movie. You won't be disappointed.",Deep Impact
279,QuickStopVA,"Stale, weak, and unrealistic, even for a natural disaster flick.",4,23 May 2005,"First off, keep in mind that this movie does not pick up for about an hour-and-a-half, and you won't get any serious action sequences until the last 15 minutes of the film. That being said, I wanted to like this movie, and I didn't compare it to Armageddon, but in the end, it was nothing more than a 2-hour waste of my time with a dull, pointless ending. The characters were undeveloped, the story was boring and barely made any sense, and it was quite simply a poorly-made film. I wouldn't even consider this a valiant effort. Way too many sub-plots, too many attempts to be emotional, and just not that good.The average movie-goer with low standards will like this movie a lot. They'll say that it was too much like Armageddon (and some may say Armageddon was too much like this one), but in the end, they will have liked it. A film-snob like myself would find this to be absolute garbage. I wish I could find better words that would better state my point, but I can't.""Don't waste your time.""

280,benaven,Could have been SO much better!,8,1 January 2014,"I just re-watched this film & was so disappointed with it. It gets 6.0 on IMDb and could have been an 8. Here's what's wrong... 1) The story is about the possible ending of the human race on Earth. Isn't that a big enough story without having to add pointless add-ons like the ""affair"" and the car crash of the astronomer? Just ridiculous. 2) Tea Leoni is a lovely looking girl but doesn't have the acting skills or gravitas to carry the role with any conviction. 3) Robert Duvall appears to be on autopilot. 4) Towards the end when things are utterly desperate we have the crew on the spaceship giving us tearful farewells, on camera, with their families. Let's see the bigger picture please; we don't care enough about the crew to want to watch these farewells! 5) The spaceship gets bombarded with massive chunks of comet and they practically bounce off it. At those speeds the damage from any one of those impacts would be terminal. What's good.... 1) Morgan Freeman is great, as always. Maximillian Schell even better. 2) The whole premise is thrilling and some of the images quite beautiful.What this film desperately needed was a decent screenplay. That (& the lead actress) are what's at fault here. A better director would help but with a screenplay as woeful as this one, even Spielberg would have struggled. Hollywood; next time you're thinking of making a film like this, run the screenplay by me first; it'll save you an awful lot of trouble.",Deep Impact
281,craiggerard_2000,The Best of the Comet Hits Earth Movies,10,20 July 2004,"There have been a series of a comet hits the earth movies over the years. In 1958 we had the Italian-French ""The Day the Sky Exploded"". In 1978 there was an NBC-TV movie with Richard Crenna which took place in Phoenix, Arizona. The year 1979 gave us Meteor which was not all that great. Then in 1998 we had Deep Impact and Armageddon. However Deep Impact is the best of all the movies about a comet or asteroid hitting the earth. Outstanding performances by Robert Duvall, Morgan Freeman, Vanessa Redgrave, Tia Leoni, Maximillian Schell and especially Elijah Wood and LeeLee Sobieski make this a special film. Some of the other films did not have the personal relationships like the romance of LeeLee Sobieski by Elijah Wood in the film. and their getting married at 16 in the face of the comet striking the earth is especially poignant. The triangle between Maximillian Schell and his estranged daughter, Tia Leoni, the reporter/anchorwoman and Maximillian Schell's estranged wife Vanessa Redgrave. The characters on the spaceship in Deep Impact were much more realistic and sympathetic than the characters in Armageddon. The underrated Elijah Wood in one of his earlier roles gives an especially good performance. The characters in Armageddon were caricatures and wooden where as these characters you grow to care about. A good film to see or buy on video or watch on television.",Deep Impact

The plot is very believable and it truly makes you wonder how the world would react in a doomsday scenario. One of the absolute best things going for this movie is the musical score. It overlays the movie perfectly, and the Director knew when to pull back in certain scenes and have no music at all. It reminds me of the music in The Shawshank Redemption.

The characters are more important than the special effects and the tears aren't from the death of one major character, but for the loss of millions and the salvation of billions.My eyes were filled with tears for the last 45 minutes of this film as impending doom approaches and the narrative takes you through the pain of individual characters, and in the final apocalyptic moments, you truly cry for the people trying to outrun a tidal wave of destruction.  The tears that round off the film are of joy, for despite the loss of millions of lives, a viewer feels relief at the saving of a handful of the leading characters (as unlike most films more than just one character sacrifices their life) and at the salvation of the world.It's a film that allows the audience to touch and feel many characters lives, as each actor, most notably Robert Duval, Elijah Wood, Leelee Sobieski, Tea Leoni and Ron Eldard, create and develop deep and believable characters throughout the course of the film.

However, in researching this movie the could have at least consulted a few scientists to see if what they were purposing could even be plausible.One of the worst scenes in the movie was at the end where somehow a kid makes it back to richmond va, gets a motorcycle drives to virgina beach (why the parents were heading to virgina beach then away from virgina beach i have no idea), finds his gf and then somehow in a few minutes time, ends up on a mountain top.

I know disaster movies are usually crap such as The Day After Tomorrow, Armageddon, Godzilla, Independence Day, etc. This however was not crap. It boasted a fine cast that did great work the standout being Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall. The rest of the cast though also did quite well. The story was handled in a fairly realistic manner and didn't require me to roll my eyes at the many plot contrivances the way the others I listed did. The only major flaw for me was the casting of tea Leoni. The usually dependable actress was extremely bland in this film. She has done much better work in her career.

291,Asch,Who cares if it was better or worse than ARMEGGEDON? It was a bad movie!!!,1,1 December 1998,"I expected this to be the more intellectual of the two asteriod movies and boy was I in for a shock.  This movie was god-awful! The characters in this movie are so lame they DESERVE to be wiped out by the stupid comet.The ACTING: Stinks.  Tea Leoni does a decent job.  Morgan Freeman is okay, but he seems sort of vapid.  In every movie recently he hasn't really been all that amazing, just consistently a good actor.  Here he does a decent job.  Elijah Wood had no business being in this movie, nor did his character, which was totally pointless.  As for Robert Duvall and the rest of the crew on the spaceship, way to go Mimi for making me neither care one iota about them nor even be able to recognize their easily forgettable faces.
THE FX: Well, seeing as it is a disaster movie, these should have figured prominently into the plot, but no, they decided to make it an emotional movie.  Unfortunately, Mimi had no idea how to handle emotion.  So instead we are left with a three minute tidal wave destruction sequence that is totally awesome, because it was directed by the SPECIAL EFFECTS SUPERVISOR, not her.  This sequence comes too late in the movie, though, as most people will have already fallen asleep.  Special mention also goes out to the flying wad of questionable white goo that is the comet - one of the worst, flattest looking CGI renderings I have ever seen that had my brother screaming praises of its fakeness.ELIJAH WOOD: In a category all by himself because he is THAT BAD.  His character has no point, his acting is poor, and the scene where he kisses his wife (God...the mere fact that idea even made it past the first draft boggles the mind) is soooo ridiculous and poorly done that it's almost worth the price of rental just to see how bad it is.  ""THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO FRENCH KISS YET AND THEY'RE MARRIED!"" I shouted, enraged, when I saw it in theaters.Eight dollars to see it in the theaters was an outrage.  I will not pay the three to see it on video.  If it was on HBO I would not watch it.  This film sucked, plain and simple.

I wasn't even remotely interested enough to go to the theater, in order to see it.  Boy, was I ever wrong!  I'm so glad that I gave it a chance, once it came to pay-per-view. I was amazed at how terrific this film actually was.  There are so many different layers of conflict.  It has a number of behind-the-scenes stories where you are allowed into the personal lives of some of the key players.

Armageddon is not only a darn fine action movie, brimming over with testosterone, but also gets great performances from the ""main 4"" characters (Thornton, Willis, Affleck and Tyler) and also excellent performances from Fargo's 2 murderers.Whilst Robert Duvall is great in this, Morgan Freeman seems surprisingly trite - his final speech carries very little emotional weight: Compare Bill Pullman (a far inferior actor) in 'Independence Day' and even Jack Nicholson in 'Mars Attacks'.Tea Leoni as a lead actress is a very odd choice, she made me squirm at points.Having said all that, this film did bring up some interesting ideas, and led to an interesting conversation in the pub.

Normally, I'm not a fan of too much drama in my sci-fi flicks, but in this case, I really enjoyed it. Much more than I enjoyed the touch-the-surface emotions of Armageddon. I found myself able to empathize with the characters in this film and felt their pain like it was my own. Unlike other reviewers, I enjoyed Tea Leoni's performance as a woman who bottled up her emotions, whether it was because she felt she needed to remain professional, or because she had difficulty expressing them and she managed to pull that off quite well. I also really liked the segments of the astronauts aboard the Messiah. Those scenes I found to be very touching and...human. Morgan Freeman was also stellar in his performance as the President. I thought the acting was very well done, maybe not Oscar worthy, but very good nonetheless. ***Spoiler*** The only stipulation I had with this film was the scene where Leo and his family are getting ready to go into the caves, Leo decides he's going back for Sarah. His parents just basically give him a hug and wish him well. Lol wut??? The kid can't even drive yet and you're going to send him off into chaos, by himself, with an extinction-level comet about to strike the earth within the next few hours. I couldn't believe the parents would actually just let him go like that. Absolutely ludicrous! It just struck me as ridiculously selfish. At the very least, I would have either gone with my child, or dragged his butt into the cave with me, not given him a ""nice knowing you"" pat on the back and sent him on his way.The girl's parents were much more realistic in how they sent both their children with Leo in a desperate attempt to get them to safety and stayed behind where they were inevitably killed in the tsunami. That's what real parents do. All in all, it was a great film and definitely one of those I will go back to time and again.",Deep Impact

The special effects in the film were magnificant and, although not as numerous, much better than ARMAGEDDON's.  ILM proved once again that they truly are the best in the business of FX.

This may be because they wasted a large amount of the budget on the giant space turd, which is exactly what this is.

If this movie doesn't have you reaching for the tissues then I don't know what will. It is both sad and incredibly happy at the same time. To be a bit more informal: I would have to say it is incredibly cute at points.Throughout the whole movie we are constantly kept engaged with each character and each sub-plot as we sit on the edge of our chairs, sofas or whatever it is you are sitting on. From a personal viewpoint the sub-story of Leo and Sarah's journey to be safe and together with their families and most importantly each other pulls on all the heart strings!Anyway I would highly recommend this movie to any movie lover!

It almost made me cry, why did they even release it. This movie didn't have enough of everything. It didn't have a good music score. It didn't have a good script. It didn't have a good performances.

Without doubt, he brings a commanding presence to the role of United States president. During one of his speeches, I said: ""I'd vote for him."" Likewise, Robert Duvall, who pilots the Orion on its last voyage, gains our respect and admiration. These men prove this is a film about character.One final, but crucial point: In most disaster films, the ""average"" person affected behaves in less than human ways, struggling to survive through looting and killing. (Some of that behavior is evinced in ""Titanic."") But the people of ""Deep Impact"" rise above that. Humankind is almost invariably shown at its best, not its worst.Perhaps, the filmmakers are saying, perhaps there is hope for us all. As the President said: ""I wish....No, wish is wrong. 'Wish' is not what I want to say."" The President prayed for mankind. I pray we would face the E.L.E.

There is also a bit of suspense as I did not know how the film actually ends, 'does life get wiped out?', I kept thinking for most of the movie.Character development was a bit lightweight, there were too many subplots so no one was developed fully enough to really care about.  The epic scale of the events on earth in the build up to the comet hitting was not really dealt with well either.  Braveheart was a more epic movie, and those events just took place in a field!  Still good story makes up for these short comings.I heard that the producers got a lot of scientific background and the movie was thought of as scientifically accurate.

It does not just focus on the simple life of one person or small minority like Armageddon does with Bruce Willis.The Casting of Morgan Freeman as president was a wise move by Leder as he shows a very strong thinking and active president compared to the dull president that we see in Armageddon and The Rock.Tea Leoni played her part superbly as well.

I think Tea Leoni is the leading role really shows some great skills as an actress, which is very important for the high ranking for the movie.

322,patrick-587-232055,A typical all American movie,3,4 July 2013,"I read quite a few reviews about this movie before actually deciding to watch it. Having watched 'Armageddon' before, and knowing that these two movies have the same kind of plot, I did have high hopes for it. But having the same plot is where it ends. These two movies are very much different, and in my eyes, 'Deep Impact' is the lesser of the two by a long shot. Yes, I agree that 'Deep Impact' does have its moments and emotions, but honestly, it comes nowhere near 'Armageddon'. The CGI graphics (at the end of the movie) are mediocre, very clear to see it's fake. But what ticks me off the most, and what makes me 'reward' this movie with the grade I give it, is that it's an all American movie. It's like America is the whole world. Nothing is mentioned about the rest of the world. Well OK, at the very end they graciously mention Europe and Africa, and that's it (Oh gee, thank you very much for thinking about us too for two seconds). Apart from that, it's America all the way. One million people can be saved. 800.000 of which are American citizens, the rest are scientists etc... Ummm, and what about the rest of the world eh?? Oh right, yes of course, according to Americans, the whole world is theirs, silly me!!! Well sorry, for me 'Armageddon' is a 100 times better than this movie. It has action, love, emotion, drama, and at least they do not see America as the only country in the world. Don't get me wrong though, I have quite a few great American friends myself, and I do like America itself too. But this is supposed to be a WORLD wide disaster right, not just an American one. Epic fail for me in regards to the plot of this movie.",Deep Impact

Small parts like the ending scene and the beach scene flickered through my head when i began watching it. My first thought was that if i didn't remember it all, it couldn't have been very good at all. I was so wrong.The real gem in this movie is the multiple, only slightly related story lines. With many other disaster movies, i find myself looking forward to the doomsday event, or the huge E.L.E. In this i found myself actually worried for the characters. Its so easy to relate to them. If you try and put yourself in the situation, i found it difficult to think what i could do differently. The message behind the disaster is love for family, friends and for the people even closer than them and multiple touching scenes that almost bring a tear to the eye really make you care for what happens. By far the most emotional moment comes from Jenny Lerner and her father, but i'm not giving anything away.Currently on IMDb this film has a 6.0/10 rating which, as the review title suggests, i think is ridiculous. This film has it all and simply put, deserves a hell of a lot better than its getting on here. Its an unmissable movie.",Deep Impact

This was not one of your 'everything's going to be OK in the end' movies. When I first watched it, I was actually surprised when Biederman struck Earth. I was thinking it would be one of those down to the last minute but in the end all is well type things. The striking scene and the ones that followed of the devastation were breathtaking. Rather than disregard scientific laws and reasoning, Deep Impact embraces it and includes it in the film.What I liked most about this movie was that it provided what could have been a real picture into what would happen should a comet be on course for Earth. The panic, widespread fear, and the tough decision to move only so many people into 'The Arc' made this a surprisingly moving film.The acting is mostly superb as well. Morgan Freeman puts out an amazing performance as the President, and Robert Duvall is first class, as is Maximilliam Schell. The only performance that brought this movie down was that of Tea Leoni. I like Tea as an actress, just not in this role. She was the only one who seemed out of place in an otherwise well-casted movie. Her dark, pessimistic broodings did not go over well. She was just too stiff and rigid to play a character like Jenny Lerner.Deep Impact works on many levels because of the humanistic underlying tones. Humanity has never faced such a crisis before, and God forbid we never have to, however if it were to come to pass, I believe that this movie provides the best window into a catastrophic future. By far the most complete, through, moving disaster movie made. Well worth watching, especially the comet striking sequence. You'll be moved, I guarantee it.",Deep Impact

Judging from what I have seen at the IMDb movie audiences don't care about how good the movie is - they just feel the need to nitpick and only now seem to like factual movies. This movie - while it might be more closer to what would really happen - is no where near as good as Armageddon. Deep Impact is boring, plain, flat and probably one of the worst movies ever made. If you really want to see a good asteroid movie - watch Armageddon - it has more likable characters and although the cast of Deep Impact all did a great job - they weren't quite the sort of mix young people (12-30) really like. I just can't say much more really -this movie is awful. It has no action what-so-ever. This story tries to create a sense of hope - the only hope I had was for the end credits to start rolling up. The love story is non existant. It doesn't quite get the sense of realism with the characters - mainly - not many of them die. More characters in it should have died to make this movie more emotional - but they didn't.This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I wouldn't even recommend it to the person I most hated in the world - simply because it is just too awful I wouldn't even feel good letting anyone sit through this.

Simply because it recognizes the people.I love disaster movies as much as the next guy (who doesn't love watching LA bite it?). Big booms, explosions, panic in the streets. It's fun. But Deep Impact uses its excellent special effects in support of the story, not as a replacement.Over the course of the movie, you learn about the characters (main and supporting) and start to care about them. Which means you're invested in their survival (not guaranteed either). Instead of faceless millions, you see individuals in danger, which gives them a much stronger impact.I actually get chills at the climax, not because of the special effects (though it is cool to see New York get slammed by a megawave). It's from the astronauts making the sacrifice without fanfare and making final touching goodbyes to their families. Jenny Lerner and her estranged father on the beach as the wave approaches and her whispering ""Daddy"" in their last moments.

Having about a year and a half's notice of this, the U.S. and Russian governments send a spacecraft, the Messiah, to destroy the comet by drilling nuclear warheads into its core and then detonating. The movie focuses on three primary story lines: 1. The young reporter Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni) and her struggles with her career and her parents; 2. The high-school couple of Leo Biederman (who discovered the comet; Elijah Wood) and Sarah (Leelee Sobieski); 3. The crew of the Messiah.All three story lines are done in such a way that the viewer easily sympathizes with the very believable characters. The best done of the three is the spaceship's crew, although the most time is spent with Jenny. They all suffer from the film's only notable problem: The story lines seem somewhat rushed. Considering its broad scope, Deep Impact clearly would benefit from an extra 30 minutes to develop, especially with the underdone angle with Leo and Sarah, but the directors evidently decided two hours was all they could use.Deep Impact, as I mentioned, lacks an A-list star, but it does feature superb performances from two of the best supporting actors of our generation: Robert Duvall (Spurgeon Tanner, captain of the spaceship) and Morgan Freeman (Tom Beck, the U.S. President).

Now that they're married they have to worry about a messy divorce rather than just simply breaking up. As for Jenny's family? Though that baby was saved, Jenny's parents died.

Some no-stretch-cast actors and a no-stretch action-director. Why should this film have been made? Because it thoughtfully brought into the spotlight the reality of obliteration by an asteroid? NO. It's all wrong, to start, and it's all pap to boot. Let's do some science-fact scouring here: asteroids aren't burning balls of flame that scientists can see from lightyears away - those are ""stars"". Asteroids are black. Space is black. The chances of anyone seeing an asteroid are profoundly minimal, considering the previous fact and that fact that space is, LITERALLY, unimaginably vast and empty. The only way to spot this asteroid would be if we were told exactly where it was and where to look; even then we'd only be able to see it as it passed in front of stars and blocked them from view. You see how hard it is to spot a block of ice that reflects virtually no light and hence is completely black against a black backdrop? These 'film-makers' don't.Also... let's talk about the movie, perhaps. (I'm watching it right now, actually, it's on TV.) Téa Leoni has just been pulled over by the FBI in a way wholly un-governmental: by bashing their cars against hers. Are they Hillbillies? Are they? No, they're not...And, OH! the sentimentality of it all. Of Elijah bloody Wood and his girlfriend. I always find it hilarious when an action director (Michael Bay in mind) talks about his films like they are true pieces of art: the 'human' aspect of the film, the 'conflict of interchanging character interfaces as represented against a backdrop of political and societal ruminations', etc., etc....Just suppose, for a moment, that Hollywood got its arse in gear altogether and began producing - not REproducing - real movies like they once did. I don't mean real movies like ANYbody makes nowadays, I mean real movies like real masterpieces of interesting stories - that's right, STORIES - and wonderful characters, and managed to employ some real directors and real actors and real producers. What would it be like if these movies I speak of were in production? Does anyone think they'd be anything like THIS muckapiece? No! Why, you ask impatiently? Because THIS is a crap film. Because THIS is a crap action film. Because THIS is a crap action film about science - which they got wrong. That is why nobody should see this film anymore.

The script is appalling, the characters are appalling, the plot is laughably predictable, and the direction is quite simply rubbish. To coin a phrase..it has 'nothing whatsoever to recommend it'.But I have great sympathy for Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall, two of the world's best actors, for getting mixed up in this travesty of film-making. They needed this film like a hole in the head, in fact it's definitely one to deny having had anything to do with in the first place.Funnily enough, it's no surprise to me to see Stephen Spielberg credited as Executive Producer. He may be a brilliant film-maker, but on past experience that's only the case when he has direct control over a film as producer and/or director. When he lets go and leaves production to others, the end product invariably lets him down. This, he should be ashamed of.But if you like schmaltzy, tacky, third-rate movies; and you don't fancy a nice long soak in a nice hot bath (with bubbles), this could be your kind of film.

361,MovieGuy2007,Fantastic and Moving,9,13 March 2007,"Having seen such films as Armageddon and The Day After Tomorrow, I really expected this film to be basically an effects demo reel. Most disaster films fit into this category: their plot is loosely tied together with some major event; humanity is threatened, a group of heroes is sent to try to save the world, and mankind prevails over nature. The rest of the film is essentially nifty visual effects that don't do much to enhance the plot.So when I saw the first half of Deep Impact, I was amazed. Apart from a brief montage of special effects in the opening sequence (a car crash that simply screams ""big budget""), the movie is one of the first disaster movies I've seen that actually focuses more on the human side of the drama rather than the awesome visual effects that computers can accomplish.Many times during the film, especially during the latter half, I felt myself touched by the realism that the actors and actresses convey. There are moments when you realize how fragile and precious life is, and that's saying something for a film of this budget.While the visual effects are indeed impressive, there are other features that make Deep Impact a necessary film to watch. James Horner's music is strikingly similar to his previous ""Titanic"" and ""Apollo 13"" scores, but it is still hauntingly beautiful and fits the tone of the movie perfectly. Tea Leoni does a good job of portraying a newscaster attempting to cover the events surrounding her while dealing with her own personal emotions, which is undoubtedly a hard act to pull off. Elijah Wood shows his skill years before ""Lord of the Rings"" hit theaters. The other actors and actresses are very realistic and emotional, and the movie flows smoothly with their presence.All in all, this movie is not one to be missed. Keep an open mind while watching this movie: don't watch it with the misconception that it's just going to be another one of those big-budget dull blockbuster films that gets churned out every summer. This one dares to avoid the seemingly standard clichés set by other films of the genre, which makes it a truly unique film to experience.Score: 9/10",Deep Impact
362,padrighbf,Waste of your time to watch,1,20 August 2020,A big disappointment none of the actors did anything in the movie to make you care what happened to them. If you have not watched it don't and if you have unfortunately you will never get your time back. If I could have given a negative star I would have given a one star is more than fair for this movie. The way it was done it seemed that the actors and actresses where more concerned about the next movie they would be in the same with the director and producers as well they were not involved with what they were doing just going thru the motions in this one.,Deep Impact
363,charles_roe,a truly brilliant film,10,17 December 2006,"Deep impact is a remarkable film. Brilliantly acted, directed and produced to create an outstanding, emotion evoking piece that will stick with you for a long time. Unfortunately for Deep Impact, as it was released roughly the same time as another film with a similar focus, being Armageddon, it is not usually judged on its own merit, but more often simply in comparison with Armageddon, which is exactly also what i am about to do. Though hopefully i can compare them in a way which shows comparison of them is not necessary. It is a shame for Deep impact as they are truly fundamentally very different. They do share the basic plot of an apocalyptic asteroid/comet on a collision course with earth, but the focus and styles of the two films are different. Armageddon was the big blockbuster, with the big stars in the lead roles and the big effects right the way through the film, exactly what you would expect of a big budget Hollywood action movie. This is where Deep impact differs, as although it has some very famous actors and actresses, (morgan freeman, Elijah wood etc) they are not relied on for making the film truly watchable. Deep impact focuses on people. Real people with real lives and real emotions, and as this extension level event dawns upon them, we are thrown into the lives and relationships of these characters and shown the true emotions they are experiencing. The films portrays the sheer terror of the characters, and the American people with brilliant realism, and we really sympathise with them, and go on the crazy journey of emotion that would begin ,with the news of the end of existence. The narrative superbly twists and weaves through the lives of three different main sets of characters, each with their own problems and issues, and then back into the action as we are constantly reminded of 'time until impact' giving a real atmospheric and very realistic feeling of a countdown to the end of life and everything as we know it. As time runs out, the tension constantly builds throughout the film and the sense of realism is fantastic. Unlike Armageddon, deep impact is not an action films as such. More a drama that has some absolutely astounding action sequences at the end of the film as the climax ensues. It is probably this sense of waiting and relative lack of effects or dramatic shots throughout the first part of the film that makes the action so compelling and emotional when it begins. Deep impact will give you real feelings of sadness, fear, love, anxiety and hope, and what is really compelling about the film is that there is no completely happy ending where everything is resolved and everyone is happy. It is very realistic and at times the tension is almost unbearable. Deep impact, im my opinion is an infinitely and comprehensively better film than Armageddon. It is much more complete, much more tense and atmospheric and the narrative is far more powerful, and really takes the viewer on a roller-coaster ride of emotion with some very powerful messages throughout the film. The thing that really makes deep impact so effective is simply, its subject matter; (the end of the world, which is possibly the most intense and powerful image imaginable) combined with the trials and tribulations of real people with real emotions. It is the way the director invites the viewer into the film and lives this incomprehensible event and the emotions that come with it, through the eyes of the characters, and from several different view points. In my opinion a truly great film.",Deep Impact

Fair enough it is quite an emotional moment with the extinction of life as we know being seen as a reality, but is it necessary to have the same disaster cliches over and over again.  The ending is where I despaired.  It was obvious bfore this point that the film was made for a an American audience solely in mind but Morgan Freemans lack luster speech on the rebuilding of the United State's Eastern Seabord was in all honesty pathetic.

Yes, the obvious comparison is to Armageddon, and yes, Armageddon really did that. Deep Impact doesn't. Deep Impact has much less action sequence and much more tension and conflict between individuals. For example, as a rookie reporter holding evidence of the threat in your hands, do your do your job and tell the world or do your duty and give the governments of the world time to formulate a response before people know to demand one?Overall, it's a good film, but the action finale boosted my opinion of it. It wasn't that the final sequence was all that great, but that the producers of this film went to the trouble of choosing the one place in the western Atlantic where they could have the impact close to shore in deep enough water to produce the tsunami effect they wanted for that sequence rather than the nuke scene from Terminator II, which such an impact in the shallower water elsewhere would have produced.

In contrast to the big-bang style of Armageddon, Deep Impact tries to take the ""serious"" route to exploring a celestial impact with Earth, but somehow the tension just fails to materialise, either in the action sequences, which are so brief and lacklustre that one barely notices them, or the character-oriented subplots, which involve little more than a series of unconnected people sobbing ""I love you"" over the same sixteen bars of sentimental music.

Surprising even myself, I actually liked it.Considering my known antipathy towards long, emotional scenes, ascathing criticism of Deep Impact could probably be expected, but - unfortunately, you might say - will not be forthcoming. Just to simplify matters, here we go; item by item.ACTING: On the whole, I was impressed by the acting. Freeman, while good, overacted a bit - pausing too often and in the wrong places, for instance - and did seem rather sanctimonious; nevertheless, an extremely good effort, and that only made those slight niggles show more. The other actors were also, on the whole, very good; Wood and Sobieski were relatively convincing, and even Denise Crosby's acting was surprisingly good.SPECIAL EFFECTS: The effects, while spectacular, served to advance the plot and not the other way round. The long shots of the comet seemed slightly wrong, but almost all the other effects were extremely well done.SCIENTIFIC ACCURACY: I was impressed with the accuracy; unfortunately, the main errors were large and obvious, though clearly required for the plot - I would say that the science was fairly solid, allowing for artistic licence. The details were impressively accurate, though - the very realistic depiction of the impact, and the way the water was pulled away from the shores; the jets on the MMU; even the burns on the astronaut's face as the terminator crossed their position.PLOT: Ah yes. There is a Hollywood law that states ""Any impending disaster will be primarily centred (geographically or in effect) on the USA."" However, this notwithstanding, the plot was good. Well written, and not entirely unbelievable, its only real problems were a rather laboured infatuation with relatively pointless emotional scenes. To quote from Monty Python's Quest For The Holy Grail, in the words of everyone from Tim the Enchanter to God himself, ""Get On With It!""So, on the whole, an enjoyable film. Some decent science, some sensible and believable scenes (such as the bus guard not being talked round), and impressive special effects, but unfortunately afflicted by overacting and excessive sentimentality, this is just a few notches away from being a magnificent film.8/10",Deep Impact

Personally, I think that there really will be a comet that will someday hit earth, meaning the extinction of many species, and this throws it into sharp reality. When I was watching this move, it was realistic and a few times I caught myself thinking this was actually happening.The acting in this movie is great and Elijah Wood's abilities at his age are astounding. I also liked the actress who plays Jenny, the news reporter, but I forgot her name. This movie is full of emotional scenes, especially the last one in the space shuttle (those who've seen the movie know what I'm talking about). It also covers family values and how much people are worth to others.

My main gripes with this film are in increasing order of potency; scientific inaccuracy, irritating decisions made by characters without reason to create tension and spells of horrific acting. Standard to sub par acting all round was extenuated by the expected brilliant performances by Freeman and Duvall, with a small few other minor roles portrayed with the realism i came expecting. The visuals were good for a movie of this age, this is the reason the movie failed to win the audience award for the 'so bad it's good' category.

388,gauravdp,"A very nice, emotional and grossly underrated movie",8,21 April 2005,"Without taking the special effects into consideration, by sheer story-line alone,in addition to the treatment, this is one of the best movies that I've seen, and I found it quite surprising that this movie attracted so little attention and such a low rating. Possibly now that has been rectified to some extent by NASA naming one of its space explorers ""Deep Impact"". It must be remembered that the disaster situation visualized in this movie is not a figment of imagination - certainly not a ""Godzilla"". Comets and asteroids have struck the earth before, and will certainly do so in the future, whether we like it or not. The only question is whether the human race will escape the devastation such an event will probably cause.The movie has an oblique reference to Eugene Shoemaker (of ""Shoemaker-Levy"" fame), the astronomer who was one of the first persons to draw attention to the likely threats, and who died in a car accident, as does the corresponding character in the movie. This movie is a disaster movie, but an unusual one in the sense that it's not a slam-bang, macho-Americans-taking-charge-and-saving-the-world type of situation. Instead, the focus is on the lives of ordinary people like us, who face imminent death. Very few of the affected people will escape death and destruction, and people desperately try to save themselves and their loved ones. The story of these people, told from the angle of their emotional turmoil is what makes this movie stand out.This movie will certainly raise the question in the minds of viewers as to what they would do if caught in a situation like this, particularly when you are faced with the choice of being able to save yourself while letting your loved ones and other people die.However, there is one spoiler in this otherwise excellent picture - the astronauts who sacrifice themselves to save the human race communicate with their families back in the Earth via video. The blinded astronaut touches the screen which shows his wife holding up his infant son before the camera. Since these Astronauts are very far away from the Earth, any such communication will experience a time lapse of several minutes, and thus this sequence is completely implausible, apart from being melodramatic, maudlin and overdone.But, all said and done, this is a story of human emotions in the face of adversity. The Indian newspaper ""The Statesman"" said at the end of its review -(possibly not the exact words) ""there is a sense of spiritual and artistic fulfilment"". There certainly is, I fully agree. At the end of it all, I must say I found it spiritually uplifting, a movie of substance.",Deep Impact

I remembered enjoying it the first time quite a lot and wanted to see how it held up after all those years. Verdict? I honestly can't imagine what I was thinking that first time and how I could ever call this film quality entertainment. Most likely my teenage brain stopped at ""giant asteroid destroying Earth - sooooo cool!"", because this film does not have much to offer beyond that.With a global disaster movie you can go one of three basic ways. One, you can get serious and make it all about the big picture - realistic what-ifs, governments' reactions, impact on society, scientific background. Two, you can make it all about the characters - focus on a small group, real and interesting enough to make the audience genuinely care about them. Three, go for pure popcorn entertainment, with great production values and a huge spectacle that never takes itself too seriously. Combinations are possible too - my favorite example is World War Z (the book, not the film), which skillfully combines the first two approaches.Deep Impact is a complete failure, no matter which template you compare it to.The big picture part is unbelievably stupid, as if the writers had a single afternoon to come up with reasonably realistic ways this scenario might play out, and on top of that never bothered to talk to anyone who deals with actual real world disasters. The idea of everyone just going about their daily lives up to the last moment instead of putting a sizable portion of the nation's resources into preparing the majority of the population for the aftermath is too dumb for words. The idea of millions of people dying in the first impact because despite knowing months in advance about it, no one thought to evacuate the coast may be even worse.The characters are equally awful. First of all, there are too many of them. There's only time for a brief introduction and as a result no one goes beyond a cardboard cutout with a couple of ham-handedly presented personality traits. The ones we're supposed to care about - Jenny and Leo with their families - are merely devices for generating artificial drama. Their idiotic actions are supposed to make the audience sympathize with them and feel their emotions. In my case they made me wish the tsunami would hurry up and wash them away already (with the sole exception of Jenny's mother, who I thought was rather interesting and well played).Finally, Deep Impact is too cheap, too serious and too boring to be successful in the last category - pure, silly fun. The special effects are third rate, the humor non-existent and the plot slowly stumbles towards one of the least satisfying endings in the history of the disaster film genre. The climax should either tie up all the parts of the plot into a nice, satisfying package, or leave us wondering about what happens next - on the big, planetary scale, as well as with the characters we've come to care about. In Deep Impact the character are either killed by their unfathomable stupidity pretending to be deep sentiment and romantic natures, or they simply disappear, their future fate unknown and unimportant (though I imagine quite a lot of regrets in their future, concerning the needless deaths of their loved ones). The big picture is narrowed down to an optimistic speech and the image of reconstruction of a single part of a single country (which seems to stand for the entirety of human race in this case).Ultimately the film that features one of the greatest natural disasters imaginable ends not with a bang, but with a disinterested whimper. Which could be considered quite an achievement, but not the kind I would give any stars for.",Deep Impact
391,lillychr14,Still good years later,8,30 April 2005,"I just saw this film again after several years. I feel that it was the best of all the disaster films made in recent years. Not too much cheese, a little heavy on sap but satisfying overall. It was much more realistic than Armageddon(which I think is one of the most overrated 'blockbusters' ever)There are no comic relief characters, no cheesy one-liners and no gorgeous movie stars(no offense to Tea Leoni). The solution to the problem was more real in Deep Impact and the time frame was much more believable. I like how the film focused more on what was happening on earth rather than in the spaceship. The end was interesting because the disaster wasn't totally averted so there was no cheerful hugging in the end with lame Aerosmith playing over it. The only thing that bothered me was that all of the nuclear missiles from the US and Russia had no effect on the comet. Wouldn't several hundred nukes do something? anything? and why wasn't the Messiah destroyed in the blast? So overall, good flick, deserves more credit.",Deep Impact
392,ratchet123,A Poor Man's Armageddon,3,28 July 2015,"This movie could have been a lot better, it's premise is great (asteroid on course to strike earth, mission sent to destroy asteroid fails, only very few people on Earth are selected to live on after the asteroid hits, leaving the rest to die a horrible death BUT they have many months before this happens so they must all still live together and wait for the inevitable) but what was needed to make it fulfil it's potential is completely missing.The aim of this movie is to make you care about the characters and make almost every scene in the second half either a tearjerker or a philosophical eye opener. Now, if this had have been achieved then this would be a very good movie, cheesy but still a good movie. But it fails rather miserably to do any of these things because it is killed by three main factors; terrible pacing, complete lack of character development and a pretty awful, cliché dependent script not to mention the below par acting by many of the actors. As a result of all this, I felt absolutely zero emotional attachment to any of the characters which in a movie so heavy with sentiment, is a huge failure in itself. Also, I never felt excited or gripped by any of the action or suspenseful scenes because they would always be ruined by the never ending cheesy lines of dialogue or the shoddy special effects and I almost lost all interest near the end. The sad thing is, even with a little better character development, this could have been a far better movie if it didn't feel like I was being forced to care about the under developed romance of the two teenagers who have a combined screen time of about 20 minutes or the irritating reporter with the personality of a spoon.Now, compare this to it's unintentional but obvious counterpart, Armageddon, which may just be a big dumb blockbuster as well but it still makes me well up, get goosebumps, laugh and smile with joy in so many memorable scenes because of it's likable protagonists, satisfactory character development & plot, great pacing and fantastic cinematography, music & special effects. That's what makes a good blockbuster, Deep Impact, on the other hand made me feel none of this and really pales in comparison in my opinion.I give it a generous 3 out of 10.",Deep Impact
393,devincrim25,People were really dumb in 1998,1,18 January 2015,"I was 5 years old when this movie came out in 1998, and vaguely remember it being a big deal, along with Armageddon. Lo and behold, 17 years later I find this ""classic"" on Netflix. Its Tuesday night and I don't want to start on my homework yet, so I thought I would give this ""classic"" a view.Now, I'm not an astronomy major, but I'm pretty sure an Earth killing comet would be spotted by someone other than a group of snotty nose kids in a field, since, yanno, people look for comets all of the time. Furthermore, there is no way the Government, which can't even keep itself funded half of the time could keep the news secret, since eventually you would be able to SEE the comet with your naked eye. Also, blowing a comet up only creates more chucks of ice, that basically equals the mass of the entire comet. Therefore, you would not only still have to deal with the full effects of the impact, but debris would hit more places around the globe.The science in this movie is bad, but considering this was probably a summer blockbuster aimed at basically stealing 7 bucks from dumb Americans its OK. What is NOT OK is the acting, and the actions several characters take. There are several characters that behaved so stupidly and unnaturally I couldn't list them all if I tried, so I'll focus on the dumbest. 12 year old Leo, the kid that found the comet gets married (lol) to his 12 year old girlfriend. They are offered a spot underground and will survive the Comet. Leo's girlfriend decides she wants to DIE with her mom and dad. Young Leo can't accept this, and turns away to go get his girlfriend, AFTER YOUNG LEO AND HIS PARENTS HAVE ALREADY TRAVELED TO THE OZART MOUNTAINS IN MISSOURI, THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM THEIR VIRGINIA HOMES. Young Leo's parents say ""aww, OK, here is a WATCH SO YOU CAN TRADE WITH PEOPLE ON YOUR WAY 3000 MILES BACK TO OUR OLD HOUSE, BE SAFE SON"". What parents in their right minds would allow this. You're sending your 12 year old son out into a world that will be on FIRE I 20 minutes with no realistic way of evening getting out of the parking lot before impact. Also, remember, this girl CHOSE to STAY with her parent and DIE in a tidal wave, rather than be with Leo. I used to be 12 years old, and every girl I meet was the ""one"". I would never leave a secure location to go be with a girl that would literally rather DIE IN A TIDAL WAVE than LIVE with me.Anyway, Leo somehow makes it across the country, back to his Virginia house in less than 10 minutes with no means of transportation, and finds his lover in traffic. This time, she RELUCTANTLY agrees to go with him, 10 minutes before the comet slams into the ocean. Young Leo outruns a tidal wave moving 1100 MPH on a scooter. Let me say that again. Young Leo outruns a tidal wave moving at 1100 MPH on a scooter. I guess that makes sense considering he got from the Ozark Mountains in Missouri to Virginia in 10 minutes walking. Maybe HE should have been tasked with blowing up the comet.Oh, I almost forgot about the ending. The idiots in space nuke the 2nd chuck of comet, ""saving"" the planet. Like I said before, the energy released from the comet would have the same effect regardless if its a solid body or broken up into chucks. Would you rather have 1000 nuclear bombs explode in one place, or 1000 places? Just Stupid. I can't believe this movie turned a profit and I can't believe its considered a ""classic"". Morgan Freeman should demand his name by deleted from the credits. Just imagine watching a bad soap opera, music and all, wrapped in a disaster movie. I didn't even discuss the reporter. Awful. This is what I get for procrastinating on homework.",Deep Impact
394,JZeth,See This Movie.,9,2 June 2005,"Deep Impact is a well-done and thoughtful film that powerfully delivers the human touch in its pondering of the age-old question: What if extinction was just around the corner?Deep Impact is most often compared to its death-comet partner from the summer of '98, Armageddon. Deep Impact is a drama; Armageddon is an action film, and delivers just what we would expect from an action film, namely, over-the-top characters, a simplistic storyline, and an abundance of special effects. Deep Impact presents just the opposite: Characters that are notably human, several dovetailed story lines, and it saves the special effects (which are very good) for the movie's climax.Armageddon did better at the box office primarily because it was much more hyped, and because it featured an A-list star (Bruce Willis) while Deep Impact did not. Its enjoyability, though, is very limited: If you are not a fan of the action genre, you will not like Armageddon. Deep Impact is the substantially better film and reaches out to the viewer to a far deeper degree.As you certainly know, the plot revolves around the fact that a seven-mile-wide comet is on a collision course with earth, and if it makes impact it will represent an Extinction Level Event (i.e., the death of all life on the planet). Having about a year and a half's notice of this, the U.S. and Russian governments send a spacecraft, the Messiah, to destroy the comet by drilling nuclear warheads into its core and then detonating. The movie focuses on three primary story lines: 1. The young reporter Jenny Lerner (Tea Leoni) and her struggles with her career and her parents; 2. The high-school couple of Leo Biederman (who discovered the comet; Elijah Wood) and Sarah (Leelee Sobieski); 3. The crew of the Messiah.All three story lines are done in such a way that the viewer easily sympathizes with the very believable characters. The best done of the three is the spaceship's crew, although the most time is spent with Jenny. They all suffer from the film's only notable problem: The story lines seem somewhat rushed. Considering its broad scope, Deep Impact clearly would benefit from an extra 30 minutes to develop, especially with the underdone angle with Leo and Sarah, but the directors evidently decided two hours was all they could use.Deep Impact, as I mentioned, lacks an A-list star, but it does feature superb performances from two of the best supporting actors of our generation: Robert Duvall (Spurgeon Tanner, captain of the spaceship) and Morgan Freeman (Tom Beck, the U.S. President). Duvall is definitely the standout of the film with an A+ performance as Tanner.As for the other actors/actresses: Tea Leoni (playing Jenny Lerner) gets the most face time in the film and delivers a believably good performance. Maximillian Schell as Jenny's father is the one notable casting mistake; I'm not sure what they were going for with him, but they could have done better. Venessa Redgrave does well as Jenny's divorcée mother.Elijah Wood (now a star but at the time just an up-and-comer) works very well as the teenage Leo Biederman, and Leelee Sobieski as his girlfriend Sarah gives us as good a performance as we can expect, considering how woefully underdeveloped her character is. The film arguably devotes a bit too much time to Jenny and her father and not enough to Leo and Sarah.If you haven't seen this movie yet, it should be at the top of your must-see list. The film moves at a good pace (if a bit fast), grabs your attention at the beginning and holds it throughout, and it features a truly exceptional final 20-25 minutes. What stands out most about this movie is its human touch and sensitivity. It manages to probe an impressive array of human emotions in two hours' time, and it will leave you with plenty to think about -- although it probably will not leave you with dry eyes. There are precisely three movies I have seen that caused the room to get dusty around me (if you get my drift), and this is one of them.In conclusion: See this movie.",Deep Impact

396,sanaannethomas-39599,Infuriatingly bad - what were they thinking?!,2,12 September 2020,"Apart from the movie being horrendously boring (how did they manage to make an apocalypse movie boring?), I became increasingly agitated by the poorly thought out storyline of pretty much all the characters in the film as the movie progressed. The storyline that particularly had me reaching for the 'off' button was the one of young Leo's - dear God, where do I begin??! - He marries a 12yo girl to SAVE HER LIFE and take her on the spaceship, but she decides that she would rather DIE with her parents than go with him to safety. Skip several boring scenes and Leo and his parents are ready to board the spaceship. It is at this point that Leo decides that he would rather go chasing after his girlfriend who chose death over him than to save himself by getting onboard. His parents are totally okay with this decision and his father even sacrifices his own entry ticket for this stupid girl and everyone just accepts it like that was a normal thing to do - What?? And then, when Leo finds his GF again, she is still very reluctant to go with him and has to be heavily persuaded by her parents to go. By this point I don't care about any of the characters and I hope they all die from the impact! Seriously shoddy writing - I do not recommend this film.",Deep Impact

It disillusioned the magic of film for me, not only was it a total rip off of Armageddon, which came out the same year, it was just generally a horrible flick. The only reason I can conjure up as to why Morgan Freeman would take a role in such a piece of crap film was that he got to play the president. He did a good job, but the story line made no sense, this asteroid is heading towards earth and instead of a demolition crew (Armageddon) a team of astronauts is sent up to destroy it. They're attempt to fails, as does the US's attempt to blow it up with missiles, but somehow by crashing the space ship into it, the asteroid magically is broken up. They totally stole the exploding space ship scene from Independence day (when the pieces of the ship fall through the atmosphere), and the whole movie premise from Armageddon.

398,dp-71810,A good movie to leave your mind in neutral and just enjoy.,5,16 February 2019,"I gave this a 5 because it is good and simple, with some humanistic soft points and the core subject of the earth being affected in such a way as to be something no country could hide from. Events on earth are more likely to affect us than a comet or asteroid wiping us out. Some aspects were genuinely reasonable to expect happening if it was real, whilst others not so much. The action sequences are fun and give you a sense of tension. The actual event is pretty much true to what an impact would actually be like and would do to our planet. People panicking and fighting to get to evacuation centres does reflect what people may do under duress of this type, I know I would want to save myself and loved ones and do anything in my power to achieve that. Acting credits are mixed, Morgan Freeman is his usual classy self, Robert Duvall is old school cool, but Tea Leonie comes across as bland and not very convincing, she seems to be confused about her part, is she a hard hitting investigative reporter, annoyed daughter about her fathers new wife, or is she an orphan of the parents separation? She has no depth in this role and laboured through it. Overall everyone else did a workmanlike job.

400,Jimi_Z,Realism or Romanticism,10,11 November 1998,"I would have to say that Deep Impact was far superior than the unrealistic Armageddon. The reason for those who oppose this view is because they seek a heart pounding, adrenaline rush, with straight immediate action at every turning point rather than that of an actual story' to the movie. All great writers of past times are known for their dramatic entrances. Shakespeare, Twain, and all of the others relied on a good story line, rather than of mystical fantasy unrealistic plots for their writings. In this sense, I say that Deep Impact is far more realistic, and better written than Armageddon. I can, however, understand those who think otherwise. I saw the movie twice; once by myself, and once with a group of my friends.

Heck, if my girlfriend and I knew the world was gonna end and the only way she could live is by coming with me to the shelter, and the only way she could do that is to marry me, then I'm gonna make sure that happens.The effects were great -- in my opinion, MUCH better than Armageddon's, which were so over-the-top they were laughable.On the whole, there was only one asteroid flick worth watching, and it sure as heck wasn't ""Armageddon.""",Deep Impact

Today, opinions, though always valid, are all over the map. The same has happened with popular music... 50 years ago, everyone liked Glenn Miller. Today, you can find hordes that hate even the most accomplished artists. My point is that our tastes and expectations as a population have completely splintered. The wide variety of negative and nit-picky comments here reflect this trend.Having said this, here is why I like this movie, regardless of certain gaps in plot, geography, ""realism"", etc. I am a fan of the old movies. Very rarely in the old movies did anyone fuss over such minor issues as alot of you folk fuss over. What counted was CHARACTERS and STORY. As far as these two elements go, Deep Impact is a completely realized and worthwhile film. And, like many of the old movies, it has a large a colorful cast that is well integrated into the main thread of the plot.Deep Impact is not a ""disaster"" movie in the traditional sense of the term. Rather, it is about the personal impact that the threat of worldwide doom has on a representative collection of characters, who happen to be involved in the efforts to stave off calamity. While the film does not immediately address the reaction of the public at large -- perhaps the film's one major flaw -- it choses to gauge the impact of the disaster by examining close-up the lives of individuals -- a literary and storytelling technique as old as Homer or the Bible. In doing so, the film accentuates and dramatizes the emotions of its main characters, and in turn communicates more directly to us the viewer.In chosing this tack for relating its subject matter, the film occasionally lurches into sentimentality, particularly in the final scene where the astronauts sacrifice themselves to save the world. It is here that the viewer senses he is watching actors portraying heroes. But the old movies were replete with this kind of tugging at the emotions, and for me, it still works; I'm just a sentimentalist at heart. And I feel sorry for those of you who have become so hardened by modern life that this has no power over you... You just can't stand the lousy effects or geographical inconsistencies!",Deep Impact

Deep Impact doesn't have the cosmic character of WWC. But it has its own charms, and I think should be appreciated as a character drama. Unlike Armageddon, the vastly-inferior film in which Bruce Willis saves the Earth, Deep Impact is about everyday characters whose world is about to end. They must make choices, not so much about their own survival (though some make those choices), but in many cases about how they will deal with NOT surviving. I found it a very personal movie, one where the characters really affected me. While there is a great deal of excitement and action, the performances of Vanessa Redgrave, Maximilian Schell, and Robert Duvall all display heroism in one way or another. Some of the characters display great heroism in the big sense; others display a much smaller heroism of keeping their dignity when they could give in to panic and futility. I don't think it's a perfect movie, by any stretch of the imagination. There are spots where continuity is strained a bit, where you think, 'now how did we get HERE'. There are a couple of coincidences that certainly caused me to suspend my suspension of disbelief.

We have been doing this for many years and it never gets old. It's a story of pure human spirit that encourages us to fight on for humanity and others. The acting is top notch, the story clean and engaging all throughout. It doesn't need all the wiz-bang of modern day action-hero movies; it stands on it's own. You can relate to the characters easily and really wonder, if the earth were to explode, what would I do.

I will tell you my favourite scenes and character, which must be the president, he really makes you believe that if the world was about to come to an end the president would be exactly like that.

OK, so some of the technical aspects had flaws, but the storyline was good and the special FX were quite impressive, especially the last fifteen minutes when armageddon time rapidly approaches.Loaded with stars, past and present, from films and popular TV shows over the last decade or so, gives the movie a comfortable feel about it.Denise Crosby's character doesn't survive, another example of her making a successful career playing dead and, quoting the tag line for Pet Semetary ""sometimes dead is better.""All in all, a film to just give the ""gray cells"" a night off and just enjoy.",Deep Impact

It's an exciting, well-directed and well-acted disaster movie, with a fine ensemble cast and top-notch special effects. About the worst thing I can say about it is just how earnestly straight-down-the-middle it is tonally and emotionally, but that's a small price to pay when the alternative is it could've been made by Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay.",Deep Impact

And I thoroughly enjoyed it both times. The characters are interesting and well-rounded, and you do actually care about what happens to them - some sequences are really quite moving. The plot is absorbing, and - generally - believable, and the special effects are incredible. There's also very good attention to detail, which 'pulls you in' and maintains your interest. Far better than The Day After Tomorrow, which covers similar subject matter (cataclysmic world event), but which - for me - was a major disappointment. I'd happily watch Deep Impact again...though maybe not this week!",Deep Impact
423,sauron_tg,A Film that is Definitely Worth Seeing,8,22 March 2007,"I first saw this movie when I was about ten. I didn't exactly follow it, I just wanted to see all the cool special effects. Then, just last week, I saw it again. To me, the movie was the real Armagedon. The film begins with a young astronomer noticing something out of place in the midnight sky. He sends the picture to an observatory, where the house astronomer makes a horrifying discovery...it's a comet on a collision course with Earth. In this film, the world governments have a year+ to come up with a plan to divert the comet. The plan is twofold, Land a large spacecraft on the comet, bury a couple of nukes 100m deep, blow the nukes and send the comet off course. If that fails, the government plans to move a couple hundred thousand people into NORAD (A nuke-proof fortress built into a mountain) and wait out the death, destruction, and mayhem. The film is focused on three people; a reporter, the young astronomer and his girlfriend, and the astronaut captain who leads the mission to save earth. Their paths never cross, yet their stories are woven together beautifully as they cope with a tidal wave of emotions that hit. This film is a bit sappy. Guys expect your girlfriend/wife to cry, you might even also. In the end, it's a story of sacrifice. True heroes, risking, giving up their lives for someone else. In the end, you'll find yourself depressed and uplifted at the same time.",Deep Impact

I made a bad choice with Deep Impact. It's incredibly talky, has an extremely hokey script and for nearly three-quarters of it's narrative (if not more) is very boring. All of the ""excitement"" comes at the end in a series of very poorly done special effects shots, with the most banal music playing in the background. This one has to be one of the worst films I've ever sat though. Is it poorly shot, no of course not. It's very professionally produced. Is the cast good, yes, of course. In fact, I can't imagine what might have drawn such a good cast to such a dud of a script.

The only thing that help hold my attention long enough to figure this out was the fact that Morgan Freeman was a part of it. I hold his movies in a field of their own and always give them a chance, strictly because of his superb past performances. Without him and the special effects, this is just another pathetic attempt at a typical disaster movie. Armageddon was so much more entertaining. It held a perfect balance of drama, action and comedic performances. Although it wasn't going to win any Oscars, it's by far one of my favorite movies. Let's remember....it wasn't made to win Oscars...it was made to entertain and that's exactly what it does.

427,mojospfx,One of the best of it's kind,8,22 January 2009,"DEEP IMPACT was largely overshadowed by ""Armageddon,"" a film with a similar story that was released at about the same time. Both feature classic disaster-movie structure (as more or less invented by Irwin Allen), but there is a big difference between these films. As you'd expect from director Michael Bay, ""Armageddon"" is all show and no go - it's filled with lots of top-notch eye candy and visual effects, but that's ALL it has to offer. The characters and story are typical of Michael Bay, which means they are all boring, cheesy stereotypes offering nothing beyond Hollywood clichés. This film might as well be called ""Hollywood Meteor Movie."" On the other hand, ""Deep Impact"" takes a very realistic look at what would happen if a comet really was on course for Earth. Events are depicted with believability and, for the most part, you care about what happens to the characters. Yes, there is some cheese factor involved, so the movie isn't perfect, but the movie's heart is in the right place. I, for one, appreciate the attempt to tell a realistic story and not just create a vehicle for special effects.",Deep Impact

This second is gone. And this second is gone forever. You'll never experiance them again. I think we could learn  a lot from the charactors in Deep Impact. Love, sacrifice, hope, and the fear and respect for the One who allowed Wolfe and Beiderman to alarm the World but to bring together a Nation. That's what I got from Deep Impact.

I never was a fan of sad movies, but even though it made me cry like crazy towards the end, I loved this one.

The dialog has no spark, the humor is pretty much non-existent, the characters are cardboard at best.b) What the hell is going on with the camera? It looks like they mounted the thing on top of an Indy 500 car. They show a room full of people sitting at desks and the camera is wheeling around like mad, desperately trying to mask the fact that you are looking at a roomful of people sitting at desks. They guys who made the Bourne Identity did this a lot too. It's cheap and unnecessary. Leave the action where there's actually action.c) Central casting was clearly at work here. Many scenes have the feel of some nutty old film from 1935, like when the crowd gathers outside Frodo's house. You can just see someone going ""Dog! We need a dog in the scene."" The sense of composition is just atrocious -- it's like they set Norman Rockwell loose on the set. Gads.

They had a good story to tell, hello great actors, but something went wrong. It's not spectacular. In fact, if you only listen to the president's (Morgan Freeman) speeches, you understand what is all about, without having to watch the rest.

I just couldn't stand her face any longer. It's good she got hit by that big wave. It's for a better planet.Besides Tea Leoni there was another very annoying thing about this movie; that constantly going, mystic, fairytale music in the background. This so called ""beautifull story"" about the end of mankind proves us how terrible selfish we people actually are. The story is about a global killer but all you see is the United States. Oh no, wait, just put some Russian nuke-pro on the Messiah spacecraft and Hollywood has shown solidarity with the world.People will never get it.

I've been a fan of Elijah Wood and LeeLee Sobieski for years, and neither one of them disappointed me in this film. Elijah is adorable and if you're expecting him to be his usual slightly awkward yet totally adorable self, this movie is what you're looking for. Additionally, LeeLee is absolutely stunning as usual.What I loved most about this film is that while it contained action and adventure, it was also appropriate for a family to watch. There was not an excessive amount of cursing or lewd behaviors. In fact, there was little to none of that stuff you find in so-called family movies these days. This was a wholesome, adventure filled film that most ages can enjoy. I would not recommend this film for younger children simply because there is a lot of action and talk of impending doom. That subject alone could seriously scare and confuse smaller children.For a movie from 1998 I felt the special effects were very well done and the story line well thought out. The actors all played their parts very well and I truly don't have much of a complaint about the movie other than I would've liked a little more smooching between LeeLee and Elijah. ;) All in all, this is a truly great film and I'll be showing it to my children in a few years.",Deep Impact

My family went to see it at the Drive-in which airs 2 movies, in which Deep Impact was the second. I fell asleep 1/4 of the way through the movie (about 10:00pm). I woke to the action packed ending. I was a little lost on the story, but caught up rather quickly since there wasn't much to follow. I couldn't really judge the movie since I slept through most of it. Twenty two years later (wow, already?!) I rewatched the movie. About 1/4 of the way through the movie, it lost my interest again. This time I didn't fall asleep, but I struggled to watch it. The middle of the movie was just boring filler and not enough action. No wonder I fell asleep! The graphics didn't really hold up, but they hardly ever did back then. The ending of the movie wasn't bad still, so I'd definitely recommend just sleeping through the middle and waking up to the end.",Deep Impact

Also, the acting in this film is just fantastic (but again, Armageddon was well-acted as well). After viewing the film again today, I thought ""ya know, there is virtually nothing in the film that I really disliked"", whereas there are a number of things in Armageddon that I really disliked! The cast in this film is absolutely superb! You've got Robert Duvall, Tea Leoni, Elijah Wood, Vanessa Redgrave, Morgan Freeman, Maximilian Schell, James Cromwell, Ron Eldard, Jon Faverau, Laura Innes, Mary McCormack, Richard Schiff, Leelee Sobieski, Blair Underwood, Dougray Scott and Kurtwood Smith. They all did a superb job in this film and I think they all deserve a great deal of credit. I really liked that all the characters in the film were likable. There wasn't a single one that ""rubbed me the wrong way"", they were all very well done characters.I have to mention the special effects as well. They are just mind-blowing! All of the scenes with the astronauts on the comet are just superb! ...And the ship that they fly looks so cool! Also, the scene where the smaller comet hits the earth is just great! The level of detail is unbelievable in some of the scenes. You should see this film for the special effects alone.If you like science fiction films with a great story that is quite touching at times, then by all means go see it.

Throughout the movie, everyone shows very little reaction to the news that a comet the size of Manhattan is hurtling to Earth, potentially killing every person and creature on our planet. The expressions on the actors and actresses are blank, emotionless, kind of immediately resigned to dying in about a year. Weird how other reviews liked the acting and how the flick touched them. I seriously don't get it. Deep Impact was too unrealistic by how Americans acted or really didn't act. In reality, mass hysteria would build, criminal and impulsive behaviors would increase, and society would start unraveling. The President was totally unbelievable and and the reporter was literally like a zombie, stating horrible news like someone who is reporting the loss of a championship high school football game. No one reacted realistically. The characters on the rescue ship made efforts at showing some human emotion, but they came off as wooden and dull. The major flaw in the movie is that most people on Earth ... including the main characters ... would react far more strongly, more unpredictably, than the way everyone reacts in the flick.",Deep Impact

No, wait: it's not because it has a great plot (it does) or because of mind blowing special effects (they are OK). It's because of the people in the movie! They act like real people would act. They feel like real people would feel. When you see something happening, you experience it with them. When you see someone crying, you hurt for them. The major characters experience life in an extremely realistic way. Additionaly, their science is reasonably acceptable and they don't rely on the ""luck"" approach to mold the plot the way they want.

For some reason they want me to write ten lines. This is too much control. At any rate, Hollywood needs to develop some piety and fear of God. It's only a matter of time now that real judgment strikes this earth. What a day that is going to be. Anyway, I feel like I wasted my time by watching this irreverent movie.

Despite the title borrowed from some porn movie, Deep Impact pretends to be serious and realistic, but EVERY scene ends up being completely inconsistent, unrealistic, pretentious, infantile or cheesy (in most cases all of these at the same time). Each scene starts out as if it's going somewhere, but then it falls apart in front of your eves, giving you the impression that the storyline was improvised on set or the director just had a bad headache throughout the whole thing. Whenever the storyline comes to a standstill, someone starts to talk about faith and God, or we are presented some didactic biblical reference.
We follow a bunch of random people who are marginal to the outcome of the events and most of their actions lack any common sense. The dialogues are painfully terrible and pointless. The more you learn about the characters the more unbelievable they become. As funny element the extras behave as if they're in a musical.

The fact that Sarah's parents gives Leo and his girlfriend the baby, so that the family have a chance to prevail... it would have been such a beautiful ending to a potentially great character study.This would also have been a great movie if it focused solely on the handful of astronauts and their mission to save the planet from a comet, their intricate relationships with each other and the climbing desperation to salvage the failing mission. The fact that they sacrifice themselves to save not only their own newborn babies, their families and friends, and indeed the whole planet... it would have been such a beautiful ending to a potentially great character study.Instead we get shallow versions of all of the above, which is a shame and a half. The slightly less shallow story arc is that of Jenny, and to be honest that's the only part of the movie I enjoy. The splintered and dysfunctional family, the photographs reminding Jenny of what she once had with her father, and the final reunion between them just before they are crushed by the deep impact waves was actually deeply moving (no pun intended).As such, it's very difficult to rate the movie properly. You've got a somewhat solid character piece, a diamond in the rough basically, a diamond wrapped in layers and layers of boring and uninteresting and shallow... stuff. You can on the one hand bawl your eyes out when the wave hits Jenny and her father. But on the other hand you definitely won't bawl your eyes out when the astronauts sacrifices themselves nor when Sarah's parents give up the baby. It's a shame really.",Deep Impact

454,covey-6,"under rated, yes. mixed genre films are",7,20 January 2007,"Deep Impact is a sci fi film, of course. But it is also a story about how relationships change, grow, and deteriorate in the face of cataclysmic destruction and probable death. It is these mixed themes that produce mixed reviews: is this a relationship film? An apocalyptic sci fi blow up film? Yes, to both questions. And doing both means the doing either better, than anything else out there, won't happen in the time allotted.Still, it is satisfying in both themes. Great in either. No. But good enough. (Consider that people respond with commendable rationality in the face of certain death and the technology depicted is 10 years ahead of what we have at this writing).Still, the film involves the viewer sufficiently to force one to consider how she or he would respond in the face of the events depicted. That level of personal involvement is rare in most current cinema and makes this a film worthy of return viewing.",Deep Impact
