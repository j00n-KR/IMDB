0,Leofwine_draca,Good and bad,5,4 October 2020,"DARK FATE is the latest in the unending TERMINATOR franchise, but I still think none of these films are worth watching more than once since the highly enjoyable third instalment. DARK FATE manages to be a bit better than the previous couple, not that that's much of an achievement. The plot of this one feels like a little more thought has gone into it, so it's a pity that the majority of the action sequences are just content to riff and copy what's come previously; the only genuinely new scene, on the airplane, is a mish-mash of overbearing CGI where it's a struggle to make out what's going on. This film has a solid trio of female leads going for it, and a fun supporting turn from Schwarzenegger, too, but it does feel highly generic at times and there's too much of it reliant on CGI and not enough of it grounded in the world of physical reality, a common complaint with modern Hollywood films.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1,SnoopyStyle,best of the rest,7,21 January 2020,"Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) had stopped Judgement Day but a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is still able to kill a young John Connor. Skynet never happens. In the present day, a Rev-9 terminator robot arrives from the future to kill Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) while Grace (Mackenzie Davis), an augmented human, is here to protect her. Sarah has been receiving encrypted texts from an unknown source warning her of the incoming time travelers.Aside from the original two classics, this franchise has been slowly descending into a mess. This one is probably one of the better ones with the rest. The writing works and is actually understandable. It is a relief not to fight Skynet again. The plot mostly makes sense which can't be said of many of the later ones. While it is interesting to rewrite some of the references, it doesn't need to keep doing it. It's a crutch for this franchise. The theme of self-determination gets a bit too overbearing and so are the callous border guards. The detention center is a little too on the nose and also very unlikely. They should be all taken to a more secure location together after the border guards are told that they are high level drug gang members and they get hit by an explosion. They would assume that these are high value targets. At the detection center, killing that border agent is simply mean-spirited. She should live to see the carnage. The ending goes on too long but that is often the case nowadays. This script is able to wrestle the franchise into submission but the clock has probably run out on this franchise. It needs a cleaning.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2,Prismark10,Terminator: Dark Fate,6,17 January 2020,"Effectively the Terminator franchise ended up in a cul de sac after Terminator 2. At least Terminator 3 tried to something different even if it just added a female killer cyborg to the ingredients.Dark Fate is a mish mash of T1 and T2. There is an air of seen it done better. This one has better CGI.Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) and her brother Diego (Diego Boneta) are working in a factory in Mexico City. They find herself under attack. One woman comes to her rescue, Grace (Mackenzie Davis) an augmented human from the future.They are getting away from the advanced Rev-9 Terminator (Gabriel Luna) who has the ability to split into two. During the pursuit Dani's brother is killed and Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) arrives to help them.Grace tells Dani that her mission is to keep Dani safe as she has an important role to play in the future.To keep safe the group goes to a remote cabin that is a source of cryptic messages for the arrival of Terminators from the future.The film has an opening scene that deals with the future of John Connor. It is also a sign that James Cameron has returned to the franchise.I could not help noticing that there are six credited writers in this movie including Cameron.It lacks the wow factor of Terminator 2. The action scenes are mainly functional, the killer Terminator move faster, jump further and seems to be even more indestructible. I still cannot work out the splitting between the exoskeleton and the liquid metal part of the Rev-9.I actually did wonder if they needed Arnold Schwarzenegger's part and I was not convinced his backstory worked here.Terminator: Dark Fate is a good film but nowhere near the level of the first two films. The disappointing box office of Dark Fate means that this franchise will get another reboot in a few years time.",Terminator - Dark Fate
3,claudio_carvalho,Not Bad,6,19 January 2020,"The Mexican worker Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) is hunted down by the indestructible terminator from the future REV-9 (Gabriel Luna) that kills her father and brother and is protected by the enhanced soldier also from the future Grace (Mackenzie Davis). They flee from the unstoppable terminator and out of the blue Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) helps them on the road. They head to Laredo, Texas, where Grace has the coordinates of a possible support and they meet the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) that killed John Connor and is living in an isolated with his family composed by a wife and a son for a long time. The group teams up to try to destroy the REV-9.""Terminator: Dark Fate"" is a kind of remake of the first film of the franchise with new characters. Dani Ramos is an annoying character and irritates in the beginning with stupid attitudes and lines. It is an unnecessary remake with no explanation why T-800 is old. But the film is full of action and Arnold Schwarzenegger saves the story. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Exterminador do Futuro: Destino Sombrio"" (""The Terminator from the Future: Dark Fate"")",Terminator - Dark Fate
4,nogodnomasters,Come with me or you're dead in 30 seconds,8,4 November 2019,"Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) managed to change the future, but not for the better. SSDD. Grace (Mackenzie Davis) comes from the future to save Mexican Dani (Natalia Reyes) from a Terminator (Gabriel Luna). Linda Hamilton helps out and later Arnie enters the picture.It is a sequel and a reboot all in one. Action filled with the same stuff we knew before. Somehow it doesn't grab me like the first one.Guide: F-word. Mackenzie Davis nudity?",Terminator - Dark Fate
5,kosmasp,Too many big holes,6,15 March 2020,"While the Terminator itself does not have issues with holes (self repairing or whaever you want to call it), a movie with holes like this, might derail in the eyes of the viewer. Forget about logic, forget about convinience, forget about many things. This is beyond suspension of disbelief, which I know some will go ""duh, it's Fantasy/Science Fiction"" - true, but the internal structure should be true, the ""inner logic"" should make sense.Just talking some nonsense and hoping the viewer will not question it might work of course - again this will be entirely up to you. I know quite a few people who cherished this as the new coming, the new savior of films sage (fate?) .. but as the title suggests it is rather dark.Having said that the action and the stunts are good, it looks good and it is a guilty pleasure having Arnold back (well he said he'll be back, didn't he?) .. if that's sufficient go ahead have fun. It's more than possible",Terminator - Dark Fate
6,classicsoncall,"""Yeah, well, you're not an augmented super soldier from the future, are you?""",7,6 August 2020,"See, this is the problem with time anomaly stories, you can wipe out past continuity with the mere implementation of a new script and do away with everything that went before. What you basically have here is the original Terminator story tweaked for a new generation and for anyone who didn't know who John Connor was. In other words, if you never saw ""The Terminator"" or ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", this might serve well as a stand alone story, but for anyone else it's pretty much an insult to fans of the franchise. Seriously, former killing machine, Cyberdyne Systems Model 101 (that would be Arnold), is back as a drapery salesman? Is that what happens to retired cybernetically enhanced assassins from the future? His riff on outfitting a young girl's bedroom with butterflies and balloons might have been the understated highlight of the picture.But if you don't care about any of that, then I guess if you switch your mind off you can have a little bit of fun with the picture. Mackenzie Davis as Grace had the kind of buffed physique Linda Hamilton had back in T2, and to my mind had more of a presence than the nominal hero, Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes). I thought Linda Hamilton played it too angry as the returning Sarah Connor; it didn't help that her age worked against her. Man, there were some scenes where she looked eighty years old.If this doesn't put an end to the Terminator franchise, I don't know what will. At one point, Carl (Schwarzenegger) says to Sarah Connor, ""Cause without purpose, we are nothing"". That pretty much sums it up for me.",Terminator - Dark Fate
7,jboothmillard,Terminator: Dark Fate,4,29 October 2019,"The Terminator and T2: Judgement Day are outstanding films, T3: Rise of the Machines is alright, and Salvation and Genisys are not very good, this sixth instalment served as a continuation of the story from T2. So, like Halloween (2018), it ignores all the others, this was a reboot that also brought back original producer James Cameron, directed by Tim Miller (Deadpool). Basically, three years have passed since Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), and her teenage son John (Edward Furlong), the future saviour of the human race, supposedly stopped Judgement Day and the rise of Skynet. They are relaxing on a beach in Guatemala, when a T-800 Terminator, sent from the future before Skynet's erasure, arrives and shoots John, successfully terminating him. In 2020, a cybernetically-enhanced young woman named Grace (Mackenzie Davis), and a more advanced Terminator model, the Rev-9 (Gabriel Luna), are separately transported from the future to Mexico City. Daniella ""Dani"" Ramos (Natalia Reyes) is living a simple life in Mexico City with her brother Diego (Diego Boneta) and father Vicente (Enrique Arce). She is targeted by the Rev-9, disguised as her father, infiltrates the factory she and Diego work at, but is thwarted by Grace, who escapes with Dani and Diego in a car. The Rev-9 pursues them and reveals its ability to split into two separate entities: a powerful (cybernetic organism) endoskeleton, and a mimetic pollyalloy (liquid metal) exterior. The Rev-9 kills Diego and corners Grace and Dani. Sarah arrives and temporarily disables both parts of the Rev-9 with explosives. After acquiring medical supplies, Grace, Dani, Grace and Sarah retreat to a motel. Grace reveals that she has been sent from 2042 to protect Dani. Sarah believes that, like her, Dani is destined to give birth to the future Resistance leader. Sarah says that she knew where to find them because in the years since John's death she has received messages detailing the arrivals of Terminators, which she then destroys; each message ends with the words ""For John"". Grace says that Skynet does not exist in her future, but humanity is instead threatened by an AI called Legion, designed for cyberwarfare. In this altered future, Legion seizes control of servers worldwide and humanity detonates nuclear devices to create an EMP, this attempt to neutralize Legion is unsuccessful. A global network of machines is built by Legion to exterminate the human survivors. Grace traces the messages to a location across the Mexico-United States border, while the Rev-9 surmises they will cross the border after tracking the group through surveillance technology. It infiltrates the United States Border Patrol and arranges for the group to be arrested. The Rev-9 attempts to kill Dani, but she, Grace and Sarah escape in a helicopter. They travel to the source of the messages, a secluded house in the woods. Sarah is shocked to find that the person living there is the T-800 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who murdered John, now much older, and calling himself ""Carl"". After killing John, completing its objective, the Terminator was aimless and attempted to integrate into humanity, developing a conscience. As ""Carl"", the Terminator became an adoptive father to a human family, and its ""mission"" became to look after them. Carl explains that it sent Sarah the messages to give her purpose. Although she accepts that they will need his help, Sarah promises Carl that once the Rev-9 is destroyed she will kill him, he accepts this. The group meet an old acquaintance of Sarah's to gain a military grade EMP that will hopefully destroy the Rev-9. The Rev-9 eventually catches up with the group, who steal an aircraft, the EMP is destroyed in the gunfire exchange. Aboard, Grace reveals that Dani is the future leader of the Resistance and will become Grace's adoptive mother after the apocalypse. Grace, Sarah, and Dani parachute to safety, while Carl and Rev-9 crash into a river beside a hydro-power plant. Rev-9 damages Carl and goes after Dani, but she, Grace and Sarah knock it into the river's strong current. The group reunites with Carl and breaks into the plant ready to take a stand against Rev-9. Carl and Grace force the Rev-9 into a spinning turbine that subsequently explodes. Rev-9's severely damaged endoskeleton survives, but its liquid exterior is destroyed. A dying Grace orders Dani to use her power source as an EMP to destroy the Rev-9. Dani is subdued by Rev-9 until Carl reactivates and restrains it. Dani stabs Rev-9 with Grace's power source, and Carl drags itself and Rev-9 over a ledge into a pit, where the resulting electrical discharge melts and destroys both machines. Later, Dani watches Grace as a child; she tells Sarah that she is determined to avert Grace's death. Sarah tells her it is time to train as the pair drives off together. Also starring Alicia Borrachero as Carl's Wife and Steven Cree as Rigby. Hamilton is pretty convincing as the veteran vigilante who has seen it all, an older Schwarzenegger is alright with some one-liners, Davis is good as the upgraded human, and Luna is okay as the new villainous machine. So, in this film, Sarah Connor isn't dead, and John didn't go into a nuclear bunker with his future wife, and everything else after that didn't happen either. That's the basics out of the way, unfortunately, this is perhaps overloaded with clever but sometimes complicated ideas, you have to remind yourself of the new future to come, and try to get past some slightly small plot holes or questions maybe not fully answered, at least the special effects, chases and explosive stuff is fine, overall it's confusing, a disappointing, only sort of alright science-fiction action thriller. Okay!",Terminator - Dark Fate
8,BA_Harrison,Familiar plot with added oestrogen.,6,23 October 2019,"Strip away all of the expensive digital special effects razzmatazz and what you have here is a very familiar plot cobbled together from bits and bobs taken from the previous five Terminator movies, with a heavy dose of political correctness and feminism, this being 2019 and all. Sarah Connor is old, the bodyguard from the future is an augmented young woman, mankind's only hope is a teeny tiny girl from Mexico, and Arnie's T-800 has developed a conscience and settled down with a family (I kid you not).Don't bother trying to work out how this film fits into the whole Terminator timeline: they pretty much explain away most of the other movies to make it easier on the viewer. All you need to know is that another terminator has been sent from the future to kill Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes), saviour of the human race, and lots of stuff gets shot at, blown up, and smashed into a gazillion pieces in the process. Nasty terminator (Gabriel Luna) is virtually indestructible, which means that there's even more carnage than ever, because in Hollywood's eyes, bigger is always better.Unfortunately, director Tim Miller really doesn't know when to pull hard on the reins, and allows the action to escalate to ridiculous levels. Hence, we have the risible sight of our feisty female trio falling from a burning plane in a Humvee, crashing onto a dam, plummeting over the edge, and being washed along in a flood of water whilst simultaneously being attacked by the rampaging Rev-9 robot. Not since Harrison Ford stumbled out of a lead-lined fridge have I had to suspend my disbelief quite as much.Reasonably enjoyable in a 'switch off your brain and bask in the chaos' kind of way, Dark Fate isn't quite as bad as Genisys (the pared down script at least makes it easy to follow), but even after 28 years and several attempts, they still haven't come close to T2 for sheer entertainment value.",Terminator - Dark Fate
9,paul_haakonsen,But it was just a remake of parts I and II...,6,14 January 2020,"Well, this movie was one that I would eventually get around to watching as I did love the original ""Terminator"" movie and its sequel. But with the evolution of the franchise, I must admit that my expectations were slim. And with all the negative feedback to the movie, I can't claim to have been thrilled.But I got around to watching it, and I must admit that this movie sort of pulls me in two directions. First of all, yeah I was quite entertained, because ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" was non-stop action from start to end. And let me just tell you that you'll be in for quite an adrenaline ride, because the action sequences are just amazing. And the movie is visually quite good, so the CGI and special effects team really worked their magic here. But, yeah there is a but here, the movie just felt very unnecessary, as it was essentially just a remake of the first two ""Terminator"" movies compiled into one movie. Sure, this is good for new audiences to the franchise, but for us whom watched them since the first movie, it was sort of a shallow experience.The Rev-9 terminator was quite nicely made, and the CGI really helped to make it realistic. However, it was just too much of a clone of the terminator in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"". It was a shame, but while it did differ somewhat in terms of what it could and such, then it just felt like a copy/paste job.""Terminator: Dark Fate"" is definitely an entertaining movie, but it is not one that stands out in the franchise. And as I mentioned earlier, it just is permeated by an overwhelming sense of ""why?"" as it is a remake. How about dishing out something new instead of just remaking and rebooting everything? It is so pathetic.My rating of ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" is a six out of ten stars, because I was genuinely entertained by the sheer amount of non-stop action, plus the CGI really was marvelous to behold.",Terminator - Dark Fate
10,sunwarrior13,Dark Fate Makes Up For The Missed Terminator Movies,9,9 December 2019,"Mackenzie Philips stars together with Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger in this sixth film of the Terminator franchise entitled, ""Terminator: Dark Fate"". This movie was based on the story of James Cameron and Charles H. Eglee. It acts as the continuation of the first 2 Terminator films - ""Terminator"" in 1984 and ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" in 1991.In this film,we get to see the story take place 25 years after the events of Terminator 2. We get to see the machines sending an advanced Terminator that is designated as Rev-9 back in time to 2020 to eliminate Dani Ramos,whose fate is connected to the future. Added to that,we also see the Resistance also send Grace,who happens to be an augmented soldier back in time to defend Dani,while joined by Sarah Connor and an aging T-800 Terminator.Overall, the story is a mix of the first two Terminator films. So there is nothing really exciting and great in it. While it will be worthy of mention that the CGI was definitely a lot better today unlike during the release of the first 2 movies, there is nothing really better than it compared to the first 2 films. Evidently,it is not even at par with the first 2 films that both got 10/10 rating in my reviews. But nevertheless,it was nice to see Dark Fate make up for the missed years particularly the the 3rd - Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines in 2003 - and the 4th - Terminator Salvation in 2009 - as well as the fifth - Terminator Genisys in 2015 - Terminator movies.",Terminator - Dark Fate

12,LeonLouisRicci,ARNOLD IS BACK...SARAH IS BACK...PLOT OF T-2 IS BACK...THE CGI ARTISTS ARE BACK BIG-TIME,8,26 August 2021,"In this one there are More SFX, More Chases, More Battles, More Explosive Stunts, More Females, More Latinos, just Exponentially More.Where Your Involvement and Entertainment Value Quota will Land is just How Much More You Want of the Same Formula, and the Time-Line to Make Sense.It's a Gala Event of Terminal Madness in the Hands of a Good Director, a Good Cast, and a CGI Team that could Populate a Small State.The Movie is in Constant Motion.It is Loud, Boisterous, and sometimes Funny.The Story, Recycled from ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" (1991) is Beat for Robot/Augment Beat.Tried and True with Nothing New.A Deja Vu Experience that will have some Relishing the Echoes of Terminators Past and for Others, Not So Much.Just Don't Expect Anything New or Imaginative from Humanity's Fate at the Hands of Humanity's Metal and Circuit Creations.Just Strap In, and Go for the Ride.Intellectualizing the Terminator Universe at this Point in the Franchise has had its Expiration Date.All the Human Actors give Good Endearing Performances and Try to Compete with the CGI for Attention.It's a Losing Battle, though They Do Hold Their Own.",Terminator - Dark Fate
13,CinemaSerf,Worst of the franchise by far...,5,24 October 2019,Terrible film... the use of CGI was very imaginative (if repetitive) but the acting was wooden and the storyline (?) was pathetic. Better than Hellboy 3 - but a damn close thing...,Terminator - Dark Fate
14,zardoz-13,Dark Fate is No Kidding!!!,8,10 November 2019,"The people who made ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" must have liked ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens."" Elements of the latter film appear in the former. For example, a beloved protagonist is bid adieu, mayhap never to return, like Han Solo's exodus from ""The Force Awakens."" Unless you live under a rock, you'll know this ""Terminator"" entry is fronted loaded with fireball females. Three heavy-duty dames dominate the derring-do, just as Daisey Ridley's light-saber wielding Rey drove ""The Force Awakens"" reboot. Meantime, Linda Hamilton encores as Sarah Connor after a 28-year hiatus, looking far more menacing than she did in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" Columbian-born beauty Dani Ramos plays the blue-collar damsel-in-distress, a reworking of Sarah Connor under a different name before she went militant. Known simply as Grace, newcomer Mackenzie Davis is cast as a cybernetically-supplemented super-soldier from the future with astonishing stamina. You know you're watching serious-minded sci-fi when a babe in a T-shirt doesn't steal the show. Mind you, Grace is no Terminator. She must maintain her cool or suffer the consequences of overheating. Watching her whirl a chain like a gladiator in an arena with an augmented Terminator is a treat! She replaces Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) in ""The Terminator"" (1986). Grace is no slouch when she shields Dani from the new version of the Terminator. Ultimately, they share a special bond. Naturally, Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his iconic role as a Terminator, but he doesn't play the same T-800 from the earlier epics. He is one of many lookalikes. This Arnold is kinder, warmer, and remorseful, protocols Terminators aren't programed to perform. According to Sarah Connor, the only good Terminator is a dead Terminator. Basically, the entire opus imitates its iconic 1984 predecessor, and director Tim Miller and his writers have used its $185-million budget to stage some outlandish brawls between Man and Machine.""Deadpool"" director Tim Miller and scenarists David S. Goyer of ""Man of Steel,"" Justin Rhodes of ""Grassroots,"" and Billy Ray of ""The Hunger Games"" have enhanced characters and rewritten the franchise's chronology. Basically, they have scrapped ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" (2003), ""Terminator: Salvation"" (2009), and ""Terminator: Genisys"" (2015). Earlier, ""Terminator Genisys"" disavowed the action of the third and fourth Terminator films, too. Consequently, ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" resumes the narrative thread where ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" concluded. Some of the revelations of this retcon may not sit well with traditional Terminator fans. Briefly, Google defines retcon as ""in a film, a piece of new information that imposes a different interpretation on previously described events, typically used to facilitate a dramatic plot shift or account for an inconsistency."" No, this isn't the first example of a retconned film franchise. When ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (2014) came out, movie producer Lauren Schuler Donner warned fans to ""forget X3 and the first Wolverine"" movie. Marvel has retconned the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and so has DC tampered with its Superman series, too.""Terminator: Dark Fate"" unfolds in 2020, but its 1998 prologue depicts a devastating revelation which would ruin a complete surprise for moviegoers were it divulged. Essentially, one of the franchise characters bites the bullet. Twenty-two years later, an ultra-enhanced Terminator, model Rev-9 (Gabriel Luna of ""Transpecos""), descends from brooding skies over Mexico City in a crystal-clear bubble and clones the appropriate apparel to appear inconspicuous in crowds. Nearby, another transparent bubble materializes, and a naked woman, Grace (Mackenzie Davis of ""Blade Runner 2049""), emerges and appropriates apparel from unwilling citizens, too. Not only does she hail from the future, but she also has must locate Dani Ramos before the lethal Rev-9 can annihilate her. Like earlier Terminator villains, the Rev-9 takes no prisoners, and it is equipped to perform feats far beyond previous Terminators. For example, the Rev-9 can detach itself from its skeletal being. This creepy-looking counterpart--a scowling metal skeleton-amounts to his alter ego. In one scene, the Rev-9's corporeal being smashes the windshield to clamber atop the hood of a careening truck, while its skeletal counterpart remains poised behind the wheel of the truck! Definitely, this Terminator poses a far greater challenge. When Grace and Dani tangle with this dual Terminator on a bridge, Sarah Connor makes a memorable entrance and saves their bacon. They steal her means of transport, but the three reunite afterward and cooperate as they cross the border into Texas. Sarah learns to her chagrin she stopped Judgment Day, but she hasn't altogether thwarted the machines. They are back, and they don't aim to capitulate. Eventually, after several bouts of backstory, which cannot be summarized for fear of revealing too much, they hook up with the soul surviving T-800 Terminator, Karl (Arnold Schwarzenegger of ""Conan the Barbarian""), who has been masquerading as an interior decorator who specializes in drapery!After James Cameron finished ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" (1991), the franchise never regained its traction with audiences. Similarly, Schwarzenegger's career went into eclipse once he became California's governor, and his efforts to rekindle his popularity have floundered. He skipped ""Terminator: Salvation,"" because he was governor. Nevertheless, he returned for Terminator: Genisys"" (2015). Unfortunately, ""Genisys"" didn't generate enough coin at the box office, too. The franchise hovered in limbo until Cameron came back onboard as executive producer. Ironically, despite qualifying as an above-average, action-packed, larger-than-life entry in the franchise, ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" is living up to the prophecy of its bleak subtitle in a way neither Cameron nor the studios may have envisaged. Although it captured the top spot at the box office during its debut, it simultaneously flopped, potentially losing as much as a $130 million for its two studios-Paramount Pictures and Twentieth Century Fox. Now, the question which arises for the ""Terminator"" franchise is: did anybody really want a new ""Terminator?"" Clearly, moviegoers weren't excited about Linda Hamilton's third appearance as Sarah Connor. Nevertheless, despite its sense of déjà vu, ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" qualifies as an exciting science fiction extravaganza worth watching.",Terminator - Dark Fate
15,Calicodreamin,Amazing action!,8,10 November 2019,"The terminator movies always deliver in action, and this is no exception. Amazing fight choreography, the scenes are full of octane, I was out of my seat multiple times. The acting is great from the cast, they all play their roles so well. Linda Hamilton is a boss. I was really pleasantly surprised by the chemistry between the main characters, it really helped to develop the story. The plot definitely cleaned the slate from the previous movies, but I thought they did a good job explaining the circumstance of the new apocalypse.",Terminator - Dark Fate
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Learning from mistakes... some of the time,7,2 November 2019,"A few years from now, two individuals arrive from the future of decades from now. Rev-9(Luna, excellent as easily the best at imitating human behaviour and blending in so far) is a pre-programmed, single-minded entity, with the skeleton like that of the original 1984 one, a surface similar to the 1991 one, presented with sleek visuals that couldn't have been accomplished until recently. In other words: a perfect metaphor for the entire film itself. He's after a target. The other to be sent is there to protect them: Grace(Davis, blending toughness with vulnerability like no one in this series has since Michael Biehn), an enhanced human soldier. This time, it's not one of the Connors that's the focus. Instead it's Dani(Reyes, refusing to to be inactive). Sarah(Hamilton, having grown more badass over the years, just like her character) has taken to hunt Terminators, and, thus, comes across the aforementioned. Out of empathy, something key to the best entries in this franchise, and James Cameron films in general, she decides to help them out: ""Because I was her. And it sucks to be her"".This being divisive is neither a mystery nor a secret. Some of the reasons are spoilers, something I seek to avoid in these reviews, so while I won't say what they are, I want those who wanna know to be aware: There's a huge thing in the first few minutes(a ton of people are going to demand their money back right after they see the scene. I can imagine it setting a record in that regard. Maybe that part should have been in the trailers. I guess they were worried about falling in the trap of revealing too much, as the ones for Salvation did, and the ones for Genisys were unfairly accused of), and the nature of Arnie's role in this. If you think these might bother you(which I realise is difficult to say without knowing the details), there are articles online that will explain these without giving away the rest of this movie. The references to the first two are plentiful, and some will definitely find them to be excessive and/or poorly handled. Personally, I didn't. There is a ton of action throughout. Like everything about this, it emulates a lot of what we see in T1 and T2. This uses the core setup as well, while hinting that the sequel will be very different, just like the third(which led to the universally hated fourth one), and the fifth(which was so unpopular that it didn't get a follow-up). Funny. R-rated with as much bloody violence as something centered on killer robots should be. Intense and never boring.I recommend this to those still interested once they've decided how they feel about the two major issues. 7/10",Terminator - Dark Fate
17,neil-476,"Well, I liked it. A lot.",8,28 October 2019,"Sarah and John Connor managed to avert Judgement Day - it never happened. But that doesn't mean that the military stopped research into self-aware military AI. Goodbye Skynet, hello Legion, and welcome to a new generation of Terminator/equivalent and protector, this time to safeguard Mexican Dani. And also welcome back Sarah who, for her own reasons, wants to have a hand into protecting Dani and terminating Terminators.Forget Terminators 3, Salvation and Genisys - this one is a direct sequel to Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Looking through IMDB reviews, it seems to have upset a lot of people who seem to take exception to people who say ""Best Terminator since T2."" Well, since T2 was an astonishingly good film, that doesn't seem to me to be the faint praise which others seek to damn T:DF with. I liked it a great deal.It had its own story, albeit familiar, it had fun callbacks to T1 and T2, it had something genuinely shocking and unexpected which I have no intention of spoilering, and it played fair with the time travel/changed future aspects of the story/ies: where I thought ""Hang on, you can't have that because this happened,"" the logic actually worked.Where it fell down was the two more juvenile leads. Natalie Reyes as Dani was a little lightweight and Gabriel Luna as the Rev-9 Terminator has neither Schwarzenegger's physical presence nor Robert Patrick's emotionless menace. Mind you, Mackenzie Davis as protector Grace is terrific, and Linda Hamilton, reprising Sarah Connor after 28 years, is epic.",Terminator - Dark Fate

The last two films had the likes of Christian Bale, Sam Worthington, Emilia Clarke and Jason Clarke, quite a step down in that regard.

Salvation was terrible, apart from Bales Youtube breakdown, and Genysis was terrible apart from the 1984 sequence, which frankly, was a fine piece of cinema.Cameron is Back, as is Hamilton, so instantly, the nostalgia bells start ringing.And the outcome? It's a pretty good sequel to T2, and the rationale to carry the story on is wonderful, thanks to some wonderful writing, and some of the best deageing CGI I've seen in a long while.Throw in a few in your face references, and some more subtle (Dwight Yoakam comes to mind) and you have a perfectly fine sequel that pays respect to the original duo, and it's so good to see Hamilton in her most memorable role, and she owns this film, from the moment she steps out of her truck, to the wonderful finale.But even though Cameron is back, you can't help but think of T2 whenever there is an action sequence, or a bonding moment. It relies heavily on fans of the franchise to remember the second film.And then there is the inclusion of Schwarzenegger. And to be frank, he is great as the augmented model 101, who literally has nothing to do, apart from raising a family, and give Sarah purpose. It's truly wonderful to see the pair back on screen, and once he appears, it's a blast until the final credits.Anyone who is expecting something revelatory, this isn't it, it's just a fun nostalgia ride that will please fans of the original two.",Terminator - Dark Fate
20,phd_travel,Non stop thrilling action with a message,9,29 October 2019,"There's no action like Terminator action. Face it, there are no more exciting sustained action sequences than Terminator action sequences. When you watch the unstoppable morphing terminator coming after the heroes of this show it brings home how long we have been missing this quality of action in movies.A pretty great cast.
Linda Hamilton is back as strong as ever. A little wrinkled in the face but very fiesty and fit looking. Arnie has some terrific one liners. His body isn't that fit anymore but for his age he's great. Mackenzie Davis reminds of Robin Wright but sweeter while being tomboyish enough to be a convincing action hero and a modern woman too. A breakout role for her. Natalia Reyes a Colombian actress plays Dani the heroine. She's good but a bit short physically. Gabriel Luna acts as the bad terminator and he's quite effective.A very strong message:
The story incorporates a current topic - border patrol and Mexico. The message of this movie is that a Mexican woman who enters the country illegally is going to save the future of mankind. Whether you agree with the message or not it is as clear as day. Plus the heroine reminds of A.O.C.Even if the time travel story doesn't make total sense, you can still follow what is going on. What time travel can ever make sense?I had a great time and if you are a Terminator fan you will too.",Terminator - Dark Fate
21,trashgang,action all over,8,5 November 2019,"Linda en Arnold of the firts Terminator back in a new Terminator. Sounds great. Firts of all, don't worry if you haven't seen the original one (1984) because Linda does tell it all throughout this flick.I can really be short about this flick. Effects are really okay espescially in the fight scenes between the robots. Story isn't that original, you could say that it is a remake of the original one. No probs with that because Terminators do terminate so what else could you tell.Opening is really stunning, action going on and on and never stops. The movie drops a bit in speed and story with the reveal of the original cyborg (Arnold) which is a bit ridiculous being married and being humanized. Once that part is over the movie picks up in speed and action.Overall not that bad after all if you dig the Terminator franchise. For newcomers maybe it is all a bit weird. The new effects used for the new Terminator are also stunning, maybe it all reminds you of Terminator 2, the way it transforms, walk, look but hey, it's a Terminator.Inside jokes are also on board, remember, I'll be back, you will get the joke twice. I enjoyed it and people in the theater also, but not one woman in the room, maybe that says enough of this sort of flicks.

What were the negative reviewers expecting from this movie? Why do they even watch it if they are so done with it since Terminator 2: Judgment Day from1991? I agree that they will never reach the same level as the second movie, or even the first Terminator, but this fifth movie is certainly not the worst. Terminator movies are always a guarantee for some good action scenes, quality CGI's, and a story that is fast and entertaining. So is it also with Terminator: Dark Fate. Some actions scenes are over the top (especially the ones were 'normal' humans are involved as no one would ever survive any of those scenes, or at least be seriously injured) but if you can get passed that you're in for two hours of wild entertainment. Maybe some things don't add up in the story (how can Arnold Schwarzenegger grow a beer belly for instance?) but I don't pay too much attention to that, I just relax and enjoy the ride. As a Terminator fan I will stop watching it when it's badly done and in this case it wasn't so bring on the next one if there ever will be one.",Terminator - Dark Fate
23,siderite,A worthy sequel of T2,8,15 January 2020,"All the people that hate this movie must not remember the first and second ones. It's basically the same, with more effects and women and Latino people. It could have probably benefited from less ""be back"" jokes, but it has now become a staple meme and it is uncouth to not at least use it once or twice.As for the complaints that it makes no sense, it actually does (Well, except for how physics work, but that's not a valid point in the Terminator franchise). Think about it: if the present can be altered by a future that you can make not happen, then any possible future is capable of altering the present, regardless of its probability to happen. If time travel would work in this way, then the Terminator films actually become plausible. With this plot, Cameron opens up the ideas for absolutely any type of Terminator film, with any of the possible outcomes. With one swift stroke, he liberates the franchise to do whatever people see fit. The title of the films is not Connor, it's Terminator; it's about the terminating machines and the protectors that end up terminating them. I understand that this sucks for people who wanted a linear hero story or who wanted the story to ""go somewhere"", but going somewhere implies a direction and a start position. Admit it: Terminator films are now points on a multidimensional grid and need just enough similarity to each other to fall under the Terminator brand.Bottom line: it's exactly what I would have expected from a ""classic"" Terminator movie. T3 was too low budget when no one had any interest in the story, Genisys tried to be tricky and mystery boxy and it failed, even though Dark Fate actually explains it away, too. Dark Fate is simply about the terror of running away from an implacable machine, the classic and celebrated Terminator plot.",Terminator - Dark Fate
24,thesar-2,They're Back!,8,3 November 2019,"I expected a good return to greatness and what I received was: A Movie.So odd. ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" was an actual movie. It didn't feel like a sequel. It didn't feel like a Terminator movie. It just felt like a real movie. Unfortunately, it felt like it needs to be seen a second, maybe third time before I get it all in.Despite the ""rules"" Hollywood loves to rewrite in franchises that have gone astray, I never mind it when they do this. They're asking us to forget ""Part 3: Booby Fetish,"" ""Part 4: Spoiler Trailer"" and ""Part 5: Dear John!"" And I'm okay with that. I really didn't like #3, hated #4 and despite popular opinion, I liked #5. It wasn't a groundbreaking entry, nor was it a franchise reboot as Dark Fate would be 4 years later.So, yeah. Forget #s 3-5. In my mind, #1-2 are a complete story anyways. It, honestly, should've ended with #2. But IF...IF...a part 3 had to happen, I would back this movie in 2019.Just like always, a terminator is sent back to kill the future resistance and another is sent back to protect the future. But, now we have them, the target, an old ""friend"" and Sarah Connor.I truly liked this movie. I was most excited about Sarah Connor returning and she never, ever let me down. Now, the movie's not perfect and I cannot wait to see it a 2nd-3rd time to really grasp everything. But, until then, I can highly recommend this movie.***Final thoughts: Yes, this is a MOVIE. I cannot empathize that enough. It truly felt like an experience in the theatre and not just another Terminator chapter. I really appreciated that.",Terminator - Dark Fate

She was an interesting character on top of being a straight beast. Dani was okay, but i wish the movie focused on them more. they could have been the entire story.it was exciting and fast paced early on, but then there were long lulls in the middle. and the best action scenes were in the first act, which is disappointing. the story was fine at best. and there were some predictable parts.i want to watch it again. i think it's higher quality than genisys, but just as mixed overall (1 viewing 11/4/19)",Terminator - Dark Fate
26,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Distinctly average, but still one of the better additions to the genre",7,19 April 2020,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningNatalia (Dani Ramos) is a young woman, who finds herself targeted for death by the REV-9 (Gabriel Luna), an advanced model sent from the future to eliminate her existence. Sent to save her is Grace (Mackenzie Davis), a human with cyborg features who knows how important her existence is. However, they find an addition to their group in the shape of Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the original female defender of the future of humanity, and eventually track down the T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger), now living a quiet existence as 'Carl', with whom Connor has a blood debt to settle.In a time when ancient franchises are all that seemingly ensures a steady box office return, we find James Cameron's original masterpiece getting another addition to its off-spring, in one saga that has surely been milked for all it is worth. In an age where extreme pride is taken in equality and diversity being reflected on screen, it's interesting to look back and note the original Terminator films being one of the earliest depictions of female empowerment, with a female as the central protagonist in an action role, yet this film notably received some online backlash from those who felt the feminist agenda was being too openly played out, with an all female cast of kick ass warriors, a la the 2016 Ghostbusters revamp.It's all as visually impressive as ever, with an eye dazzling opening with Terminators and machines reigning fire on a beach, and overhead ships landing with re enforcements, as well as some generally well staged action sequences, including some impressive car chase/fight scenes. There's not much more to it beneath the surface than that, with a lot of clunky dialogue, Deadpool director Tim Miller awkwardly inserting some moments of humour into a naturally dark, forboding script and a plot that feels very piecemeal, and completely overrides what was established in the original films, leading to it making very little sense.Performances wise, a now more haggard looking Hamilton fits the mother hen role of the tough girls ensemble very well, whilst Schwarzenegger milks his greatest cash cow by returning to his best known role, a pleasing nod to the fans, despite looking noticeably paunchier, and less enthused in the role. It's ultimately all quite unremarkable, and far from the classical status of the first two films, but if the fans keep the demand up, new films will keep getting made, and this one is distracting and entertaining enough to pass muster. ***",Terminator - Dark Fate
27,Pjtaylor-96-138044,She'll be back.,6,28 October 2019,"Wiping three films from its canon like some sort of unstoppable, time-travelling killer, 'Terminator: Dark Fate (2019)' picks up directly where 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)' apparently left off. Its major selling point is the return of Linda Hamilton as Sarah Conner, who reclaims the role with style. You don't realise how much you've missed her until she steps on screen. The rest, I suppose, is same old, same old. The narrative is basically a remake, a combination of the franchise's first two entries with several concepts from the now non-canonical sequels sprinkled in. It isn't a patch on 'The Terminator (1984)' or its 'T2 Trainspotting (2017)'-inspiring sequel, but it's better than the bland 'Terminator Salvation (2009)' and strained 'Terminator Genisys (2015)'. I probably like it about as much as 'Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines (2003)', the series' unfairly maligned other third movie, but for different reasons. It isn't as fun as that admittedly goofy flick, but it feels more tonally consistent. It works on an emotional level far more than it does on an intellectual one. The core cast all get character arcs and plenty of relatively affecting moments. Reyes' slow transition is gradual enough to seem realistic and well-rounded enough to be satisfying. The piece takes a huge risk in its opening minutes, too, and plays with some interesting ideas later on. The first problem comes, after an oddly rushed first act, when the affair gets tangled up in its own, time-travelling logic. The so-called 'plot holes' don't really matter, ultimately, but they are a little annoying for fans of the franchise. It just jumps through so many hoops to justify Arnold's involvement, as well as its very existence, that tripping up is almost inevitable. This causes some clunky exposition and a predictable plot. The solutions to a lot of its story problems aren't all that difficult to imagine - though, the clearly 'too many cooks' amount of credited writers might explain why they aren't included. The pacing sees the thing speed through the start - because, apparently, the beats which usually make up this segment have been seen too many times before - and slog through the middle. It simultaneously feels like a long season of television and a blink-and-you'll-miss-it short. In the end, nothing much seems to have happened, even though a heck of a lot did. The affair isn't all that memorable, either. When you do retroactively recall it, it seems worse than during the initial watch. For the most part, the movie is absolutely fine. It certainly has its moments. A lot of the action is fun enough and the picture's emotional weight is maintained even throughout its dullest of inclusions. The finale is engaging and fairly tense, if a little fast, and a front-end fight-sequence kicks things off with a bang. However, a lot of the action is framed oddly closely, never conveying an accurate sense of scale. It also slips into slow-motion too many times for the technique to be effective and relies on CG much more than you'd like. A plane-based romp really hammers the latter home, throwing all believability - and, thus, tension - out of the window. It's probably the worst part of the picture, as silly as anything it attempts to erase. The whole thing is about as silly as its most immediate predecessor, to be honest. It just presents its absurdity with a generally straight-face and, for the most part, gets away with it. Still, it's fairly entertaining. It positions itself on the right side of America's increasingly relevant migrant crisis, as well. Also, for those complaining about it being 'PC gone mad', its feminine-power angle is simply an extension of what's been at the core of the series since day one, since its very inception, maybe. So, not only is the complaint utterly idiotic, it's also entirely irrelevant. The overall experience is decent enough but it's certainly not the return to form you'd hope it to be. It's not bad, but it's not great. It's probably the best 'Terminator' since 1991 - though, I know that's not really saying much. It actually only just gives 'Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines (2003)' a run for its money. So, make of that what you will. 6/10",Terminator - Dark Fate
28,bowmanblue,"Same old story, but is that so bad?",7,23 October 2019,"I think it's fair to say that most people (in the sci-fi/action/horror community) loved the original 'Terminator' in 1984. However, no one was prepared to witness a sequel in 1991 that was actually EVEN BETTER than the original in 'T2 Judgement Day.' With a pedigree like that, the studio must have thought they had a franchise designed to print money. And it did. Sort of. Yet, with all its sequels, it never quite made the dizzy heights of the first two installments.With 'Terminator: Dark Fate' we now join the story directly after 'T2' (meaning 'Rise of the Machines, Salvation and Genysis' are all now 'redundant' - or possibly now confined to different timelines. Whatever. Anyway, the ass-kicking heroine of T2 is back, Sarah Connor. Yes, she's a lot older now, but then so is Arnold Schwarzenegger and they're both aging as well as they can. However, a few wrinkles doesn't affect their performances and the true reason any Terminator fan wants to see this film is simply to see the pair back on screen together one last time.And it's worth the wait. Arnie doesn't come into the film until about half way through. I would say that this is a negative, but at least the first half had Linda Hamilton to hold its credibility up. Then, when the two of them get together, we're truly back in business.Those who watched Terminator 1/2 will know that the pair (and Sarah's son John Connor) saved the future of mankind from a face of cyborg killers from the future. And everyone lives happily ever after. Only they didn't. For two reasons. Firstly (and I hope this isn't too much of a spoiler) our beloved 12 year old John Connor (through the magic of de-aging technology) is mercilessly gunned down and murdered. No matter, as the future has already been changed. Only it hasn't. Or at least not that much.Later, a new artificial intelligent threat known as 'Legion' starts picking up where Skynet left off and sends more Terminators back through time in order to pick off prominent humans. Luckily for our aware future leaders, the future resistance also sends back a protector for the unlucky target. So, 'Dark Fate' really is just a rehash of practically every Terminator film that's gone before it (minus 'Salvation'). In fact, you could probably liken every scene in any previous Terminator film to any one in 'Dark Fate.' I know that some people would call this 'homage' while others would say it's purely ripping off a superior film. Then, of course, the conspiracy theorists will say that the numerous homages to films past is purely to instill a sense of nostalgia in us so that we don't think of 'Dark Fate' too harshly.I enjoyed it. Or rather I enjoyed Linda Hamilton and Arnie back together. Mackenzie Davis is the augmented human sent to protect the young girl destined to save the world and, from what I'd seen of her in the promotional material, I thought I wouldn't like her. However, I was proved wrong. She wasn't half as much of a 'Mary Sue' as I thought she'd be. Also, the new bad Terminator (or 'Rev 9) I think they called him) was okay. He did look a bit like a man who worked in an Apple store for most of the film, but he was just about threatening enough. I'd rank him behind Arnie, Robert Patrick, the female one from 'Rise of the Machines' and the other T-1000 from Genysis.I was enjoying most of it, but the only real 'downside' it had was Natalia Reyes. She just didn't do it for me as the future leader of mankind (or should it be 'womankind?'). She's supposed to be the new John Connor, i.e. the person who will lead the human race to ultimately fight the machines of the future, yet the actress looked like she belonged in some sort of teen drama. When she had to hold a gun it practically drawfed her and the lines she was given to say didn't help as they came across as way too corny and forced.Plus the special effects didn't see that special in places. When the bad Terminator has to move quickly he jumps are way too fluid to bee believable. Plus there are some major action set pieces like where a big fight takes place in a giant milatery plane that's crashing down. Personally, I couldn't tell what was going on in that scene, nor the one that followed straight after where the battle takes place underwater.Overall, if you're a long term fan of the franchise they you'll get your money's worth simply from having Arnie and Linda back on screen together. However, it's only really the old characters you'll really care about. I'd have preferred they kept John Connor alive and he went on the adventure with them. Really, 'Dark Fate' is just a reboot of T2. Yeah, there's plenty of 'fan service' for us to enjoy, but ultimately the plot of a 'Terminator' movie hasn't really progressed since 1984 (minus the blip of the under performing 'Salvation.'A solid 7/10 when the 'old guard' are on screen. It does dip a bit when Grace and Dani yawn their way through their scenes.",Terminator - Dark Fate
29,ThomasDrufke,"An Absolute Blast, But I Understand the Complaints",8,4 November 2019,"There are certain movies that you see where you can admittedly see both sides of the fence in terms of reception. Terminator: Dark Fate is one of those times. With a budget unnecessarily very high, a story that some may say does disservice to the franchise, and a marketing push that felt forced and tiresome to say the least, there wasn't much going for the film prior to the release. With that said, the CGI is about 80% really good, the action is superb, and the performances from its new and old leads nothing short of excellent, I couldn't help myself but root for this film to succeed. Sure, it's not doing anything overwhelmingly new, but unlike some of its franchise predecessors, the film is essentially non-stop from beginning to end and it feels like it earns the Terminator title, even if I'm leaning towards this *hopefully* being the final entry. But make no mistake, this is NOT a bad film by any stretch of the imagination.8.0/10",Terminator - Dark Fate
30,Cineanalyst,Gendered Fate: The Terminator's Progressive Timeline,5,10 February 2020,"With this box-office bomb, prognostications of the demise of ""The Terminator"" franchise have returned, but this series has been producing duds for a while. Even the first two films aren't especially sophisticated action-film classics, but rather entertainingly stylized productions. ""Dark Fate"" largely tries to replicate the formula of ""Judgement Day,"" including the road-trip plot and highway explosions culminating in a last stand inside a factory. Linda Hamilton returns, along with, as usual, Arnold Schwarzenegger and, briefly, a CGI-constructed Edward Furlong. Seen as an imitation of the first two Terminator films, ""Dark Fate"" fails, but I find it more intriguing how this 35-years-old franchise has altered its timeline culturally and politically.Central to these movies has always been humanity's fear of the increasing supremacy of machines. Added to this was the spectre of artificial intelligence. ""Genisys"" (2015) shifted this to modern concerns over Silicon Valley by making Skynet a public operating system. ""Dark Fate"" returns and redoubles the emphasis on AI and machines replacing the human workforce, although there remains a paranoia over being tracked through cell phones and the bad terminator, indeed, employs the Internet, drones and other instruments of surveillance to chase after the heroes. Nevertheless, the issue of employment is brought to the forefront early on with the brother being replaced by a machine in his factory job. Moreover, the terminator is sent back in time to take away the savior's job of one day leading humanity in the war against machines. More interesting in this regard methinks is the addition of a focus here on the border between Mexico and the United States and what that symbolizes in contemporary American politics of the displaced prejudices regarding immigration--and, especially, the illegal sort--believed to be a threat to employment and whatever other matters of supposed social cohesion. That the heroes here travel with these aliens on a train so as to cross the border and are arrested by authorities in one sequence indicates that these migrants are not the real threat.This is the inverse of another 2019 installment of a series began in the early 1980s and starring a septuagenarian muscle man, Sylvester Stallone's ""Rambo: Last Blood."" While ""The Terminator and ""First Blood"" arguably began on opposite ends of the generic left-right political spectrum; ironically, they seem to have exchanged positions since. Rambo began as a narrative lamenting the Vietnam War and the mistreatment of veterans and vagrants, whereas ""The Terminator"" (1984) could be said to have started as not only a Christ allegory, which is admitted in ""Dark Fate,"" with Sarah Connor as the mother Mary, but also as an elaborate sci-fi anti-abortion parable. A machine is, first, sent back in time not to kill John Connor, but to abort his ever having existed via his mother. In real life, this conservative narrative launched Schwarzenegger on a path to eventually becoming a Republican governor of California. ""Genisys"" already altered this, too, however, towards a pro-choice ideology whereby Sarah essentially aborts her own future son (which, apparently, is a more accurate reflection of Schwarzenegger's stance on the issue anyways). ""Dark Fate"" partly does this, too, with one of the women's figurative wombs being climactically removed, but the movie also moves the timeline further towards increasingly progressive politics by overturning the white male savior thesis entirely. A Hispanic woman occupies the role of the prophesied messiah now, although even the issue of fate and choice continues to be in flux in the series.Moreover, three women team up in ""Dark Fate"" to combat an abusive, male-gendered machine. As well, Schwarzenegger's terminator only becomes good after aiding a woman and her child in escaping a relationship with an abusive man--something he essentially does twice over in teaming up with the three female protagonists. (A doubles theme appropriate to a sequel, by the way, which is further reinforced by the doubled forms the bad terminator takes.) These male-gendered machines, however, are essentially neutered--castrated. Meanwhile, human male characters tend to be shot and killed. The politics of ""Dark Fate"" are all about female empowerment. In a sense, this is in line with the rest of the series since the start in following Sarah's journey in fighting the masculine machines.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I count that as a plus because the films in question are a desecration of Cameron's legacy. Also, I was glad to see Linda Hamilton and Schwarzenegger again in this franchise. But to be fair, this is no sequel, but a rather pathetic recycling of the first two films bordering on a remake.

37,tabuno,A Good Tribute To The Original Terminator,8,1 November 2019,"Linda Hamilton, age 63, is to be commended for her starring performance. She really offered up a solid and smooth maturing character display on screen. The typical who's good and bad start like earlier Terminator versions was effective, but the early going seemed to be almost too derivative except for the stark and hard-edged physical violence that the movie began with which seemed to be superior stunt action and cinematography work than the original Terminator movies. With a bit of a confusing plot outline that really should be explained in order to avoid unnecessary early mental gyrations which shouldn't be considered spoilers but plot corrections: This Terminator movie appears to start off where the original 1984 movie left off or was it T2-Judgment Day (1991) as if the rest of the series didn't happen. Some of the dialogue especially during the first half, seemed just a bit to common, almost like a kindly, older gentlemen had written the script. Some of the dialogue could have been sharper and edgier. There is also a scene where instead of blowing up a house, it's left intact so anybody could go through it for clues. Nevertheless, the action and the persistent bad Terminator is almost continuous with one action scene after another action scene and somehow most of it somehow seemed dramatically and theatrically believable. The tension between Sarah Connors (Hamilton) and later in the movie an important older character is meaningful and nicely accomplished. Overall, this Terminator version is solid, entertaining, along with a touching emotional whisper of some of the finer Terminator predecessor movies. Yet, there are just some few elements that could have been improved that would have provided a nicely shining polished finish to the movie. Examples, large vehicle speeds, water depths, and age differentials (between past and future characters).",Terminator - Dark Fate
38,The-Sarkologist,"Yep, seen it all before",5,10 November 2019,"Well, it seems as if this film hasn't gone the way some people have expected it to have gone, if the box office takings are anything to go by. Then again, I have a strong suspicion that this is probably going to be the last of the Terminator films that we will see, which is probably a pretty good thing since I feel that they have basically reached the end of the line. Anyway, I still quite liked Genysis, but it seems as if quite a lot of other people didn't, so it looks like they have decided to reboot the franchise from the end of Terminator II.We have Linda Hamilton returning, and of course a Terminator film wouldn't be a Terminator film without Arnie playing the titular character. However, this film pretty much turns out to be nothing different to many of the other Terminators that we have seen about the place, except that they decided to say that Skynet is now long gone, but instead a new baddie has risen from the ashes.I guess you can work out the plot from here though. We have a future war between humanity and the machines, and there is a single person that is able to unite humanity and fight back. Well, the machines manage to discover time travel, and send a terminator back to kill this person. Yeah, we have pretty much seen it all before - four times in fact (namely because Terminator: Salvation really doesn't fall into that same trope).It was interesting that Cameron said that he has some ideas of where the franchise will be going, but honestly, as I said previously, we have basically seen it all before, so there is pretty much going to be nothing new going down the road he is planning on going down, namely with the sequal having them decide to attempt to blow up Legion before it can even see the light of day, just as they blew up Skynet in the second film.The first movie was certainly different, and it definitely hit the right nerve, and the second movie, well, that pretty much blew everybody away. However, they have never seemed to have picked it up from there, and it looks like the Terminator franchise is basically doomed to Hollywood history. Then again, the reality is that there is only so much that you can do with this franchise, that in the end, they have pretty much explored every nook and cranny of this realm, and it is probably time to shelve it and attempt to move onto something new.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I thought it was going down a darker plot road with her character, but it didn't. Arnold gets the laughs when he finally turns up, but he is involved as part of the team in the final battle, so he is not just comic relief. But I wanted more. I wanted an iconic Arnold moment, but there was not one.Gabriel Luna was fine (if a little bland) as the Rev 9!! Sadly, Natalia Reyes is probably the weakest link for me, they hit you over the head with how sweet she is early on, then there is a fast forward scene that was awful. I was sat cringing.

41,briancham1994,Terminator: All-Stars,6,8 June 2020,"This film is essentially a ""best of"" compilation of all the previous Terminator films and TV series. We've got a future assassin and police shootout from The Terminator (1984), a future protector from Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), a hybrid liquid/solid terminator from Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines (2003), a grey future war and augmented human from Terminator: Salvation (2009), a changed timeline, old terminator blending into human society and freeway scene from Terminator: Genisys (2015) and a metal detector joke and terminator that already fulfilled its mission from Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (2008). It also brings back all the original actors for the first time since 1991 - Linda Hamilton, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Edward Furlong. Does this make it a good movie? Well, it makes it ""not bad"". Good points: These ""best of"" elements are all combined in a coherent way, the actors are used well, the action scenes are really well done and the Rev-9 antagonist is quite fast and efficient so you feel a sense of danger. Bad points: It's a rehash of previous Terminator films with nothing new, the overuse of time travel to add more terminators is exhausting, it negates the whole of Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and so much of the plot was unconvincing - more terminators pop up ""just because"", Carl turns good ""just because"", John is unnecessary ""just because"", Dani becomes the new leader ""just because"" and Legion becomes Skynet ""just because"". Those elements were necessary for the film's story to exist but from the audience's point of view it seems like skipping from point A to point B with only an unnatural and barebones explanation for why that makes sense. I gave it 7/10 as a film just by itself, but as part of the franchise, it would probably get much less due to plagiarism and disrespect for the classics.",Terminator - Dark Fate

43,cruise01,Dark Fate is an awesome sequel to T2 which turns the franchise into a brighter direction.,10,2 November 2019,"Terminator: Dark Fate (5 out of 5 stars).Terminator: Dark Fate is a come back awesome sequel following right after T2: Judgment Day movie. The change in direction with the franchise just like how 2018 Halloween movie was which follows right after the original and forgetting about the several sequels. Which are hit and misses. Along with Terminator which needed a fresh start without losing its touch. I enjoyed the franchise, I love Terminator 3. Salvation and Genisys. But none of them actually lived up to T2 which is still the best in the series. With Dark Fate being behind T2. Dark Fate follows right after T2 and resetting the franchise into a new direction. I loved every minute of it.The plot follows after the events of T2, Sarah (Linda Hamilton) and John (Edward Furlong) stopping judgment day. Without giving away spoilers to the story and events. 20 or so years later, Grace (Mackenzie Davis) is sent from the future to save Dani (Natalia Reyes) from a new form of terminator known as Rev-9 (Gabriel Luna). While escaping, Sarah intervenes to help save her. Which she learns that the future has changed. And the war is far from over. They come across a T-800 model terminator/ Carl (Arnold Schwarzenegger) who is trying to live a normal life and form a consciousness when he has no orders to follow. He finds a purpose again to aid with them against the Rev-9.The story is great. It does have some surprises and new concept changes about the fate of Skynet and a new A.I. known from Legion. Which they are developing faster, stronger hunting robots. Like Rev-9 who is quick, fast, and can duplicate himself to get his target. Grace is like a hybrid enhanced human who is quick and fast. The film wraps the first two Terminator films and opens up for a new trilogy with its direction.Dark Fate is intense, exciting, and awesome. It lives up to the second movie with the intense feeling with characters being chased by Rev-9. Just like how they were being chased by t-1000 in T2. The film has a lot of action sequences. The opening car chase sequence was awesome which put you on the edge of your seat. Then, there is the border immigration detention center brutal chase with them trying to escape from Rev-9. Or the military plane sequence, which has them, fighting in mid air.Tim Miller's direction is great and he did it well with trying to make this third film work in the franchise. The music score by Tom Holkenborg is great and helped build the intensity with the characters being hunted. The visual effects are good. The future sequence was good and crazy with the brief battle scene with the new Terminators.The actresses Linda Hamilton, Mackenzie Davis, and Natalia Reyes are all bada** and they carried the roles with having Arnold Schwarzenegger being in a smaller role this time. He is still great with the aging Terminator. The villain Gabriel Luna played Rev-9 really good with delivering the scary and thrilling feeling of being chased by him.Overall, Terminator: Dark Fate is an awesome science fiction action film. The action is spectacular and thrilling from beginning to end. The story changes the franchise into a new promising direction which I hope to see another movie from this sequel. Linda Hamilton return is awesome and she delivered a great role which the several sequels was missing from.",Terminator - Dark Fate
44,eddie_baggins,The grey cloud over Terminator continues with Dark Fate,4,31 October 2019,"Sometimes in life your best off taking hold of the positives and with that in mind, it's nice to report that the newest bout of machine v human carnage Terminator: Dark Fate is more tolerable that previous franchise entries Salvation and Genysis, which it's fair to say isn't that much of a high achievement.Promoted as a return to the gritty roots of the original James Cameron films, with the great grey haired master even jumping on board Dark Fate as a producer and overseer of the production as Deadpool director Tim Miller took the reins, Dark Fate does indeed gift long time franchise fans Linda Hamilton's reappearance as Sarah Connor, which is a lot of fun and an extended Arnie cameo as the Governator plays an important role as the famed T-800 (now known as Carl!) but there's something worryingly stale and pointless about Dark Fate that ensures viewers will be left cold by another series entry that feels mostly pointless and arbitrary.Hired no doubt for his action directing skillset, Miller does bring some neat set-pieces to Dark Fate's plotline, such as a fiercely staged car chase and a mid-air plane set piece but in amongst all of that as we follow Mackenzie Davis's human/cyborg hybrid Grace and Connor trying to protect Natalia Reyes's Dani from Grabriel Luna's seemingly indestructible Rev-9 terminator, Dark Fate is frequently an uninspired creation that sticks far too close to previous entries formulas to feel like the fresh and reviving addition it was striving to be.At the time of release both Terminator and its beloved sequel Judgment Day were relatively fresh ideas, born out of Cameron's unique ability to recognise a winner when he sees/imagines one and with ground-breaking special effects, classic acting turns and gold-standard action to boot, they set the bar high for all other Terminator products that would follow and its almost sad watching Dark Fate try to relieve the glory days of old as it introduces us to a bunch of far less interesting new characters all the while treading on a very well-worn path of an evil big bad sent from the future to kill an important figure from the past.Hamilton and Schwarzenegger both give their returning roles a red hot crack, and their character beats and certain throwback lines are sure to bring a smile to fans faces and while Davis seems to be cut from a much more interesting film as she tries to add spark to Dark Fate's otherwise tiresome plodding, Miller's film never threatens to get anywhere near the benchmark's of the series as we become more and more aware that the glory days of this franchise are long gone as it disappointingly attempts to tell the same stories again and again, in frequently bland ways.Final Say -Better than what we've been dished up over the last couple of entries, Terminator: Dark Fate may have some nice nods to the good old days and a couple of worthwhile set pieces but as an overall experience, Dark Fate is forgettable and incessantly bland new addition to a property that is finding it increasingly hard to remain relevant.2 interrupted BBQ's out of 5",Terminator - Dark Fate
45,filipemanuelneto,James Cameron returned ... to bury the Terminator?,4,30 March 2021,"I had some expectations for this film: with the return of names as reputable as Linda Hamilton (who play Sarah Connor again) and James Cameron (not to be the director, as I would have preferred, but as a producer), I hoped that this film could relaunch a franchise that seemed to be in decay. Unfortunately, that's not happened: it is a terrible film, and the box office results seem to agree with that assessment.To begin with, I did not like the fact that this film makes a clean slate of all the films released after 1991. I was left with the feeling that James Cameron did not respect the work of all those who endeavored to relaunch the franchise, like those children who just want to play with a toy so that no other boy can play with it. Therefore, I am better able to consider this film as ""non-canonical"" than all the others. I am sorry that the film industry is so subject to vanities and personal egos, but the world is just like that.Then, we have a bad script, which basically gives us a reconstruction of the whole story after ""Terminator 2"": Skynet was stopped (how? ""Terminator 2"" ends with the clear idea that it hasn't happened yet) but John Connor was murdered and Sarah is undone by the pain. Decades later, in Mexico, a new terminator appears to kill Daniella, a young girl who knows nothing of what awaits her and is unexpectedly saved by a stranger. As the film progresses, we discover that, in the future, there will be a new Skynet, called Legion, bla bla bla end of the world bla bla bla war against machines. Where have I seen this before? Was it in the first two films in the franchise?The cast is good and features, as usual, Arnold Schwarzenegger in his role as Terminator. However, this humanized and very ""good"" version of the character not only seemed totally false and unconvincing, but it was out of step with the rest of the narrative, such as a piece left over in a machine or a dissonant chord in a melody. The actor is not to blame! He is very good and is courageous in his effort to return to the character despite not being as young as he was. The problem is the conception of the character itself, and the material given to him. Linda Hamilton also seemed to be doing well, giving us a Sarah Connor marked by age, social ostracism, the loss of her son and a future that did not happen. I really liked Natalia Reyes, especially because she doesn't deny speaking in her native tongue, and she takes on the role as an action heroine, not a damsel in distress. On the negative, I saw nothing truly remarkable in Gabriel Luna's performance and Mackenzie Davis does not seem at ease with her character.Technically, the film turned out to be uninteresting: the first two films worked well thanks to the skillful way in which suspense and tension were built and modeled. This film is not capable, at any time, of doing something similar and, consequently, it has the emotion and interest of a grand and expensive video game, with indestructible characters and tons of action, visually grand, but tasteless. The quality of the CGI is good, but it does not surprise us or justify the film. Cinematography is good and elegant, dark in the right measure and editing was also very well done. The soundtrack is uninteresting and recycles the leitmotiv of the franchise.",Terminator - Dark Fate
46,Rectangular_businessman,Absolute garbage,1,6 December 2020,"Without doubt, the worst Terminator film to date.Way worse than Terminator Salvation, or Terminator Genisys.There is nothing wrong with wanting to include more strong female characters to your story, and it definately could have been done without killing one of the main characters of the franchise for cheap shock value. To add insult to injury, said character is unceremoniously killed off at very beginning to the movie, which feels like a slap to the face to all the fans of the previous films.A massive misstep for James Cameron and Tim Miller.",Terminator - Dark Fate
47,leonblackwood,Worth a one-watch! 6/10,6,2 March 2020,"Review:
I must admit, I was expecting this movie to be awful, but it actually turned out to be OK. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't any way near as good as Terminator 2, but it's much better than the rest of the films in this franchise. The sketchy script, and mediocre acting from the slightly annoying Dani Ramos (Natalie Reeves), did let the movie down, but it was good to see Arnie and Linda Hamilton back on the big screen together again, even though Arnie was playing a much tamer Terminator with a conscious. I was impressed with Grace (Mackenzie Davis), who carried the film right from the beginning, and the visual effects were great in parts, but it's a very average film that is only worth a one-watch. In this day and age, we are really spoilt for choice, and it takes something amazing to stand out from the rest of the movies in this genre, which is why there is nothing special about this film. The concept was, more or less, the same as Terminator 2 but it didn't have the originality, or shock factor, that made that the best film in this franchise. For such a big budget, and some epic action scenes, it didn't make much noise on its release, and now that I've seen the film, I can understand why. Although Linda Hamilton and Arnie haven't aged gracefully, the script lacked the magic that James Cameron brought in the original, but there is a sense of intensity that makes you stick with the plot. As the epic scenes towards the end are all set in the dark, and underwater, you don't get to see the attention to detail, and I personally couldn't work out what the hell was going on. The scene's in the plane were cleverly choreographed, and the switching from human to the robot was clean and smooth, but it's nothing that we haven't seen before. At the end of the day, it's a decent film with some epic action scenes, but I personally think that the franchise should have ended after the second film. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Tim Miller, who brought you Deadpool in 2016. He was also the creative supervisor for Scott Pilgrim vs. The World in 2010, which is one of my favourite movies, but with such a small portfolio, I would have given this project to someone who had more experience. Although I wasn't impressed with the script, it was written by James Cameron, along with 8 other writers, but I personally think that he produces his best work when he has full control of a project. There was supposed to be a Terminator: Genisys trilogy, but after it's disappointing box office return, they decided to bin the project. This film is supposed to be the sequel to Terminator 2, which is why it seems so similar. They do plan to make this film into a trilogy, with James Cameron working with the director, but no information has been released yet.Budget: $185million

Boring, redundant, rather cheaply made and tons of logic issues, and yes, all in all I would call it an insult to the whole Terminator series. If Dark Fate would be a movie without connection to the Terminator franchise I would rate it 4 or maybe 5 (production, acting okayish).
Why this movie was ever made (besides making money) will be a mystery forever. I like some of Arnie's late works like Maggie, Escape Plan or Aftermath, but even he can't save this one from crashing. My recommandation: ignore this one like Genisys.",Terminator - Dark Fate

50,digitalbeachbum,Time travel failure,1,21 July 2021,"I have a new policy for reviewing movies. No matter how much fun they are, if the premise/plot/script is seriously flawed then the movie doesn't work for me. It automatically receives a 1/10 rating.Time travel is a killer for all writers. If they don't understand the logic behind it then the movie fails because it isn't plausible. With that in mind, The Terminator could never plausibly happen therefore it should have only been a cartoon or at best an animated flick.Time travel with James Cameron is that The Terminator goes back in time to kill Sarah Connor, which it fails. The machines in the future would have known they failed, instantly.A thought experiment, using James Cameron's logic.If the machines calculated that killing Sarah Connor was needed so she wouldn't have a baby, why send another Terminator back to kill John Connor? They failed the first time, so why not send one back 30-40 years earlier, when she was a child? Why send one ten years later in time? Why stop there? Why not send one back to the 50 BC? Why not send twenty Terminators back to 100 BC? Technically they could have brought back with them the main processor, with the intelligent leader/program. They could have built everything from the ground up, destroy all humans and conquer humanity while humans have spears and swords.And to go further, why conquer humanity? The AI doesn't work that way, it wasn't programmed to have an EGO, so even if the AI became sentient why would a computer program have an EGO? Desires would have to be part of the programming. Desires would have to be originally programmed to be part of the program. If you claim ""I'm alive"" it means nothing in relation to your desires or feelings.Look, it's a fun movie. If you like it, then cool, enjoy the Sci-Fi of it. It's Arnold after all and doing the ""body count"" for the movie is always a fun aspect. Arguing over who could have lived and who must have died in the police station is definitely a funny discussion to have while watching the movie.With that being said, I give James Cameron 1/10 for this movie. Sorry Arnold. It's a fun movie, but the premise for the script is a complete failure.",Terminator - Dark Fate
51,SAMTHEBESTEST,TERMINATOR DARK FATE :- LACKS FIREPOWER !,6,31 October 2019,"Science fiction is a mainstream genre in Hollywood and it is one of the most popular too. Most of Biggest Hits belongs to the same genre. Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2 - Judgement Day (1991) directed by James Cameron were known as groundbreaking films that time and many people call it the same today, even after so many years when technology and film-making is updated. After these 2 films there were 3 more films which didn't do well and didn't recieve acclaim upto that mark. Here comes the 6th film in the franchise ""Terminator : Dark Fate"" which is made just to make the franchise alive again and the trick is to forget those 3 films which people don't even remember. This one is a direct sequel to first 2 films of Terminator franchise directed by Cameron yet falls short. Dark Fate tries to wake up the the dead franchise again but lacks the Firepower.Just like first 2 films, Dark Fate has similar plot with addition of couple of new characters. The machines send a Terminator, the Rev-9 (Gabriel Luna), back in time to kill a young woman, Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes), whose fate is connected to Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) and her son John's legacies, which made Dani a target. The Human Resistance sends an enhanced soldier, Grace (Mackenzie Davis), whose existence is also depending on Dani's survivals, back to protect her. Grace and Dani's only hope for survival against the Rev-9 depends on them joining forces with Sarah and a T-800 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger).
Coming to the action spectacle Dark Fate has few power-packed scenes, that beginning scene is one of them. VFX an Visual Effects are good enough but as we all know Terminator films were known for Groundbreaking VFX, Dark Fate falls short to that level. Background Score by Tom Holkenborg is chilling enough and the Cinematography by Ken Seng is spectacular. Screenplay is tight but there are no twists or chilling moments which we saw in Judgement Day. Director Tim Miller kept it simple to the plan, he made it for the Terminator fans without caring about extra additional elements and that's what makes Dark Fate an underwhelming project.Terminator Dark Fate gives you that 'Return of Iconic characters' feeling but the lacks that extra boost to keep the franchise on high. The same repeatative stuff could be liked only and only by hard core Terminator fans but for rest of the audience, it should have had some brilliant visual juggernaut. Dark Fate has explosion on its own level but the Firepower is less compared to standard of the Original Terminator films.RATING- 4/10*",Terminator - Dark Fate
52,matthewssilverhammer,That's more like it,7,6 November 2019,"Terminator had some dark years. Each of the last three entries struggled with slightness (Rise of the Machines), tonal misunderstandings (Salvation), and general public disinterest (Genisys). However, the return of James Cameron as producer and Hamilton as Sarah Connor gave hope, a hope that wasn't quite met but certainly didn't leave us empty-handed. Riding the line between 80's throwback and modern blockbuster with as much grace as Schwarzenegger saying ""California"", Dark Fate offers just enough brains and brawns to forgive its clumsy storytelling.
As with all these films, the timeline is bonkers, and describing its plot is much too big an undertaking for a 300-word review. Terminators kills, future-soldiers time-travel, normal people are given salvation narratives; you get the gist. Dark Fate certainly doesn't break the mold in the script department, often leaning on lazy simplicity, unexplained coincidences, and clunky exposition to get to the next fight scene.
What it nails is its bigger points. Tripling down on the female empowerment from T2, Hamilton is joined by Reyes and Davis, all of whom bring an empathy and strength to a world that ""doesn't want {them}...it just wants {their} womb."" This killer trio reminds us that we must rage against the machines, even (and especially) against the ones we've created.
And of course, there's ol' Arnie, who comes in and gives the movie a boost of humor and nostalgia when it needs it. His chemistry with Hamilton hasn't lost a step, as they faithfully serve the purpose of handing the series off to a new generation. Don't let the recent franchise failures fool you; Dark Fate is a thrilling reminder of what we loved about this series.",Terminator - Dark Fate

54,southdavid,Drapes Of Wrath,7,28 October 2019,"Given the rocky time the many and various Terminator sequels have had since ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" scepticism of franchise is on a high. Re-enter James Cameron, to produce this film as a direct sequel to the ""T2"" with Deadpool's Tim Miller in the director's chair.In Mexico City, an enhanced human, Grace (Mackenzie Davis) has a mission to defend Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) from the murderous advances of Rev-9 machine (Diego Luna) a robot sent back in time to try and win a war years before it even starts. With her mission about to fail, Grace is saved by Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) who has been receiving co-ordinates of where to continue her personal battle the machines from a mysterious source.""Dark Fate"" is good enough. I could end the review there, but I'll keep going. Comparisons to ""T2"" aren't helpful, as what could live up to a classic like that, but ""Dark Fate ""manages to avoid most of the pitfalls of the other sequels - it doesn't do anything inherently stupid, like having John Connor swim down to a Submarine or become a machine himself - but it also can't shake off the feeling that it's a rehash of the previous films. The beats of a ""Terminator"" story are all there; taking the clothes, ""Come With Me If You Want To Live"", "" I'll Be Back"", helicopter battles, convenient industrial location for finale, sacrifice. The Rev-9, though nicely played by Diego Luna, is pretty similar to the T1000 is what he can do and how he moves. The twists of the film, if you can even call them that, are all pretty obvious - so much so I am not sure you can even call them twists.There are a couple of CGI shots, particularly at the start of the film, that are very ropey but they are prove to be the exception, rather than the norm. The practical effects are always pretty good though, and there is lots of explosions and vehicle destruction that occurs. Performances are fine although nobody is really tasked with doing anything too dramatic other than looking injured.So... in conclusion, like all the Terminator sequels is a Copy and Paste of first one, however this one is a little better than some of the others.",Terminator - Dark Fate

The action special effects are ok-ish, although they havent gotten really better compared to earlier editions, despite all the CGI possibilities of nowadays, but the action is nevertheless still full ON.I dont see any big faults with it, although it is certainly not the best edition. At least director James Cameron tried to make a sequel that is new, with FEMALE power at the centre of the story. Did director James Cameron succeed in making a good (last) sequel?

We then go to ""Mexico City 22 years Later"", and in short order a female appears from the future, followed shortly later by a male from the future. The latter is the latest and greatest Terminator model... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: let me state upfront that I did not like ""Terminator -Genisys"" all that well, and hence I was skeptical about the viability of any further Terminator movies. Then the word came of a new Terminator movie that would be a direct sequel to Judgment Day, marking the return of James Cameron (as producer), and that Linda Hamilton AND Schwarzenegger would be on board as well. Now if they could only come up with a credible story line... And they did! I'm not going to tell you what that is of course, but by ignoring the previous 4 movies, the franchise has rebooted itself and injected a badly needed bolt of new energy.

The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended well at all, much to my surprise. The theater here in Cincinnati where I saw this at was at most one-third occupied/ That typically spells disaster for a big budget movie like this (reported production budget of Terminator Dark Fate is close to $200 million).

She shows up and saves Simple Savior Terminator and Dani Ramos!!! So we go thru a couple more battles, detention, crossing the border.

58,subxerogravity,Nothing better than watching Linda Hamilton fire that shot gun.,7,5 November 2019,"The great thing about these Terminator movies being about time travel is that every ending of every movie means you can do whatever you want with the next movie. It's funny how most squeals attempt to forget every other sequel except for the first, but that is how you make a great Terminator.It's good to see Linda Hamilton back in action. If you can believe that Stallone can come back as old man Rambo (Interesting how Stallone and Schwarzenegger makes sequels to their blockbuster franchises in the same year(Trying to see whose the best old action hero).Watching Hamilton come back as Sarah Conner is far more believable and entertaining. Much respect to old Rambo but old Sarah just gave off better vibes. Mechanize Davis was great in this flick as well. Of the two things that came back in time to alter the future (Well three, of you count Arnold's model) she was the best. I did not find their Model Red T whatever as impressive as other terminators. He felt like they were running out of ideas and his robotic personality is no Arnold, Robert Patrick or the woman in Rise of the Machines. I could not help that with Hamilton it to feel like I was watching a very direct sequel to T2 and with that in my mind this new Terminator did not scare me like Judgement Day did. Robert Patrick's T1000 made me feel like their was a chance they were not going to make it. I did not get this with the Red T. Plus his particular Terminator powers are not that cool.As for the original model. Schwarzenegger is a very supportive role in this film, doing as the much wanted comic relief as anything. When things got to dark or about to get darker he shows up to transition us with some slight humor. Don't threat gentlemen. Despite this movie having a mostly women cast there be a large amount of testosterone running rapid on this screen. No shortage of guns blazing, cars shading and some stand out action flicks that assure you Tim Miller of Deadpool maybe behind the wheel but James Cameron is ridding shotgun. Excellent!",Terminator - Dark Fate
59,jtindahouse,"The best entry since Judgement Day, but nowhere near the original magic",7,4 November 2019,"The 'Terminator' series has been such a let down ever since 'Judgement Day'. The first two entries in the series where James Cameron was behind the camera were masterful. The he left and things took a very sudden and violent drop off a cliff in terms of quality. 'Terminator: Dark Fate' is certainly the best entry in the series we have had since then. Because I make a point of knowing as little about a film as I can before going into it, I hadn't actually realised that they had disregarded the other three sequels for this one. I kept trying to put the pieces together and they weren't adding up. I know it isn't ideal but I also feel there needs to be a way to let audiences know this beforehand.There are some great action sequences in this film. The big one early on is the best in the film and actually blew me away a little. Linda Hamilton's return was such a great choice. She is so charismatic and she is the only 'Sarah Connor' I will ever recognise. Also Arnold's return was wonderful. He had some incredibly funny lines. In fact it's a weird thing to criticise a film for but he was almost too funny, to the point where it took away from the seriousness of the film.It does suffer from the same problem that all 'Terminator' films tend to, which is that it gets a bit boring watching them being shot over and over and over again and it having no consequence on them. Also it does feel like we are getting almost the exact same story as 'Judgement Day'. Certain lines in the film even allude to that, either intentionally or not. I did have a good time with this movie though. It's well paced, creates some good nostalgia and is a decent way to kill a couple of hours.",Terminator - Dark Fate
60,jamesrupert2014,A technically competent but otherwise pointless remake of the iconic original,4,20 February 2021,"When a sophisticated killing machine from the future is sent back in time to kill a young women in whose hands lie the fate of mankind, a soldier is sent back by the human resistance to protect her. Sound familiar? Thirty-five years ago, it was the clever premise for an iconic action film. In 2021, it is just a retread with little going for it other than technically spectacular CGI effects. The cast did nothing for me. As Dani, the MacGuffin everyone is trying to kill or protect, Natalia Reyes switches from terrified victim to kick-ass tough-grrl much too quickly (contrast with the well-paced evolution of Sarah Conner in the original) and, as the Rev-9 Terminator, Gabriel Luna adds nothing to Robert Patrick's portrayal of the living-liquid T1000 in the first sequel (Terminator 2 (1991)). As the cyberneticly enhanced future-soldier, Mackenzie Davis looks good and brings an interesting physicality to her otherwise nonsensical character (she suffers from the same illogic that even adolescent viewers spotted in 'The Six-Million Dollar Man' (1973): the wetware simply could not survive the thrashing the hardware takes). Presumably to cash in on boomer nostalgia, Ahnold and Linda Hamilton are back as the original T-800 (or at least as original as you can be in a time travel plot) and Sarah Conner respectively. Apparently Hamilton went through rigorous training so she could look the part of a tough-ass 60+ women (which she does) but unfortunately she is saddled with a juvenile script full of clichéd hard-ass posturing. Equally unfortunately, the glorious cyborg assassin of 1984 is now sensitive elderly pseudo-fellow with a foster family in the stupidest plot twist the film has to offer. The plot bangs along predictably as the spectacular implausabilites pile up before an overlong climatic showdown. The more I think about this film, the less I like it - there is little clever, entertaining or memorable - just a blur of high-quality CGI actions sequences, none of which seem particularly original. Terminators are famously hard to dispatch but this film may have finally put a merciful end to the ageing franchise.",Terminator - Dark Fate
61,DarkVulcan29,"Terminator: Genisys was flawed, but I consider it a better sequel then Terminator: Dark Fate.",5,7 November 2019,"The plot is almost a remake of T2, only with a few changes. At least Genisys made you think it was going in that direction, and then it takes a different turn. But producers just decided to forget any sequels that came before it, and make Dark Fate the real sequel to T2. Dark Fate breaks most of the rules that the first Terminator sets up, and that kind of annoyed me, don't get me wrong some rules are made to be broken, but I don't think this film handled it well.Linda Hamilton reprises her role has Sarah Conner, and half the time I don't know weather she was acting or just going through the motions. Arnold Scwarzenegger plays his part pretty well, although I can tell he wishes he was done with this franchise. Gabriel Luna is not bad, but does not have the fearsome presence that Robert Patrick had in T2, or Arnold had in the first one. Mackenzie Davis does alright with what she was giving. Action scenes are awesome, so where the effects, and that is the only reason I'm not giving it a low rating.",Terminator - Dark Fate
62,Stevieboy666,Tons of action but another needless sequel,6,13 May 2020,"Dark Fate opens with a young John Connor being killed by a Terminator, ripping up the previous sequels. A bold turn of plot maybe but not a good one. The first hour takes place in Mexico, another evil Terminator is sent from the future to kill a young woman named Dani Ramos, who is destined to become a future resistance leader. So pretty much a loose remake of the original film. I actually preferred this part, we get character development plus tons of non-stop violence.
The second half takes place in the US, where Arnie appears. Schwarzenegger is one of my heroes but he really is too old to be playing parts such as this, even though an unconvincing explanation is given for his ageing. Linda Hamilton is here too, but again looking like she should be enjoying retirement rather than kicking serious ass. The action continues, in fact it is rammed up even more but much of it is very over the top and unbelievable. A great deal of CGI too making much of it look like a video game.
After reviewing Genisys I said that I hoped there would be no more sequels but obviously Hollywood is a money making machine and here we are with number 6 in the series. I enjoyed it, I liked the characters, the action and I will watch anything with Big Arn in. But it is a needless sequel, doubt that I would watch it again.",Terminator - Dark Fate

This is the 6th Terminator movie but it is written & produced by James Cameron-who did the first 2 Terminator movies-and he has said that this is a sequel to the second one, Judgement Day. He said that the following Terminator movies and tv series took place in an alternate timeline and are not connected to this one. It's directed by Tim Miller, who directed Deadpool. It starts in Mexico, with Natalia going to work in a factory. Mackinzie shows up, just in time to stop Gabriel from killing Natalia. Gabriel is a new, improved Terminator model called a Rev_9, which has some new powers. Mackinzie-a hybrid cyborg that is still human-and Natalia go on the run because they just can't seem to be able to stop Gabriel. That's when they run into Linda, who joins them on the run. There are similarities as to why Gabriel has been sent to kill Natalia but there are also some differences, too. Clues lead them to a cabin in the woods where Arnold has been living for 20 years. So, you have a T_800, a Rev_9 and an enhanced super soldier in the mix-plus 2 humans-to make an action packed good time. The action and fight scenes are pretty good and for those who were wondering, John Conner/Edward Furlong does make an appearance, in a way.
It's rated ""R"" for violence, language and some brief nudity and has a running time of 2 hours & 8 minutes.

64,dee.reid,"Not such a ""Dark Fate"" for the series?",8,7 March 2020,"2019's ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" aims to be what its three predecessors weren't: a sequel that is a worthy follow-up to James Cameron's landmark sci-fi picture ""The Terminator"" (1984) - my favorite science fiction film of all time, by the way, and my #3 favorite movie of all time - and its equally ground-breaking sequel, 1991's ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day."" To that end, ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" is not so much a sequel to the three sequels that preceded it - ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" (2003), ""Terminator Salvation"" (2009), and ""Terminator Genisys"" (2015) - as it is a direct follow-up to ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day.""To make that connection clearer, Cameron was brought in as a producer and story consultant on ""Dark Fate"" - a role he also played in ""Genisys"" - and was not involved at all in the productions of ""Rise of the Machines"" or ""Salvation."" In the ""Terminator"" universe, those three previous films - and the highly regarded ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" TV series that was created by Josh Friedman and ran for two seasons between 2007 and 2009 - have been completely disregarded (or only exists in ""alternate timelines,"" which is par for the course in a series that revolves around the machinations of time travel and lazy filmmakers who just want to pretend they never even took place).(On a personal note, I liked the three sequels, with ""Terminator Salvation"" being my personal favorite of the three.)And Cameron aligned himself with a capable, younger fan-boy director, Tim Miller (""Deadpool""). To their credit, they've created a sequel that doesn't always quite hit the mark, but does return the series to some familiar territory, since it also brings back two key players from ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" 28 years after the fact. And with their return, you get a sense of the race against impending apocalyptic doom, shootouts, poignant human drama, big action set-pieces, and old-school comic relief.""Terminator: Dark Fate"" begins with an extended epilogue from ""Terminator 2,"" and then segues into darker waters with an opening action sequence that has already ignited fierce controversy in the online ""Terminator"" fan community and will certainly jolt unwary viewers (the film opened in overseas markets in Europe and Asia before opening in the United States last November).We then move into the thick of the story, which centers around 18-year-old Daniella ""Dani"" Ramos (Natalia Reyes), an auto plant assembly line worker in Mexico City. A new, highly advanced version of the shape-changing liquid-metal android assassin from ""Terminator 2,"" called a REV-9 (Gabriel Luna), arrives from the future to kill her. This new Terminator is an astonishing special effects creation, since it can split itself into two fully functional autonomous forms - one is a flesh-covered human robot, and the other is a heavily armored metallic endoskeleton.Protecting Dani, is a bionically augmented super-soldier from the future named Grace (Mackenzie Davis, ""Tully""). And the pair is also later joined by Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), who is even more bad-ass here than when she was in ""Terminator 2,"" though she is more aged, cynical, and world-weary. (If you need to get caught up, she is the mother of John Connor - Edward Furlong in ""Terminator 2"" and who lent his voice and facial likeness here - who in the future will lead a human resistance against rogue killer machines controlled by an out-of-control super-computer called Skynet.) Additional help comes from a domesticated CSM-101 cyborg Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), who has taken a human name (""Carl"") and has even adopted a human family.There are special effects and then there are special effects. The film's pace is pretty much established with its first action sequence, which occurs a scant few minutes after Grace and the REV-9 arrive in the present to duel to the death for the future. The film is quite competently acted by the players and skillfully directed by Tim Miller. Of the players, Natalia Reyes fulfills her role commendably, being that over the course of the film she goes from a scared little girl to a brave and capable warrior (will her Hollywood career be jump-started by this movie?) - in much the same way Linda Hamilton had done just 35 years prior. The other really noteworthy character was the murderous REV-9, played by Gabriel Luna, who takes on numerous guises in its relentless pursuit of its target, and, as part of its search, is able to better interact with other humans than any Terminator seen thus far. I hope he appears in more movies in the future.As much as the movie tries to disregard the three previous movies (and the TV series), it does adopt one of its central caveats, which is that Judgment Day appears to be inevitable: each time one version of it is averted, a new version pops up in its place. But the key underlying emotional component of this movie (and ""Terminator 2"") was the human determination to fight for the future. Despite the apparent cynicism and nihilism - ""Carl"" casually states the likelihood of social anarchy even without a Judgment Day doomsday scenario - the movie ultimately ends on a message of hope for humanity.Sometimes that's all we need. Because hope may also bring about more ""Terminator"" sequels.8/10",Terminator - Dark Fate

They did A great job of de-aging Linda Hamilton, Arnie, and Edward Furlong.I found the ""Rev-9"" to be an interesting Terminator especially after Kristanna Loken's T-X in rise of the machines who had always been my favorite terminator, seconded by ""Marcus Wright"" played by Sam Worthington, and of course Arnold's original T-800. And then there was a T-1000 style terminator in the Sarah Connor Chronicles, played by a woman, I forget who she was but that was also an interesting Terminator.So we've seen all kinds of terminators through the franchises and the one television show, this film brings the franchise back to formula with Terminator played by Gabriel Luna, who was great as ghost rider in agents of shield.Not to reveal too much but Gabriel's terminator has an interesting ability that none of the others had ever had, I don't even know if I should say anything about it and I guess I won't. But he appears similar to a T-1000, but also has some standard parts. You will see if you watch this.As far as the film, it has a little bit of a teaser and then it gets right into the action with very few places to rest, it's an onslaught.In this case the individual sent to protect Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) is not a human and is not a terminator. It takes a little bit of exposition to reveal exactly what she is, and they don't do that all at once.This film does not depend on so many Terminator clichés, of course there are one or two ""I'll be backs"", but this film is not littered with them like other films in the franchise.Of course we all knew that Arnie would be coming back to this, and his Terminator is not what we expect at all, and that kind of surprised me. There are even a couple of spots in this film where he chooses to not follow the classic terminator look. And, he has a sense of humor. It was this whole concept of, ""the terminator has finished his mission, he's left to twiddle his thumbs in human society. What does he do?""- that is something that we never ever got to explore in any of the feature films, we got to see a little bit of this on a minor scale in the Sarah Connor Chronicles, but that wasn't Arnold. What would the T 800 do? And I think this film provides a good possible answer for that- it's worth viewing simply for that aspect",Terminator - Dark Fate
68,alindsay-al,A Good Film that is the best Terminator film since T2,7,28 October 2019,"I love both The Terminator and Terminator 2 Judgement Day, but in my opinion there hasn't been a good Terminator film made in my lifetime so I was nervous about seeing Terminator Dark Fate but I am happy to report that this is a good film and is easily the 3rd best Terminator film ever made. The premise of the film sees a half human/half cyborg team up with Sarah Connor & a T800 to protect a young girl from a new more advanced type of Terminator. Mackenzie Davies plays Grace a half human/half cyborg and she does an okay job in this film, in the action scenes she is great, she comes across as a real action star. But I have to admit this film tried to make me care about her character and I just really didn't, she hasn't got strong enough material to work with and her character just isn't particularly interesting. Luckily I felt the supporting cast does a better job, Linda Hamilton is back as Sarah Connor and she was really the standout in this film, her character is more battle hardened then we last saw her and she gives a layered performance that fits the character we have seen in the previous films. Arnold Schwarzenneger is back as a T800 and lets face it he was born to play this role and he does a very good job in the role and this film allows him to do a bit more with the role this time around. Diego Reyes plays the Rev-9 and he does a fantastic job as a deadly and destructive villain that just oozes charisma and I feel like if he is given more high profile roles he can be a big name. The story isn't exactly groundbreaking, it is entertaining watching this constant chase going on in this film but there is no denying that this plot has been done and seen before even though it does kind of work for this film. The script has some well done drama, especially towards the beginning of the film it does a good job ib building characters with a few nods to the previous films. However, this film is a bit lifeless with its charm and there is absolutly no humour for the majority of the film and I felt at times characters are swearing just to try and make this film more edgy even though it's unnecessary. The style of the film is pretty cool, this film is more violent and action heavy with the CGI feeling pretty natural in this film and I liked all the designs and tech in the film. Overall this is a good film, it won't turn you into a Terminator fan but if you are a fan of the franchise you will probably be at least hopeful for future installments.",Terminator - Dark Fate

74,cjonesas,"[7.5] After T2: Judgement Day, the menacing effect is gone",8,17 May 2020,"Strangely enough I don't feel very talkative about this movie; is it because it is repetitive or because it has basically nothing to review about?The real matter IMO is that after T2, there was no real need to further explore the franchise and its sub-stories. You may ask yourself why.
What made the two first Terminator movies great in the first place?A young Arnold Schwarzenegger who was fit and the right choice to play the killing machine in The Terminator and the impressive Robert Patrick with his Bird of Prey look in the T2: Judgement DayA fresh, original, simple yet intricately thrilling story by James Cameron, awesomely woven and presentedReal menacing atmosphere throughout those movies, very well shown and developed by the first two Terminators, felt to the core by viewersVery nice and professional visual effects in both movies, increased and enhanced awesomely in the second one, way ahead of 1991 capabilitiesNow the picture is more clear. Time passed. T movies came and went by, but failed to nurture and possess the success and menacing charm of the mentioned movies.
The last one is no exception. We have awesome VFX, fast-paced and well-depicted actions, good acting, especially believable one by Mackenzie Davis, but in the end it fails the soul of the original T movies and the rightful feel that it so desperately tries to pass around, but doesn't nearly succeed.On a side but important notes for any future T movies, should James Cameron or any interested producer decide that they haven't had enough:
You do not put a Latino-looking skinny Terminator on the screen, lacking charisma and required presenceYou do not put a voluble Terminator on the screen, more prone to talk its way through than showing frightening acting and real action in the essence of a real TerminatorYou do not put the story in Mexico or any Latin countryYou do not choose a simple, uninteresting, general-looking actress lacking real (charming) presence that everybody would go through hell to save her, let alone die for. Remember the actor playing John Connor in T2. A simple teen, yet full of charisma.You do not put bearded Terminators on the screen, should you decide to recreate / revive the T-800The [7.5] is for the shiny action sequences, generally right vibe of the movie and the real efforts put in by some of the cast, especially Davis, Schwarzenegger and Hamilton.",Terminator - Dark Fate
75,juneebuggy,Her mission is to protect,7,29 January 2020,"Saw this in the theatre, enjoyed it, Great CGI, spectacular action scenes, some cheesy one liners, good story with all the twisty time travel questions. I also really liked Mackenzie Davis as the new girl Terminator, she was awesome, an enhanced human cyborg, even had a cool backstory from the future alternate time line.Arnold Schwarzenegger is mostly secondary here, the movie is lead by three women, very James Cameron style, he's been giving us kick ass action hero woman since before it was a thing, Sigourney Weaver in Alien and Linda Hamilton's gun show in T2.I was curious how they would get around the fact that Arnie isn't really up to the action sequences anymore, the answer is have him sit in a chair, be underwater, in zero gravity and with a damaged leg so he limps slowly, I don't care, he was fantastic, great to have the gang back together. Some very cool CGI making Him, Linda and John young again for a flashback scene twist showing the T-whatever carrying out his mission after T2 Judgement Day, very cool way to explain why Edward Furlong isn't in the movieActually thought they had painted themselves into a corner because the new Terminator appears unstoppable.Worth my ticket price",Terminator - Dark Fate

77,Pairic,The Real Terminator 3!,8,24 October 2019,"Terminator: Dark Fate: Sarah Connor wakes up, sees a T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) in the shower and realises that everything since T2 has been a dream. Well, not exactly, Arnie appears on a beach in Mexico 1998 and kills John Connors, a T-800 from a future that never happened, following orders for years, tracking John. Sarah may have stopped the 1997 apocalypse but the altered timeline has resulted in a later AI takeover and it's name is Legion. Mexico City 2020, Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) comes under attack from a new type of Terminator, a Rev-9 (Gabriel Lona) which can shape-shift and split in two. Grace (MacKenzie Davis) an augmented human (Bionic Woman) sent from the future rescues Dani and a chase ensues. When all seems lost Sarah appears, temporarily disables the Rev-9 and all three set off on a quest to secure EMP weapons which will destroy the Rev-9.Some truly great car chases here, better even than those in T2, especially the scoop-truck (driven by the Rev-9) battering it's way along a freeway, the shock as the Rev-9 shows that it can separate it's skeleton from the mimetic polyalloy (it's really an advanced T-1000). Some really disturbing scenes of human dismemberment tilt Dark Fate into Horror territory. Grace provides flashbacks (or rather flashforwards) of the new 2042, it's much like Skynet one except that the Resistance have more advanced machines and weapons, the terminators have tentacles. Grace was a child when Legion took control and later became a soldier, volunteering for augmentation and Time Travel. A dark present is portrayed as well, Dani's brother loses his job in a car plant due to the introduction of robots. Even jobs outsourced to Mexico are ephemeral.Sarah is totally paranoid and necessarily so as she hunts Terminators, getting information through texts from an unknown supporter. But the death of John has left her somewhat crazed as Dani is the new target she becomes a surrogate for John. But Sarah also sardonically welcomes this turn which mean's she's no longer the ""Mother Mary"". She competes with Grace for the position of Dani's bodyguard. This isn't just an action movie, we have Arnie as a T-800 who has turned and developed feelings for his adopted human family. But the fight scenes are central, be it Grace head to head with the Rev-9 or Sarah blasting away at it. Dani is also able to become a fighter after some early scenes where she came across as a hysterical ingenue. Some cutting humour infuses Dark Fate, deadpan from Arnie with sarcasm from Hamilton. A satisfying edge of the seat adventure with some interesting twists, ably directed by Tim Miller with James Cameron chipping in on the story as well as producing the film. 9/10.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I think audiences have spoken but if an action fix is what you need, this movie will not disappoint. The plot is streamlined & to the point w/newcomers Mackenzie Davis & Natalia Reyes now playing protector/client (as it were) & Gabriel Luna playing the new terminator (the Rev9) sent by a new evil entity from the future called Legion which has supplanted the defeated Skynet which brings Linda Hamilton & Schwarzenegger back into the mix but all this constant retconning of past series installments seem a bit blasé & abusive since studios continue to expect the paying public to subsidize their creative mishaps.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Dark Fate changes none of this, aside from taking a more feminine focus.The story never progresses but simply re-mixes, with the same killer, protector, save the world formula, that feels a lot like cinematic OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder).Suffice to say, you can only serve up the same thing so many times before no one wants to know anymore. 5/10.",Terminator - Dark Fate
80,I_Ailurophile,How is the umpteenth Terminator film this good?,9,6 May 2021,"Who doesn't have mixed expectations about the Terminator series at this point? The original film is a thrilling classic, but it's been diminishing returns since then with each addition to the franchise's twisted chronology (or attempt thereof). The first theatrical trailer for 'Dark fate' had my rapt attention, but also included scenes that gave me pause.So what of it? How does 'Terminator: Dark fate' stack up?While the opening scene provides a bit of context, I think both it and especially the accompanying narration aren't the best way to begin the movie. It's also unnecessary, since that same context is provided 40 minutes in. Moving on.'Dark fate' wastes no time. After the dubious opening scene, the action kicks up extremely hard and fast, following the familiar pattern: two electrical storms occur in a locale as a terminator and a protector pass through time, and they converge at the same point to target a particular individual. And while we get peeks in the trailer to these introductions to the characters, that doesn't make the scenes any less riveting.I'm forced to question the ease with which Dani seems to readily accept the scenario that Grace presents to her - a stark contrast to Kyle Reese's introduction to Sarah Connor in 1984. Still, that's the narrative we're given, and it's a small gimme in the long run.How about the rest? A staggering amount of blood and violence, of course; more fast-paced than any of the other movies. A terminator (Rev-9) that is far more advanced and deadly than previous models, with far greater capabilities. Scenes of the possible future that are ever more horrifying - though they also tend to be a bit much after a point. Seemingly impossible odds for our heroes. Pithy remarks and passing commentary, much in line with each entry from 'Judgment Day' onward. And special effects have progressed well beyond what we've seen in previous installments, allowing for even more visually arresting depictions of the terminator's damage, of the possible future, and so on.'Dark fate' is also very over the top, as each subsequent sequel has been. But here's the thing:First of all, it's done extremely well. Every scene that strains credulity past the breaking point and is too far-fetched to be believable? 'Dark fate' is well aware of it, and it doesn't care. Because second, while we're familiar with the scenario at this point - like the action, it remains harrowing and thrilling, pulling us in and keeping us engaged at every turn no matter how preposterous it may get. The airplane scene in the trailers had me doubting this picture's chances, but considered in the grand scheme of the film? I don't mind it at all. In fact, I love it.And third: While 'Dark fate' is exciting, and suspenseful against all odds, it also doesn't entirely take itself seriously. Nevermind the bombastic action sequences: There are one-liners about gun culture, and the inhumane ""debate"" about immigration. The introduction of the tertiary supporting character brings with it the notion of emergent AI on a small scale (compared to, say, SkyNet), and no small amount of wide-eyed humor - as in, I can't believe the writers were gutsy enough to go this route. But they did.And because 'Dark fate' both declines to take itself seriously, and consciously goes all in on the story it wants to tell, that small measure of comedy genuinely works. (It helps, too, that it's more well-written than the ""Haha! Look at this!"" silliness of 'Rise of the machines.')I enjoy the screenplay by David Goyer, Justin Rhodes, and Billy Ray. I like the music by Tom Holkenborg, which is at least in part of course inspired by the music from the original film, and absolutely helps the film to maintain its energy. And I especially love the cast. The screenplay provides every character - and I do mean EVERY character - an unexpected amount of personality that they have previously lacked, and where appropriate, the cast does well in portraying their roles.Mackenzie Davis is outstanding as Grace, the resistance's chosen protector, giving her a fantastic level of grit while also displaying vulnerability. Natalia Reyes shines as Dani, the target of the new terminator (Gabriel Luna), allowing the future's hope to bear piss and vinegar while also showing terror, and grief. To simply see Linda Hamilton back as Sarah Connor, now more hard-boiled than ever, is a true delight. And Arnold Schwarzenegger... Well, acting has never been the bodybuilder's strength, but nor has this role especially required it; let's just say that if this were to be his last appearance as a T-800, it would be a worthy exit.I appreciate how more than in any other Terminator film, the climax feels like an actual fight scene, as opposed to just a gunfight or a total effects extravaganza. I like that the most central protagonists are women, providing some welcome relief from the overabundance of testosterone that weighs down the action genre. And I admire how the ending does leave open the possibility for another sequel - or in the very least, offers a satisfying conclusion to this particular saga.I think of the original 1984 film as more of a sci-fi horror movie, given the thrust of the narrative, and 'T2' felt more like an action-adventure flick with a sci-fi bent. Subsequent Terminator properties have tap-danced across sci-fi and action to varying degrees, but it's been quite a while since a feature has really captured the imagination with a sense of thrills. I know opinions vary, too.For my part, though: I went into 'Terminator: Dark fate' with a fair bit of excitement, and hoping for the best, but keeping expectations in check. And I am very happy to say that my expectations were well exceeded. Personally, I think this might be my favorite Terminator film since the very first.Audiences have been and will continue to be divided, and this movie won't be for everyone. But it is unquestionably made well, and to any degree that a viewer takes exception to plot points it gives us: 'Dark fate' doesn't care. It's going to tell the story it wants, like it or not.And that's the kind of action movie I enjoy.",Terminator - Dark Fate
81,aidanratesmovies,Beat my Expectations,8,16 February 2020,"Terminator: Dark Fate may not be considered a good film to many, at times it is certainly flawed, with action taking over instead of a storyline at times, and pacing falling victim to it doing so. However, Dark Fate is easily the franchise has had to offer in quite some time, and although that may not be saying much, the film is truly entertaining and surprisingly enjoyable. Mackenzie Davis and Natalia Reyes make for the biggest standouts in the film, which was also a surprise, considering I had no expectations or interest for either of them in the film, or their characters, as I went in. Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger return as their respected characters, and for the most part provide decent performances. Both of their characters at times seem somewhat forced into the story, but by the end, both seem appreciated and well used in the process. The CGI in the film can vary, from quite impressive, too surprisingly dull and obvious. The villain and the film is kinda lacking, and seems to put forth as only a threat. Of course, I don't expect any character development about a machine, but the villain simply doesn't seem quite that important, and seems to be more of an annoyance, than a true life-force behind the film. Most of the CGI flaws in the film also seem be involved with the character, and can prove to be frustrating at times. In the end, however, Terminator: Dark Fate is a surprisingly entertaining action film, that does contain some interesting story elements. Although it doesn't take full advantage of its concept, it does prove to be an often enough fun time to be rather enjoyable and prove to be certainly worth a watch.
My Rating: 8/10",Terminator - Dark Fate
82,questl-18592,Terminator 6: Still Terminating,7,2 December 2020,"I wonder how much of this movie comes down to predetermined expectations. The first two Terminators are classic works of action cinema with T2 especially being an almost legendary film in it's own right. Since then, we've had epic fail after epic fail. T3 is a mess of fan service, Salvation was just dumb and gave itself away in commercials, didn't see Genisys but I haven't heard good things. So when Dark Fate came on I was pretty happily surprised by how solid it is. Good action, Hamilton brings intensity, they explain Schwarzenegger and utilize him well and all of the newcomers are solid and imposing in their own rights.As far as Terminator movies go, this is easily the third best but that's not a really high bar to reach. Aside from 1 and 2, the Terminator movies are basically garbage so even being a moderate success makes this feel like a colossal victory. It's far from perfect but if you've been hoping for them to finally make another decent Terminator, congratulations, it's finally here. Ignore the others, watch 1, 2 and then Dark Fate. I'd be really curious to see anyone enter the franchise with this too, I'm not sure it would work, should definitely check the first two out before anything else.",Terminator - Dark Fate
83,adamjohns-42575,No more please?,5,4 October 2021,"Like the Terminators themselves the film makers just seem to be replicating the same thing but with slightly better special effects each time. It's not actually a bad film and it does the job for an action film full of futuristic robot fighting, but I think even Arnold is getting tired of this series now. I certainly found his character a bit hard to believe and I didn't like the fact that they seem to have completely forgotten ignored the last three films.Also Linda is pretty freaky, she actually reminded me of the junk pile lady from 'Labyrinth' (1986) and on occasion her appearance on screen caused an unpleasant physical reaction.Based on what we had seen up until this point, I don't think it was necessary to bring her back at all.I like the Terminator films as a whole and probably write controversially my favourite is the first one (1984) because Arnie plays that bad assed robot so well. These modern ""more human"" versions are a little bit too much like his comedic films - True Lies and Last Action Hero. There is something about him with that beard though.As I've said though, it's really not a bad film at all. I would just have liked to have seen a new story, which I'm sure the brains in Hollywood could have come up with.There are no stand out actors or moments really, but then this film isn't about that. Just sit back and enjoy it for the OTT violence and action.506.15/1000.",Terminator - Dark Fate
84,TheFearmakers,Terminator Too Little Too Late,5,3 November 2019,"TERMINATOR: DARK FATE not only brings back beloved originals Linda Hamilton (who hasn't been around a while) and Arnold Schwarzenegger (part of two maligned followups), there's the liquid-morphing metallic CGI from the second movie, and now we know: despite all the technical innovations, special effects have not improved since the days of T2 and/or JURASSIC PARK...During one scene, as the new Terminator leaps into the air, he looks almost made of rubber. And the overall atmosphere and aesthetic fits the DARK title as many of the fight scenes happen either at night or inside someplace without much light, making it hard to see the action panning out or to keep score about what exactly's going on...Which isn't like the last attempt, GENYSIS, where the exposition is represented within the world it takes place. Here the story's literally told in conversations and/or flashbacks during transit between fight sequences...Getting rid of John Connor in the beginning leaves a whole new plot, which is the exact same plot with different names: there's a young protector protecting a new future messiah... both pretty girls... and a very aged Linda Hamilton, whose world-weary one-liners fall flat and awkward: a sad reminder she's not as timeless (or necessary) as the two classic films she co-starred in long ago...And she's got even less chemistry with Arnold (now a grey-bearded drapes salesman) than androgynous Mackenzie Davis does with Mexican ingenue Natalia Reyes: all four merely surviving the new killing machine that could have been played by anyone. Hell, even a supermodel superchick would do, like, you know, TERMINATOR 3...Which this movie's entire purpose was to pretend didn't exist. And yet, ironically, they're the same movie: a prolonged chase scene with explosions along the way. Making DARK FATE a case of both amnesia and denial.",Terminator - Dark Fate

It's fast paced with really good direction from Tim Miller and amazing music by Tom Holkenborg. Linda Hamilton gives a great performance and Arnold Schwarzenegger gives his best performance in years as well as being surprisingly funny. Natalia Reyes and Mackenzie Davis are really good and Gabriel Luna is a fantastic terminator that's genuinely intimidating/threatening. However, it is brought down by some weak CG in the opening.",Terminator - Dark Fate
86,davidmvining,Thinly Entertaining,5,29 March 2021,"Bare competence. That's pretty much all we get from Tim Miller's entry in the Terminator franchise produced by James Cameron, basic competence. Aside from a couple of large decisions, this is almost a complete remake of the first film for a new era. It's far from perfect, and I wouldn't even go so far as to call it good, but it sort of works as a whole. Except that it's got two competing storylines that they never really merge into one.This franchise is a mess. It was relatively cohesive through the fourth movie, though the constant recasting of John Conner didn't help things. There was a story through the four that you could follow, and then the fourth was a financial disappointment and the studio decided that it was a disappointment because it wasn't the same as the first movie. So, they made a movie that was sort of a recreation and remake of the first that was incomprehensibly bad and abandoned any plans for a future in that scenario. The rights went back to James Cameron who decided that Tim Miller, the director of Deadpool, was a good choice for helmer, and they were off to the races.The film begins a little while after the events of the second film where we watch de-aged Linda Hamilton get pushed aside helplessly as another Terminator shows up in Cabo and kills her son John. Jump ahead a couple of decades or so to Mexico City and we meet Dani, a very well put together poor girl who keeps her whole household in order and shuffles her brother off to work along with her at a manufacturing plant. Before she's even done confronting their boss about her brother's sudden replacement with a machine (in just about the most heavy-handed attempt at foreshadowing I can imagine), the action starts up with the new Terminator (the REV-9) showing up as Dani's father and just killing everybody.The reason these early scenes feel so stunted is because there's a shocking number of characters that need screentime to get their arcs. First is Dani who, I assume, is supposed to be the main character. Second is Grace, the future warrior sent back to protect her (the Kyle Reese role). That's the number of protagonists we got in the first movie. Then add in Sarah Conner. And Carl. This is an action spectacular that's right at two hours long, and there are four characters with major arcs. None of them get the kind of time they need, and that's because this is really two movies in one.As Dani and Grace, who fights off the REV-9 in the plant, escape down the highway, they come to a stop and meet Sarah Conner, who shows up with heavy weapons and a nonchalant attitude as she pushes the REV-9 back with relative ease, obviously having done this a lot. Having gotten away, Grace crashes, needing injections of stuff to get her going again, and the three end up in a hotel room as Grace recovers. It's here where Sarah starts her own little arc. Ever since a few years after John was murdered, she's receive mysterious, encrypted text messages with coordinates and a time where a Terminator was going to appear. She shows up and kills the Terminator, waiting for the next one to show up.Pump the brakes. That sounds like an awesome movie. Can we get that movie? Because it sounds awesome.Because we don't get that movie. Sarah tags along to marvel at the changes to the timeline that were wrought because of her actions in the second movie. Skynet never happened, but Legion arose. Judgment Day didn't happen in 1997, instead it happened in the 2020s. Essentially, this is Terminator 3, but with Sarah Conner showing up. She has to deal with John's loss, the involvement of the T-800 who killed John and is still around, and the fact that she's not that important to the future anymore. I suppose this intersects with Dani's story best when Sarah discovers that Dani isn't the mother of the future, but she's the future leader herself, a twist the movie revels in but feels perfunctory at best because we're several decades into badass female protagonists being just so amazingly awesome in movies.The arc that Dani goes through is far too long for the amount of screen time she actually has. She goes from sassy girl who can go to bat for her brother in a work environment to full-on ready to lead soldiers into battle by the end. I think of the arc that Sarah went through in the first movie where she started as a typical young woman just entering the workforce and ended up as a soldier, veteran of a single battle that robbed her of her new love. She became the hardened warrior between the first and second movie after a decade of learning and hardening. Dani gets too hard too quickly. I don't buy it. Maybe if they had decided to take the full reboot route instead of the sort of sequel route, we might have had enough time with Dani early to establish her more fully and give her more opportunities to actually grow. When her growth amounts to her, out of the blue, offering to play the bait in a trap to kill the unkillable machine from the future, a reality she seems to accept shockingly easily. She seems to jump into this new reality really easily.Another problem with Dani is the casting. Natalia Reyes is fine as Dani in the present day, but there's a flashback that shows her in the future, bringing the beginnings of the future resistance together, and to watch this five foot nothing girl with a weird haircut give a halfheartedly written speech with gusto is unconvincing. Part of it is the speech itself, but the other part is that Reyes just doesn't sell it that well. She's giving it her all, but I don't see her as the kind of person that these attempted murderers and rapists would suddenly give up their nihilistic path to follow her on to fight the machines after about fifty words.There's another issue with the story's competing storylines, and that's Sarah's background. She has some air force contact that just hands her a top secret EMP with words about how he's committing treason, and he'd been mentioned before a single time in the movie. And then he's shot moments later, living just long enough to get the group onto a base and into an aircraft that the air force just lets them take. It's not that all of this improbably happens, it's that the backup to the actions is so thoroughly thin that it makes the experience feel jagged and random.Now, Carl. Carl was the T-800 that killed John. Left in our time with no direct orders, and being a learning machine, he actually ended up growing sympathetic to humanity and to what he had done to Sarah through his marriage to a woman and adopting her son. He also sells drapes. This is an interesting idea, that the learning computer comes to naturally side with humanity, but very little ends up happening with it. The same thing can be said about Grace and her enhanced abilities. It's interesting that she can become super strong for short bursts and needs to crash afterwards to recover, but there's no time given to her talking about how this affects her personally. It's a neat idea to see and little else.The new Terminator is an extension of the idea of the T-X in Terminator 3 where it has a solid metal endoskeleton and a liquid metal exterior, except here the liquid metal can separate completely from the skeleton and, essentially, become two terminators at once. A neat idea, and enough for the antagonistic killer robot. It's neat.Overall, I like the action as well. It's good stuff, my favorite being the plane crash as the REV-9 crashes one plane into another, climbs onto the other plane, and the good guy shave to fight him off as they get into a Humvee with a parachute. It's chaotic and amusing.Ultimately, this movie is really hobbled by the fact that it tries to tell two stories at once and never really connects them that well. Both have the potential to fill a movie completely on their own, but together they clash. At least it doesn't follow the Genisys problem and leave a bunch out for sequels, though there was obviously a plan for more story that's not going to get followed through on because of the movie's poor box office showing. It's a heavily mixed bag with good ideas being far outweighed by subpar storytelling.It's not the worst of the franchise, but it's very far from the best.",Terminator - Dark Fate

89,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Terminator: Dark Fate,7,6 November 2019,"""I hunt Terminators"". Great. Someone needs to gun down those pesky, Legion-ed prototypes.Anyway, are you a Terminator fan? Well fab because Terminator: Dark Fate gives you just what you want. Granted, ""Fate"" is not as good as the first three Terminator films (funny being that it bares an uncanny resemblance to Judgment Day and the original). And it feels a little recycled in terms of themes, cores, car chases, and action set pieces. Oh well. ""Fate"" is fast-paced, whiz-bang, and involving. Linda Hamilton is back guns blazing, the production budget is higher, James Cameron is back producing, and Arnold Schwarzenegger looks a little younger (and healthier) this time around.Also in ""Fate's"" mix playing a badass, cyborg soldier, is Mackenzie Davis (Tully, Blade Runner 2049). Davis at a lean-and-mean 5'10, sure knows how to yield a chain while snarlingly mugging to the camera. If the Terminator franchise continues (and I'm thinking it might), I see her probably being on board (or ""back"", no pun intended).Terminator: Dark Fate, which takes place in Mexico as opposed to sequel mainstay Los Angeles, is directed by Deadpool helmer and title sequence monger, Tim Miller. Miller avoids any sort of epic mantra and fashions ""Fate"" as a less violent and less self-serious, ""popcorn"" movie. He films action well (and in panoramic form), his special effects are dated yet juicily effective, his camera is true-blue, and his villain (amoeba-ed, Terminator Rev-9 played by Gabriel Luna) is totally Robert Patrick-esque.Sure ""Fate's"" plot is a little stock (a Terminator model arrives from the future to kill a young, random man/woman). And yes, Miller's ""edge of tomorrow"" doesn't create a more foreboding and bombastic atmosphere like the mighty Jimmy Cameron (most filmmakers can't). Still, Terminator: Dark Fate takes us back to circa 1984-2003 when the Terminator movies were zingy, high-velocity, and faithfully blueprinted. In terms of giving a favorable rating, ""Fate's"" ""fate"" at 3 stars is sealed.",Terminator - Dark Fate
90,justin-fencsak,this is a solid sequel ignore the naysayers,8,2 November 2019,"After the failures of t3, salvation, and genysys damaged the reputation of the Terminator Brand as well as the short lived Sarah Connor tv show made the franchise like what Star Wars is now, it was time for James Cameron to continue the fight after t2 with Dark Fate, which picks up where the second one left off. Arnold of course is back as an aging Terminator, along with Linda Hamilton, still as badass as ever, along with Mackenzie Davis as a sexy good Terminator along with some new faces. DIrected by Tim Miller, known for the hugely popular Deadpool movies, and scored by Junkie XL, this film is worth seeing in Dolby or Imax and is one of the best action movies of the year. Once in a while, there's a break in the action where all the good guys meet up at an enclave to chill, but it doesn't last for a bit long.",Terminator - Dark Fate
91,Easygoer10,Woeful Trash,2,6 October 2020,And you thought the plots couldn't be worse? Think again! This is like watching a cartoon from the 1960's. It is terrible.

93,mhorg2018,Better than what some of these reviewers would have you believe,2,1 November 2019,"OK, I was ready to hammer this movie into the ground for (from the trailer) seemingly taking the new en vogue PC way of doing things. The women are all smart, the men are stupid and evil. But that's not the case here. Yes, Sarah Connor is her usual bad ass. But the mission objective isn't. Much like Sarah in the first Terminator, she disbelieves until she has to believe her eyes. Grace, the enhanced human from the future, is well thought out and a decent actress. True, this is just Terminator done again, as was T2 (still the best of the three that Cameron was involved with) but it's done well and with panache. I will admit that the scene with the airplane (A C-5 Galaxy) was a bit out of hand, but it was still fun. The saving grace of this film is Arnold, who steals every scene he's in. I'm not going to give any spoilers, but rather than read all the negative reviews on this page, some of which are written by people I'd call, well, less than objective to be kind - go see it and make up your own mind. It's light years ahead of Rise of the Machines (which breaks all the rules of the Liquid Metal Terminators), Terminator: Salvation and Genesys which are just horrible. Cameron's fingers can be felt all over this movie, and it's certainly worth seeing.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I see this film as a homage to the original two films. It's not a classic but it's a good rehash and it's great to see modern special FX on an old story. It's better than salvation and definitely better than Genisys. It can't touch T2 but nothing can. Comparisons will lead to disappointment. Enjoy if you like seeing killer robots and cool special FX.,Terminator - Dark Fate
95,nancyldraper,Back to Basics,9,4 November 2019,"To understand my response to this movie, I need you to understand my history with this franchise. In 1984, a movie came out that I thought I would never be the least bit interested in. I went to see it because my youth group was talking about it and, as their Minister of Christian Education, and their youth leader, I was always interested in interacting with them about the media they consumed so I could challenge their worldview with the cause of Christ. I was completely astonished to fall in love with the love story that was, surprisingly, at the heart of this weird, mechanical, apocalyptic movie. It became one of my favourite movies and I've seen it multiple times since then and it still moves me. That movie, of course, was THE TERMINATORA, a straight up 10 out of 10. I have since followed every subsequent addition to the franchise, including the very good TV series, TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES (starring Lena Headley). When this newest piece premiered, revisiting the woman, now 35 years later, that was the heart of that original movie, I was at the first viewing of it, with great expectations. And, I found the thing that first drew me to THE TERMINATOR, true character arcs: Sarah Connors (Linda Hamilton) hardened by the fight and grief, rediscovering her purpose, T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) conditioned by years of contact with humans, redeeming his mistakes; Grace (Mackenzie Davis) the self sacrificing warrior, Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) finding herself in the echos that call Sarah back to herself. It was all there, plus a stellar threat and some wicked action sequences. So I, unapologetically, give this film a 9 (nostalgic superb) out of 10. {Pre-Apocalyptic Action}",Terminator - Dark Fate

This film, a direct sequel to the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day, is smartly packaged but treads unimaginatively with its chase plot and visual effects tropes which made the first three films sparkle. Schwarzenegger, this time in a supporting role, gives the film some life when he finally appears. Linda Hamilton delivers a fierce performance, but their shared screen time is sadly short. Instead of letting the tension rise between the two characters, we wind up with a far-fetched, bloated finale. Nevertheless, the action scenes are executed with skill. As an aside, the film has a feeling of nostalgia which conjures up a retrospective: the story was at its exhaustive limit in The Terminator.",Terminator - Dark Fate
97,arungeorge13,Watch it for Arnie & Linda! [+52%],5,18 January 2020,"It's one thing to milk a popular franchise of its last ounce of nostalgia. And it's another to try to recreate the same vibe as that of its best entry released almost thirty years ago. Terminator: Dark Fate's greatest success lies in reuniting the lead duo of Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger from T2 but the film doesn't treat this as one of its key selling points.The story is rehashed from that of T2, with the key characters now mostly played by women (I was okay with the film trying to be contemporary and politically correct!). As expected, a young Dani (Natalia Reyes) is being pursued by an enhanced Terminator Rev-9 (Gabriel Luna, with none of the screen presence of Robert Patrick) and protecting her is augmented super-soldier Grace (a slick Mackenzie Davis).Somehow, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), gets into the mix. What follows is a predictable first hour that plays out with some mildly entertaining action but an overdose of CGI. The famous truck chase sequence from T2 has been replicated in Dark Fate but with none of the urgency and innovation of the former. Even with James Cameron at its creative helm and Tim Miller (the director of Deadpool) calling the shots, Dark Fate falls behind in what made T2 so great: the unlikely bond forged between man and machine. It felt so organic in T2 but in Dark Fate, it just feels like an after-thought with ""you know, the future is bleak"" commentary.Arnold pops up in the second hour as savior #3. The best scene in Dark Fate is when the three ladies and Arnie sit down over a beer, catch up on what's going on and decide on a master-plan to stop Rev-9 from killing Dani. It's funny as hell; it shows us why we missed Linda Hamilton in the franchise all this while, and it humanizes Arnie's T-101 once again. Another stunner is the opening scene that's set in 1998. Barring these two little gems, Dark Fate is predictable to a large extent and the way it wraps up doesn't surprise you one bit.",Terminator - Dark Fate
98,Abdulxoxo,Just another unnecessary sequel,7,8 January 2021,"First off, there's nothing really in this movie that we haven't seen already. It's essentially a rehash of the original two films, except with a few genders swapped. And any fan of the franchise (particularly the first two films) will probably be annoyed with the opening of this film. Whoever's choice it was to write this opening made a bad decision. Well, I did actually enjoy a few things while watching the movie which is mostly due to the acting. The main cast performances are actually amazing. Natalia Reyes is quite solid as the latest prey. Linda Hamilton, although unnecessary, is cool to see her again. Arnold Shwarzenegger's role is quite minor, but believe it or not he is actually the comic relief. Luna is pretty chilling as the new terminator. The standout, however, is the chameleonic Mackenzie Davis, she's very impressive and quite a badass. I also like the action sequences, as they're very entertaining. There are chases sequences, both on foot and in cars, underwater fighting scenes, lots of guns and explosions, you name it. Although, they are well staged, they lack a sense of danger and our protagonist come out quite safe even tho some them would have likely be killed by those stunts. This movie features a lot of CGI, I can't say it's flawless as they are lots of scenes that's obviously green screen but majority of them are well done.
Overall, Terminator: Dark fate is just another instalment in this tired franchise but it's still a decent action flick in its own right. It's entertaining and the casts performances are good.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Generally I would ignore all these technical details if the film were any good but sadly this is a big disappointment.This truly should mark the end of the franchise - Its over and he should not be back ....

We set the whole thing in Mexico and we had immigrants getting into America so there is another two boxes ticked. I would add the Mexican woman made a nasty racist joke about white people.Despite gross stereotyping, political messaging and gross tokenism that I have learnt to block out this was a worthy end of the franchise.",Terminator - Dark Fate
102,rivertam26,"Wild, fun and unnecessary",8,22 January 2020,"This is my second time seeing this and it's a solid film. Being a big time terminator fan, the first two are gospel. I have to say I'm still a bit disappointed with the progression and twists in the story but the action scenes are mostly spectacular but a little too reliant on cgi that begins to look cartoonish at times. Also the movie gets a little to repetitive in spots. I mean how many times to we need to see the villain come back together. That being said the three female leads are powerhouses. Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor is a damaged soul fighting for a reason to be relevant, Mackenzie Davis is unbelievably bad ass and Natalie Rayes as Dani is spunky and fierce. Arnold Schwarzenegger is also welcome and inspired in a smaller but pivotal role that fleshes out all of their stories. All in all it's a fun, wild but unnecessary ride that satisfyingly ends the franchise for the most part. It's not really anything you haven't seen but its fun and I do really appreciate that director Tim Miller of Deadpool brings back some much needed grit to the series missing since the first. Sexy Gabriel Luna's Rev 9 is an unstoppable, nightmarish killing machine.",Terminator - Dark Fate

104,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Enjoyable but flawed continuation of the Terminator Saga.,6,4 December 2019,"Terminator Dark Fate is the sixth Terminator movie: a sequel in a franchise that tries pretending the sequels after Terminator-2 never happened. Only this time Dark Fate is now purported to be the direct canonical follow-up to Judgement Day, and it's a journey that has a very strong sense of déjà-vu.This film is another passable offering but its close proximity within Genisys' release in 2015, discarding the events of the first two Terminators making them redundant and pointless for this film's story make Dark Fate a ham fisted reimagining of James Cameron's iconic franchise. It's a well-meaning but debilitating hodgepodge of ideas trying to make a long-standing franchise seem fresh again. The story here is trying to show a blurred line between humanity and machines; and for the most part it succeeds in conveying this, but it isn't a unique aspect to the Terminator method anymore; they already did the whole enhanced-human thing in the last two movies. So what's the point of this movie? I'm not entirely sure; it's really here to assert James Cameron's future ownership of the franchise.Terminator is a franchise that's become as iconic as Star Wars, James Bond, Batman, the MCU, and Alien. That's just naming a few franchises Terminator is comparable to, and I wish that the recent movies respected the legacy of the original two films. It's unfortunate that Dark Fate doesn't have that respect.Dark Fate's watchable, but when you're talking legacy sequels to legendary movies it's reasonable to expect something more... bold and expansive for the original work.",Terminator - Dark Fate
105,Prashast_Singh,A must watch on the big screen!,10,2 November 2019,"Terminator: Dark Fate is written so well that you won't even feel the need to take a break. It practically follows the same template as the previous movies, but also adds some more entertaining elements to the story. In my opinion, this one stands at par with the first two that changed the way people looked at action movies.Not a spoiler, but kind of an information that if you're watching it only for Arnie, you might have to be patient as his appearance takes quite a time. Rather, this film centers more around the three female characters, Sarah, Dani and Grace. The actresses have delivered strong performances, but the real surprise package is Mackenzie Davis who especially excels in the action sequences. It was truly delightful to watch Linda Hamilton with the same energy as she had in the second film.Arnold kind of underplays himself, but doesn't disappoint when it comes to delivering what he's best at: action.James Cameron's return with this film is evident right from the beginning: and I mean the very beginning, where you will end up sitting by the edge of your seat. The action scenes are exhilarating, and the visual effects are splendid. Editing is top notch as the film keeps moving without any boring moments.Terminator: Dark Fate is a worthy sequel to Terminator 2 and delivers all the action, effects and story one could wish for. A great popcorn action film, it will entertain you even if you see it in a dubbed language.",Terminator - Dark Fate
106,MiketheWhistle,just another sequel,5,12 July 2020,"This terminator sequel just didnt have the punch that others have had. it did have an interesting plot/new terminator and another I guess quasi-terminator, but it just didn't appeal. It definitely had more action sequences that were done with what I guess is cgi, but at times they seemed to drag on whereas in prior Ts they didn't seem to quite drag on in the same way.It's unfortunate as it introduced two new actresses to me and both seem really good so I hate that they were in this and it didn't deliver. Linda Hamilton has certainly aged, and far better than me, but bringing her back I'm not really sure that helped very much. Arnold also has aged, and far better than me, and he did much fewer action sequences.All in all it was simply not appealing.",Terminator - Dark Fate

108,muamba_eats_toast,It was okay when viewing it away from the thought of the originals,6,3 November 2019,It was reasonably entertaining without being particularly great. Quite tacky looking at times and some questionable acting. Arnie brought some presence and a few cheap laughs. The storyline frankly was pretty awful if you can claim there was one but most of the action was pretty neat and fast paced enough to keep your attention. I wouldn't rush to see it again and most likely never will but as a one off passes the time nicely.,Terminator - Dark Fate
109,saptesh786,Worst Sequel !,3,1 November 2019,"Either James Cameroon does not come up from Terminator hangover (which may not possible due to long gap) or he wants to re cash Terminator. Reason may be anything but this movie is nothing new. You feel that as you are watching Terminator 1 or 2 as corrupted sequel. Oldies were gold and were milestones. The new one is not. Firstly movie makes us confused to time period. At least I did not understand it very well that in which period we are seeing Dark Fate? Action sequences are barely two or three and they are neither thrilling nor interesting and lack of mind. Totally copied from old. Acting is just average. Linda's role is not well developed. She sometime looks dashing and in other time like helpless. It is unjustified role. Arnold is also looking helpless & tired. He did his best in Terminator 1 & 2. The climax feeling like a B grade movie. Overall this movie is just worst and not recommended to watch, especially for those who already seen old Terminators. Watch those oldies once again instead of such hopeless movie.",Terminator - Dark Fate
110,Richie-67-485852,DARK FATE IT IS,5,2 November 2019,"Where is Cameron's signature on this? His name means something is the rule. I found this to be lacking in creativity, script and leans toward being mediocre even when trying its best. I was willing to spend the money and give the benefit of the doubt to the series and go see this in the theater. I walked out before it was finished mainly because the movie repeats itself instead of breaking new ground. What is troubling is the reoccurring and over-used plot trick of having an opponent that is hard to kill. When first introduced in a previous first-time movie it was chilling and made one wonder how do you stop this thing? Now you want it to die already. Perhaps it would make a difference if I rooted for the machines? They come across as more exciting and they ""stick around"" if you know what I mean. Lets not get caught up in warm fuzzies instead of good story telling either. Seeing these two main actors age and then reunite may be good for them but for the viewer who wants to go to the movies instead of a high school reunion 50 years later it fails and does not deliver. Perhaps a cable viewing is more to the destiny of this release as a movie in the cinemas I don't think so. Fans will not be disappointed just movie buffs who like the whole meal and not just a sliver here or there.",Terminator - Dark Fate
111,reddiemurf81,"Well,,, uh,,, not bad",6,6 July 2020,"This movie is not bad. Not at all. It's not great by any means,, but it's not bad.I really liked the new Terminator Rev 9. That was the best part!! And props to Gabriel Luna!
He gave us a great Ghost Rider on Agents of Shield,, and now he got to be a cool Terminator.After that,,, it's pretty much just what we've seen before rehashed.I thought Genisys was a more enjoyable movie. I would put this one in the same category that I'd put Genisys,,, a different universe than the original trilogy and Terminator Salvation. Dark Fate and Genisys would work that way,, but only that way imo.While this one was fine, and while I thought Genisys was good,, from here on out I will only watch T1, T2, T3, and Salvation (and after that I'll make up my own ending in my head). I wish they'd made another one (or 2 preferably) with Bale as John Connor. Terminator Salvation was the kind of trilogy I was hoping for,,, oh well",Terminator - Dark Fate
112,hnt_dnl,Stop making these movies!,1,16 July 2020,"The original Terminator is to this day one of the greatest accomplishments in film history, a nightmarish and provocative film noir masterpiece. It holds up in the most important ways: great dialogue, strong acting, fluid action, iconic moments, neat special effects, exciting climax, powerful ending. And although many franchise fans believe T2 to be the best of the films, I personally do not. It's a good summer action flick, to be sure, but it doesn't have the tight focus of the original and drags and drags, plus the acting is nowhere near as great as the original. But at least it can be called a good movie. Unpopular opinion, but I believe T3 to be the second best film of the franchise with much better acting than T2, the best version of John Connor, and a really great ending. Salvation is awful, a movie filled with fashion model actors and Christian Bale carrying over his Batman growl from The Dark Knight. Unbelievably, Genisys is somehow even worse than Salvation, which I didn't think possible.And now that the history lesson has concluded to this movie TERMINATOR:DARK FATE. This film is apparently a retcon as it is a direct continuation of T2, thereby wiping away the events of T3, 4, and 5. The film opens with a new model of the T800 was sent from the future (how many ""last"" versions of this thing are there?) to kill John Connor, which it succeeds in doing. I must give the filmmaker props because the CGI versions of Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong were pretty spot on the way they looked in the 1991 film. I honestly thought this was actually a deleted scene. This is pretty much the ending of the good parts of this atrocious flick!First, for my money, Linda Hamilton should only be remembered for her iconic performance from the 1984 film and that's it, because that is the ONLY version of Sarah Connor worth rooting for. The puny, angry and POORLY ACTED one from the overrated '91 movie was just another James Cameron wet dream of a female badass, much like his annoying, amplified version of Ripley from Aliens. Excluding her 3 Terminator appearances, I realized recently the only other movie I even know her from is Dante's Peak. I feel like The Terminator was lightning-in-a-bottle for Hamilton and she's just a 1-hit wonder, because not only was her acting in T2 bordering on terrible, but she was just a nonstop joke/sarcasm machine in Dark Fate. The writers really went with the cliche crabby senior citizen dialogue for Sarah in this movie! Hamilton just has never been much of an actress.Next, to the great Arnold Schwarzenegger, who keeps coming back to these movies in thankless sidekick roles. I really do admire this actor, but after 35 years, it's time to move on from the iconic character he essayed in the '84 masterpiece because with each passing new sequel/reboot, he's diluting his legacy. Although I will say that in this movie, Arnie once again shows that he still has more screen presence in his robotic arm than most actors (and I'm including some that people THINK are great) in their entire body of work. The man can do humor like no other. I just wish he'd do it in something original and not what feels like the 100th Terminator film.Finally, to everyone else. So in this reboot, as John Connor is dead, that requires a new savior to humanity in the form of Dani Ramos (the lifeless Natalia Reyes), some random girl destined to be a freedom fighter to inspire future generations. In comes Grace (monotone Mackenzie Davis), some random super soldier from the future who is there to protect Dani so she can live up to her destiny, but Dani doesn't think she has what it takes (where have I heard that before?). Enter REV-9 (unimpressive Gabriel Luna), another random assassin from the future whose job it is to terminate Dani, not the mother of the future but the actual future. Wash, rinse, repeat. So Dani-Grace-Rev are our new Sarah-Kyle-T800 and we have the aged versions of Sarah and T800 in completely thankless roles to remind us that we are in fact in another Terminator film and this isn't some blatant ripoff of every Terminator film that's come before, even though it's replete with the same beats from all the prior movies.Throw in some ""fancy"" CGI, drab cinematography, boring action scenes and we get yet another watered down version of what used to be a great franchise.",Terminator - Dark Fate
113,fmarkland32,Backfire,4,24 July 2020,"Sarah Connor (A way past her prime Linda Hamilton) joins forces with a Universal Soldier, er I mean Grace (Mackenzie Davis) who is a Super Soldier type that must protect a new savior of the future from a new Terminator, meanwhile Schwarzenegger returns as Carl, an old Terminator there to help. The gimmick this time is that the bad Terminator can split in two and, you know what, who cares? To be fair this one is technically well made and better than Genisys, the first action sequence with the semi is actually not bad and then it just adheres to the Terminator formula with absolutely no deviation from that tiresome formula. The action sequences rip off the later Fast and The Furious movies, the need to get Grace drugs and to cool her was done better in Universal Soldier and the movie often doesn't go anywhere organically, as the characters seem to have to go to point A so they can fight the Terminator, the Terminator just happens to be garbed as a border patrol agent when they're detained at the border and Sarah just happens to know blank who can the bomb to kill the Terminator, despite being off the grid for years. This movie often feels like it wasn't storyboarded right and because of it, it never builds any momentum after the first reel. Again their choice to make the original movies redundant will frustrate fans, but more importantly none of the characters here come close to the love angle of the first one or the family angle of 2, or even the downbeat urgency of 3. That said, Davis is actually not bad,though in battle she is no Van Damme and as usual it's good to see Hamilton and Schwarzenegger, but in all seriousness this series is long overdue for termination.* * Out of 4-(Fair)",Terminator - Dark Fate
114,one9eighty,This plan of a high probability of success... apparently,7,22 September 2020,"Tim Miller, who previously directed ""Deadpool"", takes a seat in the director's chair for this next installment in the Terminator franchise which James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd created way back in 1984. The film brings a new concept to the audience because playing with time travel in the last films changed future events in canon, it also brings new fresh faces to mix too, as well as old faces that people will know from previous films. With lots of action and a high octane fast pace, this sci-fi adventure film could be a dividing film with fans; on one hand it might make up for some previously poorly received films in the franchise and on the other hand it might just alienate fans of the franchise even more.In a Nutshell - Murder robot sent from the future to kill somebody who will become important in the future when man is at war with machine. Also sent back is a guardian to protect the person who the murder-bot plans to kill. Chase ensues. Old characters return to help and spark nostalgia with fans.At 2hours and 8 minutes you are likely to create a butt-groove in your chair, and with a 15 rating you would be advised only watching this with older kids due to the action and violence involved. The question is, did I enjoy it?Well... yes, I did, perhaps it was driven in part by nostalgia as well as an enjoyment for the spectacle the film brought. It was a rip-roaring thrill ride from start to finish, there was lots of action, plenty of character development from the new guys, and having the old guys back was kind of like finding paper money that's fallen down the side of the sofa.My criticism is though that it felt like a bit of rehash for a new audience. It was not anything new. You know how Star Wars made ""The Force Awakens"" and it was basically just ""A New Hope"" again.... That is kind of what this film felt like in places. Rather than it being a sequel to T2, the concepts brought about in this film terminate the first two films, making them obsolete. ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" retells the events of the first two film with a slight spin on the original idea. Dani is the new John Connor. Legion is the new Cyberdyne. Grace is the new Kyle Reece and T-800 rolled into one - with sexing up Sarah obvs. Sarah Connor is, well, she remains Sarah Connor but just angrier and older. With some of the retcon that's attempted it also goes against what was detailed in the first two films - if Skynet was sending back multiple T-800's, what was the point of destroying the only CPU left over from the first film in T2? If the future has changed because Skynet was destroyed in the past, how are there T-800 units still around, I'm sure that by some paradox of time travel they wouldn't exist... in fact if Skynet was destroyed, would the first two films exist? But then how would Kyle Reece travel back in time to impregnate Sarah Connor, to birth John Connor, to stop Skynet from existing, negating the T-800, the T-1000.... Oh, it's not worth thinking about, it's a messy loop still and this film doesn't really help it.The definition of insanity is said as doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. After 28 years the franchise has not moved forward since 1991, and in Dark Fate it is doing a ""Force Awakens"" and retelling things for a new generation. It is fun, but ultimately there is no point. If you want to leave your brain at the door and just watch a sci-fi action adventure film then this is a good one for you. If you want to have your brain engaged or you are a fan of the originals, approach this with caution. I will probably watch this a few more times rather than just giving up completely, so on that basis I am giving this a 7. Better than ""Rise of the Machines"" and ""Genisys"", but it is not a patch on ""Judgement Day"" or the original. You may think, why 7? Well, this film can stand on its own two legs rather than be in dire need of the other films to support it. It fulfils it is brief as being an action-packed sci-fi adventure. It is nice to watch with decent scenes, effects, and cinematography.The negatives I have mentioned are my issue with being a fan of a franchise, and those should not detract from being able to impartially rate a film. ""Dark Fate"" might be for a generation that I am no longer part of, but I can not hold that against it - 7 it is.",Terminator - Dark Fate
115,educallejero,A Soul Mary Sue ruins a very good action movie,5,7 November 2019,"Well. ""Very good"" in like, action spectacle, because there is little to nothing new here, other than some new ways to use the powers of the new Terminator (logical, giving the upgrade in technology). This movie could've been easily an ""8 pts"" movie, barely worse than Terminator 2.It has great action, some strong and fun characters, with the absolutely crushing part from Arnold (the writers were absolutely stellar with him). Acting wise, I'm not sure if he was better in the 1992 sequel.
Linda Hamilton has aged, yeah, but she was badass as F.
The new girl, Mackenzie Davis was too, with a difficult character to nail. Passionate and yet a bit more ""machine like"" than normal people. Strong and fearless, but also vulnerable. Really great.
But...They surrounded them with one of the worst characters ever. I absolutely despise Natalia Reyes as Dani Ramos. Both, performance and character, but it is almost definitively a writing problem. She's a ""Soul Mary Sue"". She literally has no one bad trait. Not once in the entire film she does something ""bad"".She's kind, caring, lovable, hopeful, smart, strong, unselfish, forgiving, resourceful, passionate and rational.
It's insane. I really don't understand how professional writers could create a character that is borderline Jesus, and not play into the joke of making it. It is ridiculous. And ruins the movie, because she's at the centre of all.",Terminator - Dark Fate
116,phubbs,Terminator: Dark Fate,2,15 March 2020,"Now this has to be some kind of record right. Hollywood has actually tried to kickstart three trilogies with this franchise and every one has failed at the first hurdle. Three huge blockbuster attempts, three flops. 'Terminator Salvation' was probably the most original and better of the attempts, tank. 'Terminator Gen-I-sys' or however you pronounce it, über tank. And now finally 'Terminator: Dark Fate', a woke tank. Seriously that's an impressive record of right there Hollywood.So you see my use of the word woke just now, well it's kinda justified. No I'm not trying to just on any bandwagons here but come on, look at the evidence here. What we essentially have is James Cameron's T2 remade and genderswapped. The plot is exactly the flippin' same for Pete's sake! The main difference here is they have killed off John Connor only to replace him with a young female minority version. As said, the rest is the same as before with a new Terminator coming back from the future to try and eliminate its target. Wash, rinse, and repeat, again.Oh Jesus where to begin?!So they killed off John straight away, right off the bat they render everything that has come before pointless, obsolete. The funny thing is Hollywood pulled the same with other franchises like 'Star Wars', 'Predator', 'Alien' etc...You know, making ridiculous decisions with the story in newer sequels that render everything before it null and void. They never learn.The new Terminator isn't threatening...at all! Now I understand the notion of having a regular looking guy as a Terminator because a Terminator is supposed to be an infiltration unit for assassination purposes, cool. And personally I LOVED the original casting idea of Lance Henriksen as the Terminator in the original 1984 movie because of his unique appearance (using Schwarzenegger always seemed like the cheesy option to me). But this guy (Gabriel Luna) has no presence or visual appeal at all. The man literally looks like a generic clothes catalog model. Sure you could say that is perfect for a Terminator but at the same time you need something of interest for the audience, the actor needs to have an interesting face. It's a hard line to walk granted but this choice was poor.Speaking of casting choices, the entire cast was wrong in my opinion. Natalia Reyes as Dani (the new John Connor) was not only terrible acting-wise but completely unbelievable as the new future of the human race mainly down to her height and size. She couldn't even hold an assault weapon believably for Christ's sake. Then we had the character of Grace (Grace?) played by MacKenzie Davis sporting some tomboy haircut (anyone notice she had the same haircut as a child in a flashback sequence?). Clearly this character was part of the neo trendy transgender obsession as she was obviously supposed to be androgynous. Grace was the Kyle Reese character genderswapped but better because she was augmented with technology that enabled her to do fancy pointless flips and such (eye-roll much?).And then we have Arnie and Linda. I facepalmed so hard at the thought of Schwarzenegger returning yet again as a Terminator. I mean come on people!! This guy is too old! It's just embarrassing now. The fact they still used that stupid idea of aging flesh from the previous flop was laughable. The fact they used the whole notion of Arnie's Terminator learning human emotions to the point that it becomes a good character, marries AND is self-employed selling curtains were both  absurd and laughable. How the hell does it marry and not have the female discover its a robot?? As for Linda Hamilton, this was clearly to try and get the older fanbase back on-board as Arnie wasn't working anymore. They pulled a pathetic Disney/Star Wars move. Both are too old and both looked ridiculous.The Terminator had a stupid design. This time the hook is it can separate into two Terminators. One is the metal skeleton whilst the other is the liquid metal skin. They can part at any time which seemed like a reasonably lengthy process that rendered the whole thing pointless to me. Also, why not just send two Terminators? Oh yeah and Skynet no longer exists of course, its called 'Legion' now. Another pointless move because not only does this render everything prior obsolete, it also surely means the threat from the machines will never end...right? One super machine will just replace another so there is no real tension anymore.The special effects are poor. How can a movie of this size and cost have poor effects? Overuse of CGI as per usual. But yeah the effects are generally bad and obvious. There are multiple scenes with horrendously obvious greenscreen effects. The action sequences use horrendously obvious ragdoll effects on characters when they are being flung around. And, as expected, some sequences are way way overblown with completely unnecessary set-pieces such as the mid-air plane collision. I mean really? Did..did you really need to have a jumbo jet action sequence here? Did we really need the Humvee sequence? This franchise is supposed to be an adult horror thriller, not a superhero movie. All this does is prove to me once again that Hollywood (and even Cameron) doesn't understand these old franchises anymore.This pretty much sums up my whole opinion of Hollywood and how they approach movies these days. They just don't understand old franchises anymore, classic or otherwise. They can't come up with any original material anymore, everything has to be remade or rebooted. They think everything needs (biased) political commentary, not even subtle but obvious in your face political commentary. They keep gender or race-swapping key characters to appease specific groups. And, apparently, they think everything needs to be like a Marvel movie now. This entire movie felt like some fan-made Latino version of the franchise, literally taking bits from the first two movies and remaking them, including the ending! One word, abysmal.2/10",Terminator - Dark Fate
117,rockman182,Terminator: Dark Fate(2019),7,4 November 2019,"I think Terminator 2: Judgment Day is a perennial title in my top ten (maybe even top five) films of all time. The film serves a great nostalgic purpose from my childhood and is also one of the greatest action movies of all time. The series from there has been hit or miss. I appreciated the following two entries because I'm a fan of the first two films but Genisys was undoubtedly abysmal. Having the director of Deadpool and James Cameron in a more expansive role was reason enough to get me interested. I had a good time with this, and its easily better than anything after T2.The film starts off in Mexico City where a Terminator from the future aims to kill a young woman. It just so happens that an ""enhanced"" soldier has also traveled to ensure that the Terminator's plan does not come to fruition. They soon run into Sarah Connor, a woman who encountered the first Terminator and the mother of future resistance leader John Connor. The group must try to escape this new model of Terminator Rev-9, a killing machine like no other. This film marks the return of Linda Hamilton to the series and also is her onscreen reunion with Arnold Schwarzenegger.The film may tread grounds very familiar to the first but I thought it did a good job in delivery. The action is ever present, and at extreme intensity, which was nice to see in IMAX. The plot doesn't have much going for it, however the nostalgic factor of seeing Hamilton and Schwarzenegger together is quite a site. Linda Hamilton is pretty great in this and really a badass. Don't think the relationship Mackenzie Davis' and Natalie Reyes' character was as deep or felt as it should have been. I also think the pivotal opening scene with de-aging was done quite well. The wonders of technology these days.This is definitely the best of the bunch that came after T2. I think having Hamilton return was a big part of that. Much like how Halloween (2018) was able to succeed by retconning everything after the first film, Terminator benefits from eliminating the last three films entirely. I know people will have problems with this film and justifiably so. I was pleasantly surprised and at my minimum standards of being better than the last three films was met.7/10",Terminator - Dark Fate

119,jon.h.ochiai,"Choice in ""Dark Fate""",8,4 November 2019,"In ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" enhanced, mostly machine super-soldier from the year 2042, Grace, played by Mackenzie Davis, stridently protects young Dani, played by innocent strong Natalia Reyes, from advanced liquid metal Terminator Rev-9, played by relentless Gabriel Luna, also from the future, sent to terminate her. Now older Sarah Connor, played by Linda Hamilton - reprising her original character, returns as the maternal Hero.Sarah is the Mother of John Connor, who becomes the savior of the Human race in the future war against the Machines controlled by the sentient A.I. gone horribly amok - Skynet. In James Cameron's 1991 ""Terminator: Judgement Day"", Sarah altered that possible future. That Judgement Day never happened. Or did it?Director Tim Miller's ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" reboot of the franchise suggests that the sins of the future may have come back to haunt the present. His occasionally distracted narrative, unexpectedly explores the nature of fate. Although at times dominated by digital visual effects and pulse pounding action, in the end Tim displays unquestionable heart.The screenplay by David S. Goyer, Justin Rhodes, and Billy Ray takes place 22 years after ""Judgement Day"" 1997, which was apparently averted in that narrative. Tim Miller, who also directed ""Deadpool"", has dismissed the numerous sequels following ""Terminator 2"". That's actually a blessing. Just saying.Linda's Sarah is the grizzled warrior renegade bent on killing all the Terminators sent from the future. Sarah's personal war is one of vengeance, after suffering heartbreaking tragedy. Linda embodies world weary strength and sadness that makes ""Dark Fate"" poignant. Her forced allegiance with aged, white bearded Terminator T-800, reprised by Arnold Schwarzenegger, who goes by Carl, the drapery man, is strange cinematic karma. Humorless, singular Sarah warns Carl, when this is all over, ""I'm gonna kill you.""Fortunately, amidst this literal tipping point in the end of humanity, adrenaline fueled chases, and brutal battles, Tim Miller displays a welcome sense of humor, be it Carl describing the irresponsible drapery decisions of one of his customers. Carl has done his best to become human, since his Terminator mission completed. He may have found purpose in life. Arnold reflects an eloquent wisdom. In a way, ""Dark Fate"" is surprisingly about finding one's purpose.Mackenzie Davis is Director Tim's charismatic force as Grace, protector of Dani and the future of the known world. Mackenzie literally towers over Linda and Natalia in their scenes together. Not just physically, she commands the calm powerful presence. Mackenzie is a star. And she's the total badass.Her Grace holds out her hand to Dani, ""Come with me or you'll be dead in 30 seconds."" Reminiscent of Arnold in ""Terminator 2"". Then in the ensuing visceral fight scene, Grace choke-slams Rev-9 to the floor. Boom.Sitting in the back of a pick-up truck, Grace gently touches Dani, who's asleep on her lap. Linda's Sarah looks on thoughtfully. This is more than just some military operation. Mackenzie is surprising nuance. Her humanity in concert with Linda's innate gravitas elevate ""Dark Fate"".At the narrative arc of ""Dark Fate"", humanized Terminator Carl asks, ""Sarah, do your believe in fate?"" Sarah's choices in the past had determined and guided the unknown future, not preordained. So do you believe in fate?Maybe, we all do our best: Making our best choices possible in who we are going to be, what we are going to do. Perhaps, that's what Tim, Mackenzie, Linda, and Arnold are asking us to look at: Who do we choose to be? Fate may well be. Yet, choice matters. That being said, take a chance on ""Terminator: Dark Fate"". Then choose for yourself.",Terminator - Dark Fate
120,Benjamin-M-Weilert,The closest we'll come to Judgment Day closure.,7,14 March 2020,"I'll admit that Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) was a difficult movie to follow. Basically the perfect sequel, this film is generally what we associate with the Terminator franchise. From its plethora of meme-able moments to its fantastic action and visual effects, Terminator 2 set a high bar for any film in the franchise to follow it. While Terminator: Rise of the Machines (2003) tried to tie up the first three movies into a neat little trilogy, most felt unsatisfied with its ending. This is why, almost 20 years after Terminator 2 released, we're still trying to find that satisfying bit of closure.Compared to its predecessors, Terminator: Dark Fate (2019) certainly came the closest to achieving this closure. After all, we've seen the effects of time travel in the future with Terminator: Salvation (2009) and an alternate reality with Terminator: Genisys (2015). As a direct sequel to Terminator 2, Dark Fate has all the required accouterments of a Terminator movie, including fantastic action set pieces, un-killable antagonists, and a ""fast and loose"" interpretation of time and the future. Plus, as seems to be the case with every iteration of this franchise, Dark Fate updated the technological apocalypse to be more in-line with what we'd expect based on the technology we currently have at our disposal.Unfortunately, while Dark Fate is an excellent film in the franchise, it felt a bit like it was making a movie based on a checklist. Re-using memorable lines? Check. Older versions of classic characters? Check. New, advanced Terminator technology? Check. I will give this movie some props for nailing the Bechtel Test, though. Of course, the end of the world isn't the time to be thinking about romantic relationships with men, so these ladies certainly had their priorities straight. Additionally, moving the rating of this film back up to R felt like the right choice based on the franchise's origins and likely helped make some of its flashier fight sequences that much better.The closest we'll come to Judgment Day closure, I give Terminator: Dark Fate 3.5 stars out of 5.",Terminator - Dark Fate
121,RforFilm,"Though better then Genisys, Terminator: Dark Fate repeats a lot and seems to create more questions then answers",5,4 November 2019,"In the future, John Conner leads the resistance in the war against machines and Skynet....wait a minute, this is not the story your getting. And yet, we've got another Terminator movie out. Terminator has to be a story that filmmakers keep trying to revive despite never being able to reach the marks of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. A lot of it has to do with James Cameron having made the first two movies and declined to get involved in the various sequels and TV series (for those that remember Terminator: The Sarah Conner Chronicles). It's clear he's never envisioned it as something to make into a franchise.But I also don't blame the studios for trying to make it into a franchise. After all, with the success of other movie universes like Marvel, Star Wars, The Fast and the Furious and even The Conjuring, it's possible that a great movie could evolve into something bigger. But what keeps setting this back is that there's been a large time gap since the second movie. With James Cameron back executive producing, there is hope that his storytelling can bring something new into the series, right? Let's see what Terminator: Dark Fate has to offer.Sometime after the events of T2, an unknown future awaits after John Conner (played by Edward Furlong) is killed by a previously unknown T-800. We also cut to Mexico where a young woman Dani (played by Natalia Reyes) and her brother dream of a better life. At the factory where they work, a new kind of terminator sent from the future, a Rev-9 (played by Gabriel Luna), that attacks and targets the woman. She's saved by a solider also sent from the future, Grace (played by Mackenzie Davis), whose been enhanced with machine-like capabilities despite being human.They escape the factory and the Rev-9 chases, showing off his power of being able to transform into two terminators. Just as their cornered, Sarah Conner (played by Linda Hamilton) stops him and help the group escape. Sarah learns from Grace that in the new timeline, Skynet may have not started the new war, but another machine called Legion does. Given how terminators are still being sent back, they assume Dani has something to do with that. The race is on to get across the boarder, meet up with an ageing terminator T-900 (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger), and fight for the new future created.I'll say this right off the back; Terminator Dark Fate is better then Terminator Genisys, but not by a lot. On it's own, its an entertaining action movie that should probably do fine with people. As a sequel to The Terminator, it's a mess that only made more problems. I'll get the positives out of the way; the acting is good all around. The newcomers like Mackenzie Davis and Gabriel Luna are good along side Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton (it's nice to see her back after a while). And the action...for the first forty-five minutes is fun with the factory fight and the first car chase.So where does it go wrong? It's story. It's clear from the beginning that now their taking John Conner out of the equation, it wants to do something different. The problem is that what it replace with, not only does it add nothing (if Legion just starts that same war that Skynet started, then why change it at all?) but it creates more questions;
If Skynet is no longer a thing, why do similar Terminators still exist?
If more terminators were sent back, why was this never addressed in T2?
If they knew who created Skynet in T2 and stopped it, why not stop Legion as well? Are there other leaders of the resistance?
Why don't they send more protectors?
Why don't they send back more terminators?
You see why this series is starting to make less sense?My other issue with Dark Fate is that despite being a direct sequel to T2, the stakes of the story seem very low considering that since John Conner's death meant nothing. If this young woman is killed, couldn't another leader rise up? Plus even with questions out of the way, the premise of stopping the terminator seems like a step back. It may be a simpler storyline, but it's also a rehash.I'll give this five T-800s out of ten. I'm only so harsh on this as T2 is not only James Cameron's best movie, but it's considered one of the greatest action movies of all time. So if your going to follow up and try again to revive the series, there had better be something of sequel strength. On it's own, it's only a passable action movie, but Dark Fate may be a true title as the fate of Terminator is not looking bright.",Terminator - Dark Fate
122,petra_ste,Why the Terminator series is done,5,3 November 2019,"I'll be honest, Dark Fate is more mediocre than unwatchable, probably the best Terminator since T2... yeah, I know, the bar is so low, it's like limbo dancing at this point. This feels similar to The Force Awakens: in itself a slick, decent movie, but I've already watched the much better original, so thanks but no thanks.Positives? Mackenzie Davis, for whom I've had a hopeless crush since seeing her as a cute NASA geek in The Martian (and then again in Blade Runner 2049), plays a relatable, compelling character, with an intriguing mix of power and vulnerability. There are also a couple of neat set-pieces, especially in the first half, before everything becomes over-the-top tiresome.Linda Hamilton and Arnold show up for fanservice. It's kind of nice to see them both back with significant roles but, as is typical of fanservice, it's like gorging on too much chocolate: tastes good at first, but then come nausea and a vague feeling of shame.My main point is, the Terminator series is now hopeless, as the last movies, especially Genisys, have poisoned the well. The continuity is a mess and keeps being rebooted, so everything is pointless: no development can feel meaningful. Show of hands: who would be particularly surprised if the next Terminator movie was once again about John Connor leading the Resistance in another alternate continuity? No one? Thought so.Also, the new villain being so talkative was possibly the single stupidest idea in the whole project. You know why Arnold in T1 and Robert Patrick in T2 were so terrifying? Because they shut up! They said very little and, the few times they spoke, it always felt like something they did out of pure necessity (probing for informations, setting up a trap) but was fundamentally alien to their nature.This Rev-9 tries to talk its antagonists out of fighting him! Can anyone picture the T-1000 reasoning with its targets? The great Robert Patrick studied and imitated the body language of birds of prey to look creepier and inhuman, and the new bad guy wants to chat. Give me a break.5/10",Terminator - Dark Fate
123,nadkarnisumeet,We Are Back!!,7,2 November 2019,"Terminator: Dark Fate review :With James Cameron back as a co -writer and producer, Terminator franchise finally gets an instalment which can stand up to the pathbreaking first part (1984) and the difficult to beat 'Judgement Day' (1991). A much needed return to form for the franchise after the underwhelming response to the last three Terminator films.Positioned as a direct sequel to 'Judgement Day', watching Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton in one frame offers solid nostalgia to the franchise fans, specially 90s kids like me who grew up on first two parts. Linda reprises her iconic role of Sarah Connor while Arnie is T-800 now called Carl who has settled for a blissful family life. Haha!An aging Sarah and her nemesis Carl unite to protect youngster Dani (Natalia Reyes, impressive) who is the latest target of Legion (the AI replacing Skynet after judgement day was averted). A super advanced Rev-9 (Gabriel Luna) is sent in time for her termination while an augmented human Grace (Mackenzie Davis) is the protector.The stage is set for some extraordinary action sequences with jaw dropping VFX. Technically, this is the second best Terminator film ever made. After Judgement Day ofcourse. However Dark Fate lacks the style and emotional touch of Cameron directed Terminators.Nevertheless, it is still worth a trip to the cinemas. Just for watching Hamilton and Schwarzenegger pump bullets once again..and yup, dont miss a young Edward Furlong in the opening scene!Regards,

124,bankofmarquis,Good Enough Conclusion to the Franchise,7,6 November 2019,"After a few attempts at resurrecting this franchise, James Cameron has (wisely) decided to bury the franchise with one last TERMINATOR film starring the original Terminator himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger. TERMINATOR: DARK FATE is a direct sequel to T2: JUDGEMENT DAY (or so says Producer/Writer Cameron) as it ignores the 3rd and 4th movies in this series (as well as the television show THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES).And that is a wise move as it simplifies things and just lets us get on to what a Terminator movie does best - fantastic action sequences, state of the art CGI, a killer robot that will stop at nothing to accomplish it's mission, and a plucky hero or 2 to battle said killer robot.Oh...did I mention that they recruit a Terminator to help them stop the Terminator?And it all works well...enough. Set in this year (2019), TERMINATOR: DARK FATE tells the tale of what happens next after Sarah and John Connor stopped Judgement Day in the 2nd Terminator film. A deadly - even more dangerous - Terminator (version 9!) returns to 2019 to kill a single woman (Natalie Reyes). This time she is helped by an augmented human from the future (Mackenzie Davis) and...Sarah Connor! Returning to this film, all buffed up and aging, is a craggy voiced Linda Hamilton as Sarah, who brings an adequate amount of world-weary, ""been there, done that"" attitude to the proceedings that pretty much carry the first half of the film.And...just as the film was beginning to sag in the middle, along comes Arnold.Playing an aging Terminator (which is explained, well enough, in the plot), Arnold plays the Terminator (who has been living with humans for over 20 years) with a wink in his eye and a sense of humor about him. Yep...this is a Terminator with a funny bone. And - I'll be darned - it works! Thanks to the performance of Mr. Schwarzenegger. He knows exactly what kind of film he is in and brings the right amount of energy, muscle and humor to the proceedings. He pretty much carries this film on his broad shoulders for the 2nd half - and he carries it with ease.Credit Director Tim Miller (DEADPOOL) for keeping things light, simple and moving along crisply. He, too, understands the type of film he is making (and the audience that will go see this type of film) so he keeps the dialogue light and snappy, the plot at it's simplest and the action as high as he can go - blowing things up at a moment's notice. It's not sublte art by any stretch of the imagination, but it is art - in a way - and art that he does well.If this is the last Terminator film (and I hope it is), then it is going out on a high (enough) note. I was surprisingly entertained (and not preached to) and, I think that is all I could have hoped for in a Terminator flick.Letter Grade: B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Terminator - Dark Fate

126,fernandoschiavi,"""Dark Fate"" ends up falling into the same traps as the previous sequences, in a mixture of thematic setback, change of scenery and reboot",7,24 May 2020,"In 2015, ""Genesis"" was planned to be a reboot of the series with the aim of launching a new trilogy, but the confusing timeline of the would have helped the film to have a bad reception by critics and audiences. Two years later, it was announced that James Cameron, creator and director of T1 and T2, would retake the rights to the franchise, and he announced that he was interested in producing a new chapter in the franchise, with Tim Miller, from Deadpool, in the direction. This new chapter would follow the story of where T2 left off, ignoring all films released after ""The Final Judgment"", including the television series ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (2008-2009)"". It was then confirmed that Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger would reprise their roles as Sarah Connor and the Terminator, respectively, with Mackenzie Davis, Natalia Reyes and Gabriel Luna making their debut in the franchise.The human Grace (Mackenzie Davis), endowed with cyber improvements, is sent to the past to protect Dani (Natalia Reyes), a girl who will have a fundamental role in the resistance against the machines and, therefore, becomes the target of an advanced exterminator model., the Rev-9 (Gabriel Luna). In one of their encounters with the robot, they are saved by Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), who from then on joins the duo on their survival mission.Since the rights to the ""Terminator"" franchise came out of the hand of his father James Cameron, there have been several attempts to continue the story and a certain consensus that none of them were convincing. In ""Dark Fate"", the creator's presence in this sense is clear both in the perception of accommodation at the base of the story and in the way it reshapes, considering the current ""girl power"" context that only arose a lot because of what was done with Sarah Connor before. The script is right to seek in the past the motivations for the future of the franchise, seeing the opportunity to pass the baton without necessarily extinguishing everything that was previously conceptualized. Linda Hamilton is back in the franchise, even stronger and steeped in a mixed spirit of vengeance and bitterness to ease the suffering at the loss of her son shortly after the events of ""The Final Judgment"". Hamilton's charisma is impressive.Schwarzenegger is again at ease in the shoes of the T-800 and continues to show charisma and humorous timing. The great highlight, however, is for Davis, who exudes resourcefulness in physical shots and dramatic talent in emotional moments. Grace and Dani mirror a lot in the two old versions of Sarah Connor, the most vulnerable and ""nobody"" of the first film and the super badass protective mother of the second - with the addendum to taking Marcus Wright's concept of human cyborgs in Salvation. To resume Sarah Connor as the great heroine in the new film of the franchise is a great success, but, although Grace is a very interesting character, it is precisely the suitor Sarah Connor's suitor that leaves something to be desired: Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) doesn't even have the chance to demonstrate if he was a character up to the franchise, because the script itself takes away all potentials: his dialogues are almost laughable, his motivations are poorly founded and even his personality didn't seem well built, sounding much more like an objective for the characters around him than a true symbol of resistance. Gabriel Luna (Matador) incorporates a robotic spirit to incorporate the new villain, but it is nothing remarkable, just convincing.However, there are clear flaws that result from a problematic script, which, in this case, went through several treatments and continued to be worked on with the filming in progress. The central plot starts from a premise that, without the necessary deepening, ends up depreciating the events of the first two films. The subplot involving Sarah and the T-800, on the other hand, revolves around a controversial event that occurs right at the beginning and a fragile concept presented later - if the viewer does not buy just one of them, this entire nucleus ends up harmed. ""Terminator: Dark fate"" does not complicate and creates a story that unfolds like a tremendous action sequence, with few pauses for reflections and explanations (sometimes unnecessary).The idea is great and the new adventure starts using images shot at the time of the second feature film. Right after that, using the technology we have available today, comes the most impressive scene: the reunion of Sarah Connor, teenager John Connor and the T-800, recreated by computer graphics so that the stuntmen could lend their bodies and movements to recreate the visuals from Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong and Arnold Schwarzenegger from 1991! What happens on the scene changes the future as we knew it, thus creating a new timeline, without Skynet, but with other problems for Sarah Connor.
There is an intense struggle between humanity and artificial intelligences that will emerge in the future and, apparently, the central issue of humans is not with the machine itself, but with the maintenance of what makes us human. In this context, the character Grace is an excellent little explored symbol: the improvement of the human body through technology does not bring us closer to machines and it is possible to lose humanity even though it is completely human. On the other hand, a machine, the T-800 or Carl (Schwarzenegger), as it is now known, seems to acquire humanity through feelings. There is a great deal of depth in these matters, but the option for a shallower script deprives the viewer of a much more memorable and meaningful film.By far, Tim Miller was the one who best managed to recreate the sense of urgency of the indestructible threat that is always on the glue of survivors. The plot runs like an efficient chase thriller in tune with the typical features of the entire franchise. In the best style of ""Deadpool"" - his previous work - the first sequence in the factory where the brothers Dani and Diego work and then on the highway is of great prominence, perhaps standing up to the best of the second film, playing the spectator in the adrenaline of the chase done mostly with practical effects, reusing that sense of verisimilitude so characteristic of the previous ones. There are no free sequences, each is moved by the plot. But the film features striking sequences, such as the collision inside a burning cargo plane, which abuses the laws of physics and turns all characters, even human ones, into superheroes capable of surviving any explosion or fall. It is not a bad action sequence, but one that clashes with the rest and tires, just as the final battle falls entirely on exaggeration, with a dull excess of CGI. With the arrogance of doing something more grand in the final act, the feeling that something bad can happen to the characters is lost slightly, even if the goodbye atmosphere keeps it on the alert. However, despite some exaggerations, Miller is able to sustain and ferment the drama towards the end, extracting tension from the friction between the cast members and still configuring the diverse situations that the characters go through with attention to their geopolitical context.The union of the talents of James Cameron and Tim Miller, that is, technology and direction of action scenes is the best thing about ""Dark Fate"". From the recreation of the young bodies of the T-800 and Sarah and John Connor to the action scenes, which mix digital and practical effects, it's all a great action show that honors the franchise. Dark fate ends up falling into the same traps as the previous sequences, in a mixture of thematic setback, change of scenery and reboot. The feature may even bear the canonical seal conferred by the original director, however, in practice there is not much that differentiates it from the so-called ""alternative timelines"". They are different pieces in the same chess game. Our heroes save us from mechanical oppressors, someone returns, and everything repeats itself. ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" brings everything fans of the franchise already know: killer robots, Schwarzenegger in action scenes, chases and explosions. Other than that, there isn't much left.Miller recognizes the worn ends of the previous ones and embraces the new presented future that did not happen in the way predicted in 1984, but that borders on the same ""dark fate"" in the face of so many technological advances superimposed on social tours. Tim Miller leaves his mark of identity, pinning the American government, machismo and arms policy on time in an efficient and ironic mood, which raises the flag already on the premise of having a common Mexican like the one pursued by the future, and the reasons for being it only reinforces how the director with Cameron managed to position the franchise today. After the two hours of film, what remains is much more the return of Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger than anything else (although Grace deserves to survive in everyone's memory). It remains for us to wait for writers and directors who are able to rekindle the flame of the first two films. Although it has the production of James Cameron, most likely The Terminator: Dark Fate will be remembered with the same feeling of mission not accomplished as other attempts to update the franchise.",Terminator - Dark Fate

128,markthomassintek,Action all the way through,9,23 October 2019,"REVIEW - TERMINATOR DARK FATERumours were rife during the year surrounding this film, which forgets all of the previous questionable Terminator films which came after Terminator 2.
The rumours were simply that they had to reshoot the 3rd part of the film because of poor audience feedback from test showings.Basically this is meant to be the proper sequel to Terminator 2 but it is a whole lot more.James Cameron who made Terminator 1 and 2 is back in the driving seat for this and it shows.I've hinted that this film is more than just a sequel and it is, its a reboot, virtual re telling sequel and amazingly it works very well.In fact James Cameron has said that if public reaction is good for this film this is the start of a trilogy and as with Terminator 2 I can see where they will go next.Action all the way through and personally I loved the re telling but using a different story leading to the same outcome.Well worth getting a ticket and watching especially for the John Connor! (no spoilers) wow!Better than many of the sequels and personally I thought on a part with Terminator 1 and 2.Rating 9 out of 10",Terminator - Dark Fate
129,allanmichael30,Jon connor replaced with mexican immigrant,1,19 September 2020,"It way too politically correct and lacks any hope of ever seeing a true terminator 2 sequel as this film claimed to be. They keep churning out movies promising to be a true follow up to T2 but just fall flat. There not sure if Arnold's terminator should be good or bad guy. The funny thing is that they thought we need to kill furlong (jon connor as its stopping story from moving on and then bring back liquid metal man. The acting is quite bad and story so difficult to follow they kind of paused mid movie to give a background of plot points. It does not explain how all components destroyed so judgement days no more, but yet Terminator still alive and kills Jon, probably going to need to watch again but just did not enjoy watching it first time round. I want to see judgement as it happened in movie like build up to jon connor going back and a full out terminator war.",Terminator - Dark Fate
130,redrobin62-321-207311,"At This Point It's Fair To Say ""No More Terminator Movies!""",6,22 January 2020,"You know, it's a shame. For a movie that cost $150M to make, you'd think it'd be worth the 2+ hours spent in the seat in front of the screen. It's not. ""Dark Fate"" is only to be seen, if you're like me, a completionist. Is it worth your while? No really. Netflix and other studios churn out soulless movies like these every week or so. Of course, since it made its money back (and then some), I expect T5 in the works pretty soon. Probably as I speak, James Cameron is preparing it. I wouldn't be surprised.",Terminator - Dark Fate
131,abisio,Solid follow up to Terminator 2,9,3 November 2019,"Dark Fate is perhaps the best Terminator movie this side of T2.
All other movies were bland and never really propose anything interesting. Aside from Arnold, all other characters were uninteresting and far from charismatic.
Producer (and original creator) James Cameron has created a new female driven terminator and like it or not the movie works.
With a few impressive action scenes on the beginning then movie change to getaway mode but Cameron decides to light touch some social issues like immigration concentration camps giving the movie one of the most interesting sub stories.
As a female driven movie, action is not all and some melodramatic moments came up but Linda Hamilton and Natalia Reyes are able to manage them solidly.
Mackenzie Davies does what she can but not on par of the other two; however her physical skills are superb and is quite believable as an action star.
Gabriel Luna as the new terminator is a great surprise (as it was Robert Patrick in T2). Without very few words he gave some kind of sympathetic menacing to ultra violent and absolutely brutal new model.
As Arnold as the legacy terminator. Well he is THE TERMINATOR he deliver some very funny lines and one in particular we have to remember ""I WONT BE BACK""In brief pure entertainment that does not disappoint",Terminator - Dark Fate
132,bob-the-movie-man,Enjoyable hocum.,7,10 November 2019,"Natalia Reyes plays young Mexican Dani Ramos. Out of the blue she faces danger and tragedy when a 'Rev 9' Terminator (Gabriel Luna) zaps itself back in time to Mexico City to dispose of her. But, as in ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"", a protector is on hand. This time it's in the ripped form of 'enhanced' human Grace (Mackenzie Davis). She's there to protect Dani and maintain whatever key to the future that she holds.Dani is assisted by Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), a vigilante Terminator-fighter wanted in all 50 US States for wanton destruction of property. But even this dynamic duo are no match for the unstoppable force of the Rev 9. So they must turn to an old nemesis from Sarah's past for assistance.James Cameron is heavily involved with this one. The decision was made to 'reboot' the series as if all the dodgy Terminator movies of the intervening years (after #2) had never happened. (That's not to say that *I* necessarily found them all dodgy. I quite liked ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" for example, with it's grim and downbeat ending).Now I went into this flick understanding that premise. So a flashback scene in the first few minutes of the film left me mightily confused. How on earth did this link to the 'thumbs up' scene at the end of ""Terminator 2""? #baffled.But if you ignore this issue, the film settles into what I thought was a nice ""Logan""-style modus operandi. There's an exciting chase sequence along a Mexican highway, but it never overwhelmed the ongoing development of character and motive.Unfortunately, this didn't last. Overall, the script lacked momentum, showing a general lack of narrative drive. This is the result, I suspect, of the familiar malaise of 'team-input'. There are a total of SIX writers contributing to the story and/or screenplay. For example, an opportunity to take a poke at Trump's Mexican wall isn't taken; neither are scenes in the topically newsworthy detention centre. It's as if the ""better not: we'll upset people"" button was pressed in either the writing room or by the studio.Trying to make up for this wallowing second reel, the movie - on boarding a military transport plane - goes to extremes of unbelievable action, both in the sky and below the water. That ""Logan-esque"" start seems a long way away now.There's another element of the movie that confused the hell out of me. The 'Rev 9' is able to jump out of it's ""skeleton"" which could then pursue actions on its own. Given the Terminator gets FLATTENED - skeleton and all - during certain scenes of the film, this makes little sense unless the skeleton is made of the same 'liquid metal' as the body. In which case, why not just have liquid metal that can assume multiple different forms and attack the target from all sides? Perhaps that came in with the ""Rev 10""!But it's not as bad as I've made it sound. This is in no way a terrible movie. As a 'brain at the door' piece of sci-fi hocum I really quite enjoyed it. The cast in particular is nicely of our time. There's a Colombian (not Mexican), feisty and successful female lead in the form of the relatively unknown Reyes. And she has two strong female characters in support. Arnie Schwarzenegger has top billing, but his is really a supporting role.Natalia Reyes I thought was particularly impressive. The girl has real screen presence, and I look forward to seeing what she does next.Mackenzie Davis is also terrific as the kick-ass cyborg. I particularly liked the way she executed a neat plot device. Grace has a 'war-machine' design... she's designed for incredible bursts of activity over short periods, but then becomes next to useless as her body crashes and needs 'rebooting'.I don't want to be mean, but there's probably a reason Linda Hamilton hasn't been in more mainstream movies since T2. Her acting here is adequate at best and didn't really cut it for me. The script has delivered her a number of humorous lines - including the iconic ""I'll be back' - but none of them really land in the delivery.Instead , it's Arnie who has the best lines in the movie, delivered with dead-pan wit. His ""cover"" identity - and particularly his chosen profession - deliver some laugh out loud dialogue.All in all, I found this a big step up on other Terminator films in the series. The director is Tim Miller, he of ""Deadpool"". It's not bloody Shakespeare, but I found it - warts and all - an enjoyable night out at the movies.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

133,AngelHonesty,Please end this franchise,4,23 February 2020,"Bigger is not better. The reason Terminator part one and two were so good, is that the story was simple. A machine trying to kill a person. It was down to earth and felt real. They had witty lines and great acting. The New terminator movie, Dark Fate is absolutely garbage compared to the original. The bad guys are un reasonably hard to kill. The entire movie is basically CGI and it looks awful. Theres way to many long drawn out fighting scenes that are useless, becuase the new terminator is impossible to kill. There are all these big filler scenes that make everything completely unrealistic and just bore you to death. On top of that, there's no original story to it. They've taken the same story and twisted it a little making it beyond predictable and boring. Theres no heart to this film or self discovery of a great character. Please, stop making terminator movies, your rubbing the name through the dirt.",Terminator - Dark Fate
134,pietclausen,Not the Terminator we were promised,5,15 January 2020,"James Cameron failed us. We loved Cameron's first two Terminator movies, but his return as Story Writer, but not Director as well, has made no difference to the Franchise's downfall. This sixth installment is probably the worst Terminator movie made and us morons fell for it - we were Cameroned.Good beginning with good action scenes but poor acting, making it boring to watch thereafter. Mind you quite a bit of the movie is made in total darkness, you hear voices but can't see a thing. Dark fate alright.As a supposed follow on after Terminator 2 - Judgement day, Dark Fate was surely meant to mean something else.",Terminator - Dark Fate
135,kjproulx,A Solid Addition to a Severly Jumbled Franchise,7,21 November 2019,"Regardless of how much you liked any of the previous instalments in the Terminator franchise, it goes without saying that it has been a bumpy ride, story-wise. Losing James Cameron as the head of this franchise was always the biggest thing wrong, due to the fact that he told his story and wrapped it up in the second film, T2: Judgement Day. This is now the sixth film and everything past the second has been subpar to me, excluding the fact that I did get some enjoyment out of Terminator: Salvation. This time, although Cameron was not at the helm as director, he was actually backing it as a producer, so if any of these movies deserved a little hope, it was this one. After viewing it, this film didn't do anything to get me excited for another instalment or anything like that, but I enjoyed it.Echoing many elements from the first two films, Terminator: Dark Fate follows Grace and Sarah Connor as they find themselves protecting a young girl from a liquid terminator that has been sent to kill her. Like many franchises that fear straying too far into original territory, this movie feels stale in terms of storytelling at times, but as a movie outside of the Terminator franchise, it's actually quite good. There are a few creative liberties taken throughout the movie that had me scratching my head, but for the most part, this film is just trying to deliver an exciting ride, which is what I feel it accomplished.Quite new to the directing chair, Tim Miller had only worked on Deadpool before being hired for this film, but that didn't bleed through into the final product at all. I think this is a very well-directed piece of action cinema, with characters you love from the past and enough new stuff to keep you engaged. It may seem like a negative to say that this movie would've been so much better if it wasn't part of the Terminator franchise, but if you can look past that, I think you'll be able to enjoy yourself. This movie is riddled with story flaws, but that's honestly to be expected with these films at this point.Terminator: Dark Fate picks up after the events of the second film, choosing ignoring instalments three to five. That will definitely be confusing to those who have followed the franchise and have no idea that's what they're doing here, but it's also a big positive. For doing this, it doesn't have to worry about the baggage that the previous films have created for any future instalments. This movie feels simpler than the rest, which was a nice change of pace. Still, this movie was more of a breath of fresh air for the franchise, rather than a great film.In the end, I can both recommend this movie as a solid action film, as well as an okay sequel to T2: Judgement Day. Yes, it's littered with problems if you look closely and there are story choices that will more than likely annoy many Terminator fans, but I think this film falls much more in line with the classic Terminator storyline. Linda Hamilton is pretty solid as Sarah Connor once again, Arnold Schwarzenegger as a little more screentime than I was expecting, and Mackenzie Davis is probably the best performance in the entire film. Overall, this is a solid action film that I would recommend, even though this franchise is a mess in retrospect.",Terminator - Dark Fate
136,kuarinofu,Shameless parasitism / longread,5,15 January 2020,"1. Expectations""- Prediction...? - Pain.""Have you ever screamed out loud ""no...why? Jesus..."" I know I did.Terminator: Dark Fate had me for the first 40 minutes of the film. The premise felt tired right away because all the films besides Salvation are the same goddamn films, but we don't get too many options here anyway, the franchise beyond T2 is messed up beyond recognition. Yes, T2 is almost the same as T1 (even scene by scene), but it didn't feel like a rehash but a refined and fleshed out version with a bigger budget. The result was the sci-fi classic we know and love.Ok, a terminator-like robot is sent to kill a Hispanic girl, so he looks like a local, is sent directly to her house and has much better infiltration skills. A good chase scene occurs with great CGI and I'm like ""ok, this is not as bad as people say"". Rev 9 robot is kind of a T-X at this point, but I still loved the concept of him having a metal skeleton and a liquid metal stuffing. Gabriel Luna is nothing like Robert Patrick in terms of looking dangerous and menacing, but it worked well with his skillset of being more of an infiltrator. However, I didn't get why he was using the same face all the time since he was easily recognizable and not stealthy at all.2. ""Movie starts, and I start to see things I recognize"" - James CameronPretty fast you start to notice that you are literally being shown the same scenes you have already seen before (the beginning scene is a mix of T1000-John chase and the ending chase of T2). If Genisys' beginning was shot-by-shot T1, this one... is as well but with different CGI assets (and scenes not only from T1, but T2 and even the Rise of the Machines). Same shots, same scenes, same camera pans. They are not trying to hide it.And this approach goes through the whole film. You can literally pinpoint every moment, every borrowed scene. What is more painful is that they even re-use the familiar sound effects, foley and music. T2 was famous for its foley and if you've seen it as many times as I did (you probably did) you will catch this very fast. And for the love of God, they even did ""Guitars, Cadillacs"" by Dwight Yoakam, this is where I went numb.3. Original contentThere's not much of it, but all the original scenes (not directly ripped-off ones) are bad with the only exception being Sarah's scene when she talks about forgetting the face of John, Hamilton still can act and this scene actually felt like something.Action scenes turn Marvel's Avengers very fast. After the plane scene, nothing feels like a real threat since our heroes are indestructible (it's ok for a 71-year-old looking terminator, but a 60+ y.o. Sarah J. Connor surviving a plane and a dam fall in a humvee...this was just ridiculous).Everything is explained in detail to the viewer so it's not as convoluted as Genisys, but the story itself is so uninteresting and unoriginal it barely makes a difference.The way Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger are forcefully shoved into the story only provides for laughable dialogue and horrendous acting from Natalia Reyes. She is so incredibly miscast and the delivery of ""stand up and fight"" made me facepalm. Nobody would follow her as a leader in my post-apocalyptic future that's for sure. The killing of John Connor (while it looked convincing) was absolutely unnecessary if they would go for an original film, but they didn't, so here we are.They expect you to buy all the ""terminator growing a conscience"" nonsense to give Arnold's character a redemption arc, but again, it's just too absurd to be taken seriously. Terminator living with a wife and a son is not even worth talking about (but they make a joke about it so it doesn't count as stupid now, I guess).When he mentioned that he was learning human values for 20 years in my head I misheard it as ""They don't want you to do too much thinking, eh?"" from T2 (you know, that self-learning disabled thingy). He also says stupid things about Sarah setting him free from Skynet (while this was never the case, Skynet never controlled him from the future, he had an objective which he has successfully completed and ""set himself free"" if you can call it that).As in Genisys, Arnold's terminator is nothing but a comically large nostalgia vehicle. A comedic relief character. They even have him say that he's extremely funny just because they are self-aware and they don't care anymore because you shouldn't too.The only believable character was Grace, mostly because Mackenzie Davis delivered a great performance. She was doing a direct impression of Biehn's Reese, but I think that this was their original intention since these films are just
photocopies now.They rip on some more scenes from T2 (stash-chain opening when crossing the border, helicopter scene from T2 where Rev 9 shoots an SMG through the copter's windshield just to name a few). We get our Enrique character called ""some major guy"", who is like Sarah's new best friend or something because he commits treason to help her and gives her a plane...whatever.4. ConclusionsAfter some pointless lethal action scenes overloaded with CGI, we get to our ending scene where everybody gets their resolution (not before ripping off both endings of T1 with the Jeep and the cut good ending from T2 with the children's playground, yes, I know).Sarah (posing herself as a Mother Mary and considering John a messiah) gets a new purpose to train and prepare Dani. She will be a good protector since she is pretty much an indestructible elderly lady. She even says ""you are John"" at some point to be sure the audience would understand (they forgot to add the laugh track though).Dani is now formed as an inspirational leader even though she wasn't even able to kill a malfunctioning Rev 9 with one hand (yeah, they borrow the malfunctioning scene from T2 too, I bet you didn't expect that at this point). She also kinda saved young Grace from this period (so she will be saving her in the bad future if it ever happens).Arnold gets his redemption for killing John (after another scene ripped from T3 no less, I mean, of course). At least he said that he won't be back, so there is still hope.And Grace repaid Dani for saving her life while sacrificing herself (again, proving that she was the only passable character (yet still Reese rip-off).Thus, they sort of came back to the message of ""There's no fate but what we make for ourselves"" but what sucks is that they completely obliterated this statement when they killed John Connor at the beginning of the film.Terminator: Dark Fate is a shameless precise copy of the first three films (with some borrowings from Salvation, the scene where Dani saves young Grace in the future). While some of the effects and the action were good, after around 40 minutes of the film, when we dive into the expository dialogue of our ""new"" story, it all crumbles.Many people compare it to Genisys. All I can say is that while Genisys was an incompetent mess with lousy writing and horrible but popular actors with a story that was fully spoiled by the trailer, this one is pretty much the same but a little less evident and with better production quality and real actors (besides Dani of course).Watch it or not - it's for you to decide, but if you love T1 and T2 you probably are not going to like this one.",Terminator - Dark Fate
137,nicholls905-280-546911,"Good film, but it needed to be great",5,31 October 2019,"I've suffered through all the franchise lows, and it is nice to finally see a sequel with some new ideas. My biggest issue is James Cameron was not directing. Tim Miller follows Deadpool with an adequate sequel, and on that front it's slightly disappointing. Halloween showed what could be done with an old worn out IP, but Terminator can't quite get there. The action is insane and the character's are interesting, sadly the storyline didn't hit for me. Another sequel wouldn't be a bad thing, but they need to twist it up. There is room to grow the story and maybe Miller will have a plan for this new direction. I just feel only James Cameron can make Terminator films. Hamilton is amazing in the role she was born to play. The film essentially killed the series, and after endless poor sequels and non starters, it's time to let it rest. The last great Terminator films was T2. It's a shame they threw all Skynet to the curve and wanted fans to embrace this bizarrely created hybrid design.",Terminator - Dark Fate
138,brankovranjkovic,Terminator Dark Fate - The real sequel to T2,8,24 October 2019,"Sci - fi intense action - C15 due to gore and language.This is pretty much the same plot as T1 and T2 where a Terminator and protector are sent back in time, one to eliminate the leader of the resistance and the other to protect and prevent this.You'll notice this version takes all the best elements from T1 and T2 with lots of familiar references. Hamilton and Schwarzenegger are both back and looking very weather worn. Hamilton has a major part with Schwarzenegger (who also has several LOL moments,) looking like more like a supporting role. The new upgraded Terminator is an outstanding villain, as usual it looks like nothing can stop this relentless killer. There's a twist in the opening scene, before we realise there's a new saviour for humanity.This is the real sequel to T2, with an emotional ending, and is the best Terminator movie since T2, and much better than the ones in between.I very much enjoyed this movie that sets up for another instalment.",Terminator - Dark Fate
139,Darkside-Reviewer,A Dark Fate for the future of the franchise,5,21 January 2020,"I didn't have high hopes for this Terminator movie because why would I the franchise died in 2003 with the release of Terminator 3, but to be fair at least that movie attempted to connect to the original story line while this movie just tries overwriting it.Dark Fate is exactly what you'd expect it to be a retelling of Terminator 2 Judgement Day with a few story differences and new characters. In this ""future timeline"" Skynet no longer exists but John Connor is killed by a Terminator that remained in the timeline if you think that's a spoiler you'd be wrong that's the first two minutes of the movie. Mankind still manages to end the world with a robot uprising so basically creating a new Skynet. As usual a machine comes back through time to kill a woman named Dani who is this movies John Connor. Dani leads the resistance against the machines in the future and surprise Dani's future self sent a protector back who is a cybernetically enhanced human. They team up with Sarah Connor who now hunts Terminators as they arrive in this time. Together they fight the new machine a few times and then run away a few times meet the T-101 model that killed John Connor at the beginning of the movie who has somehow grown a conscience and regrets killing John. They do the whole song and dance reutine of you killed my son and all the rest of it they then put there differences aside and fight the new machine killing it but the protector dies and Sarah and Danni drive off into the sunset in a jeep like in the original movie. This is just a cut and paste story nothing new added and it completely ignores what happened in the previous movie making the series even more of a mess than it was before.The Terminator franchise has hit a creative dead end now not even James Cameron could save it even with Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the movie. The franchise now needs a complete reboot with new actors a new story and a completely new timeline that has no connection to the other movies or TV shows whatsoever. Maybe then we will finally get something worthwhile until then enjoy Terminator Dark Fate for what it is two hours of callbacks and robot fights filled with CGI.",Terminator - Dark Fate
140,msbreviews,Rating: C,5,4 November 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)When it comes to the Terminator franchise, I share the same opinion as most people. The 1984's original became a cult classic, and it's one of the most influential sci-fi/action films of all-time. Terminator 2: Judgment Day is one of the (very) few sequels to such a beloved movie that actually improves on its predecessor, standing as the number one film of the saga, quality- and entertainment-wise. James Cameron left the franchise, and suddenly it all went down the sewer. While Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is still tolerable, Salvation is absolutely terrible, and the reboot, Genisys, failed to change the saga's history compellingly. So, obviously, even with the return of Cameron to the production team, my expectations were moderately low.That said, Dark Fate is the best Terminator installment since T2 ... which is not saying much. The last two flicks have great casts (from Christian Bale to Emilia Clarke), but their scripts are baffling bad. This time around, the cast has amazing chemistry, and their characters have better dialogue, but it comes at a cost. The last three movies possess stories that are not as captivating or entertaining (or even rational) as the first two films. Dark Fate has a much better screenplay, but again it comes at a cost. What cost is this? Basically, it repeats the exact same bits as The Terminator.An extremely thin line exists between paying homage to a movie and blatantly copying it. Tim Miller's team of screenwriters walk that line, stumbling to both sides several times along the way. Some scenes are indeed wonderful nods to the saga's first two installments, but a lot of other moments (too many, to be honest) are pretty much a copy-paste version of a significant plot point or character development arc from one of those films. In case you're wondering, this is the reason behind some of the ""hate"" from both critics and fans all over the world. Nowadays, people are harsher with this sort of homages, and the previously mentioned line is getting thinner and thinner.Another reason for the divisive opinions is the opening sequence. Don't worry, I won't spoil. They simply make a sudden and surprising narrative decision that takes some of T2's emotional impact, at least without first clarifying why they made such a call. Therefore, I gave the movie a chance to develop its idea, but it doesn't. It just goes with it, and it never returns to this initial moment. Having this in mind, I understand if people instantly decided to hate the film based on just that very first scene.... Because it really doesn't have any justification besides ""well, we need a story"".Dark Fate's screenplay is emotionally resonant, and it's also packed with (mostly) well-directed action sequences, but it resembles the 1984's original plot too much. There's even a direct line from Sarah Connor saying that a particular character is the equivalent of her son, John. This unnecessary and lazy exposition is surprisingly not as used as I expected it to be, but when it occurs, it's like they chose the lamest, silliest, worse possible moments to place it. However, I can't deny I actually had fun with the movie.With a much better script than the last films, the cast was able to not only shine in a few scenes, but their incredible chemistry allowed for outstanding moments. Seeing Linda Hamilton portray Sarah Connor once again is a delight to my eyes, and Arnold Schwarzenegger is an awesome badass with hilarious lines. These two are phenomenal! Nevertheless, Mackenzie Davis steals the show as the enhanced soldier, Grace, especially regarding the action scenes. I don't think Natalia Reyes offered what her character needed since she's the protagonist, after all, but she's able to stand her ground. I did enjoy Gabriel Luna take on the Terminator Rev-9, but I wish he had a little bit of more screentime besides the action.Tim Miller brings his talented directing chops from Deadpool and applies his action techniques to deliver a lot of entertaining sequences. The VFX team provides with some impeccable CGI, but there are a couple of shots concerning a few speed bursts that should have received better treatment.All in all, Terminator: Dark Fate is the best Terminator installment since Judgment Day, but it still doesn't even reach the latter's heels. It boasts a fantastic cast, with Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger returning to their respective iconic roles, but Mackenzie Davis outshines both with some badass moments and great acting. Natalia Reyes, as the protagonist, is disappointingly fine. Despite the action being well-directed and the screenplay being well-written, it all comes at the cost of essentially replicating the 1984 original's plot. Some homages are notable, but it's so identical story-wise that it takes away any sort of surprise, severely lacking creativity. In addition to this, it makes a narrative decision in the opening sequence that removes some of T2's emotional impact, damaging the saga's best movie and one of the greatest sci-fi/action films of all-time. I don't exactly recommend it, but if you're a fan of the franchise, go see it but with moderate expectations.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Linda Hamilton is back and she is a brave woman, great performance from this lady (also a great return to a high budget production film since 1997). Arnold Schwarzenegger acting is good and a charming rememblance from the first two films. The new script is about feminism, tolerance, people working together (a solid reference against the awful Trump administration), I know I'm talking about political correctness, in fact this topic is not a thing that bothers me, specially in this kind of film. James Cameron also is back to bring us a good sequel, an excellent production. Highly recommended film.By the way, now I wanna put my cellphone inside a potato chips bag.",Terminator - Dark Fate
143,SoumikBanerjee25,Not That Bad!,6,11 May 2020,"The negativity towards this particular film is baffling to say the least. As I have definitely seen much worse parts of other renowned franchises! There are many examples to take but the amount of backlashing it got is a tad bit unfair. I know the Terminator franchise has now only become a cash cow. They are constantly milking it for their own benefits. And this needs to stop. I agree on that. But if we can keep aside the fact of this film being a part of the same franchise. It's certainly not as bad as it may seem! As an individual film, this got lot of positive things too. Sadly those were simply overlooked by the sheer hate the fans have shown. Alas!For me, it was an enjoyable ride. Well most of the time! As it suffers a lot in the middle part where the pacing and screenplay gone to a pitfall, and the story takes a step back literally. The way it started off with a great tone and feel to it. I was totally into it. I thought, it might surprise me in the end. But sadly it only gave false hope. The action pieces, the blood pumping sound score and impressive Sound design fitted damn well. But then after a pleasureful ride, The speed takes a toll and more drama starts to settle in. That's where it became the least effective!The characters are good except 'Dani'. I don't know why but she never seemed a considerable fit to become the next 'Sarah Connor'. Such iconic boots to fill! Mackenzie Davis as Grace was superb. I have previously seen her in one of the episodes of Black Mirror. And Since then I knew she is capable of pulling various roles. Linda Hamilton as Sarah still has that fiery & badass presence that I very much liked. And what Can I say about Mr. Schwarzenegger. He is one of those actors who never lost his charm and etiquette.As a whole this film shines the most whenever any action piece comes in but loses its touch rather quickly on the other aspects. I would have loved to see more action from it. But it was an entertaining watch nonetheless. Don't keep your expectations high and just enjoy the fun ride. It's definitely a nicer popcorn flick. And please don't compare it to the classics. Although this follows a similar pattern in terms of storytelling but it's far away from those two classics. They are Incomparable!",Terminator - Dark Fate
144,0w0,Terminator: Smart robot vs. stupid girl,6,25 January 2020,"It's your average sci-fi action flick, but there's a few things that just irks me:The stupidity and ignorance of the 'young girl' character is infuriating... just absolutely infuriating... she can't drive, she can't think, she freaks out in every situation... she's completely incompetent and inept in each and every situation presented to her, even until the VERY end of the movie, she's still an idiot.Also, the movie is unrealistic... there's the one scene where the Terminators fight on a plane (having just left an airport), and after a few minutes the one Terminator falls overboard, which means that that Terminator would have landed many miles away from the airport, since they've spent a while already flying away from the airport, but no, aparently not, because just a short while later the Terminator is in his own airplane already and right next to the other airplane that he initially fell out of... how is that even possible? It would have taken that Terminator at least 10-20minutes to get back to the nearest airport in order to then commandeer an airplane again... so that scene is completely impossible and unrealistic.Also, the fight at the very end of the movie between the girl and the Terminator is once again impossible/unrealistic. I mean, a girl weighing 50kg doing a lil' girly kick against a Terminator would do literally NOTHING... that thing wouldn't even move...",Terminator - Dark Fate
145,RussHog,Pathetic,1,2 November 2019,Terminator Dark Fate is the worst sequel in the franchise and one of the worst movies ever made. It arrogantly ruins everything that comes before it - makes a stupid alternate reality that is a complete lackluster rip off of the previous films - and it introduces a new cast of characters who are nothing short of absolute trash. It also wastes Arnold and Linda Hamilton. This film has no right to claim it is a direct sequel to T2. It's atrocious. Terminate the people who made this.,Terminator - Dark Fate
146,MrDHWong,"Marks a substantial improvement over the previous three entries, although not by too much",7,31 October 2019,"Terminator: Dark Fate is the sixth installment in the Terminator franchise starring Linda Hamilton, Mackenzie Davis, and Gabriel Luna. Directed by Tim Miller (Deadpool), it marks a substantial improvement over the previous three entries, although not by too much.In 2020, a human cyborg soldier named Grace (Mackenzie Davis) is sent back from more than twenty years in the future to protect a young woman named Dani (Natalia Reyes) from being killed by a new model of Terminator known as the Rev-9 (Gabriel Luna). Joining Grace and Dani is Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), who spends her time hunting down and killing Terminators after receiving coordinates to their locations via texts from a mysterious individual.While its three predecessors aren't much of an act to follow, Terminator: Dark Fate still manages to pull through most of its mistakes to become one of the better entries in the series. This one feels like there was actual effort put into furthering the Terminator mythos rather than just for cash grab purposes. We likely have James Cameron to thank for this, as he both co-produced and co-wrote the film's story, making this the first Terminator film to have his proper involvement since the second one. In other words, this feels more like Terminator 3 than Terminator 3.Unfortunately, the film's first act felt sloppily handled, riddled with cliched dialogue and hastily introduced characters. Several times I found myself quietly completing a character's sentence before they had even finished talking, much to my annoyance. In addition to this, each time some random new person shows up in the story, I was able to correctly predict that they would die at some point, making their existence little more than for expositional purposes.However, the main characters did a great job keeping the film interesting during most of these poorly maintained moments. I particularly loved Grace, the cyborg human who is played brilliantly by Mackenzie Davis. I certainly wouldn't mind seeing a spin-off film focusing around her and her origins, even though enough of it is shown here. Also, it was welcoming to see Linda Hamilton reprising her role as Sarah Connor, the role that made her famous in the first place. This time she is considerably more battle-hardened, building upon how she was in the second film, rather than having her arbitrarily killed off-screen, which bothered me greatly about the third film. I did find Dani somewhat annoying at first, as she seemed identical to Sarah Connor in the original film, but over time she does develop some original character traits as the story progressed, much to my relief.Something I can never fault a Terminator film for is its action scenes. Even the worst entries in the series have at least one exciting moment of action and this one is no exception. The final act has a solid final showdown which is almost on par with the first film in terms of how satisfying it was to watch. I did feel that the rest of the other action was hit-or-miss though. This may be due to the fact that I feel most audiences such as myself have become somewhat desensitised to the great special effects on display after the five previous films have already wowed us so many times.Overall, if this ends up being either the last entry in the series or the beginning of a new one, I would be fine either way. There's no denying the huge impact the first two films have left on pop culture and although this film definitely won't blow the minds of today's modern audiences, it should hopefully reassure them of the franchise's well-earned place within the action genre.I rate it 7/10",Terminator - Dark Fate
147,stevelomas-69401,"Go Linda, go Arnold",7,27 October 2019,"Better than T3 & Genysis. The acting is sound and the storyline rattles along at a serious pace. On the other hand this is essentially a rehash of the previous films and the last 30 minutes gets increasingly ludicrous.

148,eva3si0n,Probably the dumbest movie I've seen in the last couple of years,2,22 November 2020,"Probably the dumbest movie I've seen in the last couple of years. Genesis is not a bad movie yet. I could not even imagine how to spoil the film if I put feminist ideas at the head and make the main antagonist a helpless dumb. And the main protagonist who replaced John Connor is so puzzling at all, her character is not spelled out by the screenwriter at all. As a result, the film has 2 normal scenes and all the rest is either self-copying the series again or the complete stupidity of the screenwriter. The Terminator series is dead, and the saddest thing is that Cameron himself buried it, betraying his ideas.
1 point for name, second point for Arnold)",Terminator - Dark Fate
149,Alexander_Blanchett,"Entertaining yes, - wasted opportunity, too.",7,28 October 2019,"Well there were some parts I loved and some I didn't like too much. First of all James Cameron multiple times said he distances himself from all the other sequels post T2 and sees this as a direct sequel to the 1991 masterpiece. Yet he steals or borrows a lot of elements out of the other films especially Salvation and Genysis. In the essence it is basically a remake of T2 with those additional elements. There is one big twist at the beginning of the film that might turn off a lot of fans of the original franchise and also creates the biggest story hole of the film.
Now the points I liked: Mackenzie Davis. A really great and enjoyable performance and a fantastic character addition to the series. I also loved that they brought back Linda Hamilton totally in Sigourney Weaver/Ellen Ripley mode. Really bad ass (sometimes a bit too cartoonish tho). Also the way to integrate Arnold Schwarzenegger to the story was fun (yet not original). The action worked perfectly fine for me, some really fantastic stuns and sequences. It had a nice atmosphere and some good camera work. Besides the points I mentioned in the beginning it was a great action adventure, yet without many new conclusions to the original story (at least not very exciting or great ones). I think for the return of James Cameron (sort of ), Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger you would expect a much more thrilling concept or story. Still it was entertaining in its own way.",Terminator - Dark Fate
150,cardsrock,The definition of insanity,5,17 October 2020,"...AKA doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. That's essentially the Terminator franchise at this point. Now I'll give them credit since they added in the new twist of inexplicably killing John Connor in the first 5 minutes, basically rendering the first two iconic Terminator movies irrelevant. They also tried gender-swapping to see if that would spark some life in this dead franchise, but nope. Since apparently Hollywood still hasn't learned, gender-swapping roles with the exact same plot as the original doesn't work. What's even the point of it all since no matter what happens, some company will always become Skynet and send a terminator into the past to kill the future leader of the resistance.Now there is some decent action in this one, but it doesn't make up for the redundant plot and overall exhaustion with this franchise. Just please stop.",Terminator - Dark Fate
151,dfa120374,How did we get from Terminator to THIS?!,5,23 July 2020,"Dear dear dear. What an absolute let down this latest installment of the terminator franchise is. I gave it 5-stars but purely because of the action, visuals & the effects. Everything else, however, is either not very good or plain mediocre (I never thought I'd say THAT about a terminator film).I was actually looking forward to this, especially when I saw who was going to be back (no pun intended), but oh boy. Sorely disappointed doesn't cover it.Firstly, the writing - especially for a terminator film - is extremely poor. I mean ""Carl"" the Terminator?! C'mon, and I still can't say that without laughing, but that was the moment it just got ridiculous for me. ""Carl's"" back story makes absolutely no sense, from the moment ""he"" was sent back to the moment you see ""him"" in the film. Also, the cringy ""YOU'RE the resistance leader! Not some man!"" speech (yes - even Terminator has been added to the nonsensical, politically correct ""woke"" garbage). A 60plus-year-old woman able to fight like she is still in her 30s without breaking a hip. It's stunning James Cameron was a part of this and to see this franchise go from two amazing Sci-fi/Action films (T1 & T2) to this is pretty embarrassing.Schwarzenegger seems to have been brought back just for an extended cameo (and not a very good one at that). In the 1st two films the T-800 was threatening, intimidating & relentless. Here, it was the exact opposite. I LOVED Linda Hamilton in those 1st movies also, but she was wasted here, and I hate to say it but she was very wooden in the part of Sarah. Two standouts were Mackenzie Davis and Gabriel Luna and I think they really carried the film, but without any disrespect, that wasn't hard to do here.The plus points were the visuals & the action, but it's just a pity the story dragged it all in to the gutter.An extremely mediocre Terminator film. NEVER thought I'd say that about a Terminator film either.
Just one more thing to add to the year of craziness that is 2020.",Terminator - Dark Fate

153,Beejerman,CHEER! - (7 stars out of 10),7,12 November 2019,"The stage curtains open ...After the debacle known as Terminator: Genisys, it was refreshing to see this welcome addition to the Terminator franchise. Returning to reprise her role of Sarah Connor is the noticeably aged Linda Hamilton - still the ever vigilant defender of the human race against the machines. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns once more as the ""friendly"" terminator who lends a helping hand. And, behind the scenes, is the return of James Cameron who wrote and produced this latest entry. So, with all of this returning going on, is this movie a return to form? Well ... not exactly.This time around, the latest model terminator - a Rev-9 assassin - is sent back through time to take out the future resistance leader. John Connor, right? Wrong. John was killed earlier in the film by a T-800 terminator, which alters the future. The resulting resistance leader is a girl named Dani Ramos who lives in Mexico City with her father and brother. As before, a lone protector is sent back in the form of an augmented super-warrior named Grace. Showing up on the scene is an embittered Sarah Connor. Eventually, they catch up to the same T-800 that killed John and it is this unlikely alliance that makes their final stand against the Rev-9.As with all the terminator movies, there is plenty of in-your-face choreographed fight scenes, explosions and tons of eye candy. The special effects and cinematography are second to none, and the pacing is excellent with the movie starting out strong and effectively moving forward. The characters are well cast, the acting good and the story worthy of the series. This film, to me at least, had a bit of a dystopian feel to it. Not nearly as pronounced as in Salvation, obviously, but still there none-the-less.I would recommend this one without hesitation. It is a solid movie that stands on it's own while contributing to the overall Terminator story. Yet, one gets the feeling that we've seen the best that this franchise has to offer and we are finally grinding to a halt. Some would argue that was the case with Genisys, but the whole purpose behind Dark Fate was to right the sinking ship. I walked out feeling it did that to a degree, but I also felt like everything has been exhausted and there is nothing left to do. Dark Fate may well stand to serve as a fond farewell.",Terminator - Dark Fate

155,garethcrook,Please. No more.,5,16 March 2020,"Terminator. For all the back story, reboots, future apocalypse stuff, it's very simple at it's core. Man vs Machine, with some cool effects and lots of smashy crashy bits to sear your eyeballs. That's what we have here, evil molton-tar like, indestructible robots, good robots, including Arnie and it's strongest card, Linda Hamilton. Here she's knarled, militant, full on badass. She's still the unhinged revenge monster, but she's really the only thing that anchors this in a dusty world of car chases and super fast cut fight scenes. It's storyline isn't original, in fact it's a carbon copy of its predecessor. That's the angle, it's happening again. Skynet is replaced by Legion, but the premise remains to wipe out the origin of the pesky human resistance. The trio of female leads works well, largely because it's fun. This was always the strength of the first two films, it didn't take itself too seriously and that's what we have here with self referential in jokes and cheesy yee-haw dialogue. However as the film goes on, it all gets a bit much, overly sentimental and despite some typical blockbuster explosion heavy action sequences, I'm left cringing rather than smiling. It looked promising at the outset, but come the trope-laden finale, I was willing it to end, as it descended into lazy predictable nonsense and one bloody awful line after another. Yes it was fun watching Arnie being Arnie and Linda Hamilton reprised the role pretty well, but as they drive off into the sunset (what, you didn't think the good guys were gonna die did you?), I'm left with the horrible realisation that the story is left open for more. Please I'm begging, no more. Terminate this before you do any more damage.",Terminator - Dark Fate
156,Azanspy,A decent movie.,6,2 November 2019,"Terminator Dark Fate is definitely not bad as compared to the last two Terminator movies. The direct sequel to Judgement Day is a decent watch. It has eye catching visual effects, very good action sequences and Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor and Arnold Schwarzenger as T-800. The return of these iconic characters definitely helped the movie. Tim Miller's direction was also good. This is nothing like his previous movie Deadpool as it was a comedy movie. Mackenzie Davis and Natalia Reyes also did a good job as new characters. I don't know if there will be a sequel for this as it will be based on this movie's box office performance. Overall, Terminator Dark Fate is a one time watchable pretty good action movie which is a legacy sequel to the iconic Judgement Day.",Terminator - Dark Fate
157,statuskuo,La Terminator!,4,21 October 2020,"I have often wondered why they keep revisiting this ol' chestnut. It's banged out like a tired old prostitute. And at a certain point, you may want to let it go out to pasture to die in peace.If it weren't for the sweet buns of Mackenzie Davis, this would be a complete dud. However, I have to give them credit, they don't care what fans of any of the alternative universes think. They will have you believe a cholla from Mexico City has the goods to be the savior of the universe.Why not?Well, for starters we'd probably end up with a society full of face tattoos and women that sound like Michelle Rodriguez. The real fall of society is that we all kill ourselves for annoying ourselves. That urban Mexican accent is the worst. Before I'm censored for perceived bigotry, the Spanish accent is the sexiest.
I digress.
There was a point when Sarah Connor mentions she was the same age as the girl in this movie when the Terminator came for her. Seriously folks, do the comparison. One is a WOMAN, this one is a kid. Try casting older and just saying she's younger, idiots.This movie is about the lack of physics. And repercussions of actions. Never mind the numbers of collateral damage these four idiots unleash on society, it's all about the future, right folks, while ending everyone else's? I mean, at least with the new Terminator, he shouldn't care.But hey, this is what they think is woke. Coming from scientist massager James Cameron, you'd think they'd be a tad bit less cartoony with the fights.
But here is Tim Miller. ""Deadpool"" fame. A movie that is obnoxiously self aware. It makes sense he would add in his little jokes about ""being back"" or ""not coming back"" It seems wheezy and tired. And Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor seems like that chain smoking aunt that can't stop cursing. Ugh this movie grates on me.This Covid thing gave us lots of time to waste, and even then, I would not recommend this to basement dwellers. Perhaps to 13 year olds.",Terminator - Dark Fate

159,dilipbts,Terminator dark fate,8,19 June 2020,"I'll be honest, Dark Fate is more mediocre than unwatchable, probably the best Terminator since T2... yeah, I know, the bar is so low, it's like limbo dancing at this point. This feels similar to The Force Awakens: in itself a slick, decent movie, but I've already watched the much better original, so thanks but no thanks.Positives? Mackenzie Davis, for whom I've had a hopeless crush since seeing her as a cute NASA geek in The Martian (and then again in Blade Runner 2049), plays a relatable, compelling character, with an intriguing mix of power and vulnerability. There are also a couple of neat set-pieces, especially in the first half, before everything becomes over-the-top tiresome.Linda Hamilton and Arnold show up for fanservice. It's kind of nice to see them both back with significant roles but, as is typical of fanservice, it's like gorging on too much chocolate: tastes good at first, but then come nausea and a vague feeling of shame.My main point is, the Terminator series is now hopeless, as the last movies, especially Genisys, have poisoned the well. The continuity is a mess and keeps being rebooted, so everything is pointless: no development can feel meaningful. Show of hands: who would be particularly surprised if the next Terminator movie was once again about John Connor leading the Resistance in another alternate continuity? No one? Thought so.Also, the new villain being so talkative was possibly the single stupidest idea in the whole project. You know why Arnold in T1 and Robert Patrick in T2 were so terrifying? Because they shut up! They said very little and, the few times they spoke, it always felt like something they did out of pure necessity (probing for informations, setting up a trap) but was fundamentally alien to their nature.This Rev-9 tries to talk its antagonists out of fighting him! Can anyone picture the T-1000 reasoning with its targets? The great Robert Patrick studied and imitated the body language of birds of prey to look creepier and inhuman, and the new bad guy wants to chat. Give me a break.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Chases, explosions, meltings and remoulds and cyber-skeletons - it's all there, with a climax in the turbine room under a dam that could almost be a recycled Bond-villain's lair.Linda Hamilton and Arnie are looking a bit weathered (can cyborgs age?), but they bring a curious kind of warmth to the patchwork storyline.

167,PyroSikTh,This is the Fourth Failed Attempt at a T2 Sequel,4,25 October 2019,"Dark Fate's biggest issue is that it's basically T2 all over again. Another Terminator is sent back to kill another person who will be instrumental in the future war, so the resistance has sent another superpowered being to protect them. It's the exact same story we've seen from four previous movies already. It's getting tired, and new takes on the formula need to be found. The other problem is Cameron wanted this to be the third movie, following on from T2, and ignoring the three movies in the middle. But with T2, they supposedly defeated Skynet for good, so how does the formulaic plot come back? A totally different AI called Legion, which coincidentally uses the exact same technology and designs as Skynet.But what about John Connor? He was saved and is set up to be the great hero of the future in the war against the machines! Not any more. The very first thing Dark Fate does is kill him off, unceremoniously, by another T-800. I'll give you a moment to digest just how monumentally bad an idea that was, and then realise that that's exactly what they did. Okay, let's dissect why this is a bad idea. Sarah and Arnie defeated Skynet in T2, so who sent this mysterious T-800 back, and why? There's no war with the machines any more. Furthermore, why did they send a T-800? They sent a T-1000 last time, but no, sending an older version will get the job done this time, obviously. What nonsense kind of logic is that? But of course the biggest problem is it completely undermines the entire driving force of the whole franchise! Kyle Reese is sent back to ensure Sarah survives to give birth to John, and then a T-800 is sent back to protect John himself, and this was all for nothing. Nothing! If you want your ""totally real actual third movie"" to feel like a continuation of the first two, you don't completely obliterate the reason for the first two movies' existences in the first five minutes! Even Rise of the Machines got that one crucial aspect right! But no, John Connor. Who needs the mythologised saviour of all mankind any way?So without John Connor, who's even being protected any more in this new war against the machines? It's some chick from Mexico, who Sarah constantly belittles the entire movie saying she's being protected so she can carry the real saviour to term successfully, without once considering that Dani herself might be the new saviour. And of course, guess what the ""twist"" in the third act is? Oh my god Dani was the saviour all along! Shut your misogynistic cake-hole Sarah Connor! This is 2019 and we need to shove female empowerment down our audiences throats! Now look, I have no problem with Dani being the new saviour herself (other than it's in complete disrespect to John Connor). What I have problem with is that they so clearly signposted it to make a point that she's a strong independent woman who don't need no man. It was unnecessary, as both Sarah Connor and Grace are badass women already, and Dani being another one really isn't that big a deal. And while disrespecting John Connor, it also drags Sarah Connor through the mud by turning her into a narrow-minded, stay-at-home type woman who can't even conceive the idea that she's not the only female badass in the world.The film doesn't even make sense by its own logic either. The most obvious example of this is Sarah's crusade against Terminator incursions over the last twenty years. She gets a text telling her when and where, she shows up, she kills the Terminator, time and time again. But this one seems to be different because she can't kill the Rev 9. She can't kill it with help from Grace. She can't even kill it with help from Grace and the T-800 that killed John. In fact the Rev 9 is so unkillable that the movie is literally just a series of action setpieces from one confrontation to the next, and nothing changes each time. They make a plan to blast it with EMPs, but those are destroyed before the Rev 9 even gets close, so each and every action sequence is Grace, Sarah, and Arnie shooting and blasting this thing that just absorbs everything, gets booted away, and then comes back again, over and over and over and over and over again. If the overall plot wasn't tired enough, the constant and unchanging action scenes are almost certain to send you to sleep.The visual effects are hit and miss. I thought the de-aging of Linda Hamilton and Arnie in the opening '98 scene was really, really convincing, and the kid they cast as John was a splitting image of Edward Furlong, to the point where I thought for a moment it was a deleted scene from T2 that they remastered. Unfortunately the effects from that point don't really stand up to scrutiny due to one glaring issue; rubber man syndrome. So many times is someone flung, or there's a fancy unrealistic jump, and rather than using wires and stuntmen, they just CGI the whole human, but their movements are like rubber. They bend in unnatural ways, like ragdolls. Much of the third act is cast in such black darkness that it's hard to make out what's going on as well. And this was in a dark cinema screening. I dread to think what it would look like on home video in a normally-lit room.Despite all my rants, I did enjoy most the movie. When the opening scene killed off John Connor I was left a little apprehensive, but if I had been more critical at the time, I would have listened to the alarm bells and strongly considered walking out right then and there. The rest of the movie was enjoyable enough until around the third act when I started realising how much of a repetitive mess it all was, and it started to feel like it was going on forever and would just never end. And now I've mulled on it more, and I'm in disbelief that they could crap up a sequel to T2 so many times. It's been nearly thirty years, and we've had four separate attempts, and not one has been good enough critically. Dark Fate does not buck that trend. It's yet another failed sequel in a long line of failed sequels. I give it a 4/10. Can we go back and do those Salvation sequels now? Thanks.",Terminator - Dark Fate

171,Draysan-Jennings,Wasn't expecting much,7,21 January 2020,I really thought this movie was going to suck. I was pleasantly surprised. Linda Hamilton was a badass.

The action scenes were awesome and the story wasn't bad. Definitely worth checking out.,Terminator - Dark Fate
172,dfle3,Terminator: Dark fate...interminable franchise. 55+%,6,16 November 2019,"This latest instalment in the ""Terminator"" franchise brings in some twists and additions to the lore but still feels like a lazy restatement of what we've seen numerous times previously. The story has been told better, especially with the first two in the series. Now this new entry just seems to give the viewer a cursory and perfunctory action film and characters, in order to fill it with even more action. That action can be ridiculous though, as in not being believable. The terminator that you see this time is another upgrade to the one seen in ""Terminator: Judgment Day"", going on memory. You see familiar faces from this series as well as some new ones, the latter to presumably appear in further sequels. Their emotions and reactions are familiar, and demonstrate the cursory and perfunctory nature of the storytelling which I mentioned earlier.Overall, this film lacks soul. Whilst the new elements of the film are interesting, especially with the focus on the female characters (this focus might make this the kind of film that girlfriends might end up not minding being dragged to by their boyfriends), it's just a pity the rest of the film doesn't provide enough material in support of this. These new elements could have been an interesting ingredient of the original film but you would wonder if audiences of the time would have been receptive to it and not punished the film at the box office as a result. Better yet, such elements could have been better integrated into this one, with the focus on the new character perhaps being made to comment on the nature of humans, whatever the threat.You can probably guess the tension that the filmmakers were trying to relieve here: they had a franchise which had told a good story at the start and could have been left for posterity...but making a lot of money from these films is good, so why can't we just bung out another one when we've really got nothing interesting to say?Set initially in Mexico, ""Terminator: Dark fate"" even comes across initially as a foreign language film, with Spanish being spoken and subtitles used (it's only for a short time, though). Perhaps such a setting and the new characters introduced here are pointed, since the current President of America, Donald Trump, has made a point of vilifying this country and its people.The themes of this franchise, such as the dangers of artificial intelligence and robots are becoming more topical in our age. Contemporary mass surveillance is referenced. When you tie that in with artificially intelligent robots from the future which look human and are here to kill the sources of resistance to their rule in the future, well, the effect is powerful. It occurs to me that these terminators are so powerful that resistance is useless. It also occurs to me that the lure of making a lot of money at the box office is also something where resistance is useless to James Cameron. I was under the impression that an Australian Prime Minister, probably Paul Keating, had used a phrase like ""like a dog returning to its own vomit"" but I see that Wikipedia lists such a phrase as originating in the bible. So long as this franchise keeps making money, no matter how much the films stink, James Cameron will return to them. Or, he'll just bide his time until the time to reboot the franchise is right!There is some humour in this film. Arnold Schwarzenegger's terminator delivers some deadpan lines, demonstrating a dry sense of humour. I wish that I was paying more attention to one scene where his character was waxing lyrical about a certain item found in homes. It made me think whether his character had a dry sense of humour or just lacked self-awareness, although I do concede that it could equally have both. Last year, Jamie Lee Curtis demonstrated there is life for old actors...when there is a franchise involved, with her return to the world of ""Halloween"". Here, Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger reinforce that observation. Linda's character does seem a prop at times though, coming across as sucking a lemon before speaking (she's understandably bitter and a cynic).As far as I can remember, I've seen the first two in this franchise (""The Terminator"", ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"") but I can't say that I remember having seen the next one, ""Terminator 3: Rise of the machines"" (edit: I just saw a picture from this film now, which reminds me that I think that I have seen it...the one with the female terminator). I have seen and reviewed at this site ""Terminator salvation"" but not the next one ""Terminator Genisys"". There's also been a TV series which I've seen ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor chronicles"" (at least to once the series started getting overly religious in its content but maybe I've seen all of it. It was cancelled after its second series, Perhaps I took the view that I wouldn't continue watching the series, if it had continued). Wikipedia's article on this latest instalment mentions that story creator James Cameron regards everything after the second Terminator film as belonging to alternate timelines. Going on memory, it occurs to me that what we see early on in ""Terminator: Dark fate"" as far as the fate of one character goes, would also put it in an alternate timeline from ""Terminator: Judgment Day"".When your film utilises time travel as an element of the story, incoherence can obviously follow. As far as I'm aware, there are no parallel worlds in the Terminator universe (it's up to the viewer to treat different films as being in ""alternate timelines"", to user Cameron's phrase. They are not part of a coherent series in other words. Some of them must not be a 'true' part of the 'real' story told). That being said, that should, perhaps, make the existence of Arnold Schwarzenegger's terminator an anomaly in this film, i.e. with no causal link to this world. His existence there is perhaps paradoxical. I don't know. Is there a coherent philosophy of how the universe would work in a world of time travel but no parallel worlds? I wouldn't think so. In any case, the lore surrounding terminators is expanded through his story in this filmMy score for this film isn't a reflection on the prominence of women in this film. It's a reflection of the quality of the story. Really, I can't say that ""more of the same"" in future instalments hold any attraction for me now",Terminator - Dark Fate
173,funtasticfour,A pretty good third movie-I'm fine with pretending the others don't exist,7,3 November 2019,"Honestly, I'm tired of these movies. I don't want to see another Terminator movie for 20 years. That being said, most of them are entertaining, especially the first 2. This one is supposed to be #3 and I'm fine with that. I've read enough comic books and sci-fi movies to call it an alternate timeline or whatever. Arnie and Linda are fine, but its the new characters who shine and make this movie good, but I still don't want to see a sequel anytime soon. Come up with new stuff Hollywood!",Terminator - Dark Fate
174,Offworld_Colony,A fitting third film that only comes 28 years late.,7,7 February 2020,"Dark Fate has a title that I hated going into the film but kind of liked coming out. I guess that's a compliment, another would be that by the time Arnie enters the film, I had actually forgotten he was in it, I was enjoying it so much.Dark Fate's plot was clever in its reverence and spin off from the main series' lore and yet it feels like a high quality mainline entry; The adherence to the Skynet nonsense is finally gone and something simpler and far easier to understand and engage with is in its place. And compounding that is the fact the the ride is so brisk and fun (but not this time because the film lacks plot) that I didn't mind being swept up in the story instead of trying to second guess all the potential plot holes.Tim Miller has some tremendously creative ideas in the action and, conceptually in the robots. The marketing and Cameron-led spiel doesn't do it justice; I went in expecting a generic action-centric Terminator parody but the film just fired off with such a great, fresh experience. And yet the film was patient and interested in showing us these character just enough to care and be interested.Linda Hamilton, while shaky at first, was superb and I'm glad the marketing plays her up because she came back at exactly the right time and with exactly the right script. I'd happily see plenty more with her at the core of the experience.When Arnie turns up his backstory and current state is elegant and simple and efficient, leaving a new and surprising and genuinely heartwarming version of the Terminator. Also, amazingly, Arnie brought the humour, and while it wasn't all worth a chuckle, it wasn't as groan worthy as some of the other entries and more than a couple of times I actually laughed out loud, so elated to see these characters being handled well for the first time in a long time. It's at this point in the film that it just blossomed and I was enraptured from there on out.The third act is very third acty but still the action is superb and engages; Miller and Co. Have made a formidable but cleverly weak villain that finally felt like a real infiltrator. And who couldn't be wowed by A zero-g Terminator fight, or fighting on the bottom of a waterbed, the way the future liquid Terminators fight, or the clever battle royale that didn't result in two big things just smashing each other away like so many of the others films.I wanted a little more from the fan service but to be honest the film was permeated by Terminator lore and tone instead of being completely different (like Genysis trying to be a Marvel movie) and cloying desperately to shoehorn in the franchise tropes. Yes at the end I wanted to see the thumb from the end of Terminator 2, but it was ok, Dark Fate felt like it had the right kind of fan service, the right way. The references were tactful, organic and surprising.So Dark Fate has great music, a great Mexico City location and tone and almost always great VFX, barring some shaky human physics, as always. And it's got bountiful love for the franchise and a really solid makeup that shows more quality as the film goes on. It's not quite the Fallout this franchise needs but it is the Rogue Nation, filling the franchise with new life. Tim Miller has sold me, and for once Cameron's endorsement wasn't wrong, this is a fitting third film in the series and one I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish.",Terminator - Dark Fate

At the hour mark, I was done. I really liked seeing Sarah Connor back, and I thought the scene when she arrives was awesome, including her first line! But from there, it is really slow going.Reviewing this film as a part of the Terminator series, well, it sucks. This one film basically negates half the series thus far, rewriting the back story and which character dies almost entirely. And Arnold's character in this makes no sense whatsoever, in context of the previous movies and the programming of the machines. He doesn't even move like a Terminator! And his hair greys? AND he can grow a beard? Come on, filmmakers, watch the original and be ashamed...",Terminator - Dark Fate
179,nikola17,i have chosen my fate that i liked film,10,7 November 2019,"Well it at least it's better then Terminator Genisys (2015) i like Terminator Genisys but it's far too soft because with PG-13 RATED, R rating for Terminator is always better. witch i didn't like with that rubbish actor who played john Connor Jason Clarke aka Jason Fruitcake if you cut out l and r comes with 4 letters cake Jason Fruitcake i thought he ruined Genisys a bit, i thought Genisys did good but it wasn't film i loved too death but with this ithought this was better i understand this film flopped, some angry critics about this film. just because critics hated this and this flopped doesn't make me to hate movie i just watch movie choose my opinions on it. i liked this film i thought i liked it. However I was very entertained! For me it hit all the right marks. loved how Linda Hamilton was exceptional reprising her role as one might expect her character to develop in the 2 decades since her last ordeal thought it was great dark terminator film to bring back because i hate it when it's PG-13 i like it when it's R RATED, it was violent a lot darker story. i liked new villain witch i thought he was a badass. and yeah i truly understand the CGIdoesn't hold up well. but it doesn't put me out of movie. i liked new characters Grace (Mackenzie Davis) who is known for Blade Runner 2049, Black Mirror. Daniella ""Dani"" Ramos (Natalia Reyes) she did some Mexican shows and movies but she is known for Pickpockets, Birds of Passage i thought she was badass pretty Mexican chick to be the new destined mother of the Resistance leader like Sarah Connor who needs to be protected. villain who is Rev-9 (Gabriel Luna) advanced Terminator prototype that originated from Legion it's not called skynet anymore. Rev-9 was sent back in time to terminate Dani. i thought new characters were held much better cast then to cast from Terminator Genisys i do like Emilia Clarke but rest of it eh. but in this cast did better for me. i didn't understand why didn't get Arnold in all movie he doesn't appear until middle of film sadly, i would say it's more of Linda Hamilton film then to Schwarzenegger film. the doesn't follow anything to Terminator Genisys even Arnold said you don't have to watch Genisys to watch Terminator Dark Fate. but it takes place after T2 ended In 1998, three years after averting the threat of Skynet, Sarah and John Connor (Edward Furlong) but people it's not him playing John Connor it was double person Jude Collie who doubled Edward Furlong but they made CGI use of young john Connor from T2. he live a life of peace, oblivious that Skynet sent multiple Terminators back through time prior to its erasure. They are soon attacked by a T-800 Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) at Livingston, Guatemala, which brutally murders John before disappearing. i really wanted John Connor to be deserved afterwards was to spend time with his mother and get a proper childhood, after everything what happened from Judgement Day which is why it's so effectively tragic that he was killed after only getting a taste of what family feels like, but it's not for nothing. Clearly written from a place of love for the character, they devoted a lot to show how much his death affects others.Twenty-two years later an advanced Terminator, the Rev-9 (Gabriel Luna), is sent back in time to Mexico City, to murder Daniella ""Dani"" Ramos (Natalia Reyes) Grace comes out nowwhere saves her they are on chase, then that's when Sarah Connor comeback and saves Dani and Grace. now the story kinda toke idea from Terminator Salvation when Sam Worthington says i am human but he is machine well in this she is not machine but at least she is converted into a cyborg. if your curious about Arnold Schwarzenegger T-800 well after 20 years he found a woman who was abused and by her ex husband he saved her life. then he raises with family. began to learn from humanity and eventually developed a conscience, taking the name ""Carl"" and adopting a human family. Learning of how its own actions had affected Sarah and able to detect temporal displacements. i really loved Sarah was always the main character, and her loss gives her a new dimension as she walks a fine line between rage and sorrow. i thought action was fun still Arnold kicking ass with Sarah Connor once again like in T2. i thought villain Gabriel Luna has done very well done as villain i liked badass look of Rev-9 type he can split in 2 witch is cool looking robot. that can have ability to separate these two components into two separate. the action was good fun to watch, CGI yet again doesn't hold up very well. It's so sad to live in a continent where so many socially inept will accuse anything of having a political agenda just because it's female-centred. It's like, ""How does it make sense for women to suddenly be important too? It doesn't make sense! The men were the important ones the whole time!"" The C-5 aircraft and underwater scenes were a bit too dark i think it wants a different type of look of cinematography different to helicopter chase to Terminator Genysis and scrimping a bit on the movie's budget i know it wants to be different but at least did they see film did they it's too dark ?? like if i am watching Alien vs Predator Requiem that kinda dark cinematography type of look. i thought showdown to T-800 ""Model 101 vs Rev-9 was good showdown not great but a very good showdown to it, i would say better showdown then seeing terminator fighting with the bad john Connor from Terminator Genysis.
I grew up with T1 and T2 and I absolutely loved this addition to the franchise. i don't love movie it is pretty watchable,James Cameron returns to produce a definitive sequel to T2, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton are together again on screen, and it's an R-rating that doesn't dick around trying to be family-friendly, and you can't even appreciate this goldmine because you're distracted by the existence of women. To the straight men who're triggered, I don't even know why you're so mad about this film i mean i truly understand why hated Terminator Genisys but i liked it because story but it was silly at most of times but i thought this did a lot better then Terminator Genisys. Tim Miller is a director who was fired from Ryan Reynolds made this film and James Cameron produced it witch i think he should get off Avatar movies for awhile since everyone been waiting for sequel for 10 years just for Avatar 2 lol i think James Cameron needs to comeback to direct Terminator he was first person who made Terminator character the movies he made witch was fantastic. but they hired wrong writers for film witch i hated writer David s Goyer overrated director and writer who destroys films like Blade Trinity, Zig Zang, Unborn he is more of writer then director but him as writer god i think that's how critics got angry don't believe me ? look up all movies that he is a writer off past 6 or 9 years he is destroyed a lot movies like Blade Trinity, Freddy VS Jason, Ghost Rider spirit of Vengeance. the last one he written was Batman vs Superman Dawn of Justice.he is terrible writer if maybe James Cameron was director put more money into this and get tim miller as writer of film it would be maybe be better but i guess James Cameron is two-face prick who say's oh Alien vs predator is a good movie then he says i hate it pick one he even said that too Terminator Genisys
it was pretty good film then he says he hated same goes with this i don't think he cares. but i liked film i never change my mind on this film or Terminator Genisys i liked them both but i would have to say i liked Dark fate a lot more it has darker style of film. it has bit of funny lines in film but too over top like Terminator Genysis like young Sarah Connor calling Terminator pops or when they arrested it play's song background bad boys what are you doing to do ? in it like original films do. nothing like that this film wasn't too over top. look it's great film for terminator fans but reason i have to spoil review aka review contains spoilers is because some of people might get pissed off is because the young john Connor dies and story becomes more pointless yes i understand but end of day take it or live i take it i loved film it was just fun to watch i don't say it's best Terminator in moment yet. i say it's in proofed 6th film but i think it needs to be more proofed needs to be better because this film flopped but still made a lot money in box office. it's because he was built up as a savior, but Terminator 2 Judgment Day already established that he wouldn't become the same man and gave him his own journey. It may have been shorter, but it's a complete character arc that doesn't need continuation and that's a testament to T2's writing. Audiences seem to always want a sequel that subverts all expectation while being exactly what they expect, then they get angry when it can't do that: Salvation tried so hard to give John a gritty war film, Genisys turned him into the bad guy, and anything you can come up with is probably just as bland. it's not movie or cast it's writers i think Tim Miller kinda destroyed this film only if he didn't hire David s goyer. i didn't think Tim Miller wasn't right director of film. Ignore negative reviews this one is a must watch of film, it's fun to watch, performances from linda Hamilton was great and another actors like Arnold and another 2 girls did great in film, thought cast was better and villain was better then in Terminator Genisys. i have to rate this 10.10 sorry guys could not hate this movie at all",Terminator - Dark Fate
180,SkullScreamerReturns,The money-making machine must be terminated,2,22 May 2021,"Arghh....there was potential in this one. Linda Hamilton is back and looking cool and Arnold is always nice to see again even in his older days. You could have made a ""return to form"" of some sorts with these people, but no. Instead: script that brings nothing new, and makes even the classic characters seem dull. And the new characters and actors are even worse. Most scenes are copied from previous movies but with no style, and the plot explanations at this point are such randomness that it makes old fans want to terminate their brains.My rating may seem overreacting since it's not the most boring or most annoying movie ever. You can watch it...once at least. But...it's just so empty of any real Terminator quality that I feel bad for Arnie and Linda that they agreed to take part in this junk. I guess they made a lot of money though.One extra point for the scene of Hamilton coming out of the car with sunglasses and a grenade launcher. That was the high point where I almost believed this could work.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Yeah, being an Arnold fan, I would have loved more of him in the movie. Neverthless Mackenzie Davis impressed me somehow.The story is same old, which anyone would have predicted and we all knew how this was going to end. Apart from first and second series of the installments, I would place this at the third spot. Other Terminator movies were not that impactful for me.Overall I would say I liked it. Mackenzie Davis was the pick of the movie for me, movie should have had one impactful moment of original Arnold. Linda Hamilton was nice to watch. Overall a good film for me.",Terminator - Dark Fate
182,stevenrotherforth,More reboots than an old laptop. Is this franchise still relevant?,6,24 October 2019,"Terminator: Dark FateA couple of weeks ago right before the theatrical release of 'Terminator: Dark Fate I was in my local DVD store browsing through the Blu-ray section when I heard a teenage boy say to his friend that he'd never seen any of the'Terminator' movies.I was a little disturbed to say the least but it did get me thinking.""Is this franchise even relevant anymore?""
After T3 which was an unimaginative retread of T2 then 'Salvation' which had flashes of brilliance but ultimately had no heart or soul but in my opinion is the best of the sequels.The final nail in the franchises coffin came in 2015 with 'Genisys'.A film that was trying to be too clever and failed to capture the audiences attention.Hence this attempt at yet another reboot.This time around 'Dark Fate' is a story written by creator James Cameron.Should we get excited because of this? I was sceptical at first.After all he did give 'Genisys' his blessing and we all know how that turned out.Attaching Cameron's name to 'Dark Fate' seems nothing more than just a publicity stunt and the first trailer didn't wow me at all.I don't believe Cameron devoted much time to this. Mainly down to some questionable plot points that are criminal and don't pay off.Directed by Tim Miller many critics (me not included) believe that 'Dark Fate' is actually the best sequel since 'Terminator 2' but that could be like saying it's the least ugly duckling in a brood of really ugly ducklings.Thankfully this isn't fake praise and 'Dark Fate' is a decent but not great attempt at trying to continue the story after the events of 'T2: Judgement Day'.In fact go ahead and forget those other sequels. They're no longer recognised.'Dark Fate' works in places mainly down to the old saying
""If it ain't broke, don't try fixing it!""
But by the same yardstick it also means that this film is devoid of anything original.Except some bold but not thought through choices.Unlike 'Salvation' which actually did try and do something fresh with the franchise.There's going to be many a fan that won't appreciate how a certain major character is treated and it could be said that this film takes a massive dump on the memory of T2.'Dark Fate' is essentially just another chase movie where a robot is again hunting someone and someone else is trying to protect them.When the CGI dust settles it is obvious to see that this sequel is yet another lazy attempt.Where 'Salvation' is underrated 'Dark Fate' is overly praised. I believe in time this film will not be as well received.'Salvation' was met with glowing reviews upon release but ten years on and it is no longer regarded positively.It is 22 years since Sarah and John Connor prevented Judgment day. Now a newly advanced Terminator is sent back to kill a young girl named Dani. An augmented super soldier is also sent to intercept the Terminator and protect the young girl. Like aforementioned it's the same formula as previous movies.Cameron's supposedly penned story follows the tried and tested 'Terminator' format and it's certainly not breaking any new ground.This is where my skepticism grows as to Cameron's actual involvement.A revolutionary storyteller such as he would have come up with something more imaginative than this.If there's a key ingredient to this films success it is going to be the return of Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor.She's still bad ass and It is apparent that this is her story and Arnold Schwarzenegger isn't the key to this movies appeal.Arnie does return and is sparingly but effectively used. His character arc is in some ways clever but you do get the sense it could have been explored and explained a little further.Arnie's aged Cyborg has somehow developed a conscious even without the chip in his head being meddled with.Anyone who's seen the Directors cut of T2 will know what I'm referring to.However Arnie eats up every moment he's on screen.Natalia Reyes as Dani does a good job at conveying the growth and development of her character but it is without doubt Mackenzie Davis that steals the show as enhanced super soldier Grace.She's even more bad ass than Hamilton. We could have a new action star here. Davis is totally convincing in some wonderfully staged action set pieces.This is perhaps the main attribute that this film offers. The action scenes are some of the best in the franchise.Gabriel Luna as the new Rev-9 Terminator is great. Not quite as good as the menacing Robert Patrick as the T1000 but still a believable killing machine with the ability to better interact with humans.'Terminator: Dark Fate"" is an improvement on the previous sequel from a franchise that's had more reboots than an old PC.It's not going to win everyone over.My opinion of this movie like that of 'Last Jedi' has altered with time to reflect.Director Tim Miller has crafted a film that moves along at an exciting pace.At 2hrs 8mins I do feel more could have been added. The story that Cameron and his co-writers have Supposedly created does need more time in order to truly flesh out this new world and its Eyebrow raising character arcs.The opening scene is jarring and choices made are never truly justified or earned with regards to a decent payoff at the end of the movie.Edward Furlong fans beware!That said I was pleasantly surprised just how much better this film was as the trailers didn't do it any justice.Perhaps this franchise is still relevant?I'm not so sure. Even with the supposed help from the creative mind of Cameron himself.This franchise just seems to be fresh out of original ideas. Can it continue?Only the box office numbers will tell.",Terminator - Dark Fate

For years now I have been watching Asian movies and they are mostly fresh and with good stories and new ideas. They rarely over use the modern Hollywood gimmicks of CGI and Explosions as a substitute for a good script.The US film industry has lost its way it hasnt been a good time for Hollywood movies for a long time and I cannot see it changing anytime soon.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Yeah, the plane reveal takes a step onto the nose and the main plot's a rehash but the lead trio is so refreshing to watch (see Dani's tear-jerking use of Spanish at the end) and Carl and Sarah's history adds some seasoning to the story skillet. As for its meat, the set pieces are phenomenal (see the dam sequence leading to the thrilling final team-up).

188,Mike_Devine,More like 'Tired Fate',5,5 July 2021,"In 2019, after so many years after the high point of the 'Terminator' franchise, we were finally reunited with the original Sarah Connor - Linda Hamilton. 'Terminator: Dark Fate' was clearly an attempt to recreate the magic from 'T2.'Despite the valiant effort, 'Dark Fate' ain't great. The concept is intriguing, and the familiar faces we're reunited with help in some respect. But by this point, audiences are suffering from ""Terminator fatigue."" No amount of action, including big rig highway chases and shoot 'em up/recover sequences between man and machine, can rescue the film from itself. Sure, there are some moments when 'Dark Fate' feels like it has the potential to be great, but they are overshadowed by the schlocky dialogue and predictable plot.One of the few highlights here is our introduction to Mackenzie Davis, a rootable heroine who is sent back from the future alongside the latest model from Skynet's collection - REV-9 (Gabriel Luna). Davis is equal parts badass and unapologetically human, and she is the yin to Hamilton's yang. And while Arnold isn't as rusty as he was in the previous entry in this series, his new T-800 does not feel nearly as authentic as his older models.'Terminator: Dark Fate' is hopefully the last in a series of mediocre sequels to this once great cinematic franchise.",Terminator - Dark Fate

190,SnobReviews,"""Terminator: Dark Fate"" has its flaws but is still entertaining.",6,6 November 2019,"""Terminator Dark Fate"" is explosive fun and a better film than the other Terminator reboots, but the writing is thin and the film is too long.
.
In this science-fiction action film and direct sequel to ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"", Sarah Connor and a hybrid cyborg must protect a young girl from a newly modified Terminator from the future.
.
Although action packed and features some of those Terminator action sequences we love, ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" doesn't really come alive until Arnie shows up. The acting is a little blah and the storyline is slightly exaggerated, but it does show how James Cameron has creative control on this sequel because the quality of the film is way better than the others. I did expect more from this instalment but regardless of its flaws, I was still entertained and think it's a better film than the ones we've seen in recent years.",Terminator - Dark Fate
191,daisukereds,"I wished this was better, but it is just okay.",3,10 November 2019,"There is nothing outstanding about this movie. Everything is fine.. the action, the direction, the editing, sound, design, etc. The worst parts are some of the characters and the story (which are tied together). The new terminator guy is your generic actor that could have been played by anyone. In fact, he could have been replaced by a CGI robot for the entire movie and that would have been better. He isn't visually striking or appealing, he just is. Forgettable villain, cool CGI.. no memorable action scenes.The worst of the bunch is the new main character. Dani is by far the most forgettable in the entire saga (if the terminator guy had more than 4 lines, I would count him as a character), and the actress just doesn't fit the role at all. The movie makes a point of being a women movie and letting you know about it (not in a good way, unlike the original), as well as being diverse for the sake of it.The rest of the cast does a fine job, specially Sarah Connor, which remains a believable badass and still has relevance.. sadly, she is not the focus of the movie and should have been.
The change to the original Terminator character was just.. dumb.
And the new Kyle does a believable job at action ""man"". She is good, a shame no more Terminator movies will be made after it flops. Though I hated her interactions and lines.. specially with Sarah.The story could have gone in a really interesting direction, but it's a simple checklist of everything we've seen already. At this point, it's hard to accept that a super indestructible robot is unable to accomplish a simple murder mission.. Just send one with a nuclear bomb attached to it.Though I admit it has some really good CGI at the beginning! After that, there are times when it's kind of noticeable.I'd give this a 3, but I really liked Linda Hamilton in it.",Terminator - Dark Fate
192,kgprophet,Terminator 6? No Thanks,4,19 February 2020,"Whether the producers of this sequel wanted to wish away the existance of the previous 3 sequels, this still is the sixth Terminator movie that has been made. As much as the producers wanted to convince audiences that this sequel was different, most of the tropes are there. The buzzing and zap of the time bubble arriving. The guessing game at the beginning of who is the good robot and who is the bad robot. The literally mandatory action scenes.The only moments of interest come through in the complexities of Grace, an 'augmented' human from the future. Having recognized her from ""Blade Runner 2049"", Mackenzie Davis has a very symmetrical, almost sculpted, physique. Her extreme emotions generate some good humour. As for the rest of the cast, meh. Why the John Connor in the form of a young girl who works a blue collar job? The new terminator is more ordinary looking and frankly doesn't look menacing enough. Why bring back Grandma Sarah? And Grandpa T-800? Ugh. Especially since Sarah is cast as being in a constant bad mood. No fun.Of course there is no deviation from the normal story arc. Two people from the future touch down and create havoc. A chosen one must be saved at all costs. The new Terminator tracks them down. Cue the scenes from the future, after the apocalypse, again. There is a distracting subplot that Grace needs some kind of drug to stay alive. Then the totally over the top and groan worthy appearance of Grandpa Terminator. Complete with wife and kids? The actions scenes, while well put together, still were derivative of Terminator 2, specifically using a big truck and a helicopter. Then there is the last second character development for the new John Connor. Like out of nowhere now she is this fearless leader?In general, the flurry of bullets trying to stop the new Terminator gets tedious, but I really don't have much attachment to the main characters other than Grace. Here's hoping this sequel finally buries this burned out franchise.",Terminator - Dark Fate
193,dianamarinelli,Okay movie the first two are the best,6,5 May 2021,Overall not a terrible movie but there are so many plothole. Killing John Connor in the first five minutes and they did Arnold so dirty. They miss his iconic lines.,Terminator - Dark Fate
194,W011y4m5,Original concept. Poor execution.,5,26 January 2020,"More proof that The Terminator movies should've swiftly ended with the satisfying conclusion provided in James Cameron's masterpiece: Judgement Day.Unfortunately, we're instead subjected to a desperate attempt from studios to milk the brand for every last penny it's capable of ever finally producing & thus, this gluttony results in the dire creation of another unnecessary sequel in the form of Dark Fate - acting as the pitiful death rattle of the drawn out franchise.Cameron concocted the story for the film which was then adapted by several other writers & additionally, he had a hand in producing... But regardless, none of this is of any consequence because ultimately, it takes a great director to realise the potential of their project by developing & nurturing the concepts featured for them to be truly rewarding & sadly, they aren't here.Surprisingly, this installment does ask one intriguing philosophical question (most likely from the mind of James), deciphering the differentiation between alterations to the future & destiny; discovering whether one are the same thing - if an event is prevented from ever occuring, will time reassert itself & ensure that eventually, it continues to happen anyway? Hence, is resistance futile in the face of the inevitable? That's FASCINATING to comprehend - contemplating the fact that armageddon is the ""fate"" of our species & not its avoidable future...However, this idea evidently isn't appreciated for the genius potential reinvention of our understanding that it is so Tim Miller alternatively just bombards the audience with mindless visual spectacles instead, rushing from one unconvincing CGI set piece to another in an endlessly arduous stream of computer generated action sequences. No tension, no stakes.How I miss the practical effects featured in T1 & T2!Please, just end it. No more after this.
I can't shake the feeling that maybe things would've been far different & this would've likely been much superior if the creator did return to the helm (as opposed to the guy who made Deadpool) but ironically, we can't change the past so sadly, I guess we'll never know.",Terminator - Dark Fate
195,Danny_G13,A hybrid mess Terminator which doesn't know what it is,6,15 January 2020,"I'm going to come out with the biggest problem this movie has, before even going any further:It can't decide if it's a Terminator for the fans, or a Terminator for a new generation, and ends up being a mess of a hybrid between both.It doesn't quite scale the appalling heights of the miserable Terminator Genisys in terms of messiness, but it's not far off, and Salvation continues, of a very very bad bunch, to be the most solid post-T2 movie in the franchise - probably because it's just a decent tale on its own, rather than being intrinsically tied to the rest of the series.It's hard to do a review for this movie without spoilers, because the key plot points are what confuses the audience between established fans and a new generation. But I'll go for it.I don't mind the new generation idea, I really don't - I just didn't want it in this series. What I mean is this might have worked as a modified spin off, a story in the Terminator universe to bring new fans in without completely p*ssing off existing fans - kind of like how Fear the Walking Dead complimented TWD so well without undermining it or its fans.Unfortunately, as a 'canon' story, and a supposed 'proper' sequel to T2 it's a hundred miles off being good enough, and it's evident that creative arguments between Cameron and Miller undermined any chance of this thing working.Why Cameron came on board this I don't know - but the end result is so bad that both he and Miller have officially washed their hands of being responsible - frankly they blame each other. Cameron says it's really Miller's film, Miller says he basically had no control.And that mess is evident on the screen.There are so many ruinations of established Terminator tropes, and because Cameron is on board with this, we take those violations more seriously than the nonsense of 3-5. Cameron basically dismissed those films as 'fan fiction' and then managed to be significantly responsible for something just about as bad.As an action film alone, isolated, without any standard to compare to, this is an ok movie - there is no denying it's fairly entertaining, and Mackenzie Davies' Grace is a fine leading character. Arnold's T-800 works alright even if his plotline is just a completely disgrace, and Arnie shows he still has it even in his old age. And Reyes' Dani is *alright* in terms of it being an isolated movie.But it isn't, and when you take the fact it's supposed to be cannon, her brand new character is garbage - kind of like, (again another TWD reference) the rotten third series of TWD video game which abandons characters we love and replaces them with a completely new family we don't care about - we just don't care about Dani, why would we?Unfortunately, I hated this Sarah Connor - I understood why she's so broken, and Linda Hamilton played the role as well as she could, but the anti-hero Sarah Connor of the second one has been replaced by, frankly, a bitter old hag (for honestly unacceptable reasons but no spoilers). She didn't even look the part - it just didn't feel like the character we love.And the Rev9 Terminator looked way too much like Jon Cryer to be able to take him seriously. About as threatening as My Little Pony.The action sequences were ok, not great, but ok, but the CGI was horrendous. I'm seeing so much praise for them but honestly I felt like I was watching such forced rendering - it rarely looked convincing, especially when the Rev9 was in the air. Too fake.All-in-all this is a franchise which hasn't known what it's doing since T2, and not even the return of its daddy could fix it - Cameron and Miller conspired to make a hash of it, and their new story is equal or even worse than the 'fan fiction' which preceded them.As I say, as a movie in its own right, not attached to anything, it wasn't bad - it was ok, and I've seen worse. As a Terminator movie, it just shouldn't exist.",Terminator - Dark Fate
196,Med-Jasta,How to explain such a terrible movie...,1,12 March 2020,"Shameless rehash of T2. I was surprised at how much it followed the structure of 2. The idea of how the machines take over made sense: someone else would do it, I guess.I don't normally notice plot holes and things on a first watch. I noticed them this time. When the new bad guy is looking for Arnold in his house and finds the picture of the work van on the refrigerator my friend yelled in the theater, ""Why would that be on there?"" And he's right. Arnold wasn't standing next to his work van. There was just a picture of his work van on the fridge so the bad guy knew what car they were driving.Then the good guys go to get a bomb to kill the bad guy and when the bad guy attacks them they don't use the bomb. The whole reason they went to get it was to kill the bad guy and the bad guy attacks and they don't use it. What?The line, ""I'll be back,"" was used too many times in this. This franchise created the line and then killed it. I thought Arnold had killed it long ago when using it in every movie other than Terminator but I was wrong, this movie killed it. It's officially terminated.The bad guy comes and is defeated so many times that he stops being a threat and just becomes a nuisance.The only cool scene was the flashback because the technology was flawless, that's it.Complete waste of time.

Or the forced feminism?,5,7 November 2019,"After watching this movie, I was surprised to see a RT 71% based on a total count of 272 critics and an 84% audience score based on 7,442 counts. If the whole universe is appreciating it, why is it considered to be the next flop, and no one seems interested in paying for this flick?I think it is the same critics of Deadpool that were paid off to generate some hype. The script had no character development. Even Genisys was far better than this soft sequel. I know T:G has an IMDB rating of 6.4 but at least China managed to save it from being a box office flop. Who is going to save T:DF? It has a rating of 6.5 and I think it will drop to 6 by the time it has ended its run. Not even the magic combo of Cameron, Schwarzenegger and Hamilton will save it from being 'terminated'!

198,Cinema_Fan,It feels it does little else but hold its breath when having something to say.,4,29 October 2019,"Who would have thought that thirty-five years would pass since the original blockbuster science-fiction film ""The Terminator"" (1984) and that we would be watching a reboot of the Terminator franchise? ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" (2019) conjoins alongside ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" (1991) and thus leapfrogs across the timeline to the present with what we see here with ""Dark Fate"".This latest edition to the extended family is a fair attempt to travel into the future and project a whole new angle on a fresh face of cinema goers. This is new-generation progressiveness to both enhance and perpetuate the ""Terminator"" franchise and it has done a fine job for the millennials' to enjoy and consume. The future here is bright and no doubt shall be very reproductive.This new addition comes out screaming and shouting great effects and action, with an all-female lead that brings this triplet baby shower to a wonderful level of liberated vigilantes. We see Linda Hamilton reprising her role as ""Sarah Connor"", who brings an edge of maturity and guidance to the proceedings, that only a touch of tough-love can bring. While we have the irrepressible Mackenzie Davis, as ""Grace"", providing strength and determination to assist the survival of the youthful and inexperienced Natalia Reyes who plays ""Dani Ramos"". Three generations of ladies playing their irrespective roles in the hierarchy of knowledge and experience makes a fine combination and drives the adventure to new heights with each player serving one inevitable goal of a global responsibility.Theoretically a road movie that plays as a high-octane survival trip combining superb fist-fights, vehicle destruction and every inch not being wasted in the visual theatrics. The only bugbear here is that without these visual sweeteners there really is not much left to ponder within the context of the whole. It simply is that, a road movie of great expectations but it can seem a little too convoluted in parts when all else has been proven, said and done that it feels it does little else but hold its breath when having something to say. Nonetheless ""Dark Fate"" is a weighty attribute within the Terminator family and with each passing addition we look forward to seeing how this partner shall grow and develop.",Terminator - Dark Fate
199,DeBBss,The Most Obvious Cash Grab That I Have Ever Seen,5,27 October 2020,"Terminator: Dark Fate is the sixth installment in the Terminator franchise, and at this point, I think the franchise has been milked to its bitter end. You can tell that this franchise is practically dry because this movie is literally Terminator 2: Judgement Day, but without John Connor. There's absolutely nothing new in this movie, absolutely nothing. Terminator: Dark Fate is truly saddening, because as a huge fan of the franchise, you can tell that everybody is tired of it, to the screenwriters and to the actors. Arnold and Linda Hamilton are so visually exhausted of the franchise.First of all, the plot is stupid. There are numerous subplots that just don't make any sense, like the terminator that killed John Connor suddenly having a conscientious. Secondly, the amount of disrespect to the older films. To kill John Connor at the beginning of the film, then to replace his role with a bland, one-dimensional Mexican chick. John Connor is what made Terminator 2: Judgement Day so amazing, and to make that movie completely useless because they wanted to make another sequel is just pure disrespect to the fans. This is just proof that the studios don't care about the fans, just the money. Thirdly, the lack of creativity. I've already mentioned about how similar this movie is to the second, and it really shows that there are no more new ideas with this franchise. By far what makes this movie so bad was the entire plot.I really don't know what the filmmakers were thinking when producing this thing, but man did they screw it up. I could think up of several different plots right off the top of my head, but they went with the worst possible option. Terminator: Dark Fate is the most obvious cash grab that I have ever watched, and what's really sad? They didn't even try to hide it. Let's just have some faith that this franchise ends now, before it can get any worse.",Terminator - Dark Fate
200,Intermissionman_,The Way It Had to Be,9,11 November 2019,Great Job to all involved on the Film. Especially the Big 3 fighting the new Terminator and keeping Dani safe. Thought the Story line played out the way it had to be. Will see again.,Terminator - Dark Fate
201,DuskShadow,Men+Sacrifice=Female Happiness...WTF?!,4,6 December 2019,"I am being a hunred percent honest here.Many people go off about "" Oh sjw"" this or "" to hell with that because of blah blah"", but few if anyone seems to actually know why. At the least most reational people can recognize when something is obviously off and being focused in a single direction at the expense of another. And many modern film franchises are no different.
Just as throughout human existence, where men were the hunters and protectors and one of the two pillars of the human species alongside women, for some reason, men always got sacrificed more often than people are willing to admit.
The ability to act in a situation because osmething is morally imperative is not the same as a supposed obligation to do what others find might be approvable. Nor is something just done because one gets paid or is in that position. There is a greater deeper drive to protect and look out for others that is at the heart of true men that is sorely underappreciated in the world. Yet this is not the first time.
At given times in the ancient world leading up to the downfall of a famed civilization, there were a few common occurences that heralded the end yet to come:
They usually followd a period of extra prosperousness that was almost undue, followed by all sorts of rights and ideas and paths taken by groups that wanted to carve out a small corner of the already well defined spaces of the world, which would be fine if this didnt come at the cost of lives and the happiness of others. This then is followed by stagnation, bloated excesses, underappreciation for those that truly do the work and protect, which were usually 99.9%+ men, followed by pure emasculation of the male populace. This then almost immediately within a generation leads to a lack of militia or fighting forces/ defenders whom see no reason to carry on for those that do not want or care for their protectors, which then leads to more excess and unrest, economic collapse, and finally societal destruction. In the past it was at the hands of so called "" barbarians"" that simply rolled over cities left and right as if they were putting up no fight at all.
We are at the precipice of such a time now. One again, we stand more divided than ever without realizing whats truly important or recognizing those that do so much for us. However, in an age of equality, in a sense, though men still do the majority, many women for the last few decades have tried to join in, pulling their weight and gaining insight into even part of what men on average go through and are expected to do.
Since so many people are going to die in yet another judgement day, its okay, since its an action movie, that more than 40 men for ever 1 woman dies in this film. The feminism, if that even means anything nowadays, is all too palpable. Yet even when one of the main leads is a woman, old enough to have been around for the real days of feminism in its 2nd wave hayday, the film goes to pot. Every chance to save a man that was in imminent danger was averted. A man always got his skull veritably crushed against a wall in a small confined space, yet a woman in the same room just got knocked out...WTF?! ROFLOLMFAOMFGAFFSMFH.
Every time there was even the slightest lead that a man could help or do this, or even one day be the savior of mankind, as was the theme of Terminator previously, that was thrown out the window with the male child like some Amazonian birth selection process of olde.
Yet Since Arnolda is clearly back, as seen i nthe previews, he can help as much as possible, since he is technically not a man. This is alwso technically an aspect of hollywood trying to sell people on the virtues of transhumanism, but thats for another time to be discussed. But look into it, its real and coming.
At times Dark Fate was good just for action, but only so much that it was obviously trying to do nothing different than ANY former film in the franchise. Yet EVEN THEN it was not enough. I would lie if I said I wanted to be wrong, but after watching every sequence from this impressively lanky and fit young blonde lady, somwhow she just fizzled out. ""Oh to creat empathy we need to slow her down."" NO YOU DONT! Wheres the Lara Croft tom raiders?! Wheres the Kitanas from Mortal Kombat or the Chun Lis that can kick ass with the rest of the boys?!
ANd so many other great female leads that never took a single name, they just kicked ass?
A real man wants a woman thats fairly equal to stand next to him, as close as can be, but hollywoods game is misdirection, propoganda and lies.
There was once a hope of story progression with the Christian Bale film years ago, that would show the future and allow for a true continuation and explanation of events, and perhaps an eventual conclusion that was asatisfactory, but that got ditched too. Honestly the franchise cannot come back form such blunders that Genysis and Dark Fate have commited. Not without another retcon in the vein of comic books from the mid to late 1990s onwards. But we know even that does not always work, because people cannot simply forget an abomination and vile perversion of something they love. NObody should be asked to do something so heinous and traitorous. Would you trade a beloeved friend or relative for a poor atomoton copy? Nope, not if you have any sense at the least. This is what ruined Star Wars for millions upon millions. Its not that theres a female lead, its just that the ones chosen cannot even lead themselves well in a role. Especially not in a film directed by a person that has lost the pulse for some other random onjective. Just leaves a bad taste and memory for all i nthe long run.
But hey, go watch the film and count how many men died compared to woman in Dark Fate. How many easter eggs all films have to have to subconsciously fool people into thinking its okay to just blatantly copy parts of the older properties. If you are a vapid, lackluster fool, waste your money and go see the film after reading this. You dont deserve that cash or that time back if you cannot head the warning of one whom knows, amidst countless that also could see the writing on the well before the ink left its well.
Its crystal clear at times that the real fans have been scarificed for the sake of whatever smaller number this film is pandering to. Hollywood like most media franchises have lost their way and diminished from the high age of the mid 80s to the early 2000s.
Shame that Terminators Fate cannot be changed. It will remain uninspiring, Dark, and will never ""Be Back"". 4/10",Terminator - Dark Fate

director: Tim miller/James Cameron
starring: Arnold schwartznegger,Linda Hamilton,Mackenzie Davis,Gabriel Luna,Natalia Reyes etcOverall rating 88/100Terminator dark fate focuses on the character daniella who is essential to saving the future. A adapted and more dangerous terminator ( Gabriel Luna) is sent from the future to kill her. But a genetically inhanced human soldier has also been sent from the future to protect her. And with the help from some familiar faces they must stop the evil that is trying to put a stop to the needed future. I really enjoyed terminator dark fate and for me it was a return to form for the franchise lets talk about why this is.First of all i loved the villain and the creativity of the new terminator. Gabriel Luna did a solid performance at playing the villian here. He took no prisoners and he really was brutal and got rid of everything that was in his path to daniella. Therefore as an audience member he was an enjoyable villain and when he was eventually killed it was more satisfying as they made him seem indestructible. And the whole design of him splitting into human and terminator form was clever and fun to watch as he really was unbeatable for a long time. And i liked that they hinted at the theme of robots taking over in factories. I think due to the rise in making of robots in todays society i thought it was a nice little touch to add what the implications of a larger use of robots would look like.Next the action sequences and final act was fantastic. The action sequences got bigger and bolder as the film progressed and therefore the film just got more and more entertaining. The film didn't hold back which i loved and i think the 15 rating helped the film as well. And the final act was fantastic. The Setting and spectacle of where the action was taking place was really interesting and creative. And they managed to create a doubt in our minds about whether this terminator could actually be killed so this was well executed.However i do have to say the CGI was slightly poor and unrealistic in places. Some of the action sequences and close ups of Gabriel Luna as the terminator looked unfortunately very unrealistic in places. This was largely when he was transitioning into his liquidised terminator form and when he was jumping through the air. He almost seemed like a video game character in places which is not what the director should be going for and i was surprised at this due to the 185M budget.Next i thought Arnold Schwartznegger was fantastic here and he bought a lot of humour to the movie. Arnold is just so enjoyable to watch and he made the most of all the screen time he had. He just has such a great precense to him with his outfits and voice that you cant help but smile every time he appears on screen. He was also surprisingly hilarious in dark fate as well. The fact that he was living with humans for so long he began to develop a more human personality and feelings. This bought out many funny interactions between all the characters especially Linda Hamilton.Adding on to the previous point Linda Hamilton was brilliant. I am very glad that she was bought back for this. She kicked a lot of ass and she was just fantastic to watch. Her interactions and largely hatred towards Arnolds terminator were hilarious as she had no filter so she said exactly what she thought of people. Also surprisingly she bought a few emotional beats to the movie. Due to her son being murdered when she was younger. She got surprisingly emotional in some aspects of the film. The fact that she never took photos of her son was sad to hear as she said that she sometimes forgets his face. And Arnolds respect for her left for a very sweet moment at the end when he sacrificed himself which was well executed.My final negative for me would be the pacing inconsistencies of the second act. The first act and the final act as i have said was fantastic. But the second act was slow and dragged in places. There was a lot of conversation or moving around locations that left my mind wondering only in places. The movie soon got me invested in the film again. But it would of been nice if my investment and interest in the film was consistent.But my final positive for me would the standout performance of Mackenzie Davis. Wow she was fantastic. She had a powerful presence in the whole film. She had fantastic action sequences great depth to her character which i appreciated through flashbacks. And the whole concept of her being enhanced was really interesting as well. So i really hope she gets the recognition she deserves for this performance.Overall despite having poor CGI in places and not being consistently fantastic. Terminator dark fate offers fans a return to form for the franchise. with Great writing,development,characters and action. And it offers us the fact that all the franchise needed was a new director and the return of James Cameron.",Terminator - Dark Fate
204,gavinp9,"Good action, but not up to Terminator standards",6,2 November 2019,"'Terminator: Dark Fate' is the sixth film in the franchise, but effectively acts as a direct sequel to 'Judgement Day' and ignores everything that happened in 'Rise of the Machines', 'Salvation' and 'Genisys'. Since it's pretending those timelines never happened, it borrows ideas from each of them. Unfortunately, this film's first few minutes also taint the whole point of T2.It's good to see Sarah Connor (Hamilton) back, and (eventually) Arnie as ""Carl"". However, the main characters this time are Dani (Reyes) and Grace (Davis). Grace is an augmented human, sent back from the future to protect Dani, a Mexican factory worker. They're hunted by a Rev-9 (Luna), a Terminator that can separate it's nanites from its skeleton. Looks cool, but not revolutionary after 'Genisys'. It's essentially one big car/helicopter/plane chase.Since this if from Miller ('Deadpool' director), there's no real humour or fun, which is a shame. Plenty of explosions and good fight scenes, and both David and Reyes are solid, but Arnie has far too little screen time, the film has way too many clunky explanations for what's happened to the future - pesky time travel! - but the biggest let down is how unoriginal most of it feels and how the Sarah/John Connor storyline that was set up in the other five films seems to be betrayed.",Terminator - Dark Fate

206,mike-c-b,Bad editing,1,13 January 2020,"Take everything other people have said about this movie and add bad editing. Every terminator jumping around like they weigh nothing. Flying for no reason like superman. Jump cuts scattered inbetween like it's supposed to be ""intense""...From the start they don't let you settle into the scene and atmosphere with a long ASMR sensation. There's sparks in the air as a new terminator arrives. Two people standing nearby go into full fear-acting mode. The terminator is in full ""woe is me"" mode. The cops show up to the scene in full fear-acting mode. The terminator is naked, but it's 100% tricks (cutting, lighting, shakey cam), instead of zooming way out. This is all about 30 seconds total when it should be a good 5 minutes. There is absolutely no feel for any of these people, so why follow what happens? Every other scene afterwards is panicky arguing. Over acting, cliches, hyper fast movement, no atmosphere, don't care what happens to anyone... so why bother?",Terminator - Dark Fate
207,pkpera,"Current IMDB av. rating is OK by me (6.4), and as usual, very different reviews",6,15 January 2020,"I watched this with low expectations, partially because Genisys (huh - same rating), what was worst by me in 6 Terminator movies so far. Then comes T3. Salvation was OK for me, and there was something new, instead too busy Arnold :-)First 30 minutes were basically T2 in big part, and some T1 scenes, 'revisited'. Was it for younger audience, or just to warm up ? :-) Must admit that I laughed couple times, it was so similar to original scene. 'This will be long 2 hours' crossed my mind. But then, story started to develop. Nothing really original, but at least we had finally new movie :-) I really don't get those offended by strong female characters. And in any case, this is case of movie without clear leading character.
What is probably one of reasons why many did not like it. Mackenzie Davies was fine, as Linda Hamilton in her age with action scenes. And Columbian actress Natalia Reyes . Was not much happy with direction.And important thing in Terminator movies: visual effects (CGI) : for some 180 M budget and almost 30 years after T2 - not much good. Replacing silver with black at liquid metal terminator was bad idea by me - looked somehow cheap. And those transitions looked rushed. I was thinking: is it me, spoiled with all new visual effects in last decades not being impressed or it is really worse than T2 effects ? So, needed to dig out T2 and look some scenes. Indeed much better.
Maybe they spent too much on early scenes with real people (actors) CGI scene ? What was fine, indeed.There was some humor here and there, and we got some announcements about future participation of some actor. Best was by mandatory weapon filled room (for T movie) scene - like he just did it because in that state it is normal :-)Now, some comment comments: many did not like female as warriors, leader, but that's their problem, not movie's. Too much similarity with mostly T2 is surely not so good thing - and it was especially in first and last half hour present. But since this is story by not so young James Cameron - what did you expect ? After Avatar ? As said, CGI is not top notch, but served.Some said that this is end of Terminator franshize, they killed it and like. Well, much less than what is done with Star Wars. And time travel offers endless opportunity for new Planet Earth/Humanity destiny twists. So, I expect that after some years, it may be new Terminator movie, likely without James Cameron and Arnie, Linda. If something bad does not happen again - without bad machines, in this World, real one, not really going right direction :-(",Terminator - Dark Fate
208,patches89,HES BACK!,8,17 November 2020,"Now this is better after the awful Genisys we get a film thats a more worthy sequel to T2 than any that came after it. Yes it reconned the story with having the T-800 kill John at a tiki bar and now the hope of humanity is a young Mexican girl who is being hunted by....yes you guessed it, a terminator. She's on the run with the help of a returning Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, Grace (Mackenzie Davis) and Carl/T-800 (Arnie). This film has split opinion but you can see the involvement from James Cameron. The story is much more coherent and the writing also. The right people were casted and the set pieces were fantastic. A welcome return to a good film for the franchise but time will tell if it'll revive it for future films",Terminator - Dark Fate

There were some leaps in logic but it is TERMINATOR. Fun stuff!",Terminator - Dark Fate
210,movieman6-413-929510,Terminator: Dark Fate looks more like a reboot than a new movie from the series.,4,2 November 2019,"Terminator: Dark Fate is the sixth film from the Terminator film series. This film is directed by Tim Miller, the director of Deadpool.In the film, Grace (Mackenzie Davis) a hybrid human cyborg is sent back from the future to the past to protect Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) from a Rev-9 Terminator (Gabriel Luna) trying to kill her so she can kill it human resistance cannot begin in the future.
During her rescue mission, Grace meets Terminator Hunter Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), who is also trying to protect the world against Terminators who have come back from the future to the past for various obscure actions. Although Grace and Sarah collide with each other on how to best protect Dani, they still have to work together to stop the Rev-9 Terminator to protect the future against the upcoming robopocalypse.This new film is set in a new timeline and thus ignores all films that were released after the second Terminator film Judgment Day. Unfortunately, they have also chosen to make adjustments, which also change the storylines of the first two films. These changes make the first two films seem less or superfluous. Fans of the first two parts can therefore better try to avoid this new film or not take it too seriously. Due to the changes, this new film also comes across as a reboot of the original Terminator films and then completely from the second part.
It is remarkable that James Cameron, the director and writer of the first two films, came back for this new film as a co-writer and producer, while actually going against his own stories of the first two films.The effects also look good, but are no better than the effects they used in 1984 and 1991. CGI was not used as much in the past as it is used in films today. These effects used to look special in the past, while these effects are now used too much and can come across as standard or cliché. Many explosions in this film also show that they were placed in the film with a green screen.The best thing about this film is the acting, but the cast has to work with a well-known script. In this way nobody knows how to put their acting work in particular in this film. It's nice to see Linda Hamilton again in the role of an older and crankier Sarah Connor. Arnold Schwarzenegger has more of a cameo in this new film, but he still manages to create a few comic moments.",Terminator - Dark Fate
211,CountJonnie,"Actually a decent movie, partially a remake of Judgement Day, but almost ruined (terminated) by Natalia Reyes as the new female lead.",7,22 April 2020,"Dark Fate captured some hate, which might be an overreaction. Not completely original, this movie is basically a remake of Judgement Day with almost the same characters, just older and more CGI. The acting is mediocre, except for Grace. Schwarzenegger was partially a funny but effective sidekick, Linda Hamilton looked almost as if she didn't want to be there. But it was almost ruined by Reyes who is the new lead who has the annoying ability to act as if she's the leader with her dumb speeches, while not doing one single  besides getting saved.Another surprise was the new terminator who made the most of it, with few expressions and lines. Besides the previously mentioned flaws the movie has good effects, very good action, a fine pacing and is a good mix of old and new and is actually a decent conclusion to the parts of the Terminator franchise we DO love. If only it really IS the final installment.",Terminator - Dark Fate
212,Thrashman88,Action Packed Rehash,6,2 February 2020,"All Terminator sequels are decent, action packed rides that serve their purpose as 2 hour entertainment. With this being said, ""Terminator Dark Fate"" is no different with its rehashing/rebooting of the original 1984 film. Most ""fans"" of the franchise will agree that only the first two movies, ""The Terminator"" and ""Judgement Day"" are and will always be the relevant ones. The 3rd one more or less followed a logical timeline and the rest, well, they did whatever it took to make mindless entertainment. With James Cameron going on record saying THIS is the actual follow up to ""Judgement Day"", you'd think if he was on acid or some other mind altering drug. Killing off John Connor (digitally rejuvenated to near perfection) in the first 3 minutes of the movie, renders all the preceding action in ""Judgement Day"" pointless, much in the same way ""Alien 3"" did with Aliens. Not only it was pointless, it was downright ILLOGICAL: why send an older terminator model to kill John Connor when you had the shape shifting one from Judgement Day? ""Judgement Day"" re established the Terminator as a protector. Why REVERT it to a heartless killer? Again, if James Cameron backed this up, he must've been really, really high and out of himself.
Anyway, ""Terminator Darke Fate"", moves at a lightning fast pace, which is the movie's saving grace. So fast that when the climax finally arrives you feel it's just another action set piece, not the real finale. The Special FX for the most part work, specially the ""deaging"" ones seen in Sarah Connor, John Connor and the original Terminator. Some other FX (Like the plane and Hoover Damn sequence) look positively lame and right out of a video game.The new ""protector"", a half human, half cyborg named Grace, takes the place of Reese in the original. When I saw her, I wondered how a future world in ruins could develop such advanced technology by integrating a living human with mechanics so seamlessly. The protégée, a young Mexican woman named Dani Ramos, is the NEW terminator's target. That new terminator is also a Mexican looking dude, which is a nice twist. Maybe by the next movie we'll have a Chinese Terminator, a black terminator, a Muslim terminator and so forth.
The real story here is (copy/paste the original Terminator 1984 summary here).In all fairness, ""Terminator Dark Fate"" is quite entertaining if you don't focus on the illogical and absurd ""twists"" the director and writer make. It's sad to see a franchise that could've rivaled other successful ones treated with such a high level of disrespect, even by its OWN creator. While it's always nice to see Arnie, and a glorious come back by Linda Hamilton, they were nothing more than massive Easter eggs and a means to ""link"" this sequel to its source.Just watch and try not to think too much about it and I'm sure you will also enjoy ""Terminator Dark Fate"".",Terminator - Dark Fate
213,ritera1,Entertaining and badass,8,27 January 2021,"Of course the big draw is the action scenes. The first 25 minutes was packed with a solid 20 minutes that worked very well. The ending on the cargo plane was very effective, too. (Standing on the gangway in mid-air was silly, though.) The brief conflict with Grace in the future ""flashback"" felt jumbled and mumbled. The INS section was conventional.Mackenzie Davis' turn as a heroine worked really well and had the grit it needed.Linda Hamilton's character suffered from time constraints as they established she's a heavy drinker, looked it and portrayed as such. I was shocked how old she looked. But not enough time and screen time to examine her pain. Thus, she came off ugly, like all bad drunks.The goal in the writing with Arnold's reformed terminator was ambitious and interesting, but he doesn't have the chops to pull it off. Thus, it ran as just reciting backstory. At 70, he still can sell the battling terminator. The very brief moments of him talking about drapes was funny.Also about the terminator character. He fed the arrival of other terminators to Sarah Connor to give her something to live for. But he'd leave all that to chance as he easily killed her son? And Grace had his coordinates tattoo'd on her because she had a bad memory---but earlier easily recited the drugs she needed in the midst of a breakdown?As I've read in the imdb notes, I was also distracted by Arnold's dog and why it wasn't hostile to him. Good points about if he raised it as a puppy and that he was now reformed so not a threat to the dog. But was distracting as I was watching. If you don't show that in the movie, speculating later isn't enough.Major Dean, near the end, was a device to write themselves out of a hole and was way too easy. But, ""Meh,"" it's a Terminator movie.Natalie Reyes as the recycled John Connor was forgettable. Linda Hamilton got enough at the end of Terminator to make more of the character.Ironically before watching this I was thinking about the first and second. Like in Predator, I wondered why Skynet had not equipped the other Terminators with interior explosives if they failed their missions. Then they had Grace have the weapon against Gabriel Luna's terminator in her power supply. I guess the advanced AI of Skynet didn't think of that one.Although he did a great job of directing in Deadpool, Ted Miller's directing here was unspectacular. I'll assume it had something to do with his documented conflict with James Cameron in the editing phase. We'll see as he has nothing on his imdb schedule. Hopefully this hasn't killed his career.Why didn't the humans go back in time to head-off the end of the world or just escape?",Terminator - Dark Fate
214,WalkdenEntertainment,Dark Fate for the Franchise indeed..,6,31 October 2019,"More than 20 years has passed since Sarah Connor and her son, John, managed to stop Judgment Day. Naturally Sarah thought the threat was gone forever, but it turns out it was only postponed. Once again someone who can defeat the machines is identified and Robots from the future have been sent back- one to kill; one to protect. The Terminator is a new and highly advanced weapon known as a Rev-9 and its target is a young girl named Dani (Natalia Reyes). John Connor is no longer a target and Skynet is no more....Like each Terminator film, the young girl isn't alone. Her protector is Grace (Mackenzie Davis), a female super human with many ability. Naturally, she too is sent from the future. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) also catches up with the leading ladies and wants to tag along to prevent a terrible future for the world. To clarify, this film feels like a continuation from the film Terminator 2: Judgement Day and is simply ignoring the previous instalments.As a plot, our film has taken big risks which I feel we shock many fans, especially if you're a fan of the first two instalments (like myself).Needless to say it's enjoyable to see the return of both Linda Hamilton & Arnold Schwarzenegger (even if the reasoning behind it is a bit sly). I personally didn't have any issues with the returning characters or the introduction to new faces.Without giving spoilers, I was slightly dissatisfied with the lack of chemistry between both Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger in their roles. This is more relating to the way the film has been written and its general plot. Ah yes, the plot...Unfortunately this film is very familiar in regards to its general story and we know it too well by now. Two people are sent back from the future, they go on the run, travel somewhere safe, and run again until the end occurs. It's unfortunate the film hasn't changed the pace, only altering the plot.Action is generally enjoyable but there is nothing truly gripping here or anything that kept me on the edge of my cinema seat. This could be due to the large dose of CGI effects and green screen backgrounds.Overall, Terminator: Dark Fate is a solid effort considering it's the 6th Terminator film. While elements can be praised, such as the reuniting of familiar faces from the original film or introductions to new characters, the film takes some major risks in the plot which I fear will hurt many fans. The film's storyline is also nothing new and action scenes are loaded with CGI, taking away the suspenseful chills.5.7/10

217,madhukar30,Finally some justice to the franchise !!,7,22 August 2020,"Though I am a great fan of the Terminator franchise, I was very reluctant to see this movie for a while because of the fifth instalment. After a great start to the franchise The Terminator:T1 and T2: Judgement day, T3: raise of the machines turned into a dud followed by a somewhat promising T4: Salvation. T5: Genesis turned out to be a pathetic affair. So I had very low expectations when I started this sixth instalment, Terminator: Dark Fate aka T6.In about 30 minutes into the movie I found Terminator: Dark Fate extremely gripping and
I N T E N S E with lots of surprises springing up regularly. T6 luckily cut the mistakes that T3, T4 and T5 did, that is cutting up the over complicated Cyber Dyne, Skynet, Resistance, HK Hunter killer, T800, T1000, Judgement day, Kyle Reese Mumbo Jumbo etc. This I believe has made Terminator: Dark Fate a very interesting and a pure action cinema to even new viewers. The movie is loaded with very ""Cool"" action sequences and springs a host of surprises, about every 20 minutes.Linda Hamilton's return to the franchise along with newcomers McKenzie Davis and Natalia Rayes adds up tremendous on screen boost to take on the new Terminator Rev9, which is a credible and refreshing upgrade. Awesome screenplay keeps T6 very refreshing and intense for almost throughout the movie. Excellent stunts & cinematography lights up things on screen. Excellent VFX and production design needs a special mention, So does the spectacular Background Score. The movie never lags in any way. In the end all the credit & appreciation should go to the director Tim Miller for T6.If over the years, one has seen the movies from Terminator franchise, Terminator: Dark Fate is an unmissable movie. I am sure Terminator fans the world over will surely enjoy this one. I thought after T5, the franchise was dead but ""It is Back"". A must watch for all action fans around the world and not just T fans.....",Terminator - Dark Fate
218,theromanempire-1,The best terminator movie since judgment day. IGNORE THE HATER REVIEWS.,9,7 November 2019,"First I really want to warn you about those negative hater reviews. they have nothing to do with what this movie really worth.
unfortunately we live in days of hatred and trolling in internet.
if u are a fan u must watch this movie.
finally we get the real thing after like 30 years of waiting.
unfortunately after T2 we never got a real worthy T movie and that's the reason after so many years T:dark fate is not a success in the box office.
fans had enough disappointments with mediocre T movies and so far unfortunately they ignored this great film.
T:3 rise of the machines was when the things started to go wrong.
the movie was passable and made money back in 2003 but it was nowhere near the first 2 films.
then we got disaster. part 4 salvation was really a disaster. worst and most boring T film ever made. a nail to the coffin.
they tried to resurrect the franchise with genisys a few years ago but that was another disappointment as it was also a bit confusing as for timelines and how things were happening.
finally the NEW T MOVIE sets things right. u can ignore all previous 3 movies and after u watch T 1 AND T2 u can watch dark fate the real part 3 of the franchise.
arnie and linda may be old now but they still delivered the goods.
the movie had a great story...explained why things happened in a nice way and the action rocked.
if u exclude only like 10 minutes towards the end when we had like videogame fights all the rest of the movie including a superb ending which reminded that of the judgment day ending gets a clear A GRADE.so for me this is an A - (9,5 out of 10) and of course I will add it to my dvd collection.",Terminator - Dark Fate
219,ThyDavideth,"Pre Menstrual Cycle, Terminator Style",6,30 January 2020,"The fate of humanity no longer rest on the nuts of John Connor but on a female Mexican because, you know, social justice and a butch husky cyborg must protect her from a liquefied metamorphic over exo-skeleton terminator. Terminator: Dark Fate was not that bad, and believe me, I hate feminism and this movie has it in spades. The approach with the story, though not executed well, was actually decent making it paradoxical to which a future were Skynet no longer exists but a new menace called Legion is now the new front runner for technological terror. I hate that they killed John Connor and this new lame and r·tarded female character Dani Ramos (not a household name by any stretch of the imagination) becomes the new snatch face of the resistance but whatever.Some characters were good like the Rev-9 which reminds me of Noob Saibot from Mortal Kombat games and Ah-nold is always entertaining but what happen with Linda Hamilton? She has become an old bitter hag that sounds like she smoked one too many cigarettes. And the lesbian cyborg; oh she was unlikable. Just an obnoxious idiot with no personality that does nothing but whine and has raging periods constantly.The action was fun. I always enjoy a good cybernetic rumble from movies of this nature. The CGI was a little silly but it works just fine. So is this the worse Terminator ever? No. I think Genisys was worse. And, yes, I know no one likes feminism and wishes every one of them cows would succumb in a fire because macho women are laughably stupid beyond all basis of thought and social justice is worse than cancer but I thought Dark Fate was a simple dumb fun action movie.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Another franchise that the writers managed to destroy.The writers simply could not restrain themselves and managed to destroy this film. The movie had great potential, but in the end it turned out to be a total failure.The villain just talks too much and most of the characters are irritating.

But again, nothing is better in this one than T-2. Yes, the excitement went a little high when Linda Hamilton appears. Its like that T-2 relived moment. Mackenzie Davis was the wow factor in the movie, the way she came in its a complete entertaining. She is in for action movies big time and she has performed exceedingly well.

The fourth was another step in the right direction but then they had to screw it all up with godawful Genysis that I for the first time in years have become afraid for the franchise. And now Dark Fate is in theaters. After hearing so much negativity towards this one as well, trashing reviews and low scores I had the lowest expectations possible but the end result didn't disappoint me one bit: sure it's nothing new and the whole movie can easily be a collection of references tracing us back to the first two movies, sometimes smartly borrowing, something simply taking what was done before and redoing it shot-for-shot but it all comes down to a fine continuation of the story. I can see why so many people hated it - Dark Fate is basically a T2 remake but it's the one done right. Whereas Judgment Day tells us that the future is not foreseen and our fate is only up to us, Dark Fate embodies its name and says fate is something we have to get on board with and that whatever has to happen will happen.

The storyline is as same as that of the First two terminator movies.
Arnold and Sarah Connor is brought back for fans but Sarah Connor goes over the top and she's quite annoying.
They added some feminist ideas into this. Even though I am all for feminism, this feels forced.
Natalia Reyes's acting made me wish the Terminator actually get to kill her. Arnold and Mackenzie Davis did good. Gabriel Luna wasn't that good. But he wasn't bad either.
The bar is set so high by Robert Patrick that probably no one will ever get better than that.
Some shots from T2 are used which made me feel something for the movie.

A very flat and lifeless performance - just a mean and nasty portrayal of Sarah Connor.Too many plot holes: even the lame excuse for how Connor finds the hunted group on the bridge makes no sense; the way that there is information to Arnold is goofy since it would have had to happen prior for anyone to know (the cyborg) the coordinates; the bad killing hundreds to save one action scenes that made no sense; the horrible and ridiculous airplane scene; the list goes on and on.Too bad that movie franchises are starting to look like cheap imitations coming out of Mexico - first the bad Rambo and now the bad Terminator - these movies make both stars look ""expendable""",Terminator - Dark Fate
232,itsbobr,Pretty Good and there will be Sequels,9,29 January 2020,"Gabriel, (Gabriel Luna) a Rev-9 Terminator, is an advanced model, and is after Dani (Natalie Reyes) who is crucial to the fate of the world because she will be the mother of a son who will lead the Resistance against the new order of terminators: Legion. We will see Grace (MacKenzie Davis) an augmented human who has special powers to fight the Rev-9 and Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) fight to save Dani from Gabriel the Rev-9 Terminator.There are a lot of CGI battles so you need to be prepared for them. They do go on all the time, but the choreography and editing are excellent and you will believe everything is real because that is what you will see. Kudos.We don't see Arnold Schwarzenegger as Carl the former Terminator known as a T-800 for more than an hour into this. He is leading a simple life as a drapery fitter and is no longer the terror Sarah Connor believes she killed in a past Terminator movie. But Sarah keeps her distance from him as he was the one who killed Sarah's son John Connor and she vows to kill him after the fight with Gabriel, the Rev-9 Terminator is over.Notables: Fraser James as Major Dean who gives the EMP weapon (an electro mechanical Pulse weapon) to Grace that will kill Gabriel; Diego Boneta as Diego Ramos, Dani's brother; Enrique Arce as Dani's father; Tristan Uiloa as Felipe, Dani's uncle who helps them cross the US border.When MacKenzie Davis is on screen you cannot take your eyes off her and I am sure we will see more of her in other movies in time. She has great stage presence with great acting ability and is very pretty too. See? Nice to see Linda Hamilton fighting again and we always like seeing Arnold who is always very good. Natalie Reyes also did a good job as Dani.You would think that this ends the Terminator series, but not so fast. There's a scene at the end that shows Sarah Connor and Dani making a vow to keep a very young Grace, who (we see) is shown coming out of a playground, safe without fail this time. So we will have sequels. This movie will talk about different time lines that didn't seem to intersect each other. Don't try to understand this, just go with it. And, let's face It, Hollywood wants to keep this Terminator series alive. And so they will for sure. (9/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Humor: No. Language: Yes, but mostly in the beginning.
Rating: A",Terminator - Dark Fate
233,bastos,Terminator: Dark Franchise,6,19 May 2020,"I would like to start by saying this is a very hard movie to review due to all the baggage it carries. My first reaction was that I was pleasantly surprised with this entry of the franchise. After the terrible reviews and fan bashing I was expecting a mess of a movie and what I got was a very slick and entertaining sequel. It had a lot of things I liked such as the action sequences, especially in the first half, were all very very good. I really liked the terminator being a mix of the first and second one, kind of like the T3 one, but this time very well done, maybe a bit too talkative (but not as much as people are saying) and very menacing, you always had a sense that there was no stopping him, you were only delaying the inevitable, again like in the first two movies. Loved Mackenzie Davis in the Kyle Reese role, she brings a mix of vulnerability and strength that I liked a lot, and Arnie, for me, was a delight. Another thing I liked was how they had a very strong female trio and they weren't shoving it down your throat at every moment like, say, Charlie's Angels. Linda Hamilton on the other hand I didn't like at all, there was something off with her and she had a grandma vibe that I hated. Also the John Connor decision was a terrible one and their reasoning is that they needed to give Sarah Connor a new arch to make her character interesting. Wouldn't it be much better to have them both return and try to find a place in the world, now that Judgment Day had been avoided? T3 already had some of that, but the point of that movie was that the future could never be completely changed, but here it would be about John Connor becoming a hero in the present and that would be much much better than having grandma Sarah carrying a grudge for the rest of her life. And it's just unbelievably ironic that the biggest hater of Alien 3 would do this to his beloved franchise... And this brings me back to the Terminator franchise as a whole. Is it possible to have another incredible Terminator movie? I really don't think so. The first one was a B-movie, with a very limited budget and a great idea that became a classic due to it's star and director being the perfect duo to deliver such an entertaining movie. The second one is the true miracle of the franchise, because we had both Cameron and Arnie on top of their games at the exact time where the sfx were being revolutionized and they were able to up the ante and make an incredible sequel that had no right to be as good as it was. The problem is that the whole concept of the franchise relies on time traveling and all the paradoxes it creates, and there is a limit to what you can do with that before becoming either too confusing or just plain irrelevant because you stop caring. So, what next? Show that you can never stop Skynet? Done. Just show the future wars? Done. Just ignore everything and start over? Done. Just ignore everything and start over, but with Linda Hamilton? Done. Every time trying to replicate the lightning in the bottle that T2 was and failing miserably. So, should they stop? That's a harder question to answer because I had a very good time watching this movie, and you never know when they can come up with a brilliant idea to sweep us off our feet. Maybe we should just stop expecting the wheel with every new entry and be content with a nice shiny new car even if it is just our old car with a new painting.",Terminator - Dark Fate
234,gareth-75442,"Very bad idea at the expensive of a good franchise, it's a reboot Jim nothing more",1,25 October 2019,"""Oh dear"" yep that's the best way I can describe this movie, it's by no means the 3rd movie in the terminator franchise its certainly not a sequel to T2, it is quite simply a reboot of the franchise & if they had simply gone with that in the first place then there wouldn't be as many bad reviews for this movie as there is on here.
OK so I don't believe anyone will watch or not watch a movie based on any reviews of it either on IMDB or anywhere else, this movie will gross a ridiculous amount of money on its opening weekend but its going to be the repeat moviegoers that will make it a financial blockbuster of which sadly I won't be one.
This movie doesn't tie anything up of the original franchise it just takes a huge dump all over it and then in a couple of sentences of dialogue denies it's even existence & gives us a whole new future villain with no back story other than again a few lines of dialogue, yet this new future villain with no ties or acknowledgement of skynet uses the same ideas & technologies as skynet did with its ""time machine"" & terminators, even the main protagonist story is the same as John Connor's, it's bad story telling right from the start, how James Cameron thought this was worth doing is beyond me.
So unfortunately the fantastic T1 & T2 has all of its best bits reused & has the worst aspects from the fast & furious franchise mixed in with it along with what seems to be a dig at the trump administration.
I hate political crap hammered into what should be an action packed sci-fi fantasy movie, I don't care if the hero is female or male, young or old, I don't need to know their sexual preference or their political beliefs, the fate of the future is at stake from a completely made up bad guy/girl/machine so none of that is required thanks, I also don't require the beliefs of the director, producer, executive producer or make up person.
So onto the movie itself, it suffers badly because instead of trying to be a good solid story about trying to save the future the writers/director seem to have opted to just try & outdo the ridiculous fast & furious franchise, has it had a lot of money put into CGI you bet there is tons of it, to the point its so over used its repetitive & boring, the story itself is bad its just a rehash of the original but the fact the enhanced human from the future had the means of stopping the terminator right from the start & knew this but didn't use it was the worst part of the plot.
The truth of the terminator movies is people watch them for arnie, they don't care who else is in them, stop caring about all the other blockbusters out there & stop trying to better them or out do them, this should have been better thought out, it should never have included anyone or thing from the original movies, it should have been a new story with a new plot
& characters.

235,gabriel_sanchez,"OK, but shouldn't keep coming back...",5,17 November 2019,"The Terminator series is now a franchise! This being the sixth movie tell that by now! But is it a good franchise? Well, if you like over the top action, it is ok!I'm not very fond with the Terminator saga and all that happened in the story. Hell, I didn't even watch Genesys; and it was not required at all. With this, you can see that the story is pretty much a standalone-ish that sort of resumes from where the second movie stopped, sort of...Plot is the same, but now with a different ""John Connor"". So nothing new to see here. Basically, the now so called Legion wants to kill the next human hero: Dani Ramos, and it is up to Grace and Sarah to protect her somehow.Seeing Arnold and Linda together again is nostalgic, of course; but other than that, nothing special. Arnold makes for a good robot as well, as always.The movie is self aware, so it mocks its predecessors with some jokes. Laughable material, maybe.Overall, OK movie, not sure if cinema worth it... but OK to watch it after its release out of the movies.",Terminator - Dark Fate
236,namob-43673,Not the worst movie of the year...,2,10 November 2019,"As the title says this is not the worst movie of the year, but sadly that is, by itself, the good thing about this movie.
Gabriel Luna is pretty good, Linda Hamilton is okay, there are a couple of decent action scenes (most of those is in the trailer), the best action is on the 15min mark and pretty cool.
So there the good stuff ends. After that you can basically clock out, check your emails or walk out.This is a mess, and it is a mixture of all the other Terminator movies into one, which does not work. The movie is not nearly good enough to pull of that mixture of pretty much everything that came before.
The movie is not horribly bad, it is just stuff we already seen, in a mixture, and not directed or written good enough for it to work. I can understand that some people like this movie; if you never saw a terminator movie before or if you have seen very few action movies before, you might think this is alright or maybe even good.Well, I did mention that this movie was not THAT bad, but only if you can ignore the politics (which is very hard to do) and you can ignore that you have seen this movie 10 times before, and you can ignore that Arnold (T-800) terminator is still alive, with a conscious... He has a family and purpose... He now hug people, raise children, fights for good... Not because he was reprogrammed, nah, just because he... uhm... dunno... is a feminist? Hate walls towards Mexico? I have no idea. He is good alright. Just accept it. Robot can grow up and become human...This movie is that it is not as bad as Us or Alita, I would say this movie is a 2/10 which in my head make it comparable to the horrible crap which was Endgame.
Not worth the ticket price, and I cannot recommend, but perhaps some of you might enjoy it...",Terminator - Dark Fate
237,virindra,Quick cash grab.,5,1 November 2019,"What a pity. This movie could have been so much more, but it wasn't. There is so much potential: the story around the terminator (time travel), Cameron and Miller, Hamilton and Schwarzenegger, but somehow it did not work for me. Where was Edward Furlong? The cgi kid in the beginning? Really?The story is stupid. A terminator has been sent in the past to kill this Mexican girl. The résistance sent an edhanced human being to save her, so she can lead the resistance. That was soo stupid. If I was this ""edhanced"" human being, I would have let the terminator kill that Mexican girl and lead the résistance myself with Sarah Connor.The cgi was very rushed. The effects in T2 was more 'real'. This movie was like watching a computer game. It did not feel real. There were no emotions. Moments that were supposed to be funny, were awkward. I really liked T2, and I still do. This was not a worthy Terminator movie.A plus: I liked to see Hamilton and Schwarzenegger together again.",Terminator - Dark Fate

243,Lewis_Heather787,The franchise is now dead for decades !!!!!!!,3,8 November 2019,"Why did I have any real confidence in this film franchise considering that the past three attempts to make anything remotely near the quality of the first two films has failed miserably??? This is just another one of the sequels to add to the list, that just does not work on so many levels..............this film is beyond poor, its sad because they had all the ingredients to make, at least, a half decent film.I have very few positives about the film. However the best part of the film is probably one of the parts I was actually dreading the most before seeing it. The return of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Now I cant believe I'm about to type this but, he was fantastic in the film..........the only thing that made me go ""wow that really works"" his performance is understated but really works considering what had transpired for him to return. Brought some much needed heart to the film, some charisma and most important some great humour. Unfortunately the rest of the film didn't match anywhere near the level of his brief performance.That is it for the positives.Apart from Arnold the rest of the performances are dull and boring to say the least but I would also say that they are not help by a poor screenplay to start with. The worst of them all is Linda Hamilton, who just looks so out of place. It looks as if she hasn't acted in decades..................time has taken its toll and unfortunately she does not have it anymore. Her delivery of some of her dialogue is terrible, I could never connect to her character again because she just stuck out like a sore thumb. Mackenzie Davis and Natalia Reyes are trying there best but they're give not much to do apart from run away from explosions and fight................the film never makes me give a damn about them at all.The story is just too predicable and feels like old ground being trodden on again.................there is a slight twist with this film but its nothing revolutionary, its exactly what you expect from a Terminator film these days. Some of the actions, although they may look great, are stupid beyond belief................the plane sequence what was Tim Miller thinking???????Unfortunately that is where a lot of the blame lies on Tim Miller's lap. He is an immensely talented director and story teller........obviously did wonders with ""Deadpool"" but he has gone a bit too far this time. The studio has aloud him to get away with a lot here that should have been cut out or changed completely ................did nobody question the direction the film was taking in pre-production. It just seems like a more fresher take on the franchise should have been attempted, something not connected to Sarah or John Connor in anyway...............there are plenty of things a decent screenwriter could come up with in this franchise with all this material to work from???Overall its bad 30% out of 100 or 3 out of 10..................I cant believe I was even anticipating this film to be honest, what a mess!!!! Rise of the Machines, Salvation, Genisys and now Dark Fate can be added to the list of terrible sequels!!!!! I think its official now ""The Terminator"" franchise is dead for decades................note to studio stop making them for a long time please!!",Terminator - Dark Fate

245,anthonyjlangford,The T3 we've waited for.,8,6 November 2019,"Let's face it, nothing will ever surpass the first two Terminator films. The same could be said for the first two Alien films and Star Wars too for that matter. They established the canon. They were fresh, exciting and all still hold up today.As far as follow-ups go this surpasses the previous three entries. This pays homage to what has gone before without making it too obvious that it's repeating some of the same Territory. The action sequences are great and there are some light moments and touching one's that are not overplayed nor corny. You could feel the director pulling back a little rather than risk cheesiness. He's done a great directing job. The visual and editorial style mirrors T2.I thought all of the cast were fantastic. Linda and Annie would not have come on board if not for believing in the script. Their characters are honoured but also built upon. They've changed a little. It's tough to see them aging but at least we had the opportunity to see them again. I hope other older actors get similiar opportunities. I'd love to see Ripley return.Some of the set pieces are awesome, especially in the third act. Very exciting. You feel like they've squeezed every possible scenario out of this particular style. You almost hope there isn't another film. It feels like its all been done now.Let's be honest, it's The Terminator, not an Oscars seeking virtue-signalling arthouse film. It delivers in all areas, and then some.It's easy to be critical but if you go along with it, it's a thrilling, fun, action packed ride with time spent developing characters you can empathize with.

Finally a great sequel to Terminator 2 and I'm happy to Say i really enjoyed this one and I can finally say that Terminator is now a great trilogy in my opinion.The action is incredible and the story like the originals is simple but effective the new characters are great i especially like Grace the augmented human she was a great addition to the Terminator lore.Arnold is fantastic and I love what they do with his character having more human traits the longer he's been on earth. The new Terminator Rev 9 is the best villain sinse the T1000.The only think I wasn't a massive fan of is what they do with John but I accept it beacause of how it works for the story and how it moves the story forward it works really well as a continuation from T2. I kinda like this idea that the future has changed and he's no longer important its very much like Force Awakens with a passing the torch theme.I also really like the idea that Skynet failed and the T800 was taking orders from a failed future that never happened and its now Legion it was interesting way to carry the story on but keeping the events that happened In T2.
The T800 even says in film he came from a future like that and it failed.Now the highlight of the film and in my opinion the one thing that was missing from the other sequels is Linda Hamilton she was amazing in this she is and always will be Sarah Conner no one can play it like her.
Her character in this one is fantasic and I like her development in this one.Verdict 9/10 a great sequel and great follow on from T2 this is the true sequel and Linda Hamilton was great in the movie.

The same exact story is told yet again without brining any value or complimenting the first two Terminators in any way.There is simply no originality and Dark Fate feels like a bad remake stretched out by unnecessary complications and dialogues that are barely held together by action sequences. Mackenzie Davis is the only newcomer who puts an effort into this movie while Natalia Reyes fails to give any kind of believable performance and as a result the two characters are not able to establish a connection that can resonate with the audience. The new villain resembles a blank sheet of paper as he is not able to portray a threatening robot that or at the very least look imposing.The big positive is of course Arnold who makes his presence felt in every scene that he is in whether he is making a joke or shaking his old bones during a fight.

266,hunter-friesen,"""Dark Fate"" can't revive rusted franchise",5,7 November 2019,"No matter what our differences may be when it comes to political and social issues, as humans, we can all agree that the ""Terminator"" franchise has been downright awful for nearly 30 years. Since the innovative ""T2"" by James Cameron, the three sequels by lesser filmmakers have buried this once-popular series in a grave of mediocrity. And once again to milk more money out of nostalgic and hopeful fans, the franchise has been quasi-rebooted into the form of ""Terminator: Dark Fate.""Set in a present where Judgement Day never happened, ""Dark Fate"" opens in Mexico City as two robots from opposite sides arrive from the future. Their target is Dani Ramos, an important figure that will someday lead the human resistance against the robot overlords. The human-robot hybrid sent to protect her is Grace and the robot sent to kill her is the Rev-9, a shape-shifting terminator similar to that of the T-1000. As Grace fights to protect Dani, she is eventually joined by Sarah, who helps the pair go on the run from the relentless killing machine hunting them.Directed by Tim Miller of ""Deadpool"" fame, ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" is a downhill action flick where the ride starts at the top and continues to sink lower as time goes on.The beginning action set pieces are ripped straight from ""T2: Judgement Day"" as the two robots track down their target and eventually meet for a fight. This initial scene is by far the best in the movie as each robot gets to show off their unique powers. Miller also lets the scene play out with minimal editing and great stunt work that highlights the quality special effects.Once this scene is over, Miller has foolishly played his whole hand and left nothing else for the remaining 90 minutes. The action becomes a recycled mess as each subsequent scene takes place in more dimly lit areas that try to hide the flaws. Nothing new is introduced about the humans or robots and it all melds together into a blob of standard movie action tropes.With three screenwriters and five credited story contributors, ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" has way too many cooks in the kitchen that end up canceling each other out.The plot is incoherent, which has now become a staple of the ""Terminator"" sequels. Time travel is a finicky business once you start to think about it, but this movie has serious logistical problems straight from the start. These huge, gaping plot holes negate any emotional connection to the story and make every plot twist easy to see from a mile away.The overstuffed writer's room also led to some insufferable dialogue choices. The usual franchise catchphrases are all here, only this time they're painfully inserted and delivered to the point of parody. There's also an incessant need for every other sentence to be a profound statement, especially any line from Dani or Sarah.In a seemingly desperate move, the producers brought back Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor. The character and Hamilton's performance is the film's biggest asset, even as she struggles to work with the amateur material given to her.Mackenzie Davis is pretty good as Grace, the robot-human hybrid from the future. Like all robot characters from the franchise, she brings great physicality to her performance. Unfortunately, she doesn't bring much emotion to her human half, stifling any connection to her character.Relative newcomer Natalia Reyes plays Dani and falls in the usual rookie trap of overacting. At the start, she does fine work, but as the film gets more dramatic, Reyes overleans into her one-note performance.Lastly, Arnold Schwarzenegger reprises his role as the T-800 terminator. It's no surprise that the Austrian is great in the role that he can play in his sleep by now as he makes a nice pair with Hamilton and is the only reason some of the comedic moments work.""Terminator: Dark Fate"" is the best sequel since ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day,"" but that's such a low bar to jump over that it isn't saying much.It's like a student got three straight F's on their exams and then got a C minus. It's still not good, but at least they didn't fail this time and are somewhat moving in the right direction.",Terminator - Dark Fate
267,nigelmacdonald-97173,Back on form.,8,15 January 2020,"This is the best since T2. Solid story and amazing set pieces. Some odd plot holes, but time travel tends to cause those.

269,MinistryofDoom,The inevitable Dark Fate of a Failed and Incoherent Franchise,4,15 January 2020,"Oh Terminator Dark Fate, what happened? How could have it gone so wrong? this film had all the right ingredients. In theory it should have worked. James Cameron, Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger were back together for the first time since T2: Judgement Day. Tim Miller (Deadpool) was directing and Cameron was producing. So what happened?Here's what happened. The plot was a mess. A big stinking mess. This is the 3rd time that they attempted to reboot the struggling Terminator franchise and by all means, this time, they should have got it right. Dark Fate is a direct sequel to Terminator 2 and retcons T3: Rise of The Machines, Salvation, and Genesys out of the direct T1/T2 timeline. I was OK with that....but instead of continuing the story beyond the ending of T2, it mostly became a rehash of T2. The only things preventing it from being a total rehash were more screen time for Eddie Furlong and his kick ass Public Enemy T-shirt, and a really awsome Guns N' Roses song.Linda Hamilton was excellent as Sarah Connor. She gave more depth and realism to the character. She was a badass fighter but also had her physical and emotional vulnerabilities; something you don't see so often in a Terminator film. New comer Mackenzie Davis was mostly great, though her character is a little strange and under-developed. Apparently she's a Cyborg, a human enhanced with cybernetic implants, but her background is contained to some very brief dialogue. The character of Dani Ramos, played by Natalie Reyes, is the least of all developed character. She assumes John Connor's role in this film. If you've seen prior Terminator films, then you already know the importance that they place upon her. Now we come to The Terminator himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger. They needed a reason to include him in the film. Why was he back? Well, to draw in big box office numbers mostly, but how does he figure into the film? After all, if this is a direct sequel to T2, and we know he was melted at the end that film then in what way could he be back? Well, ladies and gents. Let me tell you. He is returns in the dumbest way possible. I'm not going to spoil this film but rest assured many groans and eye rolls were experienced in the theater that evening. The Terminator franchise traditionally requires that you dispel your basic sense of logic but this...THIS....was absolutely ridiculous. I almost got up and walked out of the viewing. Yes, it was THAT bad.Now if you just want to see a couple of hours of straight up action...cars blowing up, planes crashing, lots of big guns and explosions, you won't be disappointed. The action is the best part of this film. The story that provides context to that action? Meh, you can forget about it. Just wait until the movie streams or releases to blu-ray and then watch it on mute. That's how important the story is.Overall this film, I hope, will finally be the nail in the coffin for a franchise that has been struggling to make sense for many, many years. Three strikes and your out right? Don't try to recover from this with yet another reboot. Just let it stand as the final chapter....the Dark Fate...if you will, of a failed series of films.At least we still have Terminator 2: Judgement Day",Terminator - Dark Fate

It just took the wokeness a little to far in my opinion.The CGI was top notch. Several of the action scenes really had my heart racing, especially the aircraft scene. The detail they put in to the trauma of one of the terminators getting damaged was impressive.They just tried too hard to send a political message of the strong female.

Sorry to report, but authors of this - did not have it. but even if they lost the time loop narrative and made it one timeline just a fight with early first gen terminators. Or AGi coming into conscious there is so much space for maneuvering and a good movie. But no, they made tons of bad choices and brought nothing good into the movie. It's even surprising. Usually you add something to new work even by accident. here is a just a stream of bad decisions. Nobody cares if its all female cast. But if that was the only idea and they didnt know how to make it into something decent. Why start. Facepalm",Terminator - Dark Fate
277,BrickNash,Awful bland movie which does nothing new,2,27 October 2019,"Terminator: Dark Fate is the next tired attempt to revive the Terminator Franchise.In a nutshell, this is awful. The film is little more than a generic and tepid action film with the Terminator name slapped on it. For 200 million dollars, it looks incredibly cheap and very bland, with an overly lit brown/beige palette and locations that you've all seen before (more road chases, more factories).Mackenzie Davis is the standout and gives a really good performance as Grace, but the others are really below par. Even Linda Hamilton portrays Sarah Conner as some inept old women who is just really annoying. Her angst and negativity in T2 was always justified, but here the motivation are all so thin that it ends up just being a pale facsimile of what she did for Cameron. Arnie is 100% phoning it in here and his role in the film is almost comical in regard to his ""character's"" situation. The new girl....isn't even worth mentioning.The plot is just exactly the same old ""send a bad guy and a good guy back to kill/protect someone then go on a chase"". There's absolutely nothing new here at all, and almost every beat from the other films is re-hashed, only here they inject long boring sections where nothing happens. These parts are supposed to be ""dramatic"", but there's no depth or originality to the story or characters for those kind of moments to work without just being dull.The CGI is woeful too, and I'll not spoil anything, but it takes a very big dump on the first two films from the very start.Any attempt at a third Terminator film should have been made in 1996-98. The film should have been written and directed by James Cameron and should have been completely set in the blue tinted post-apocalyptic setting we saw glimpses of in the first two films.Alas, we will never see James Cameron's ""Terminator 3: Future War"" as not only has the lore been tainted, but the time for it has well and truly passed.Terminator: Dark Fate is not only a poor, poor attempt at a third ""canon"" entry in the franchise, but it is for me, the worst of the post-T2 movies.Yes, even Genisys.",Terminator - Dark Fate
278,plasticanimalz,Soooooo Boring,4,20 November 2019,"I was originally excited to see this for Mackenzie Davis, and thought maybe with Arnold and Linda on board it might make up for the past few Terminator films. Then I saw the trailer and didn't think it looked too promising. The new terminator, there is nothing scary or menacing about him, and the trailer itself was not particularly exciting. Then I saw Tim Miller was the director, and based on Deadpool, thought that despite the weak trailer it might be okay. Nope. Mackenzie, Arnold, and Linda can't save this film, and other than them and the new terminator designs, there's nothing worth watching in this film.Films used to at least be entertaining, now, I wonder what is even the point of going to the movie theatre since most of the movies suck. They're just two hours of scripts that simply go from one scene to the next with zero character development and a flimsy plot, if there's one at all. And now, some of the time there aren't even stars in the film, or barely, like the new Charlie's Angels. Why should I pay $12-$28 just for the movie ticket to see a bunch of no-names who have the acting skills of cardboard, or an outline of a film that is based around visual effects and action scenes and has little to no story? Terminator 3-5 were not great films, but I at least enjoyed myself. Now, that seems to be too much to ask for. I didn't even see Terminator 6 because it didn't look very good and other than Arnold the leads were a bunch of barely known TV stars. Didn't seem promising.I don't understand why they didn't hire Idris Elba for the lead villain. He seems like an obvious good choice. He has the imposing intimidation factor of Arnold and can also do the menacing, withering stare like Robert Patrick. The terminator they hired is officially the worst villain of all time. His acting choice was to do nothing. Nothing! How did he even get hired? If I ever see he's in another film again I will purposely avoid it 'cause he is the worst actor ever. The terminator might as well been a potted plant, 'cause it would have brought just as much to the roll as he did. The model chick in Terminator 3 that everyone hated was a better terminator than this wet noodle.The new John Connor...she was fine. Nothing special. She definitely did not have the charm of Edward Furlong. With the strong chops of Mackenzie, Linda, and Arnold, I was willing to let her be ""just fine,"" but when they showed future her I almost started laughing. She's saving the human raise? What is she, 4 foot 11? She's so little. At least with Edward Furlong, future John Connor was a grown man, not Edward Furlong, a little kid, pretending to be older. I just wasn't buying anyone would follow her or she could fight her way out of a paper bag. Just not very believable. Another obvious choice for the new John Connor is Zendaya. She has great acting chops, has the charm where you immediately care about her and feel for her safety, and she looks like she can kick butt. All necessary requirements to fill John Connor's shoes. If I don't believe she can survive, let alone lead an army, what's the point?But even with Idris and Zendaya, this film still would have sucked. Maybe they could have made it more tolerable, or ANY actors with talent, but the film itself was nothing more than moving from one scene to the next. And how did the terminator always find where they were? If the terminator is so efficient, why does he have legs? That's not very efficient. If he is so unstoppable, why isn't he basically just a drone that flies around and kills her? it doesn't make much sense anymore that the terminator is a robot in the shape of a man if they're that advanced. Or why not be a virus, or a man that slips a mickey in her drink? Seems way more efficient than a robot. He doesn't remotely blend in, going around, blowing everything up, so why do they bother making him a man? With cameras everywhere, which was the reason supposedly the terminator was always able to find them, cops should have had an ID on the guy's face, yet he seemed to be able to fool the Army and the Border Patrol no problem.Terrible script, terrible villain, mediocre lead, all around boring film. If you feel you must see it for Linda and Arnold, wait until it's out on streaming. There's a reason I was the ONLY one in the theatre seeing this bland turnip.",Terminator - Dark Fate
279,AziziOthmanMY,better than Terminator Genisys but still horrible plot,1,25 October 2019,First of all i appreciate that Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger is back in this movie and Mackenzie Davis was decent enough but this movie had become more of a border wall run movie instead of a terminator movie.,Terminator - Dark Fate
280,gcsman,Pretty much just what you expect! Well done without totally standing out.,7,12 November 2019,"I see that the female voters on the IMdB ratings rate this one almost half a point higher on average than the males, which has to be a bit unusual for a straight-up action/sci-fi movie with little-if-any deeper ""message"" and not much character development. Aha! Could it be because there's actually a market for female action heroes, of which this film has three? Who would have guessed ..... notwithstanding that we already have a raft of films to point to like Aeon Flux, Wonder Woman, the X-Men series, Captain Marvel, Salt, Charlie's Angels, Hancock, The Incredibles, The Avengers, Alita, Star Wars VII through IX, and of course the previous Terminator outings themselves.As with any sf movie involving time travel, it's best not to think too deeply about plot details, because they'll never stand to reason if you probe too deeply. Just enjoy the ride. For fans who know the Terminator series there are no big surprises here in the way things unfold, just a well done revisit to the look and feel of that franchise. So, for me it's a 7/10. Still though, it's good enough that a fair number of scenes do stick in the mind afterward. I liked the two newcomers in the main group of 4 protagonists: Natalia Reyes is effective at her role of growing in front of our eyes from an innocent, confused bystander into the steely leader-to-be of the future Resistance. And Mackenzie Davis is impressively tall and muscled and takes no back seat to anyone in the action sequences.I have to admit though that Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger are the standouts by a bit of a margin, as others have said. Hamilton, at her current age, has that great voice and also (!) a very interesting face -- it's as if she's had to wait all these years to grow into it. And Arnold, playing the original T-800 Terminator who has oddly been set free for many years to grow and mature far beyond his original programming, squeezes every bit of humor inherent in his still-wooden yet now *almost* human persona. The best sequence in the film, for me, was not the action but rather when all four of them meet up at his cabin in the woods, where they have the time to interact, talk, get to know each other, and make a plan to destroy the new Terminator on the board.In short, I enjoyed it even if the Terminator films have kind of outstayed their welcome. Worth seeing.",Terminator - Dark Fate
281,skullhead739,Nothing new but a good watch,7,16 February 2020,"I Just want preface by saying I'm a huge terminator fan and that this movie is by far not bad by any means, just not great and here's why.Story:
I like how they strayed away from the previous terrible movies, but this one doesnt offer anything new. It has all the original cast and is action packed trying to protect the new Sarah connor..Acting:
The performances are good and characters seem badass and real. Although arnold Is barely in this and seems as dull as ever unlike how you feel watching short circuit. As well as the character grace seeming annoyingly aggressive at points.Cinematography:
As you'd expect all the shots And special effects are great. All the CGI is well done and i really enjoy the new inventive ways to throw some fight scenes together.Summary:
All and all I really enjoyed this film, it's better than the previous films besides T1 and T2. But I dont feel they added anything new or anywhere near a ending to a franchise. But I did enjoy seeing all the classic characters and new ones that bring a fun ride to watch.",Terminator - Dark Fate
282,royhectorkabanlit,A True James Cameron Terminator Movie,10,3 November 2019,"The movie captures the feel and vibe of the first two movies, especially the relentless nature of the action and thrills on some parts. When you see those long, almost non-stop sequences then you know you are truly watching a James Cameron Terminator movie.However, I do have some issues, like the fact that the plot is a little bit too close to the first two films. They try to vary some stuff, but in the end sometimes the movie felt more like a soft reboot than a sequel.The C-5 aircraft and underwater scenes were a bit too dark, makes me wonder if they were scrimping a bit on the movie's budget.Despite those, this is still a very entertaining movie to watch. Mackenzie Davies was awesome, she basically is another Terminator in the movie. She has fantastic screen presence and charisma.Overall, highly recommended.",Terminator - Dark Fate
283,OneAnjel,John who?,6,2 November 2019,"SPOILERS: This film was disappointing on pretty much every level. To say it traded bad ass-ness for political correctness is not a complete picture; there still could have been some heavy bad ass-ness and I'm really stumped as to why that did not take place. It relied completely on special effects which rather than progressing it seems to actually egress with a bio-adapted female who almost immediately is shown to be the waning heroine who is basically dead in the water without a bottle of Evian and a shot of OJ. Really guys?
The film opens with about 20 minutes of not only being in Mexico but speaking Spanish -- wait, did I just pay $15 to READ a FILM? AND the super hi-tech new terminator is Hispanic as is the ""new Sarah"". Could they have at least tossed an Indian in there? Those Indians are pretty sexy. And where was the gratuitous black character?And btw, Mexican as a majority is something California is trying to stop, not reward. thank you.The 3 amigras include a Hispanic Mila Kunus-ringer (the new Sarah, er John), and Mackenzie Davis, who they managed to make look like a teenage European boy who has an intimate borderline lesbian moment with her female savior, and Sarah who has gone from being a passionate firecracker to being the bitter survivor of a wasted journey.We find Sarah looking around 80 y/o and for most of the film I find myself wondering if they did that intentionally for effect or why they failed to hire Karen Faye to clean up those years of bad living. That's not a cheap shot at MJ, it's a hail to the queen of make-up art, for the record. The terrible voice is from smoking -- kids please don't smoke.My biggest gripe is that the film almost immediately kills off John Conner!!! John Conner!!! And pretends that Sarah did her job well but now the nightmare is being replayed out by a different technologically superior invader. I'm sorry, but are you kidding me!!! You killed off John Conner!!!???It's a vaguely entertaining 2+ hour film that relies on impressing only the aging crowd who first turned the Terminator into a major blockbuster.There are 3 exciting moments, which play out poorly due to extremely bad writing:
When Sarah arrives on the screen;
when Arny shows up;
and when the film ends.I was going to add ""when the new terminator dies,"" but after seeing the ridiculous ""fight"" between the new terminator and the new Sarah where this powerful bio-adaptagenic gruesome creature actually has its hands around the new Sarah's throat and yet she still lives to tell, you would understand why I could not include this final scene.All in between is a hodgepodge of starkly unbelievable moments, horrible writing, and bad puns aimed at reliving the original film.If they were trying to kill off the Terminator franchise, this was a major success.",Terminator - Dark Fate

285,mattfrancis-03963,Watchable but underperformed,6,15 February 2021,"Dark fate isn't mediocre it's more disappointing. The problem being since T2 they've all been considered disappointing and all equally fell short of the 80s movies. Each film in the franchise has something new but it becomes more chaos and weak than exciting. The films fall short because they lack the presence of Arnie. He is included, except the harsh reality is he's not appreciated because he's old. Dark fate has an all new terminator, more powerful more interesting but the rest of the film didn't impress. It's got to be better on all fronts not just one or two new characters. Dark fate has way too many sins (goofs) like in the opening 40 minutes, when Sarah Connor appears on the freeway (out of no where waiting until the last minute to intervene) there's loads of traffic then when the terminator gets shot there's no traffic. Another would be the acting why on earth is this new terminator breathing and swallowing. So many and the director has failed to make this the success it should have been. Not even the legendary Linda Hamilton can save it. Hollywood are in too big of a hurry to make money by using previous character etc they often mess up when they release new ones. This failed to impress and will leave you feeling robbed of how proud you were of the first two movies. Again.",Terminator - Dark Fate
286,phoenixinvictus,It made time travel pointless because John Conner was a Temporal Paradox,2,19 January 2020,"First off I believe that killing off John Conner is a betrayal to the entire franchise, because it negates the reason for time travel! In Terminator Genisys they turned John Conner into a villain and betray the human race he was meant to save-again a betrayal to the franchise. If John Conner dies (or goes evil) and someone else takes his place it makes time travel and terminators pointless! John Conner was a Temporal Paradox with a father who had not been born yet and it made him ""special"" and maybe that was why humans had a chance at winning the war. I wanted to see John Connor rise up and embrace his destiny and save the human race because nobody else could do it. John Connor was the product of time travel and it made sense that an AI would want to kill him. After all, the first two movies set up John Connor as the saviour of humanity. As far as I am concerned the Terminator franchise ends with the second movie.
They murdered John Connor so that feminists might get the chance of becoming men. This movie overdid it with the ""strong female role"". Linda Hamilton who is a beautiful woman was basically turned into a MAN! There were way too many female strong women leads in this movie. If one strong female is good then three should be better... right? Well no! First off it seems to me that the machines were pretty much winning the war. By Grace's own admission ""you don't fight a Rev-9 you get out of its way."" Dani isn't special like John Connor was...In fact, killing off Dani shouldn't make much of a difference because someone else will take over and form a resistance. Why would she be able to form a resistance without any military training? Sarah Conner trained her son to lead because that was her mission. This movie betrayed Sarah Conner as the mother of humanity.
Let's face facts. There is no Universe in which humans would be able to fight against robots let alone win. Humans are frail and weak. The Black Plague nearly wiped out half the human population in the middle ages. If an AI is smart enough to invent time travel and create a terminator killing robot capable of regenerating from any damage inflicted upon it then I must ask the question... Why doesn't it weaponize the Black Plague and wait for humans to die off? Surely a deadly plague is easier than ripping a hole through time and space and rolling the dice? The I in AI stands for Intelligence-duh!",Terminator - Dark Fate
287,eelen-seth,Nostalgic action packed blockbuster,8,30 October 2019,"Let's forget about everything that happened after 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' back in 1991, and make a decent sequel. That was probably producer James Cameron and director Tim Miller's agreement. Not that I didn't like the oh-so-campy and over-the-top 'Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines', but it ain't no T2. And to be honest, they knocked it out of the park with Dark Fate.Terminator: Dark Fate takes place in Mexico City, where Dani (Natalia Reyes) lives a simple life with her brother Diego (Diego Boneta) and father, when a deadly new kind of Terminator - Rev-9 - visits from the future to hunt Dani down and kill her. At the same time, Grace (Mackenzie Davis), an enhanced human soldier from that same future, has also travelled back in time to protect Dani. When their first showdown inside a car factory, comes to a halt after a car chase a la Fast and Furious on the freeway, we quickly realise Grace isn't the only one fighting these deadly terminators. Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) has come to the rescue and has some old grudges to process.Tim Miller's (Deadpool) new sequel in the Terminator-franchise is solid. So solid it makes you forgive the tiny flaws in the film. He's made a sequel that is worthy of the Terminator title and sets up a new future after Sarah Connor changed that future by saving her son back in 1991. Miller might just have another franchise on his hands, if this one does well at the box office. The film has had a lot of male writers. Seeing them write such strong female characters on screen is something I will always support and applaud. The guys also clearly know how to be funny. Those subtle inside jokes incorporated into dialogues give the audience something to smile about while sitting on the edge of their seats. Planes, trains and automobiles - the action takes place on different locations and so we need to keep moving. Even when crossing the Mexico/US-border, Sarah Connor's in-your-face commentary on smuggling an immigrant across the border, can count as one of many witty lines she gets to deliver.Linda Hamilton is a champion. Her character has grown but hasn't forgotten the events that took place 30 years ago. Unlike Halloween's Laurie Strode last year, Sarah Connor has actually prepared herself for another big bad and is so bad ass, you can't help but smile and cheer for her. Hamilton's powerful performance makes you wonder why she hasn't been on screen that much in the last decade, since she clearly knows how to compel an audience into liking her.Another one back to reprise his role is Arnold Schwarzenegger, as a retired Terminator who lives in the woods. Schwarzenegger has done a lot of comedy in the '90s, but shows he's still got a funny bone left in his body. Dry humour and funny one liners will have the audience laughing out loud, while he still stays true to his Terminator past and knows how to pack a punch to impress.Hamilton gets to go head to head with Mackenzie Davis' (Tully) Grace. Davis is more known for her dramatic roles, but stands her ground as a convincing action superstar who believes what she's doing and looks fierce while doing so. Natalia Reyes, playing the helpless victim turns into a kick-ass woman fighting back at her dark fate. While she's the one bringing the emotional factor to this story, she's clearly a woman of many talents and knows how to handle different genres.Tom Holkenborg's score is filled with South American tunes, while staying true to the Terminator-score we're all familiar with. It's wonderful to see Junkie XL grow into the composer he has become. Dark Fate is as expected filled with VFX, some work better than others, but never in a way it becomes distracting. There's a few shots in futuristic flash forwards that seemed a bit unfinished, as did a shot later on in the film when Grace leaps through an aircraft, making her look like a video game character. Besides those two incidents, I found the VFX go hand-in-hand with the human characters.One huge visual effect is the new Rev-9 terminator. This liquid robot can shed his human skin as some sort of out-of-body experience and still do severe damage. Since this terminator looks like a human on the outside, Gabriel Luna (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) is the perfect man to blend in with the crowd. He gives a very serious touch to his character, while changing up his personality to get what he wants from government officials or bystanders. Very impressive work.Terminator: Dark Fate is a fun, thrilling, non-stop-action packed sci-fi blockbuster, with a hint of nostalgia and sets up a new tale within the Terminator-universe. Watch this on the biggest screen possible or in a 4Dx-cinema for full effect. *I'm not responsible for any injuries*",Terminator - Dark Fate

291,nebk,Dark Fate For The Terminator,4,16 January 2020,"Terminator Dark Fate is proof that film makers will make anything even if they have no new ideas for the franchise.The movie follows the storyline of T1 and T2, ignoring the other sequels and the plot is a mixture of the previous Terminator films whereby an augmented human comes to the present in order to save the future leader of the human resistance from a new terminator sent to assassinate her by Legion which has replaced Skynet as the computer A.I trying to kill all humans. The hero of the previous films John Connor is killed in the first few minutes of the movie by a different T-800 from the one that was protecting him in T2. And the story continues 22 years later with a new bad terminator coming to kill the new resistance leader. She in turn is being protected by the augmented human and Sarah Connor seeking revenge for her son John. Eventually the T-800 model who killed her son and has developed a conscience through the years helps them as well. Because that makes sense apparently. He calls himself Carl, lives with a wife and adopted son in Texas and installs drapes. He developed a conscience when he saw a bad husband abuse his wife and young child. What a hero. I suppose that is supposed to absolve him from the fact that he killed John Connor in front of his mother.The acting and the CGI are decent and the de-aging scene in the beginning looks competent. The new bad Terminator is interesting as it can split its liquid metal skin and the skeleton and attack from two sides. Everything else goes downhill. The story is weak and increasingly predictable and insults the viewer asking them to believe that the T800 terminator has developed a conscience and feels remorse and that Sarah Connor has spent the last 20 years fighting terminators because he has been sending her messages about their locations as he feels the Temporal Displacement whenever a new one arrives.Another huge problem is that in the end when the new terminator is defeated and the old one sacrifices itself to defeat it, the bodies are left where they fell. So someone could find them and build another Skynet/Legion or whatever it will be called next. It's sad that no one thought about the fact that in T2 the terminator sacrifices himself in order to prevent Skynet from existing and here no one even thinks about it.Overall this movie has too many plot holes and problems which are brushed over. There are some interesting scenes and one liners but this is not a sequel that T2 or the fans deserved.",Terminator - Dark Fate
292,Freedom060286,Entertaining,7,18 January 2020,"I don't agree with the harshly negative reviews for this movie.The cast is excellent. There are three very good actresses: Linda Hamilton, MacKenzie Davis, and Natalia Reyes. And we have Arnold Schwarzenegger in an unusual role as a terminator who completed his mission of killing John Connor, but remained among humans and helps a woman raise her son.While it's true that some scenes are very similar to scenes in other terminator movies, other parts are original and overall it's quite entertaining.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I only watched this as it was free part of my subscription, and I had nothing better to do one evening so I figured what the heck. I went in with low expectations and while it pretty much met those expectations, I did make it all the way through without fast forwarding it, which I guess is a plus. Contrary to my predictions, I actually liked Arnold in this despite him being an old man & all, I thought he was going to be in it as a glorified cameoWhile the new terminator antagonist was decent and more powerful than previous models, the plot was simply an overcooked ham, nothing new, just another rehash with a new character, it's getting really really old.The other thing that bothered me was Linda Hamilton, from her first to last line she just sounded like a 90 year old chain smoker which made me cringe and was just a cranky burnout through the entire movie.

The only purpose I could think of was a space-saving method, so they only had to use one time machine thingy.The nostalgia was nice though - harking back to the days when this franchise wasn't a joke.The action was not great, and the excitement I assume was supposed to occur never happened.

The terminator is the most advanced unit ever made. Yet, it can be outsmarted and outfought by a human with some upgrades. The terminator constantly makes idiotic moves.
The dialog is typical of a C grade movie. It's full of cliches ""I must save you"". ""The fate of the world is in your hands"".
The acting is poor. It's the standard I'd expect from a day-time soap opera. Even Sarah Connor is at her worst.

Beautifully directed by Tim Miller, whose scenes are always clear and enhance the action, Terminator Dark Fate offers us a new story, unfortunately really far from originality, with new plots and characters that capture the love of the spectator, but some of these have huge lack of originality too. This chapter, which is the third official movie after the original two directed by James Cameron, is packed with a spectacular cast, excellent dialogues, including clichés and irony that stops at the right point without flowing into the idiotic or redundant.

It is because of low attention span. They literally pump out new 'shiny things,' like a Terminator who can split into two! Oh wow! Like, this current generation, that was raised on coma inducing cartoons, has no attention span anymore. You can hear it in the way they talk fast in movies now.
Having JC killed in the beginning kind of defeats the purpose of the entire franchise. Now they've chickified the Terminator series. Arnie is like, he plays the part of the dildo. There's no other way to say it! Arnold is the plastic toy of the film! He's an extra piece of meat, ok!
Then they send some undocumented time traveler, down in the Maquiladoras of Meheeco, to kill some short girl.... what point is this now??
Is there a veiled message about racism in this?? I don't know....
Not even the part where Arnie kills John Connor looks any good. You can tell it is just there to move the story along! It is obvious CGI.

306,chi_town_fed,Rated E for Excruciating,2,31 January 2020,"Los Angeles has lowered the standard of films to third world country acceptance. My suggestion is to either make a foreign film or an American film, versus this hybrid flip-flop dedicated to appeasing a small segment of the Latin community. Guess what Hollywood? Latin AMERICANS actually do speak English. This era of hybrid language films for the sake of being PC turns me off. Either make a foreign film in a foreign language or make it in English. Versus this 30/70 nonsense. I hated bouncing between subtitles and no subtitles because a few people came into my country who absolutely refuse to speak my country's language. Again, Latin AMERICANS speak fluent English so stop with this PC film crap.This film is poorly written and unremarkable in every way. It also goes against every Terminator sequel following T2. As previous stated, the writers overt attempt to appease a small segment of Spanish speaking people is getting old. They did the same thing with the 2019 Rambo flop of a movie. At this rate they may as well start making movies where you press one for English.I don't care where you are from. If you are an American then be an American as most people are. The few who choose to take advantage of American freedom and prosperity and live a dual life of not speaking English and flying foreign flags on American soil should move to the country they seem to cherish instead of enjoying the freedoms I served to protect FOR my country paid for BY my country. This flop of a film is a result of pandering to individuals who want to live here yet pledge their love and loyalty to a foreign country. If you love some other country so much, move there and fight to make it better then make your own movies in your own language.The first terminator movie was fantastic. Terminator II was even better (the best of the entire franchise thus far). Since then, this and other wonderful franchises have devolved into brain washing propaganda for feminism and for forcing Americans into becoming a Spanish speaking nation. Notice how they don't make these hybrid films in other languages? Why is that? What makes Spanish so noteworthy compared to other languages? Where are the half English half African languages films? Or half Swedish language? I don't want there to be any but I am making a point.I am also sick and tired of these feminist-propaganda movies. It is just as bad as any other form of propaganda. I watch science fiction to be entertained, not re-educated. The Avengers and Star Wars franchise has also been co-opted by feminist propaganda, and they are also miserably written films. I don't need propaganda to appreciate women. Also, the CGI in this film is laughable.I miss the days of having three or more remarkable films (in English) being released each year. Instead we are inundated with these massive budget wastes of propaganda posing as sequels.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Yes, it's a rehash of T2 and it's much worse than T2. But that doesn't say that Dark Fate is bad, especially that T2 is listed #36 on IMDB Top 250.The story is a rehash indeed. And since it's the second time around (or the third) it is not explained well as in the first two. Arnold played his role well, but the background for his characters is quite stupid (and again, not well explained). Sarah Connor in my opinion was the biggest letdown. It just didn't feel like the Sarah Connor we knew from T1 and T2.On the positive side, the action and the CGI are great. The pace is also very good, with several intense action scenes. Leads (except Linda Hamilton) were good, and the rehashed story kept simple and avoided stupid convolutions of Genisys.Overall, a very decent science fiction / action movie.",Terminator - Dark Fate
310,ssvfolder-1,Fem fest in a very bad taste,5,22 February 2020,"I like strong female characters. In some cases it's better than your typical male hero characters that save the day. In this case it feels as this is a B rated movie, with atrocious script and above average special effects. Sometimes it feels as it was made intentionally to create unwatchable and mediocre at best movie, with the intention to kill off the franchise. The combination of Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger was enough to bring us to spend money on the viewing, depending on our fleeting memories of glorious Terminator 2, but it's definitely not enough to lure further on.
This movie tries to check all the required boxes : Feminism, action, nostalgia, beloved characters, special effects, but still fails miserably doing so.
There are numerous plot holes within the movie that I will not even begin to mention, as anyone with a common sense can map them out for themselves. The characters motives and reasons are ridiculous. Acting is bad. Plot is something out of any franchise fan worst nightmare. I'd even say that Terminator salvation and Terminator Genisys look like a good movies, after seeing this one.
The franchise appears to be done with. It will take a considerable effort to revive this. I gave it a 5/10 only for seeing Arnold and Linda in their respective roles for the last time.",Terminator - Dark Fate
311,joshbarton15,It's most definitely back.,7,30 October 2019,"""I'll be back"" is very much a catchphrase that the Terminator franchise has lived by since its inception in 1984. Two seminal sci-fi classics and three more incredibly mediocre sequels, degrading in quality as they went on, later and we arrive at Terminator: Dark Fate, the sixth film of the franchise that ignores everything after Terminator 2: Judgement Day while also bringing back a few familiar faces, both behind and in front of the camera, along for the ride.25 years after the events in Judgement Day, a modified liquid metal Terminator (Gabriel Luna) is sent from the future to kill Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) and a hybrid cyborg human (Mackenzie Davis). The only thing standing between them, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) and the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger).News of another Terminator film was met with worthy caution by myself, after the utterly dismal Genisys made a mockery of what once made the franchise such a pioneer for blockbuster filmmaking. It comes as a great surprise to me then that Terminator: Dark Fate finally delivers a worthy sequel to Judgement Day, the return of both Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor and James Cameron as producer playing a major part in the film's success.Opening with a sequence I was expecting but by using state-of-the-art visual effects meant I was drawn right in from the very beginning. From there, the film is a non-stop action blockbuster full of humour and, most importantly, heart that combines with spectacular special effects to create such a crowd-pleasing experience for a Terminator film.Coming to the performances, the new blood of the franchise is just as important as the old guard, and they do a great job in making their characters both strong and likeable. Mackenzie Davis and Natalia Reyes in particular ensure the franchise isn't just relying on nostalgia to get it over the line, and Gabriel Luna offering the presence required for a determined killing machine in these films. It's great to see Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton back together again in the Terminator franchise, and both are on good form here, Hamilton the more hardened of the two with Schwarzenegger delivering a surprisingly nuanced turn as a Terminator.Terminator: Dark Fate doesn't come without the usual blockbuster cliches mind, corny dialogue and major conveniences aplenty however, it's a sequel that feels as if it actually respects what came before it, all while offering a new horizon for a once flagging franchise. Don't be surprised if ""I'll be back"" is heard again a few years down the line.",Terminator - Dark Fate

316,domtaylor,Maybe it's time this franchise is terminated.,5,31 October 2019,"'Terminator: Dark Fate' is the latest entry in the long running franchise to act as the third part of the 'official' series. In what seems to be the latest trend with decade-old franchises, it picks up directly after the events of the last well-regarded sequel, which in this case is 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' (1991), completely ignoring everything that came after it. Ironically enough, though, this newest entry actually belongs with everything post T2, as it is far from being anywhere near the quality of the first two classics and is actually worse than some of the sequels that it canonically erases. It starts out pretty effectively with a swift set-up and a decent action scene, but it soon becomes clear that it has nothing new to offer. The narrative is just 'Terminator 2' all over again, even more so than the other entries in the franchise, and at this point it just feels tedious. How many times is Skynet, or at least a variation of it, going to keep coming back and causing the same chain of events? While that may be the point that these films try to explore, although even Cameron seems to be confused as to what the overall message is about fate now, it isn't necessary to keep showing the audience that, especially when the experience is as bland as this. Generally, this flick is fairly slow moving and feels rather long; its 'road-trip' premise quickly loses steam and feels very segmented. Also, the narrative is very clumsily told, with a lot of on-the-nose exposition and flashbacks that often 'reveal' things which are already fairly obvious to the audience. The final act is very poorly handled, too, with the action becoming way too big and overtly CG. This makes it really hard to see what's happening or even really care, which isn't a good thing when it's supposed to be the point where you're the most invested. It also just doesn't feel like a Terminator flick despite Cameron, Hamilton and Schwarzenegger being back together again. It's not awful, though; there's some good character work, the T-800 is used in an interesting way, it's great to see three strong female leads in a blockbuster like this, and the action is mostly entertaining. The problem is that it just doesn't offer anything new and therefore becomes rather boring. It's a shame, too, as this could, and probably should, have been a return to form for the franchise. I guess it just goes to show that regardless of the talent involved, this series has been past its expiration date for quite some time now. Maybe it's time this thing is terminated once and for all. 5/10",Terminator - Dark Fate

Instead, they could have used huge cables, the entire power of Hoover Dam, and arc-welded that monstrosity into oblivion! Much better ending!!!! But that's the short-sighted, rather limited imagination of the author -- not the film's fault.Can't fault Arnold or Linda for their performances -- just the stupidity of the script -- like Linda's character saying she STILL wanted to kill Arnold's Terminator, even though he was a dedicated 'Family Man' for 20-30 years?In short -- the Script needed a lot of work to be worthy of a similar title as the terrific ""T2"".

Luna is no Patrick but acquits himself well enough and the Mexican chick grows into the role. Davis is also ok though no standout.

The bad guy casting was a disappointment. They could have been politically correct and much more exciting by chosing Mike Colter or Donnie Yen.

The story is just barely not laughable. It stumbles badly anytime they do a flashback trying to explain past or future. Everything else is superb and entertaining terminator action. Think of it as Terminators Force Awakens but less twee. Mackenzie chewed up every scene shes in. Bias warning: I have a massive crush on Mackenzie Davis.",Terminator - Dark Fate
322,tresm87,"A failed attempt at a true sequel to T2 with some solid action and (SOME) returning mainstay characters, that ultimately feels like a PC retread cash grab.",6,6 November 2019,"6.4/10 As a terminator fan that grew up watching T2 religiously, the pointless events in the beginning are utterly pitiful for the franchise. The shock factor attempt that MIller/Cameron pulled is the worst move of the franchise so far and is why this tanked. Now once you can force yourself to try to focus on the remainder of the film it does have some visually intriguing moments, but still seems hollow until Arnold shows up. I found Grace's character as serviceable and somewhat interesting, But Dani's character is unbelievably awful and you can never imagine her as the new leader of the resistance. It was nice to see Sarah Connor back in action as well. Until Arnold shows up this film was somewhat dragging. The Rev 9 was a visually cool villain though never once had the same unstoppable ferocity that T1000 had. So when the T800 finally shows up this film actually feels like a Terminator film and the conclusion is is easily the best part. While it never comes close to being a successor to the first 2 classics, it does have tremendous action towards the end. The story was somehow very flat and uninspired and just seemed like a bad attempt at remaking the franchise based on new PC characters. At times the cgi is just overbearing and even lacking. Overall with all the money and people they had behind this film it should've been written better and still seems like a cashgrab. John Connor deserved better and fans did too.",Terminator - Dark Fate
323,brandonrhewitt,I want more,10,9 November 2019,This film is amazing and i want them to actually make the trilogy this time like they said i need more but it looks like we aint gonna get a sequel so thanks guys for ruining one of my favourite films,Terminator - Dark Fate

325,mr-altex,"Half good, Half bad.",6,26 July 2020,"Mackenzie Davis is awesome. In her role, she is practically flawless. Both acting and the way the character is constructed. On the other hand, the flip of Natalia Reyes character Dani is just unnecessary, or more so, hard to believe.I enjoyed the first half, introduction and all the scenes in the beginning did bring back memories, maybe even more than it was necessary - car chase where the bad guy has big truck .. some awkward conversations.But then, hour is gone, Carl is found, Then airplane chase? Just what now?I don't know, I have mixed feelings about the whole movie. I enjoyed it at first, then they added a bit more slow scenes, added unnecessary plot twists for more feelings and end up with cliffhanger.To those who think this movie killed the franchise, I think you are right. Eventually, it started to feel like a parody on the 2 original movies with cameos.",Terminator - Dark Fate
326,edwardrevans,Not as good as T2 but a worthy addition setting up the franchise to continue.,8,27 October 2019,"In the series of the Terminator series this is a worthy addition, far superior to Salvation though that did start well this addition resets the timeline in a very clever way. Now your critics will say well this and that etc, but me thinks they are missing the point and a key scene at the start of the film in the car factory. What Dark fate does is this it resets everything back to where we are in the very first movie in the timeline however this time with a different twist. The action sequence at the climax of the film got a tad boring and i lost a bit of interest there and I would have like to see Arnie a bit more but his introduction was very clever which i think some will fail to understand. All in all a decent addition",Terminator - Dark Fate
327,NatashaJAmos2015,Ignore all the haters !!,4,18 February 2020,They obviously didn't read online that the producers etc want you to disregard the movies after Judgement Day.

What more do the haters want ??,Terminator - Dark Fate
328,nightringer-76840,Reboot!!!,5,16 January 2020,"So, Terminator franchise is still making some money, but it doesn't blow fans' mind anymore. So what did they do? They reboot the story starting with Gynisis.This one is even a bigger reboot since they killed off John Connor and put Sarah Connor in a pedestal as the mentor of future leader, a female version of John Connor. James Cameron's signature, preferring female main heroes over male heroes, is clear. Cameron also closed John Connor's chapters and opens new opportunities fot Terminator to forward as a franchise.Tim Miller's hyper action scenes with over the top CGI fight scenes are excellent but disrupt the story a lot makes me wonder if there are cut scenes with long conversations in them. The story failed to grow further than expected, Dani's character didn't grow too much to be likable, leaving gaps that gave bitter taste at the end. Of course, the producers expected sequels and new franchise to build on, however my guess is it will be in small screen.A few magic moments that surprises me was the intro with young Sarah, John and T800. If they made a new trilogy, based on those events, leading towards Dani, that would make the Terminator reboot a lot more lovable. For example: a movie about Carl's self discovery, Sarah's adventure hunting Terminators, then merge them as this movie.In short, this movie has too much to tell with too much long action scenes.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Gabriel Luna makes a good villain, Arnie is far better than he was in Genisys, and Mackenzie Davis and Natalia Reyes do fine. It's also nice to see Linda Hamilton back (although she overacts embarrassingly at times). The effects are great. Stunt and fight choreographers earn their money too. Ignore the 'wokeness', go along for the ride, and take it as it's own thing. It's an entertaining action flick. 7/10.",Terminator - Dark Fate

331,andyajoflaherty,The real T3,7,30 August 2020,"James Cameron is back, and what we have here is a direct sequel to T2 that completely disregards T3, 4 and 5... and it isn't half bad at all. Decent action, a formiddable terminator, the return of Sarah Connor and for the most part likeable characters make this a much more enjoyable watch than the last few films in the series. It does seem to lose its way in the final act, and in terms of plot and pacing feels like a retread of T2 with some T3 thrown in, but as a whole it's the best Terminator film after the first 2. Definitely worth a watch",Terminator - Dark Fate
332,trevorwomble,A decent enough sequel to T2. Watchable although predictable.,7,25 October 2019,"Certainly way better than the script mess of both Genisys and Salvation, this is an enjoyable film that follows on from the classic T2 Judgement Day.The return of James Cameron to production duties and Linda Hamilton reprising the role of Sarah Connor makes a huge difference to the tone and feel of the film, making it visually and in terms of storyline, fit in neatly with the original story arc as the film ignores the events of the fun but lightweight 'Rise of the Machines' the more sombre 'Salvation' and the boring 'Genisys' .It also has elements of light humour too, something that the last two sequels in particular badly lacked. Tim Miller was also a solid choice of director after his fine work with Deadpool and the action rolls along so you don't really notice its 2 hours running time.There are still plot holes and the film is not perfect. Much of what we see we have seen before, especially in T2. The plotting is predictable but the return of Sarah Connor to the story does give it some much needed gravitas. And the film has the gritty but realistic language missing from the last three films.On the whole this is a decent entry into the franchise, especially after the abysmal last two entries, and helps get it back on track.",Terminator - Dark Fate

James C. wrote this? how long it took him? a minute? .
Such a ridicilous display of characters i have never seen, and i watched thousands of films. no story, and the whole thing looks as if it was written by a ""MeToo totaly feminist"" admirer.

Damn I swear to god I was so close to breaking the DVD disc from red box (yeah I rented it). And my god this was Terminator 2 all over again. But with gender and politics. The only good thing was both Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger. That's it..... the rest of the cast. AWFUL . I HATE Dani Ramos...I really do. They kill John Connor for this girl.... seriously. I hated almost everything about this movie. I really did I thought it should have ended at Judgement day Terminator 1 and Terminator 2 were the best.

341,Mike_Noga,Better than I expected.,6,5 November 2019,"I realize that's faint praise for a movie but it's my truth. I thought it was better than the last two, but it was nowhere as epic as the first two. It had a few good moments and plenty of plot holes made some dubious choices.I thought MacKenzie Davis was pretty good as Grace, the augmented human sent back in time. Her character was strong and capable but also had some vulnerabilities which made her more interesting while also being pretty logical. Her weaknesses made sense, they weren't just conjured up to move the plot along.I thought. Linda Hamilton did a great job. She was more intimidating than any T-800 And she acted pretty much how you'd expect anyone in her position to act. I thought she added to the movieArnold's presence on the other hand was pretty sad. Maybe even lame. He himself was actually good. He brought a healthy dose of whuppass to the film and managed to pull some humor out of his character's situation. But otherwise the explanation for why Carl( Yes, Carl!) was helping them was pure nonsense. Arnold was good while he was there, but the movie would have made more sense if he wasn't in itIt is neither the Sequel We All Deserve nor is it a Sign of the End Times. It's an action movie with a lot of flaws and if you focus on suspending your disbelief hard enough, it's enjoyable.",Terminator - Dark Fate

The first hour is actually quiate a joy, action is fun, chases are good and then towards the middle all the action scenes are in the dark and fast paced (you know this mindless crap is in every 2nd movie nowadays)...
You won't get aesthetic joy from this film... The cast is strange, it seems like it was targeted at Sout American audience since a few hispanic looking actors there... So yes, to sum up a popcorn film for one evening and you will forget it all in one hour...",Terminator - Dark Fate

344,garethvk,The Best One Since T2,8,31 October 2019,"The battle for the future is about to unfold and if you think that ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" is dancing around to a familiar tune; you would be right to a certain point. Once again a killer cyborg from the future is dispatched to our timeline in order to destroy someone who will play a part in the downfall of an A.I. system in the future.As before; a protector is sent back and this time around it is a woman named Grace (Mackenzie Davis); who will need every bit of her augmented abilities to stop a deadly new Terminator (Diego Luna), from killing a young girl named Dani (Natalia Reyes).Grace is soon joined by Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), who has been waging a war on Terminators for most of her life and now has an even bigger reason to hate them. Sarah clashes with Grace as she tells her that she was Dani at one point and knows all too well what is going on even though Grace's future does not include the exploits of Sarah and her son.The crew eventually join forces with an older Terminator model (Arnold Schwarzenegger); to try to stop the new threat and what follows are some amazing action sequences along with some light comedic moments.While the film opens with epic battles and chases which bring back memories of the earlier films it is the breakneck intensity that sets this film apart. While audiences are not in awe with a liquid metal Terminator as they were in the second film, it is done in a new and creative way to keep you guessing.
The film also cleverly throws some unexpected twists which helps explain the divergence from the futuristic timeline that was displayed in the prior films.
However this time around we get a fresh new wrinkle with a new A.I., new Terminator, new characters, but the same intense action sequences that have been missing from the series.Creator James Cameron has returned to the franchise as a Producer and story contributor, and Director Tim Miller using the earlier Cameron films to set a tone that makes this film stand out from the recent sequels.The return of Hamilton is great and she shows off a gritty and tough Sarah that has been missing greatly from the series. Luna plays his role with an icy efficiency but also has some good lines in the process showing how his model is an even more skilled and deadly infiltration unit.While it will not be in the same class as the first two films in the series; it is much more enjoyable and much better than the subsequent films as Cameron and Miller have created an intense and relentless action spectacle.4 stars out of 5",Terminator - Dark Fate
345,sjarja,Better than all the negative reviews suggest,7,20 January 2020,I liked it for what it was. A consequence of a franchise that relies on time travel and the butterfly effect of altering the timeline - where the timeline is inevitably locked in a similar outcome.The acting was good .. that is .. it is not the movie that expects amazing acting.Negatives:the CGI was bad .. and i am not a person that usually spots poor CGI. But it was quite poor - a great disappointment for such a franchise.The antagonist Terminator was a bad casting in my opinion. He would have been very good as a real infiltrator with his much better human interaction than previous Terminators... but since he tended to make a bee line to his target guns blazing - he felt like a completely wrong person for the task.All in all though .. slightly above average for me.,Terminator - Dark Fate
346,am-by,Could have been better,5,13 March 2021,Could have been better if Linda Hamilton and Schwarzenegger had cameo roles or non action roles. They are too old for their parts . Schwarzeneggers character has become ludicrous. The action sequences are ok and make it watchable. A bettet script with more suitable roles for Hamilton and Schwarzenegger or a movie without them would have been better.,Terminator - Dark Fate
347,Chrispearce2,You will be terminated... #me too,5,23 February 2020,"Not sure where to start or begin. Perhaps a time loop would help. This is a poor addition to the series.

348,clock_me,A worthy T3 we needed,10,26 October 2019,"I'm a huge fan of T1 and t2 there my all time favorite ones genesis which a lot of people hated was for me better then t3 and salvation and after the movie came out I read this series was not going to be making any more terminator movies which kinda bummed me outBut then I saw a trailer for dark fate and at first it looked kinda bland didn't think anything of it that was until the final trailer hit and it raised my hopes while i was waiting for the torrent i read a lot of reviews mostly 1 star complaining about the cgi and the woman terminator and bad script but I didn't want to believe itSo tonight I saw the movie and I have to say it was way better then t3 t4 and t5 it was the one i was waiting for the one that t3 should have been,
now as for the 1 star reviews i call bull crap the acting and story were something new you get to feel for the characters the Mackenzie Davis who plays Grace the female terminator blew me away with her acting not so much with Linda Hamilton hers was so so but Arnie's as the t800 had me calling for him during each fight scene with him and the the bad guy
Natalia Reyes as Dani was really good as the one who saves the world but I was hoping to see way more of john Connor and that pissed me offone other thing that was a bit annoying was Linda Hamilton voice what happened she doesn't sound like the Sarah Connor I remember for t2 something is way off but other then that if you want action a good story good acting and great cgi I recommend this to anyone who is a terminator fan don't listen to the heaters they must not be fans to give it a 1 star I'm gong to see this again in theaters",Terminator - Dark Fate

350,shweta-51657,A decent end to the franchise.. (future reboots notswithstanding),7,17 January 2020,"The last few years has seen the rise of women-centered movies and franchises (Hunger Games, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Mad Max: Fury Road). Unfortunately we have also seen Ghostbusters, Charlie's Angels and Hustlers this past year. Thankfully, this isnt one of those movies. This movie was led not by one or two women, but by three women and one lead male (good to see you Arnold!). Granted, thats almost three too many leads, but I have to say Linda Hamilton stole the show here. Her arc was done quite well and with a touch of class. The movie salutes quite a few of the good ol' moments from the original movies when Cameron was still attached to the franchise. I have to say you have a hard time connecting to the protagonist in this movie but you dont dwell much on her thanks to the performance of Mackenzie Davis.
Overall, this isnt the worst film of the franchise so far (Looking at you, Genisys). Sarah Connor continues to be a badass. Together with Arnold, it makes the movie worth watching.",Terminator - Dark Fate
351,DeadMansTrousers,Another sequel to fall in T2's shadow,7,2 November 2019,"I grew up watching the terminator movies, I have watched most of them in the theatres and I came to terms with the fact that there will never be a sequel that can match the greatness of Terminator 2 long ago. Why people continue to compare the sequels to an almost perfect film I will never understand.Dark Fate was far from perfect, but it wasn't the worst terminator film. I would've liked to have seen more of a connection to the second film in the beginning. But the easter eggs they used to link it to the other films were just as entertaining for me. They even used the country song which plays in the biker bar in T2 when the T-800 gets his clothing. I really enjoyed seeing Sarah/Linda back on screen with Arnold after all these years and for me that alone made it worth seeing.Overall the new characters aren't as memorable as the ones from T1/T2 but the film is entertaining enough and the added element of humour makes it different from the previous sequels and also reminiscent of the humour from T2. If you're a fan of the series it's worth watching to make your own opinion.",Terminator - Dark Fate
352,El-Ak,Not that bad!,6,31 January 2020,"I actually enjoyed the film even though it had a lot of plot holes and mistakes. I also enjoyed the previous film with Emilia Clarke but didn't actually understand the connection between them and how is Arnold in both films with Sarah but here is a different character. Anyway, the film opened with one of the worst De-aging CGI shots I have ever seen with Linda Hamilton's face looked completely fake in the past and in the same shot appeared a better De-aging one with Arnold's face and body too. The CGI is one of the biggest problems in this films in a lot of other action scenes with which this movie loaded. Also the story itself is the same repeated story as the previous one but this time travelling to the past instead of the future also with the same stupid scenes where the one they are trying to save doesn't understand what's happening and all that stuff and try to leave and this repeated bad acted nonsense. About the cast, Arnold's role doesn't appear except after an hour into the film with what I can say the least effective part he ever had in the entire franchise not to mention the below average acting too. Now let's come to the worst part which is the leading role itself with Natalia Reyes which I don't know for what reason did they choose her giving a very very below average performance too that anyone could have done it better. Even the character is so poor and didn't feel it all. The equal part to that is Linda Hamilton's stupid character that didn't even need to exist in the film which wants to look like a badass all the time while in fact she is very ordinary old woman who can't do anything and can't even act it good who always when comes in contact with Rev-9 ""The evil robot who done a better work"" always doesn't hit here with any sharp thing and only punches her pushing her away in every scene while he doesn't use but sharp objects in compact with the others in a very stupid action scenes. Speaking of the others, I must mention the real hero of this film which at first attracted me to it and didn't disappoint who is Mackenzie Davis with a real badass character and look. She was the true saviour of this film and the characters also 🤣. Her look, her action scenes and her performance is the best thing in this film and with it the rest of the story seemed better and entertaining a lot. Don't expect any kind of good score too and you may guess the end of the story as well. However, The film isn't boring one the contrary it has one and only one feeling in it which is entertainment and fun. Not that bad, just enjoy it. 6.5/10",Terminator - Dark Fate
353,drawlife,"Best since T2? Yeah, but that ain't saying much.",6,4 November 2019,"Look, killing John Connor right off the bat is going to upset the fans and many others alike, BUT, and just hear me out for a second. Since T2 with Edward Furlong, John Connor has been used as the main focal point with Nick Stahl, Christian Bale, and Jason Clarke. It just wasn't working. He serves no purpose since they completed their mission in T2. Did I raise my eyebrow when he got killed? Yes I did, but as the story progressed I didn't have a problem with it.I found the new leads, Mackenzie Davis and Natalia Reyes to be competent. We live in a more sensitive and woke culture nowadays, and while I'm all for having more female heroes or more diverse characters, there's a difference between doing it well and being forced upon for the sake of having it.Thankfully here in DARK FATE, I found that they did it well and it never really felt too forced. I felt as if there was a story to tell and the story called for it. Davis as Grace, a human who's augmented has great action scenes with the new Terminator, the Rev-9 played by Gabriel Luna. Reyes is Dani Ramos who is the new leader of a new resistance against a new AI called Legion in the future. While she is good when she's frightened and comforting, she didn't come across as believable when acting tough. It wasn't horrible, but could have been better.Schwarzenegger can play his T-800 role in his sleep at this point honestly. He's great as always and I quite liked what he's been up to in this film. I felt Linda Hamilton's presence in the film gave more gravitas. She's old but it didn't distract me at all cause she still was able to hold her own against the Rev-9 and she commands the screen every time she's in it. They both in some ways carry the film with their performances.The story is very familiar, taking bits and pieces of story elements from the previous films. Nothing truly new. Dialog and exposition absolutely drags the film from time to time. The film is in high gear from the opening, fizzles a lot in the middle, and then once Arnold's T-800 comes into the picture it regains it's momentum. Don't bother trying to figure out how this film fits within the continuity of the other films. Just know that it's a simple throwback to T1 and T2.Action sequences are fast paced and fun. I found myself to be very entertained by them. Gabriel Luna does a good job with his Rev-9 character. Menacing in some parts. CGI is just okay. There are moments where it looks extremely obvious, but not horrible. The de-aging of Sarah Connor, T-800 and young John Connor with Furlong's likeness looked so good in the opening sequence. Tom Holkenborg otherwise known as Junkie XL does a good job with the score with awesome callbacks to Brad Fiedel's music in the first two films.Overall, like my title implies, this is the best since T2, but T2 set the bar and after almost 30 years no other entry has come close to the first two, so to say its the best since T2 really isn't high praise when your last two movies were SALVATION and GENYSIS, which starred a former Batman and Daenerys Targaryen, both in which couldn't even save the franchise.While I do enjoy TERMINATOR 3, in a perfect fanboy world the story concludes in T2, but seeing that is not the case, one way or another DARK FATE is serviceable fun and does deserve a sequel to finish off its story should it perform well.6.5/10",Terminator - Dark Fate

I liked the twist on the new terminator of how he could jump out of his skeleton. And Schwarzenegger ofcourse is the man!

Who could have seen that coming.But seriously, this feud between the characters of Grace and Sarah Conners doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and there is zero chance we would ever side against Sarah Conners. So that is the first mistake they made with this movie. We want to like both of them, we want them to team up from the start. But given a choice, Grace doesn't stand a chance in gaining our trust or affection against the woman who has been part of this for nearly 40 years. So Grace's smart-a** quips and threats only work against her.With all the jumping back and forth in time this franchise has done, it's hard to surprise us anymore with weird new timelines. But killing off John Conners as a kid from the very start seems very incongruous and certainly unwanted. What we wanted was an ending where all the good guys survive somehow. How about Arnold absorbing just enough of the REV-9 to heal himself, same with Grace, and STILL change the past so John Conner doesn't die.We now understand the Butterfly Effect probably isn't real. In most cases throughout history, too many forces are at play to rely on any single instance of an event. If Skynet doesn't happen, the forces that brought it about will still bring about something similar. If Hitler had been killed as a baby, the forces working in Europe would probably still have given rise to something or someone else equally perverse and evil.So that part of the movie we can accept. We just want it on our own terms, giving us the ending we hope for. It's science fiction for crying out loud, you can write it anyway you want...why not write it to satisfy the audience?",Terminator - Dark Fate
357,GavWaskett,Terminator the Musical - I'll be Bach!,7,13 September 2020,"The Terminator is back and it is forgetting everything after Terminator 2: Judgement Day, which some people won't like the idea of, some people will love the idea of, but me, if James Cameron is happy with that idea, then it is good with me. And seeing as he helped to produce it, I think he is more than happy about it!Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger are back, well he did say he would be! The story takes place twenty-two years after Sarah Connor saving the world from Skynet, life has not been simple for her, however. Arnie's Terminator (well one of the models) is still on earth, but he's changed over time. Rev-9 (Gabriel Luna - Marvel Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D -Ghost Rider at his calmly psychopathic best) has been sent to hunt and kill Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) by Legion who now terrorises the future. However, the new resistance has sent cybernetically enhance Grace (Mackenzie Davis) to give her protection and then the circle of hunt and fight, stand and fight, blow up everything and fight begins.Linda Hamilton is grizzly and gruff and a damn fine action hero, Arnie is still a legend and whatever type of Terminator he plays, from the original killer to the softer Guardian in Genisys, he will forever own the character and make him watchable in whatever guise he is. Natalia Reyes brings vulnerability and then a growth to her role as Dani and I hope to see this character in the future(just not the dystopian future she exists in) and Mackenzie Davis is a new action star for the modern film era.Unfortunately the film has made a huge loss at the box office, it looks like the general public are not in the mood for another Terminator film, so there will probably not be any more following on from this story and the Terminator will disappear until someone else reboots it(far, far too many reboots in the cinema now).I on the other hand, really enjoyed this story, lots of great action, one-liners thrown around liberally, two screen icons back together and three very good supporting actors who make the roles their own.

Shoulda brought the family!You will not be disappointed. Tons of action. TOTALLY unbelievable but what an awesome escape! And Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers an unexpected high-quality performance as an evolved droid on it's final quest; generosity of spirit and humanity oozed from his turn as the Cyberdine product. Worthy of award-season mention. Everyone, from villain to heroine, brought their A-games acting-wise though I truly felt Linda Hamilton could have done a tiny bit more with her (much more developed) character-an oversight of the director perhaps? SO MUCH imagination in each action scene and locations.",Terminator - Dark Fate
359,darkwizard404,Absolute garbage,2,13 August 2020,"This movie is a pile of crap! Seriously it didn't even feel like a Terminator movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Terminator himself was reduced to a supporting character who only appears in the second half of the movie. His name was used to promote the movie and his talent was wasted in this pathetic excuse of a movie.I don't understand why the main character had to be a Latina girl. And aside from that they focused on illegally crossing the border and detention centers. Wow just wow! Adding a political angle to a movie that was supposed to follow up on the legacy left by its prequels. What a shame!Some scenes didn't even make sense at all. For example in one scene Dani was practicing shots but she never used a gun before and misses her shots with the pistol. The next second she successfully shoots all her targets with a machine gun. That's absolute nonsense!The acting of the 3 ladies were below average. Arnold is the only one who manages to deliver a decent performance even though he was completely sidelined in this movie.The director did a very poor job. The movie was unorganized and kept on dragging when it could have easily finished in less than 2 hours.I used to think Terminator Salvation was the worst but Dark Fate proved me wrong. Worst Terminator movie ever and a big slap in the face of Terminator fans.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Tim Miller's action scenes are the definite standouts, along with the surprisingly effective cast, but the story is shortchanged for what is essentially a rehash that doesn't truly respect the original or build on it in any meaningful way.",Terminator - Dark Fate
362,ryanwinning1,"Gotta have more Arnold, baby!!",8,13 November 2019,"As the producer of this film I would have watched the final draft and came out like Christopher Walken in his infamous SNL cowbell bit: ""Gotta have more Arnold, baby! Gotta have more Schwarzenegger!"" I do believe Arnold did enough to save this movie, but by that point it may have already been too pro-women saving the world. It seemed like constant back-handed slap to males throughout the movie. The message is that men are either the evil bad guys trying to take over the world or you're in the way of the real heroes which is the tough women here to unite the world. I liked Mackenzie Davis as an cyberneticly enhanced human. Her acting was really enjoyable and easy to go along with, but I really didn't enjoy Linda Hamilton, or Natalia Reyes performances. Linda Hamilton seemed like she was trying to win an oscar with every word and movement she made. She just really overacted every bit and distracted me from the movie into thinking this was all about her. It felt like she had been saving this performance up for so long and it ended up just not being smooth acting on her part. This was my first experience in a 4Dx theatre and it was really cool for the thrill ride aspect of it. There's fighting and explosions in so many different cool scenarios that had water spraying at me, fans blowing loudly as they fought inside of an airplane, and fun things like that. I love Schwarzenegger and the whole Terminator franchise so I give it 8/10 for the thrill ride aspect but definitely over-acting by Linda Hamilton.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Dark fate was everything I expected. Great action. Great cast. Similar plot to other Terminator movies.At this point, I'm not sure what direction fans expect them to take. I was a big fan of what they tried to do Genisys and I wish they had gotten another movie.Because Genisys was deemed trash by the fan base they went back to the original game plan, bringing back Linda Hamilton and Arnold, and proclaiming this installment as a direct sequel to T2. They did their best. And if this wasn't a part of the Terminator Franchise and was just graded as an action movie, I feel people would have liked it more.I won't give any spoilers but i wanted to let other readers know to give it a shot. Ignore these reviews that score it super low. They are just fanboys that will never be happy with any additions to the franchise. I enjoyed this movie, hope you do too.",Terminator - Dark Fate

The timeline shift doesn't bother me at all and I think suits the movie well given that Sarah altered the timeline in the earlier movies,nor does it bother me that three capable women took the central roles,I like strong women.The acting was terminator standard as was the script and the effects were,for me,awesome,all up it was thoroughly enjoyable was to kill a couple of hours on a hot and humid day and definitely a movie I will again.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Really this movie should have taken the franchise back to its horror roots. Sure it's not as bad as the other terminator films but that's not saying much, It would have definitely been refreshing and needed for the franchise, if they really wanted to continue the story you CANT beat the originals so I don't know why they keep trying. especially if the director decided to make a carbon copy replica of both terminator 1 and 2... the story is redundant, the cast is ok, it's nice to see Sarah back and Arnold is always good as always. The script is TERRIBLE, however the dialogue makes it watchable, the performances of the actors are ok, it's really just an ok movie all around. The action is awesome but becomes so repetitive, it tries also to reincarnate same action scenes we've seen in the originals, it's literally a movie calling back instead of moving forward. I really thought this movie could have done so much. Why is it so hard for them to just bring it back to it's roots because clearly doing this action packed adventure is too much for these people.

But okay whatever that's fine not exactly direly bad some mediocre action scenes and an hr later Arnold (at least Genesys put him all way through) so they have some really terrible almost incomprehensible action scene on a plane and crash into a dam and then just like T2 Arnold plummets to his death yada yada predictable boring nothingness it's not the actual content of the movie that makes it a 2/10 it's probably a 4/10 in terms of action and stuff somes fine but it's the awful awful story goddamn I hate how its just so predictable and has the gall to retcon the last 3 but it's so much worse than them.",Terminator - Dark Fate

T2 didn't have as many over the top action scenes but still some similar like the helicopter and liquid N scenes.The main characters didn't have much of a role but I liked this version of Sara Conner. Arnold didn't have much of a role. No humour like other movies.

373,Martinito_08183,"Unfortunately ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" is not the movie that redeems the franchise.",4,12 November 2019,"It tries to capture the magic of ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", but just like the previous movies in the franchise - ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" does it unsuccessfully. The first two movies are fantastic, but after that - everything else is a giant waste and everyone is trying to forget that they existed and i don't blame them. ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" tells the same story as ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" with some small things that are new, so that it can feel different, but it's still the same story. I don't know why the people that make these movies can't tell a story that doesn't involve a Terminator protecting someone from a another Terminator.When the movie begins we have a de-aged John Connor and Sarah Connor, who are now living their lives in peace, until a Terminator shows up and kills John Connor and Sarah hopelessly watching this moment happening right in front of her and this is where i couldn't believe it what i just saw. We got attached to John Connor so much in ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" and all of the sacrifices that were made to protect him, so that he can destroy Skynet, when he grows up - now it doesn't matter at all, because we know that he will die in this movie and it's a disservice to the character and after that they replace him with the main protagonist Dani. This is where everything feels pointless from now on.The main protagonist Dani is not very interesting as John Connor was and the line that Sarah Connor says ""She's John. You're John."" is so obvious and was very bad. The actress, who is playing the character Dani does not help at all and gives the weakest performances in the movie. It wasn't terrible, but was weak. Linda Hamilton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mackenzie Davis and Gabriel Luna were trying in the movie and you can tell. Gabriel Luna plays this movie's T-1000 and Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the same character, but was taken in a different direction in the story, which i wasn't a huge fan and he does a ultimate sacrifice in the end again. The only characters that i liked were Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) and Grace (Mackenzie Davis) and they are the only ones that are very well written.The de-aging effects that they used look very impressive and unfortunately - that's the only time the CGI effects look good. The rest of CGI looks super fake and at moments they were very bad. The cinematography was the thing that i didn't like, but that doesn't mean there weren't any good shot composition, but most of it was very OK and the other problem is that there are shots that lasted only a few seconds, but that was the editing's fault. The editing was very average in the action sequences, especially when the characters have a fist fight. The way it cuts from one shot to another was so fast and for that i couldn't even enjoy the action.The music was the aspect that i totally disliked, even after exiting the movie theater i immediately forgot it. It was the one of the most forgettable and generic soundtracks that i've listened this year. I wasn't surprised when i read that Tom Holkenborg (aka Junkie XL) composed it, since he has never composed a good or memorable soundtrack in his entire career. The dialogue for the most part was weak with some lines here and there that i liked. The biggest positive for me was the sound, so the people, who worked in the sound department did a fantastic job with it.As a whole i was very disappointed by the movie. I was hoping that this movie will redeem the franchise, but sadly i was wrong. This is the sixth installment of a franchise that was doing downhill from ""Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines"" and now no one cares about it anymore. The Terminator franchise has the most screwed up timeline in film history. It's hard to know which movie is canon and which isn't, since with each new installment they destroy the established timeline.",Terminator - Dark Fate

If you've been a fan since #1 like myself, better not watch it.
The title does say it, so I guess my fault for not being warned by it. Only it is not only dark fate. It is past fate also. The storyline doesn't make sense with the first movies and boy i wish they had put that fatal beginning of the movie on the trailer. Seeing John die, has a kid, was brutal & unnecessary. Made me sad during the movie. John didn't had to appear and die in such a stupid way after all he had been through. Could have left him out of the story without killing
him. I expected the old terminator to be the old friend of John, whom saved him and a happy reunion between Sarah and it. Overall, it is an entertaining action movie. But again, if you were a fan, don't watch it",Terminator - Dark Fate
375,Kirollos-Noah,A great action movie!,8,9 November 2019,"Terminator: Dark Fate is directed by Tim Miller, director of Deadpool, story by James Cameron, Charles H. Eglee, Josh Friedman, David S. Goyer and Justin Rhodes, and screenplay by David S. Goyer, Justin Rhodes and Billy Ray. And starring Linda Hamilton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Mackenzie Davis, Natalia Reyes and Gabriel Luna.This movie is a direct sequel to Terminator 2: Judgement Day, after more than two decades since Sarah Connor prevented Judgment Day, changed the future, and re-wrote the fate of the human race. Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) is living a simple life in Mexico City with her brother (Diego Boneta) and father when a highly advanced and deadly new Terminator -- a Rev-9 (Gabriel Luna) -- travels back through time to hunt and kill her. Dani's survival depends on her joining forces with two warriors: Grace (Mackenzie Davis), an enhanced super-soldier from the future, and a battle-hardened Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). As the Rev-9 ruthlessly destroys everything and everyone in its path on the hunt for Dani, the three are led to a T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) from Sarah's past that may be their last best hope.The Terminator was a very cool movie, filled with amazing performances and inventive story. T2 continued the awesomeness of its predecessors, and even added more greatness to it, T2 is one of my all-time favorite, Hamilton and Schwarzenegger were astonishing, and the story got more intelligent and interesting!Terminator: Dark Fate started off where T2 left us -the theatrical version, not the extended cut or the director's cut- with cool special effects of young Sarah and John Connor and T-800, and it changed and throw every other sequel that came out after T2, starting its own new timeline, and here's where fans and critics got divided, some say it's a terrible idea, and complaining about what the movie did to the rest of the franchise, and kinda did to the previous two films, and some say that it's really cool to have a movie on its own, telling us what would have happened if ""THAT THING"" happened to that character instead of what actually happened in T2, and the rest of the franchise.. and for me, I'm with the part that says that it's a cool idea!Let me tell you why I think it's a good idea, it's good to see a movie taking the risks and do something different than what anyone expecting, to go out of its shells and makes a new one, with a different idea, deleting all the other mediocre sequels, saving the franchise with this good sequel/reboot movie! Though the movie suffers from the very obvious similarities between it and the original Terminator movie, and I saw lots of people complaining about that, and yeah it's a flaw, the movie is not flawless, and it reminds me very much of what happened to Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and how it was familiar to A New Hope, but people got over that quickly with Star Wars, but I see people trashing Terminator: Dark Fate for that, and it's just not fair, because, even though its similarities can be a little bit annoying, the movie did an amazing job still as a Terminator movie, and as an action movie!Let's settle this down once and for all, Terminator: Dark Fate is very similar to The Terminator, sometimes it felt like it was not its own movie, because of the steps they took, that the original took too, but the plot in general and the cast are enough to keep you invested, interested and caring for them very much. So it's a flaw, but not as people are saying it is!As we're talking about flaws, let's talk about Dani Ramos played by Natalia Reyes, I didn't find her interesting, not like John Connor, or Sarah Connor, her performance was OK, but her character won't make you invested enough, but because of her fellows, who have more screen time than her, they made the movie investing.The action sequences were made very well, the movie was great as an action movie, it was adrenaline pumping, it was really good to have Hamilton and Schwarzenegger back, they did an amazing job, alongside with Davis, the pack gave us a stunning action sequences, combined with a very exciting score by Junkie XL.. yeah, Terminator: Dark Fate is one of the best action movies of this year, but Miller used lots of slow motions, and he relayed so much on CGI, the CGI was amazing, but some scenes could have just been made with double-stunts instead of CGI, but he chose the easiest way of making action scenes nowadays, over the one they used back then in The Terminator and T2, but still, Terminator: Dark Fate was very exciting, and visually impressive, with a villain that we've seen ones like him, but Luna made REV-9 a good villain, and scary from times to times!The performances were mesmerizing, everyone did a great job, even Reyes, though I wasn't so invested in her character, but her performance was still fine, but the MVP definitely goes to Linda Hamilton, she's my favorite part of this movie, she was so cool and her script was well-written, they truly honored the past with that amazing upgrade, because that's what I call and amazing character arc, she was my favorite part in T2 and now she's once again my favorite part in Dark Fate! Hamilton is such a great actress, and she's so impressive, also she gave the movie an amazing sense of humor, and she was great in action too, her performance is A+ in this movie, just like T2! Speaking of amazing actors, Schwarzenegger is my second favorite part in this movie, though he didn't have much screen-time like Hamilton, but whenever he was in the frame, he added so much to the movie, especially in action! I loved what they did to his character, he's now settled, more human, just like what we were briefly introduced to in T2, he's now a new character than what we have seen before, and that's why this movie is so good, it added so much to the franchise, more than any other sequel that came out after T2, it did its best to be its own movie, and in one way or another, it did that alright! Also Davis did an amazing job in this movie, and her scenes with Hamilton were great, funny.. her character in general was really interesting, and she did great in action too.The movie over-relayed on CGI, that could be a flaw, but the CGI was well-made, the scene at the beginning of young Sarah, John and T-800 was flawless, but during the movie, you CAN tell that some of the scenes were CGI-ed, but it's hard to tell most of the movie, so I think it was visually impressive actually!Terminator: Dark Fate is a great Terminator movie, and an action movie too, with amazing performances and similar yet interesting plot, T:DF got into my top 10 movies of this year so far, because it didn't only give justice to the famous characters in this movie, but it also succeeded at the risk it took of trying so hard to give the fans something new! It also was great at its own genre, and I'm so confused of how people really trashed this movie, just because of that change they made at the beginning, just see this movie open-minded, and you might see this movie as I did, because this movie does NOT deserve all that hate at all! If they decided to make another sequel, I really hope to see them taking other risks like that again.I'm gonna give Terminator: Dark Fate an A-!Just go and watch the movie with no mentality or anything.",Terminator - Dark Fate

In fact T:DF is similar to Captain Marvel in many ways; tone, politics, weak story.I was a actually enjoying it until Sarah Connor turned up, which is nothing against the character of Connor, more that the narratorial integrity fell apart henceforth.There are so many plot holes and cringeworthy dumb moments. The writers kept writing the action into places where the main baddie would just kill Dani: the plane, the last scene. I've said this in other reviews but Hollywood has a severe shortage of intelligent writing currently.Final word; it's an awful film but not half as bad as some have made out. It's a weak plot, unbelievable main protagonist and a few moments of casual racism. But it's still better than a lot of the dross being pumped out of Hollywood recently!",Terminator - Dark Fate

Terminator Dark Fate had several really tasty, shall I say, creative decisions that when coupled with strong performances (welcome back Linda Hamilton!!!) and cool set pieces made for a very enjoyable experience.Terminator Dark Fate is the best entry into the series since Terminator 2... and on that note: If you're a fan of the first two movies there are a number of little callbacks that are very cool.VAGUE *SPOILER* BELOW IN

379,RoboRabbit89,'Dark Fate' is a return to form.,7,18 November 2019,"First off I'm happy to say that James Cameron,
is back as co-writer and producer to the franchise!
You know, a lot of people thought he'd never do anything
with 'terminator' once he reacquired the rights, but I did,
and I told my mom that there is no way Jim would ever!
It's his baby you know?Now before I go into the film i'd like to mention that,
this franchise is (DAMAGED) from the other filmmakers
over the years; For toughs that don't know, Jim had to sell the rights
way back when he did T1 in 1984, in order to get a possible sequel made,
now this franchise went through many studio hands over the years, then
around when he did T2 in 1991, he sold the the rights again.
I believe at that time he was either done with the series or he really didn't know
where to go next, but Arnold was enthusiastic about making another, Jim
felt 'terminator' is very much Arnold's as well, Jim just offered ask for as much
money as possible. And the rest is history for the downfall of the franchise.(Onto the film). Mild spoilers ahead.In 1998 three years after judgement day which was set in 1995,
John Connor and his mother Sarah Connor are relaxing in mexico
at a local bar, John goes to the counter to get his mother some drinks when
suddenly John is gunned down by a T-800! Sarah cradles John's lifeless corpse
and thus starts a new chain of events!
22 years later in mexico a time sphere appears marking the arrival of Grace
a resistance fighter from the year 2042! who is human but with cybernetic
enhancements. Her mission is to protect a young woman named Dani Ramos.
Also a new terminator menace from the future arrives called Rev-9 who is a
new form of dark liquid metal and a solid but hollow endoskeleton, both forms
can split in two full autonomous units! he is here to kill Dani Ramos.
Later Grace and Dani meet up with Sarah Connor and the Terminator who is
more human socially that lives in a cabin with a ""wife and child"" (used as cover).
Together the awesome action foursome do battle with the Rev-9!!!This movie was pretty good i really liked it, now it's never going to be better
than the first two films which are classics.This movie did something different
and it feels fresh like the the first two, which is good and this film feels like a true
sequel, you know, a true T3. Don't listen to all the negativity out there, keep
your mind off all that rubbish and see it for yourself.I give it a 7/10. This one feels like a blood relative to T1 and T2,
and this film is directed by Tim Miller, also Jim has said this is very much
Tim's movie. But don't let that get you down it's fast, fun and action packed!!!
I hope you have a good time because I know I did!!!",Terminator - Dark Fate
380,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Terminator's Fate Is Not So Dark,6,7 January 2020,"The Stream: Same old Terminator story with new faces.The Big Screen: Explosions upon explosions! Action Galore!The Final Bill: Popcorn movie with a convoluted storyline no one cares about. Think Miss Bala with robots.S2SWe are back *Terminator voice*. This weekend we are able to give you a review of Terminator: Dark Fate. But first things first.Let's catch you up on Terminator history. This movie takes place more than 20 years after Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) met and survived the original Terminator (1984) and then prevented judgment day years later (in Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991)) (forget about all the other Terminators between '91 and '18). We find out what she did essentially altered history and the fate of the human race. Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) is living a simple life in Mexico City with her brother and father when a new, highly advanced and murderous Terminator - a Rev-9 (Gabriel Luna) - travels back through time to hunt and kill her. Dani's survival depends on her joining forces with two heroines: Grace (Mackenzie Davis), an enhanced super-soldier from the future, and an old, battle-hardened Sarah Connor. We follow Rev-9 as he tracks Dani; and, he leaves a trail of destruction on the way. Luckily for them, they find T-800 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) from Sarah's past and recruit him to help them save the day.Now that you have the history and a simple version of the plot, let's give you the good and the bad.There is tons of action in this movie. There is so much action that some of the scenes were repetitive and could have been cut to shorten the movie. Nevertheless, if you love explosions, constant chasing and fighting, this movie is right up your alley. Forget any of the plot this movie force feeds down our throat and just sit there and enjoy the action. Surprisingly, this movie has a couple (2 or 3) scenes that actually made me laugh out loud - maybe because they were unexpected or maybe because they were actually that funny. Either way, the comedic relief was appreciated as the movie just feels constantly heavy. Arnold really stole the movie and quiet as it's kept made the movie bearable. Lastly, I enjoyed the women's empowerment underlying message and highlight of Mexico in this movie. Now for the bad.The movie felt 3x longer than it actually was. The movie didn't break the 2 hour mark, but I found myself checking my watch and the pre-teen next to me clearly went from ""enjoying this movie"" to ""get me out of here"" by the last 20 minutes. You would think the action would quell those feelings, but ultimately, this is the same exact ""Terminator"" action and moves we've been dealing with for 35 years. The producers could've given us something new to make us ""ooo"" and ""ahh"". So, the action was good but nothing we haven't seen before.Lastly, this storyline, that they harped on constantly, was just convoluted for no reason. The idea has already been fleshed out in two movies and yet for some reason the writers decided to try to confuse the audience and make the movie seem more deep than it really is. This movie is quite shallow and obvious. Don't try to trick us as viewers with a basic and predictable storyline when we're clearly only there for the action and explosions.Long story short, I know the Terminator fans out there will enjoy this movie, but to everyone else, this is a perfect movie to watch on FX in six months or so. You won't have missed anything. This movie is basically Miss Bala with robots chasing her instead of drug lords.With that said, stay tuned to Stream to Big Screen...We'll be back. *Terminator voice*",Terminator - Dark Fate
381,helenbassett,Terminator Dark Fate Film Review - Tim Miller Directs Terminator Originals Linda Hamilton & Arnie Schwarzenegger (Now Making Curtains) - And Still They're Killing It,10,21 November 2019,"Arnie's back and this time he's a curtain maker and walking the dog in a quasi retirement. The multi talented Tim Miller messes with our time travelling head again right from the off in Terminator: Dark Fate. And funnily enough looking back to 1998 when Sarah Connor's story of a coming nuclear fallout that she alone stopped, is not believed. Is there any wonder?Let's pretend that Terminator is the only film in the series so it's easier to get the time line right. But the beginning already throws you off. Back to the future like. And if what just happened happened, then who the hell will save Planet Earth against the rise of the machines? And who will save them? Sci-fi world problems.Sometime in the near future Tully's MacKenzie Davis lands in Mexico and she's after a particular girl. Grace has a job to do and Natalia Reyes's Dani is her mark. Grace is an enhanced human, a supermodel soldier of the future, stunning as she is. Maybe women of the future all look like that. And she can handle herself against the local law enforcement. One thing I did notice fashion wise in the film were the cargo pants the women wore. Cool as hell by Ngila Dickson, and made me want to rush out and buy them for a second coming of the All Saints era.But someone else is also after Dani, and he's an enhanced AI. A Rev-9 called Gabriel. Marvel's Ghost Rider Gabriel Luna riffing on the Archangel and landing in a lightening blast. Making an entrance but not to bring glad tidings and joy. His is a completely different message. And he's brought a twin. Terminators have moved on in the future too, and Gabriel is phenomenal. But he hasn't met Sarah Connor. Linda Hamilton reprises her kick-ass role with explosives. And Gabriel gets the message. But how did she?Turns out Sarah has been sent the details of where these Terminators will be, from an unknown co-ordinate. Signed 'For John'. And Grace has the same co-ordinates tattooed on her. I want to say butt. Where she is to meet. And they do, but Sarah understandably is not pleased to see him, re the beginning scene. And because of what happened I guess what Sarah did in Terminator is now cancelled out. No wonder she's still mad all these years later But Arnie's T-800 is now a pussycat in slippers with a family. Writer and producer James Cameron wrote this as a follow up to Terminator 2: Judgement Day when Arnie's T-800 became the good guy. But I really don't remember much about it with Robert Patrick, so I don't know in what time line this film's start happens. Skynet taking a second pop at John, but it seems with the same good Terminator from Judgement Day? As my head explodes. But be that as it may, the Apocalypse is coming now, and Carl wants to help. Training Dani who can handle a gun, just like she was born to it.And maybe she was, as Grace explains. But for now Grace, Sarah and Carl the curtain man! have a job to do. Protecting Dani's future. This must be an immaculate conception because there is no man. But goddamn it this is 2019 and we're a woke generation. We don't need a man to save the human race from the new Skynet of the Terminator future: now called Legion. Carl excepted. And the women are fantastic.But they need a plan, and Dark Fate employs terrific special effects with the CGI action mind blowing. And amazing choreographed fight scenes plus there's Deadpool tongue-in-cheek style comedy. Arnie always did have a light touch. And when he's gone they'll miss him, but Sarah will be back! And so will I. Is this now a Girl's Own Story as we wait for Grace to grow up? Her and Dani actually seemed about the same age in the present. Better to just suspend reality and enjoy the crazy ride.",Terminator - Dark Fate
382,RubyMouse,It's alright,6,24 October 2019,I thought this was an adequate respite from thinking for an evening. In fact you'll enjoy it a lot more if you don't think and just enjoy all the highlights from pre-existing terminator movies re-hashed with some extra women for the 21st century and a supremely badass Linda Hamilton. I don't think it deserves all the furious 2 star reviews but it won't be winning any Oscars either!,Terminator - Dark Fate
383,aramsdale,NONE SHOULD BE BACK,6,24 October 2019,"I thought this is the best Terminator since the 2nd, making it the 3rd best as the others were all disappointing.
Great to see the story carries on from the original ignoring the others & to see Arnold & ""Sarah Connor"" together, with a decent storyline, makes it.
I hope this is the last one as i think they finished it well & could ruin the legacy they just saved unlike the last"" Predators"" which has killed that franchise.
Would recommend for nostalgic reason. 7/10",Terminator - Dark Fate
384,cyifly-2,"Lazy and Disappointing. All The Terminator Boxes Checked Off, Except for Acting and Writing",5,27 February 2020,"It was very obvious Hollywood producers decided to make a checklist for this film that matched everything which worked in first two films and put those same items in this film.
Arnold - Check . Linda Hamilton - Check.
James Cameron's name - Check . Liquid Terminator - Check.
Final Scene in a Manufacturing Plant - Check.
High Speed Highway Chase Scene - Check.
Liquid Terminator Bad Guy Impersonating Good People. Check.
Guns Blowing Liquid Holes in Bad Guys Face & Face Melts Back to Normal - Check
Melty Bad Guy Flowing in and Out of Moving/Flying Vehicles - Check.The part they left off the checklist was a plausible script or decent supporting actors. The script was terrible and the actors worse. It makes you wonder if any of these major Hollywood/Terminator players even looked at the script or auditioned these actors.The movie was not terrible, but it was very lazy, disappointing and forgettable. It was marketed as the best since T2 and a continuation of the story of T2. It had James Cameron's name in the credits as a writer and producer, but there is no way I believe he wrote this amateurish script. I believe putting his name on it was only a marketing ploy. Had he read the script (much less wrote it), he would have realized the story line didn't didn't even make chronological sense... or any kind of sense. The dialogue seemed like college kids wrote it. It was certainly not the work of professionals who write on the level of the first two. I understand that it is probably difficult to recreate that magic of the first two. But that is why you spend a little extra money and get good people. What did they spend $185,000,000 on? Not writers or supporting actors. They lost their ass on this budget and for good reason.No wonder Disney is ruling the movie kingdom and more people are staying home and streaming this kind of stuff. No one wants to spend good money on this. It killed a few hours. I watched it for free. For that, it was OK. But it doesn't compare AT ALL to the level of greatness the first two films -- Like they marketed it.",Terminator - Dark Fate
385,randomStuff101,Best since T2,8,17 February 2020,"Wasn't expecting much, but happy to find a good hearty Terminator movie. Lots of grit, solid action and excellent effects.Story was plausible enough relative to the theme. It's somewhat of a redemption from more recent Terminator movies where there was too much generic cheese.Cast was good, the girls did a good job with action and fights. Pace and interest flowed. The reason for Arnie to be there was well defined.Bad guy Terminator is cool, menacing. Although sometimes you wonder why he isn't getting the hits in, he seems to miss a lot, considering his advanced abilities. He just couldn't get a break.Not perfect. Another minor quibble is the photography. Too many close ups, or tight shots. I prefer wider angle, I'm not a fan of huge heads filling entire screen.The big hitting scenes at end turn up volume to 11 on industrial strength destruction. It's a great movie even for the excellent action scenes and stunts.",Terminator - Dark Fate
386,Schuriken,The Final Nail In The Coffin,1,5 November 2019,Linda Hamilton looks like she has been homeless living in the streets the past 20 years.Arnold looks like an uncle Karl who should have died 20 years ago. Why he is being cast in Terminator is beyond my understanding. His younger self made with CGI is very good we dont need grandpa Terminator.My best guess is that Linda Hamilton just waited to return only as the final nail in this awful movie series.Somewhere someone is asking for his money back right now at a movie theater.Can someone please explain to me what exactly anyone may gain by watching Linda and Arnold eating at a Korean food restaurant ?I respect it if you choose to be the final nail in the coffin. I cannot understand why you have to rub it in our faces though. The marketing clips for this movie is like visiting a terminaly ill family member you havent seen in 30 years. Its not fun or entairtaining by any means.,Terminator - Dark Fate
387,GazWatson,"Great film, terrible ending",6,2 November 2019,"A great pity, I loved most of this movie, but the ending was really crap, they dont seem to have learnt from the previous movies. Killing virtually everyone off, dramatically, never works. Especially if this is part of a new trilogy.",Terminator - Dark Fate
388,Exiled_Universe,This movie did its job and it did an awesome job doing it!,10,12 February 2020,"Well terminator is my favorite movie franchise and it has been ever since i was a kid so ive been sticking around since the movie wasn't even filmed yet and i used to look at yt vids and news articles showing pics of filming locations and any little detail that i could see up until the trailer came out a long time ago and i still remember how crazy excited i was. So a few months after it came out ive finally seen it and wow i should have seen it sooner. So this movie was exactly how i imagined it to be, it did what it was supposed to do so i am very happy that it went that way. Clearly there was never a dull moment at all at any point throughout so thats great. So first off the acting was great and all the actors and cast like grace and rev-9 was perfect and it all looked cool and the acting was badass. One problem i had is that how did john connor die as a kid when he was older in t3 and salvation? It makes no sense but whatever i guess i dont really mind and im sure theres somewhat explanation. All the action scenes were great and all did as expected so thats good as well. Another thing i really liked was all the cool lines the characters had to say at some points. Also sometimes its hard to see when it turns night and also i feel like sometimes there was too much happening at once but i could still tell what was happening but i mean maybe if there were more parts just shot with one take for at least a few second that would be a bit better. My fav part well idk what to say to that, i liked ever second but if i had to choose maybe the final battle or the factory fight in the beginning and my least fav part might be the fight on the plane i also like the jail fight cuz the rev-9 kicked ass with him killing all those cops it was cool af. Overall i dont really know why a lot of people hate on this movie i thought it was great and perfect the way it was.",Terminator - Dark Fate
389,Jim-Eadon,"Go woke, go broke",3,4 November 2019,"All modern Hollywood movies are PC, they're downright woke. For me, it makes them unwatchable, and I boycott these SJW movies, not just as a protest, but I genuinely find them intensely irritating. Disney Star Wars being a case in point.
Compared to classic movies, modern movies are dumbed-down, soulless and shallow too.",Terminator - Dark Fate
390,Jim-Eadon,The Woke-inator,3,4 January 2020,"This movie is absolutely awful, an attempt to tick all the woke tick-boxes. The characters were ALL irritating, and the villain terminator was neither here nor there.
The logic of the movie made no sense either. If a grandma ""hunts terminators"" then they must be pretty easy to kill, so what's all the fuss about?",Terminator - Dark Fate
391,chrisstetz,A mixed bag,7,1 November 2019,"Unfortunately there's two rather large negatives that detract from the positives, although as usual the negative review on here are totally over the top.There's a great cast and some great acting here, Mackenzie Davies is superb, as are Arnie and Hamilton. Although not so much the rather bland actors who play Dani and the terminator.The movie keeps you guessing and for a two hour movie I didn't find myself checking my watch, which is what I normally for for most blockbusters and comic book movies.The drama is very good in places, once you get used to the new cast members and for the most part it's a thrill ride that moves along at a fair clip.The two main issues are the action and the contrived, heavy handed PC garbage that is infiltrating almost every movie that comes out nowadays.
Why they feel they need to do this to a franchise which had Linda Hamilton as the most kick ass, never say die action hero to rival Ripley, I'll never understand it.
I guess the stupidity levels with today's audiences are so rife that they need to ladle it on thicker and ram it down our throats to make sure we get the point.Back to the action; it's terrible for the most part. This movie feels like Michael Bay directed the actions scenes. Boring and creatively void. Camera's zoomed in too close to see what is going on and hit on the heels of IT Chapter 2, this is another movie with an over reliance on horrible, relentless, boring CGI that takes the viewer right out of the movie.Thankfully the drama and interaction of the cast is so good that it lifts the movie up A fair bit and balances it out.Overall this is an enjoyable film, but it reeks of box ticking and mindless, messy action and falls short of the first two entries in the series and probably also below Genysis.",Terminator - Dark Fate
392,Spidenus816,"Hamilton is the heart, and Schwarzenegger is the soul",8,5 December 2020,"I'll acknowledge this upfront: the story is nothing special. Now that that's done, let's confess this is the best of the Terminator films aside from the indelible T2. Its main strengths are veteran actors Hamilton and Schwarzenegger, and the new additions are all right. The action scenes are overall feel of the movie bring us right back to the Terminator world, almost to the point where you feel like you're watching a Terminator film for the first time.",Terminator - Dark Fate
393,WKYanks,Fooled again...,3,5 November 2019,"In short, I'm not a happy camper... bad on me I guess ... got my hopes up - so much for using a brain when writing a storyline or giving a crap about established iconic characters...😡It starts out with the scene from T2 where Sarah is going nuts, screaming in the room after answering questions from Dr. Silberman. OK, my blood is pumping a little bit now... here we go!!Then we have a scene where CGI wins the day... A T-800 walks up on Sarah Conners and John (all look like they did in T2, I mean REALLY look like them... wow!) and BAM.... John is dead and young Arnie walks away and Sarah is left holding her dead son. Yes, that fast... 😱Blink, blink... 😢 ... ok, that was unexpected...They stopped Judgement Day, saved humanity, stopped Skynet and there are other T-800's popping in with orders to kill John? ... wasn't the T-800 mission to kill Sarah, then in T2 to protect John? Why not send more T-1000's? ... all from a future that didn't happen? ... WTF...We get a female ""terminator"" (Grace) arriving to protect a gal we've never heard of, Dani. She a Mexican, sweet little gal, taking care of her family and works at a factory where machines are starting to replace humans on the assembly line; one that happens to be her brother.We also have another new model terminator who's mission is to kill Dani. He goes to the factory and all hell breaks loose, but as expected they get away and are saved by Sarah Conner on the bridge as we saw in the trailer.I will say this, boy did this movie need Sarah and Arnie... and for what they were given they both were very enjoyable. Good humor, good action... to be expected from these two.So after Sarah saves the day we learn that Grace isn't a machine, but an augmented human. I liked Mackenzie Davis here. I remembered her from 'The Martian"" and ""Black Mirror"" and was impressed with both. I liked Grace as a character too. The individual performances aren't what kills this movie. As an action movie, I'd probably give is a ""B-"".So, we are led to believe that Dani will father the next John Conner... see, even without Skynet the internet gets us... and it ends up being called ""Legion"". A new bad guy that ends up killing humanity, creating terminators and figuring out time travel. Such originality......oh, and Arnie has a name (Carl), a family that he saved from abuse, learns to become more human and is a drapery guy. (Carl's Draperies). This wouldn't be bad if it were the Arnie we got in T2 (but it's all melted), you know the one that was sent to protect not kill, but this is an original T2 with the mission to kill. But hey, what the hell... this all provided for some really needed good comedy and got Arnie in this movie - so I'll live with it I guess.The new terminator is kind of cool I guess... it can separate from it's T-800 looking skeleton so it's kind of a double wammy thing, but I never felt like I did in T1 and T2 when it was on the prowl. The original Arnie had me on pins and needles the entire time and the T2 liquid guy was a tremendous badass as well. This one was just kind of there and well... no needles.We find out that Dani isn't going to be the mother of our savior, but she is going to be the savior. Man, did they screw the pooch here... they might have been able to pull it off with better casting, but Natalia Reyes is a tiny thing. All of about 5 feet... she just doesn't project any kind of badass or military leader persona... and when the movie tries to make her into one it's really horrible. Horrible casting IMO.So we get the big fight and the only way to kill this damn thing is to use the energy core inside Grace... yes, we've seen this before, haven't we? ... so Dani rips it out of Grace and with the help of Arnie they stick it in our new terminator's skull, drama - drama and that's that. Oh, Sarah calls Arnie ""Carl"" (like she, of course, said she would never do earlier)... I guess that was supposed to spur some sort of emotion like we all got when Arnie lowered himself into the vat of bubbling steal... not.I won't even go into the painfully stupid airplane/Hoover Dam drama... eeeeesh...So the last scene is, you guessed it... Sarah and Dani riding off in a jeep!!!Everything was better in T2.... even the chase/fight scene CGI stuff was better.I'm such a dumbo... I was fooled again.... never again with this movie franchise... They've made 2 great movies... the first two. They should have stopped there. Everything else is rubbish. This one is actually disrespectful to the franchise, the first 2 movies and their iconic characters.",Terminator - Dark Fate
394,rockingruby,Very disappointed.,3,31 October 2019,"I saw a few reviews for this that said it's a good movie and I wanted to like this but I left the cinema feeling very disappointed yet again.
T1 & T2 are amazing but this sequel just like all the other sequels is garbage.
The script was ridiculous, the Villain was not scary and I found myself laughing at him at times and his cgi was sometimes terrible.
It's not working they need to start over with new fresh ideas and let these characters die and tell a new story.",Terminator - Dark Fate
395,kismit,A throwback to the first two films,8,2 November 2019,"Arnie was not one of the two main characters but still served a purpose and added to some unexpected humor for his role. The two lead ladies were excellent, not being caricatures or unrealistic superheroes. I thoughtI felt the touch of James Cameron that had been missing for so long, and Linda Hamilton was still able to inject the Sarah Connor character into a place where the numerous franchise revisions of the future had sort of removed her relevance. For a franchise with this many sequels and re-imaginings I was quite impressed. I would be happy if they left this as the end to the series though.",Terminator - Dark Fate
396,martinrey-15593,Terminatior B-Movie.,3,21 September 2020,"The baddie Terminator in this movie is a Rev-9. I was actually hoping the Rev-9 won. This was just how wrong this movie is.
Don't know why Arnie agreed to doing this apart from lots of money.
Terribly muddled story that actually makes the first 2 movies redundant, shockingly.
The script is very poor with some terrible lines and the acting is just B-movie.
The main characters are cringeworthy and all unbelievable. Linda Hamilton hams her way through the movie acting like John Rambo.
Arnie is a Terminator who is now a middle aged family man, yes really.....work that out.
If you're a Terminator fan like me, don't watch this, you'll hate it. Its ludicrous. Storyline, acting, characters and script are all beyond woeful.
Its as though the director and producer have never seen the previous Terminator movies before and just did what they wanted...its that bad.
My 3 stars are only for the good CGI.
Just go watch Genisys again, even that is far better.",Terminator - Dark Fate
397,rchosen-193-5535,Ignore critics and form your OWN OPINION. This movie was MUCH better than critics said.,9,6 November 2019,"Obviously Terminator movies after T2 have a history of being terrible. So when people hear about yet another movie they assumed it would be bad too. But when I seen it was Cameron and that he was calling this the ""Official Terminator 3"", I knew it would be good.Sadly one of the reasons the movie flopped was they didn't do a good job explaining this was by Cameron or that it was really the official canon T3. On top of that critics were harsh on it, expecting something that would beat T2 or were expecting some Oscar worthy stuff. Anyone who has seen the series know these are action movies. You don't watch them for Oscar worthy stuff.I ignored critics and its rating here on IMDB and went and seen it for myself. I got back from it about 30 minutes ago and LOVED IT! Is it as good a s T2? In some ways yes, but overall no. I'd say it's just slightly below T2. It is better than T1 though. And obviously the ""other"" movies.I won't post spoilers but I will say they did a great job of connecting to T2 and making the story fit in with the series. And it obviously opens the doors up for more movies. Which I am all for given the things that happen.if you always go in expecting some political message, then you will always be disappointed. Movies always have some sort of message in them. I didn't mind the messages in this because they weren't in your face.",Terminator - Dark Fate
398,Rayofsun71,Not sure what everyone's problem is,8,5 November 2019,"I just saw this and I honestly thought it was great. Way better than Genisys I couldn't even finish that one.

400,hiraishinnojutsu,"It's time for the franchise to die, no need to disrespect it even further",7,31 October 2019,"One thing I really hate about this movie that I think quiet honestly has been going around these days in some of the most beloved and well-known franchise of all time: The white male main characters have to die, in order for representation to thrive in the upcoming installment. Terminator, sadly, is the latest victim to the newly common troupe. This makes me want to put all of the horrible sequels to ""Judgement Day"", like ""Genesys"", ""Salvation"", and ""Rise of the Machines"", far above ""Dark Fate"", because at least they still true to the core myth of the franchise: John Connor, a white American male, is the leader of the resistance that will end the reign of the machines, and bring victory to the remains of what is still recognizable as ""humanity"". And I see some homage or nods or similar story to the ones in the previous two movies (Since this movie ignores the other three), but does it justify the radical change to the main hero of the lore? nope, F%$K it. Thanks to the action scenes, improved CGI (though in some scenes it sucks), awesome new and more powerful villain, and the badass collaboration of the franchise's most iconic veteran: Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger, ""Dark Fate"" deserves at least 7 out of 10 from me. Even though if you force me to rank the Terminator franchise, I would hurl this one to the bottom of the pit.",Terminator - Dark Fate
401,shahrad,Decline of judgement day...!,2,27 June 2020,"Dark fate of the franchise. Awful acting, stupid dialogues, ridiculous moments and irrational storyline. Only 2 stars for the presence of Arnold Schwarzenegger! That's all!",Terminator - Dark Fate
402,FixedYourEnding,Sometimes coming in 3rd is not so bad,7,10 February 2020,"Yes, it's true. I can't imagine any movie coming out of the Terminator series that would be better or even equal the level of story and emotions of T1 or T2 (judgement day). Please understand, T2 is one of my favorite movies of all times, however I felt this is a nice refresh to the franchise as it is, as most people agree the best one right after these two.That's why I said coming in 3rd can sometimes be respectful. The movie surrounds 5 main characters, ""Dani"" a new protagonist (played by Natalia Reyes), Sarah Connor (the original Linda Hamilton), T-800 (the original Arnold), a future solider ""Grace"" (played by Mackenzie Davis) and of-course the newest robot development Rev-9 (played by Gabriel Luna). That robot is even a better killing machine than T-800 and T-1000 put together, literally. It seems this robot is the T-800 with some T-1000 nano-technology put around it, it's an interesting approach and with the excellent CGI work on this movie it kinda works.Indeed, the story is a slight repeat of things we have seen before, specifically T1, but some people can see this as a homage, or a female version of T1. What is missing, in my opinion, is the soul. In T2 you could almost feel the horror that Sarah Connor is experiencing when seeing the T-800, that fear does not exist in this movie. It is disappointingly down to an enjoyable action movie, however the characters are great and it is a good piece of film-making. Be on the lookout for Schwarzenegger's excellent joke midway!The ending? no spoilers here, but I can say it is very predictable, as to who will survive and who wouldn't, but I still enjoyed it. So, when you are done criticizing how it's not as good as T2, just sit back, relax and enjoy the show.

407,Marc_Action,Too Many Plot Holes,4,13 June 2020,"Dark Fate wants to bypass T3: Rise of the Machines, Salvation, and Genisys to be the last installment of the Terminator trilogy that never was. Personally, I'm one of the very few that actually liked Rise of the Machines. It had the best ending of all the sequels and it would have been a fitting end to the franchise, in that, Judgement Day is inevitable. And while Salvation wasn't great, I liked that it's the only film in the franchise that focuses on the future war between Skynet and the human resistance. Then there's Genisys. SMH. If you thought things couldn't get any worse than Genisys--well, fasten your seat belts!Here are the ""main"" issues I see with Dark Fate:1. So, turns out Skynet sent back several terminators to kill John in 1995 after the original one didn't get the job done against Sarah Connor in 1984. However, it takes one of the other terminators a full three years to catch up to (and terminate) John in 1998 after being sent back in 1995. Question: What took so long for one of these terminators to even make themselves known to John and Sarah? What were they doing for those three years? Selling draperies like Carl? Secondly, why would Skynet send any of the obsolete T-800s in the second timeline (1995) to kill John instead of sending all of them in the more advanced T-1000 variant?2. It's hard to follow the Sarah Connor-Carl subplot because it's just plain stupid. Apparently, in present day 2020, Sarah Connor didn't know that a Skynet-like A.I. was still in existence in the future until Grace tells her about Legion, yet Sarah's main backstory is that since John's assassination in 1998, she's been hunting terminators at the point they show up from the future when she's given their coordinates via mystery text messages. Well, in 12 years of hunting newly arriving terminators, it didn't occur to Sarah to question where these terminators were coming from if she wiped Skynet from existence in 1998?3. They turned Sarah Connor into an annoying and condescending grandma with a gun. They turned the bad a** T-800 into a househusband and drapery salesman. WHY?!4. While the concept behind the Rev-9 is pretty cool (a terminator being able to split into two), it just wasn't a scary terminator. A non-scary terminator = BORING! Part of the reason this franchise was so successful, was the frighteningly realistic portrayal Arnie and Robert Patrick gave to their respective futurist cyborg assassins that would stop at nothing to complete its mission. The main problem with the Rev-9 is that its special effects are obviously CGI. This takes away from the Rev-9 seeming real. Hell, even the Terminatrix from T3 with her cheesy endoskeleton and laser arm seemed more realistically imposing than the cartoonish Rev-9. In addition, the coolest part about the Rev-9 was its ability to split into two separate terminators; however, this element is severely underused in this film. Whenever it does split, the endoskeletal one never gets much screen time and it is usually easily disposed of. Basically, this cool ability proves useless in this film.5. Four boring protagonists and a boring antagonist combined with a stale, rehashed plot is not a recipe for a good movie. Dark Fate attempts to be the ""real"" predecessor to Judgement Day but has too many serious continuity issues to do so, while still borrowing elements from the three prior sequels in the franchise it claims to ignore (speaking of at least T3 here). When the script does try to be original, like having Dani herself be the leader of the human resistance instead of her male offspring, it fails miserably. Natalia Reyes
is certainly not a terrible actress by any means; however, she ""is"" terribly miscasted in her role as Dani. For one, her accent when speaking English is too heavy, so much so, I can barely understand anything she says most of the time. Plus the editing during her sole fight scene in the future was very choppy--I'm guessing this was done to mask the fact the actress was so short. This might also explain why the fight was so short (less than 15 seconds). It's just not believable she could lead a resistance in the future, sorry. Grandma Linda Hamilton would be much more believable in this role than Reyes.",Terminator - Dark Fate

413,pootc,It could have been worse,6,5 November 2019,"It could have been worse, a lot worse is not exactly high praise but considering what we've gotten since Terminator 2: Judgment Day it's come to that. Dark Fate ignores everything since T2 and Linda Hamilton returns as Sarah Connor which is the best thing about the movie.Tim Miller directs with Cameron as producer and while there are some good new characters in Grace (Mackenzie Davis), an augmented human from the future and Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes). Gabriel Luna plays the villainous Rev-9 sent from a new future. As it turns out Sarah's choices in T2 stopped Skynet wiping it from existence only for it to be replaced by something else.Schwarzenegger is back too but it's Sarah and the new characters that take center stage, and rightfully so. Linda Hamilton is the heart of the franchise but not even her return can save the movies shortfalls. The story is a familiar formula and that was the idea - to rehash what we liked. But make no mistake... this is no Terminator or Terminator 2 in terms of quality.The story line has a brutal twist which I was fine with but beyond that it's more of the same but not as good. Thankfully there are scenes in between the action to introduce and reintroduce its characters. It tries to be meaningful in parts and slows down which was a however the third act quickly degenerates into a computer generated mess.It's completely over the top. I understand computer effects are necessary but what ever happened to mixing it with practical? What worked about Cameron's classic movies is the action was somewhat grounded and you could believe it was happening. Here characters appear weightless, defying gravity and I am not just talking about the ridiculous scene on the plane!Overall, it's just more flogging a dead horse and bigger isn't always better. For me, these were more than just action movies. They had heart behind them and a message. I wish they had aimed higher but to tell you the truth I'm numb to this series now and was never that invested anyway. I will take this iteration over Rise of the Machines and Genesy's. Salvation has points for being different though so...Arnold quips he ""won't be back"" in this and probably as The Terminator. I'm fine with that.6/10",Terminator - Dark Fate

415,pintaxandre,Mixed feelings,5,24 October 2019,"I really enjoyed some moments of the film. Fights scene and action was great but below what judgment day and salvation provided in that area. CGI was OK but not great. Once again T2 & 4 did the job Better.
When it comes to the plot l, it was overall OK. There was nothing incoherent like in Genysis, but a few major plot facilities. Those left me down because they could have been simply avoided, had the story been a bit inspired.
Let's get to the story then. Honesty, the structure is well known and the same than every terminator movie except salvation. Nothing new in that area: the movie is a big hunting party all along.
What surprised me more was the character development. Schwartzie clearly was the best part of the movie and I loved his character which differed a bit of what had been shown before. I also liked what became of Sarah Connor. It is clearly not a character arc as powerful as in judgement day, but it is done well and Linda Hamilton is definitely the best actress for the role.
Where I struggle more is with the new characters. Grace, my god this character is awful. She reeks arrogance throughout the whole movie despite being incapable of surviving more than 15 minutes by herself. I hated that character. She is just unbearable. I however liked that they took a different approach than Marcus's character in Salvation.
The terminator for this movie was cool, at least cooler than what was presented in the three previous films.
The main character is boring and seriously lacks substance. I don't even remember her name and couldn't care less to know because she was so inconsistent.
I find this film enjoyable, but not great. It is a decent addition that tries to continue the story of judgement day, but it sets also the path to a sequel for a franchise that struggles to come up with something new.",Terminator - Dark Fate
416,warthogjump,A welcome addition to the Terminator 'trilogy',8,3 November 2019,"Although Terminator Dark Fate may not satisfy fans as much as the epic masterpieces T2 and the earlier T1, there is still really a lot to like about Dark Fate.In my opinion, fans may be too hard on Dark Fate for the change in story perspective, but I think it is very refreshing and much better than any other Terminator movie made after T2.Despite what many say about the lack of character development, there is plenty in Dark Fate. Without going too far and giving away spoilers, the Dark Fate storyline is possible to continue straight off T2 without watching any in between Terminators. Dark Fate opens up a world where although one set of circumstances (T1 and T2) may stop Skynet from destruction of humanity, there is always potential for another threat to rise, especially when humanity creates it. In this sense, 'judgement day' may ultimately be inevitable. However, to counter this, Dark Fate also creates more than the concept of the end of the world; it creates the power of conscious and choice, and it shows how even a Terminator can acquire a 'conscious' per se, although it may not operate the same as that of a human. It is also interesting to note how the Terminator conscious grows intrinsically, after a certain or final mission is fulfilled, and there is awareness of the capacity to 'grow' and find 'purpose' in life.Add to this plenty of dry humour, especially from Arnie, insane amounts of satisfying science fiction action that feels real thanks to the mature rating and gore factor, and enormous and visually impressive CGI battles that make you feel like you are right in the midst of Terminators, half human cyborgs with a conscious, and augmented humans.Terminator Dark Fate may not be the 'masterpiece' sequel T2 was, but it is definitely a welcome addition to the Terminator 'trilogy' and it creates the possibility of a unique, but similar storyline expanding with new characters in a new universe.",Terminator - Dark Fate
417,Wirxaw,Feminator: Stark Hate,1,5 July 2020,"There is no sensible way to describe everything wrong with this movie, the 1\10 is probably the most apt and deserved way to put it. However, for fun's sake and to turn this mess into something to smile over, I'll describe the ""characters"" from the movie, in the order of appearance. Spoilers, duh.Dani ""V""amos:
When I first saw this character, I wasn't sure if I'm watching a B-movie, like Superlopez, was that supposed to be funny or anything, but, sure enough, I soon found out that it doesn't matter. It's a C-movie anyway. And the curious thing about this protagonist is that... it's so bad that it's really bad. It's not a Mary Sue, no. She is far, far, FAR too useless for a Mary Sue. In fact, she doesn't... do anything in the movie, except for showing that she is mexican and she isn't white. Yes, these two things are made very, very clear by the writers. She isn't a self-insert, because... self-inserts are generally far more powerful. What she is... is a Spherical Cow. Or a Spherical Horse in Vacuum. Or... Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged. It's a case of when either the author has absolutely NO idea, like a 5-year old's level of no idea of how things work, or the author purposely wants the audience to have this level of idea. Either way, it's a very artifical, absolutely impossible, borderline insane depiction of something. She is supposed to be Johnka Connor, the leadur of the resistance. She isn't... trained... or scarred... or powerful... or smart... or commanding... She is... a prissy mexican teenager. She really cares about her family, until she doesn't, she really wants to speak mexican, because her perfect english isn't believable enough, and she really gets these bouts of anger and determination that young girls get every now and then. Curiously, her brother is a kind of guy that could stand topless on a street corner and, I assure you, he wouldn't starve, and her father is... kind of there for about a minute of the movie, but the writers make us think that this thin girl that couldn't lift a hammer is the ""older sister"" of her ""childish brother"" and a caretaker of her father and she is some great engineer that isn't going to be replaced or something. A really spherical cow. Another interesting moment of her character development is how she was trained to shoot. So, first she is holding a handgun, and she misses all of the shots. Then, to cut the screentime, dear Sarah tells her that this target is a terminator that has killed her entire family and gives her some rifle that she wouldn't lift with her legs. And, just like that, this leader Dani scores all the headshots. With a huge rifle that makes AK-47 look like a child's toy. A ""very"" spherical cow. Oh and in the end, she kind of slaps a huge metal terminator with a crowbar or something and he flies away like she is Wooden Woman hitting a pinyata. Also, in the future, when we see what this tiny girl has (not) grown into, we get a scene where she's saving a teenager Grace from some scavengers. She does it by taking them all on, one at a time, of course, and then monologuing. Seriously, a tiny girl that couldnd't squash a bug is taking down armed scavengers, and, instead of offering them food, because that's what they need - she starts talking to them like they are on a talk-show. This isn't how it works. When you are so hungry that you no longer see humans as operators(at least slaves), but only as food and competition - you aren't swayed with words, you are swayed only like a stray animal - with food, or aggression. If she'd fed them first, and then started going all ""bakana, minna mamoru, zettaini yurusanai"", she could maybe expect that they'd see point in following her, see hope. Instead, she just started mouting off like a sad teenager in a mirror(which isn't far from the truth, considering how bad the chroma key is), and they all saw the evil of their ways. And, apparently, there was a whole squadron outside that ""none"" of the flying Hunter Killers could detect with no heat, sound or visual signatures. I'll tell you what should have happened - Grace would've been shanked right there and looted for food, and this ""Vamos leader"" would've seen... other kinds of utilization, and the whole squad outside would just hear ""those noises"" and wonder: ""-Uhh, should we move in? -No, the commander hasn't given us a signal yet, it might not be safe!""Grace:
To start off, this is probably the worst soldier in human history. Because the amount of uselessness and ""no idea"" is really making me wonder what was the point of having her in this movie, of even developing her, if all she ever was - is a mcguffin? Well, I'll explain why. See, first of all she is ""Augmented"". And she got augmented, because she was basically torn to shreds, yet somehow conscious and the medics even ""wanted to do something about it!"". However, she, ahem, ""grace""fully said ""I volunteer.... to be an Augment"". Wow. Remember, kids, CONSENT! Whether you are fooling around after school or are fighting a war in the distant future, where people, who take decades to grow and develop, are lost in droves to a single terminator - you still need a female CONSENT to do anything to her body. Because obviously in that distant future 75% of humanity wouldn't volunteer to become these robocops just to have a chance to live for more than 5 seconds, no, they would first have to die meaninglessly, and, if they somehow survive after dying meaninglessly - they could ""volunteer"" to become augmented. To be.... useful for about half an hour. Seriously, the movie makes this whole ""nanofiber"" and ""super muscles"" and ""thorium reactor"" nonsense and then brings up ""I have a metabolism designed for short bursts, you either kill a terminator or die"". I just... I have facepalmed so much. Do these augmentations cost like wrapping your hamburger in tinfoil? Why augment someone to give them planned obsolescence?! Imagine building a really, really, really fast car, and having it die after one drag race. That's some writing marvel right there. As a human with metabolism issues - I know fully well how it feels. I just also know that I wouldn't volunteer to become some Wolverine if I still had to deal with my ""human"" issues. Well, sarcasm aside, the movie does explain why this plot twist is there: to show Mackenzie Davis in a t-shirt with ice on top of her. Okay, I can forgive Tim Miller, he wants to make a Feminator movie, but he can't help but abide his kinky fantasies. Also, these sudden collapses would show that Grace is ... human, vulnerable. Sorry, Tim, I know you tried, but you have just earned a medal: ""Royally failed at making a Leeloo"". Anyway, Grace arrived into the story like every timetraveller ever - naked, and, interestingly enough, twice in the movie she had to steal someone's clothes. Twice she had a choice of a ""skinny male"" and ""unimpressive female"". Twice she chose the skinny male. Why? Trannomachines, son! Seriously, Kyle Reese had chest. Arnie had a chest. Sarah Connon had a chest. Grace... got a desk. Sure, the desk is useful, you can put your laptop there, or even your breakfast, but it doesn't... ahem, stand out. To add insult to injury - remember how I said that she is the worst soldier ever? Well, she is useless. She is either saved by Sarah or Arnie, all the time. All her powers come from post-editing. Speed up that sequence? Wow, now she's like a Wooden Woman! Make her punch seem like she's superhuman? Make that stick look like a sledgehammer? No problem! It's like the monsters in modern movies: you defeat them by removing the photoshop layer they are drawn on.Rev-9, aka the Mexinator:
You've seen scary plastic Arnienator, you've seen The Robert Patrick, you've seen Kristanna Loken act more feminine as a terminator than Mackenzie Davis as a human, you've seen some Avatar, and you've seen a happy-go-lucky ""mom im ur son"" John Clarke. Now prepare to see a .... uber foods deliveryman?! What did they base this character on? Did they really have to make a terminator less intimidating than Kristanna Loken? Or Grace, for that matter? Ironically, where he fails as a terminator, he succeeds as a human - he is MUCH more human than Grace. He could definitely talk his way out of being late at food delivery, without having to kill his client. Because being late is somewhat of a trend to this guy - he always comes right after the characters have had time to talk, reminisce, bond, plan etc. That's also the most advanced terminator that has to use modern-day drone technology to kamikaze and modern-day soldiers, because apparently having a ""dual-body"" terminator is not enough. Probably should've ridden a two-person bycicle, then he wouldn't have been late.... In Grace's ""flashforward"" scenes we see an old ""Rev-7"", a fierce, hellish creature that can shapeshift, split itself, and that has these tentacles that are fairly effective at talking down men with guns at medium to close distance. Yes, these Rev-7 can, somehow, be taken down with a couple of bullets to the face, but they seemed to get the job done. They also didn't remote-control any drones, they ""were"" the flying drones, crashing in a huge explosion and immediately wreaking havoc. So how, after two revisions, which apparently added some bullet-proofing(and generally plot armor) and human-like shapeshifting and personality, did they regress so much in combat effectiveness? On numerous occasions this uber foods guy just doesn't kill his victims. He'll shred apart objects and weapons, but only punch or shove the protagonists. No tentacles, no real stealthiness, no flying, no nothing. He can't even run like Robert Patrick... he runs like an uber eats guy whose bike got busted halfway to the suburb.Welp... Imdb letter count is up. I wish I could give some credit to Arnie and Sarah... but, alas, I think these three characters should give you ample idea of why this movie is 1\10.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I ended up enjoying it!If you're sick of Terminator movies, or looking for something truly new and inventive- look elsewhere.This movie isn't about telling a new story or twisting the world on its head- it just adds to the pre-existing world and heads it towards a new conclusion (albeit, one we've been teased with many times before in the other movies).I think people are unfairly bashing this film. I'm willing to bet that most of the people who hate this movie made up their minds before they even saw it. It's really not that bad. Maybe people don't like that women are the main characters, or that the ideas here have been done before (almost all of them), but if you take the movie on its own- it's pretty well done.I wasn't going to write a review at all, but seeing some of the negative reviews out there, I wanted to say that this one really isn't that bad!

The problems with this movie are in the fact that it's basically a rehashed plot remade to teach it's audience that coyotes are just nice guys who have a heart of gold risking it all in order to do a good service; and that only a woman can save the world. The viewer gets a real sense that the writers seem ashamed of the fact that it was a male (John Connor) who would save the world in previous Terminator iterations. They actually erase that and create a new reality. John Connor is no longer the leader of the human resistance. The new savior is not only a woman, but a Mexican woman. Who knows what they will come up with in the next Terminator? I'm sure it will be whatever happens to be politically profitable for them. Other than the action scenes there is little to watch here.",Terminator - Dark Fate
427,Zaffy-1,I actually enjoyed it but the franchise is pretty much done,8,29 December 2020,"Maybe it is the fact that all the movies after T2 were from bad to awful, especially Genisys, but what can I say, I enjoyed this one.I loved seeing Linda Hamilton again as Sarah Connor and I really liked Arnie's part and its character evolution. I found the story pretty much ok.
The direction could be better though, it needed to be more intense.Anyway, I am not sure what else the franchise can offer us anymore.
I see this as it's final chapter and well, I am ok with it.",Terminator - Dark Fate
428,jcallows,So much estrogen!,7,25 December 2020,"Not that it's a bad thing. The first two Terminators had a strong female character. Except in that case, it was done right. In this case, not so much.The problem with this film, like so many recently, wasn't that it pushed a social justice agenda, but that it just wasn't very good. And when you got a mediocre film, any irrelevant issues being pushed act as a distraction instead of an enhancement to the story.Anyway, about the film. It's certainly a watchable film, at least for the first two-thirds. The familiar faces and visually stunning action sequences alone made this film worth watching, despite the silliness of the last act.What made this film worth watching was also what kept it from being better. The return of Sarah Conners and the original Terminator brought nostalgia but unfortunately took away time from the two new characters, time that could've been spent developing them and developing their chemistry. So when we got to the grand finale, it was hard to feel anything for them.This was the second time they tried to reboot the franchise. Perhaps the third time will be the charm.",Terminator - Dark Fate
429,Homer_Ate2,Pretty fun and entertaining,6,21 January 2020,"Certainly not as bad as what I expected after hearing the negative press this movie was receiving. Not great by any stretch of the mark, but it had some good action sequences and the characters were fine. The whole Arnold / Connor save the world from judgement day ruined this movie in my opinion. That story line is DEAD and should have been left at T2. Rather than carry on a story line, why can't they seperate the universes? Anyway, if you can seperate this from the franchise, you'll do ok 😁",Terminator - Dark Fate
430,mjfhhh,Shocking Opening Awesome Film,9,1 November 2019,"It's been a long time since I felt this way, but when I saw the prologue for TERMINATOR: DARK FATE I wanted to leave. It took me a long time to forgive what had been done to some beloved characters, but it was necessary to establish a really interesting dynamic for Sarah Connor and the T800. It is fun to watch Hamilton and Schwarzenegger reunited once again, and their relationship of mistrust repeated and magnified. It's probably the first sequel since Judgement Day that made me feel emotional about cyborgs fighting each other. Also, this is the first of the sequels since JUDGEMENT DAY that actually feels epic.Mackenzie Davis is a new star to watch. Her superpowered, whilst humanly fragile Grace is much more alive than the script allowed her to be.The weakest link in the cast is Natalia Reyes, here she tries to fill Edward Furlong's shoes, but she has no charisma or relevance. Teenage John Connor was so easy to relate to as a typical suburban boy, Reyes' Dani is as detached a character from this viewer as is humanly possible.The first two Terminator movies were not afraid taking time to establish characters. Dark Fate explodes with action a few minutes into the film. It's fun to watch but it takes away the anticipation.As a movie about the monster from the future that came to kill a beautiful heroin Dark Fate works rather well. As a direct sequel to JUDGEMENT DAY it's not perfect, but definitely worth a look. Evoking just enough curiosity and nostalgia DARK FATE has a lot going for it.

If the answer is yes, you will like this one. The action is top notch, and the effects really good. The same characters, and Arnold has a few humorous lines. Linda Hamilton does a lot of scene chewing, but that's okay. I understand that being released in early November and not distinguishing itself from the other Terminator movies brings a lower than expected box office, which is this movie's problem. It was meant to revitalize the franchise, but so were 3 other films, and they each were abandoned as soon as they hit the theater. Its just too many misses. So spending 200 mill and expecting the audience would show up in droves was really poor planning.SO they should have spent 100 mill and took the Rambo/ Rocky route and it would have been a nice little Terminator film. But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it.",Terminator - Dark Fate
434,gazzalodi,Third best of the franchise,7,15 July 2020,"Which is pretty understandable since they went back and mashed up T1 and T2 for the story. Not much to add after that. Things go boom.

437,skintone-38600,The real sequel to T2,6,9 November 2019,"I agree with the reviewers that this was a gender based statement to empower women, in this MeToo world we live in.
Shame, but despite that, this was a good sequel to T2 and I really enjoyed it.
Arnold's role was really great, and so funny it's worth watching just for the humour.
And yes, it was an action flick like T2 and yes it had been done before, but who cares? It was entertaining and fun.
The other terminator movies after T2 were so disappointing, and especially Genisys, which was so abysmal and forgettable ( hey how do we cash in on the Game of Thrones success? I know, let's cast a terrible actor from Game of Thrones but who cares, she's really popular right now. The plot ? Who cares about that? )",Terminator - Dark Fate
438,TakeUpReel,Not great..,6,5 November 2019,"...but you probably already knew that before going to see this version of the Terminator.I usually dismiss movies rated at a 1 or a 10. They're typically the outliers that don't contribute much to a reasonable review.Honestly, I would have given this movie a 5.5, if I could provide a partial star rating.The movie has a lot of action and I really wasn't expecting much more than that.Most of the story is nothing new. It's just placed in a different color wrapper. You know...
Humans create high-tech machinery.The future is filled with self-aware ""robots"" that want to eliminate humanity.Humans unite around a single person that gives them the will to fight back.The robots send a killer robot into the past to eliminate the person that unifies humanity.The humans send someone/something into the past to protect the person that unifies humanity.A lot of battles ensue.At a high-level, nothing has changed with this overused formula. Did you really think it would?It would have been nice to adhere to some level of continuity from previous Terminator movies however. I wasn't sure if I should judge this movie as a sequel or a stand-alone movie, because it had elements of both.Some scenes made my brain hurt, like....Arnold wanting to be more human and moving in with a woman and her son. His explanation for this was stupid. It seemed that the writers weren't even trying to explain anything (in a reasonable matter) with that plot point.One of the other scenes that wasn't explained well was the way that Arnold knew about the various Terminator's exact time and location of arrival. It was mentioned, but not very well.Also, the plot point about Grace's medicine that she had to take wasn't written well.I didn't like Linda Hamilton's version of Sarah Conner in this movie. I wanted to punch her myself. OK. OK. I get it. John was killed in front of her. She's been dealing with the potential apocalypse forever. She's angry. She's bitter. She wants revenge. However, she came off more as a cranky old lady telling kids to keep off her lawn than a useful partner.Why does Arnold have beard stubble in this movie? Does his cyborg model have the ability to grow facial hair? Shouldn't his appearance be the same as it always has been? Don't get me wrong. I'm glad they didn't de-age him, because that doesn't always look very good. (I'm looking at you ""IT - Chapter 2"").This movie tosses around the F-bomb enough to make Tarantino blush. I'm OK with that, but some people may alarmed by the frequency of use.Actually, I'm glad that the studio didn't try to water down the action by slapping a PG-13 rating on this movie.Terminator: Dark Fate is not the bottom of the barrel (like some reviews suggest), but it's not stellar either. All in all, if you prefer action over plot, substance or continuity...you may like this movie.",Terminator - Dark Fate
439,Abranth-d,Fails to maintain the legacy of T2,4,4 November 2019,"Here's my review of Terminator : Dark Fate. So ' dark fate ' which ironically is the fate of this movie is directed by Tim Miller , the director of Deadpool and written as well as produced by James Cameron himself. Cameron said in an interview that Dark Fate is the true sequel to T2: Judgement day , is it though ? NO ! . Cause this movie is nothing but a cashgrab which tries to make itself work by recreating judgement day with little nods of nostalgia to that movie . The story takes place after the events of Judgement day , which as you know is stopped from happening , but even then young John Conner is killed and twenty years later there's another AI called Legion in place of skynet and they've sent a Terminator to kill this Mexican chick , and an Android is sent back in time to stop that from happening . Linda Hamilton is caught up in this mix and she's the only thing good about this movie , Arnold's in the second act of this movie and felt completely wasted , atleast a few hasta la vistas would've been good , but nope. The Terminator in this movie does exactly what the T-1000 did , the liquid metal thing . Only difference is that the metal alloy looks like the symbiote from Spider-Man and it has the ability to replicate leaving it's exoskeleton behind. The action was okaayish cause you can't see most of it due to sloppy editing and the majority of it (with the exception of a highway chase) happening in dim light , like Batman v Superman level dim light. You can't see in that. The cgi wasn't revealing but wasn't impressive either , it was like that neo v agent Smith(s) scene from matrix revolutions , almost like a PlayStation 2 cutscene at times. In the end, Dark fate is an other failed attempt on softly rebooting the franchise but turning out to be a cashgrab using nostalgia.",Terminator - Dark Fate
440,mocaler,Variations on a theme,4,4 November 2019,"This is the first Terminator movie which I have seen in theaters since T2. I'm not big on time travel stories and plot elements. So I usually wait until the Terminator movies are on TV, streaming or rental. I have, over time, seen each of them. With exception of 1, they are all variations on a theme. Robot goes to the past to kill someone key to the human resistance, etc. The once exception, Salvation, could have taken the franchise out of the time travel mire. But it was done badly. So the franchise continues with the repetitive elements. I went to see this because I thought that the 3 female leads was a cool variation. And there are some other cool elements. There are also some cringe worthy WTF moments. But the biggest cringe factor is that they cannot seen to get past the loop which prevents the story from progressing. I think that I would like to have waited until it became available via rental or streaming.",Terminator - Dark Fate
441,catchuanbu,Terminator dark fate is not Genisys level bad but that doesn't mean that it's much better either. .,6,21 January 2020,"It is such a cringing movie to watch because it's using the same formula just with different people. There are no surprises just disappointments. When you watched T2 after T1, you are surprised that the same looking terminator who tried to kill Sarah in the first movie is actually protecting her in the second movie. I feel like the story writing of this movie is to suit the formula of T1 & T2, and the ages of the actors.The movie introduces two important new characters;
Dani and Grace, and although they are both perfectly acted I found it kind of hard to connect with them. I suppose grace was easier to root for because we were given flashbacks/forwards to her future which gave us some backstory, but overall I felt they struggled to feel unique unlike characters like Kyle Reece.Positive- The stage is set for some extraordinary action sequences with jaw dropping VFX.
However Dark Fate lacks the style and emotional touch of Cameron directed Terminators.I wish SkyNet would send Terminators back in time and try to kill all production of sequels after T2: Judgement Day, including this one.",Terminator - Dark Fate
442,verminhater,Feminism? NO. The Terminator future doesn't have room for gender specific roles.,6,17 January 2020,"There's a lot of binary reviews these days. A film must be a ten or a one to a great many. This is neither. Is it as good as T1 or T2 - no. None of the Terminator films made after T2 have been masterpieces and with a very elderly Arnie why would you expect that?.The story is just like Star Wars - recycle, repeat and pump it out again. Whether it's another death star or in this case another terminator to blow up it is what it is. Why would you go to see a terminator film and not expect to see a terminator to stop? It's well made and there's plenty of action and I enjoyed it.And now the elephant in many reviewer's rooms. The fighters happen to be female. So what? The women act the part of fighters not female fighters. This isn't a Ghost Busters or Oceans 8 female remake for the sole purpose of having a female remake. These characters absolutely could be female and of course Sarah Connor had to be. Remember Kyle Reese's answer to Sarah's question ""What about the women in your future?"". ""They're good fighters"" he answered. Feminism criticism dismissed by Kyle Reese himself.Don't expect a masterpiece like the first two, treat the characters with as little regard for their gender as their future demands and enjoy an action film.",Terminator - Dark Fate
443,fxdx4,The pieces just miss,7,25 January 2020,"Terminator and T2 were iconic films of the 80's (and early 90s), and arguably 2 of the top action films of all time. T2 may be one of the greatest sequels of all time as well. It was iconic, and did exactly what a sequel should. It would be hard to top T2, and for 30 years no one really tried.There were credible inclusions into the series, such as the Sarah Chronicles, and Terminator Salvation, (was there a T3 in there somewhere??) but no sequel until the brutally awful Genysis.Thankfully, our last images of the Terminator franchise are not Genysis. It no longer exists.... Dark Fate - even if it is a film that didn't need to be made - checks the boxes. The new Hollywood heroin, big explosions, amazing effects, 80's retro, all check check.The plot is basically the same the original Terminator. A terminator is sent back in time to kill the leader of the resistance that overthrows Skynet (rebranded as Legion for whatever reason). Thankfully, the film does not try too hard to explain or play with time loops as that is a major folly of many films. This is less a homage, like the first Starwars Force Awakens, and more of just unoriginal story telling.So what works? The movie overall is entertaining - as long as you don't think or look too close. The new Terminator baddy is cool. Hamilton and Arnie are great to see again, and they work well. Arnie acting as a robot, ironically, is shockingly strong.So why isn't it great? Well it is the new formula for films that has grown tired. Special effects over plot, soft rebooting of an old franchise in hopes lighting strikes twice. There is nothing really new here, no new story to tell, no really need for the film other than to fill a release date for a studio.In many ways, it fails under it's own expectations. Had this been a film called ""Dark Fate"" and had to ties to Terminator, it may be an 8, as compared to T2 it's a 6, so maybe split the difference at go a generous 7/10.
We deserve a great sequel, not an ok one.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Sadly, Sarah Conner is the anchor of the movie. Meaning she drags it down to a standstill.
Otherwise, it's a fun adventure.

446,Lost_In_Translation_,"Best of the Post-T2 movies, still lackluster",5,31 October 2019,"I've seen all the Terminator movies except for Genisys. This one for sure is the best of all the post-Terminator 2 sequels, but it's still just an average movie.None of the action scenes are anything special and there's an over use of passable CGI. Some de-aging for certain scenes happens and it does NOT look good. Thankfully it's only mostly the opening. Even then the rest of the CGI is alright. There's a scenes here and there that it doesn't look too great, but it's good enough.Mackenzie Davis is pretty great in this. I hope she gets more roles after this movie. Would have 100% worked without Linda Hamilton, but it was nice to see her back on the big screen. Arnie's part is small and towards the end and makes the movie a little bit better. The new female lead is good, but rarely feels like a character in the movie.The pacing is really awkward in this. There's a good 45 mins in the middle when they're trying to cross the Mexico/America border and getting caught by border patrol which brings all of the momentum of the first act to a complete halt. Action doesn't need to be happening non-stop, but the middle just isn't interesting. Nearly fell asleep towards the ending as the final action scene is a bit dull and just a mess of a lot of dark scenes where you can't tell what is happening.This also barely earns it's R rating. There's really only one scene with any major blood, the rest is the f-bomb dropped maybe a dozen times.Even though this one wasn't terrible, please stop making Terminator movies.",Terminator - Dark Fate
447,sme3,A Dark Fate Indeed,6,26 November 2019,"The Terminator franchise has simply exhausted its premise. Though the plot of this film might be the best that can be done to wring another film out of this series, the suspension of disbelief needed to accept this film is too high. The relentless impossibilities throughout the film render the action scenes unexciting. The film lacks the suspense, surprises, and strong characterizations of the James Cameron entries in the series. Unquestionably considerable work by talented people went into making this unnecessary film.",Terminator - Dark Fate
448,machrf,Terminator movies don't disappoint,10,26 January 2021,"They keep somethings the same and make some things different. They seem to take a path that you may think is no good and turn it into a great story. I would have liked to have seen a Terminator that stayed in the same timeline, maybe in-between the movies before this one. The women are getting a bit too butch for me. Why does society think that strong women have to be a double for a man? Today, no one knows of a strong feminine woman. Very sad. So, it was very pleasant to find myself being caught up in the movie. You can't help to feel for the characters. You have the familiar aspects of the known and new characters and yet they stretch the confines of their roles. For me, the familiar scenes were not overdone. They had enough of a twist in them to push the movie to new heights. Unfortunately, with the characters that we are familiar with they are getting older now and probably will not be in another Terminator movie. So, the introduction of new blood with a new nemesis, same yet different, might just keep the series going for another generation. By the end of the movie I was thoroughly enjoying the interactions between them all. I dont want to say it is a great end to the series due to the actors getting older. I would rather look at it as a new beginning to more Terminator movies.",Terminator - Dark Fate
449,FabledGentleman,The Terminator Franchise is Dead to me now,3,30 October 2019,"Not in the slightest did i think, a few hours ago, that this movie would be so bad, that it almost rivaled Genisys, but the sad truth is, it is. This is the second worst Terminator movie ever made, and THAT was something i really didn't expect.After all, the story is by James Cameron, he also produced it, it has both Schwarzenegger and Hamilton revisiting their roles, and it also has Tim Miller at the helm, who did a really good job with Deadpool. So this should be fine right? I mean, what can go wrong? At least it will be pretty good, or nothing less than decent right?Wrong.Already when less than five minutes has passed you start to notice that things are off. It just doesn't have the same vibe or atmosphere that the first two terminator films had, it just feels weirdly ""lesser"". The CGI is not good either, and the acting is stiff, and uninspired. And as time passes, and each scene fails to accomplish it's main goal, the movie starts to fall apart. Bit by bit, frame by frame, the movie slowly implodes.This movie tries really hard to build heart and connection between the characters, but it totally fails at it, making the end of the movie a travesty to watch. I had to shake my head when i saw what was displayed on screen.The Terminator here is a sort of modern version of T-1000, but it feels like a bad copy of it. Split in two.. Was that suppose to be the ""up the ante"" trick? The Rev-9 is boring, unoriginal, uninspired and badly designed.And there is also something else i need to address, which i rarely do. And that is the SJW propaganda we see a little too much in movies these days. In Terminator 2, when Sarah meets her Mexican friend with the guns, it felt completely right. The scenes made perfect sense, the chemistry between Sarah and Enrique was spot on, those scenes were there to build on the story. In this movie however, when you see a Mexican, that Mexican is there for an agenda, not because it makes the story better. And you can feel it, it just feels off.I sat there in the Cinema thinking to myself, there is going to come a scene at some point that introduces an asian and a black person at the same time, it just has too. And yes, it does... This is not coincidental. And I'm sorry that i have i address this, it shouldn't be necessary.I feel robbed of my money right now. I seriously didn't expect this film to be so bad, yes it is, bad. This is the exact same story yet again, just told without inspiration, without emotion, without originality, without groundbreaking CGI, without a good story. It has very little to offer all in all. And i strongly advice all fans of Terminator 1 and 2 to stay as far away from this movie as you can, it will piss you off.I cannot believe Hamilton signed up for this, well i guess she got payed, and she probably don't care if her ""career"" goes down after this, it's not like she much of one as of lately. But she should not have done this, just let it be with the two films that are actually really good.The Terminator Franchise is unsalvageable now, this was the final nail in the coffin, and it was thoroughly inserted to the core of the franchise. This movie needs to fail at the box office, and it probably will. It's already failing in Europe, and the big event premiere where i just saw it, had only sold half of it's seats. When a triple A movie fails this bad, it's because people don't recommend it, because they dislike it. in this case, i have to agree, the movie should never have been made. Now let the terminator franchise rest.For me there is only two terminator movies, all the others never happened.3/10 - Bad",Terminator - Dark Fate

Irrelevant, disillusion. Breaks with the story to create a very similar story, why? Doesn't make sense, and the new story itself gets lost in its own web, not being logical and where a lot doesn't make any sense.
Technically good, cinematography is well done but weak script. And terrible performance by actress Mackenzie Davis, impressive by the negative, very rigid and expressionless ...

451,Eric266,"Enjoyable, but Kind of Middling",6,3 November 2020,"Dark Fate is not on the level of the first two Terminator movies, but is better than the last 3. (I actually kind of liked Genysis so you can ignore the rest of my review if you hated that movie.) Dark Fate is pretty much a retelling of the original Terminator. Skynet no longer exists in the future, but humankind has created a different AI known as Legion which accomplished the same thing. A robot is sent back in time to kill a young Mexican woman to prevent a future where humans triumph. Just like in the first movie, future humans send back one of their own to protect her. While I agree the plot is just a rehash, its actually got some new wrinkles to it.Linda Hamilton returns as a hardened, bitter Sarah Connor. She has been hunting terminators for the last 20 years. Mackenzie Davis is Grace, a soldier from the future, sent back to protect Dani (Natalia Reyes), the key humakinds future. Of course, Arnold Schwarzenegger is back. He is still a T-800, but is not a terminator from any of the previous films. Apparently, Skynet had sent back several T-800s to kill John and he is playing another one who has a connection to Sarah (which I won't spoil). The new evil REV-9 terminiator is played by Gabriel Luna and he is about on par with Kristanna Loken (T3) in terms of menace and screen presence, both far below T2's Robert Patrick. Ms. Loken is much nicer to look at so she grades a bit higher. Mr. Luna's terminator talks too much and it really lowers the menace stakes when you realize he is not just an unstoppable machine, but is kind of rational, too.The plot has been done so many times that I think fans have just gotten tired of the schtick, which accounts for the bad reviews. In the original, the machines tried to kill Sarah and then T2 took on the machines trying to kill John. The less said about T3 and Salvation, the better. Schwarzennegger is fun in this role and he has some pretty funny moments about how his terminator has adapted to the human world for the last 20 years (which might make a pretty good movie in its own right). While most movies these days seem intent on turning every lead character into a female, this one actually made sense. Bringing back Linda Hamilton was a nice call back and having a second female protagonist to help protect a teenage girl, makes more sense then sending back some macho male soldier. The special effects were adequate, but not nearly as jaw dropping as T2's liquid metal terminator. Its all been done before (kind of like Jurassic Park). Still, it was a nice, action-filled 2+ hours and I was not at all disappointed. Don't compare it to T2 and you will enjoy it as much as I did.",Terminator - Dark Fate

456,impendingdd,Terminate this franchise.,1,27 March 2020,"This film was supposed to be the opportunity for redemption of a franchise that went south after Cameron's ""T2"". Linda Hamilton returns and Arnie's on board again. Before the trailer this film looked positive. Then the trailer dropped which was disappointing because of the new actors and CGI. Then Hamilton reluctantly said the film was just ""okay"" on Jimmy Kimmel, then it was released and bombed. And rightfully so. The film's CGI is terrible and the actors look like they belong in a B movie. The story and script are a huge middle finger to the original franchise. I'd never thought I'd live in a time where I think that T3 is actually a decent film. Salvation, Genisys, Dark Fate are all trash. It's sad. Give the film to an amazing director, does no one want the job? Somewhere in another universe there's an amazing Terminator sequel. With the technology we have these days there could be such an awesome film. It's a massive disappointment and at this point it's a dark fate for this franchise unless a miracle comes along. Star Wars was redeemed with ""The Mandalorian"" so I suppose there's always a chance for a different, fresh (but true to the original) direction.",Terminator - Dark Fate
457,askeland89,My curiosity got the best of me,3,5 November 2019,"When I first heard that James Cameron was serving as a ""Godfather"" of sorts for Tim Miller to make an ACTUAL sequel to Judgement Day I was hyped to the max.
Now I'm starting to suspect that neither of them had any involvement in this. To me it seems like they just printed their names in the credits as a sales tactic.
I gave it 3 stars. 1 for decent action scenes, 1 for decent-ish visual effects and another one for Linda Hamilton because hey...
I was prepared to be disappointed, but not to this extend. Calling this mediocre is an overstatement, this movie straight up sucked!!T1 & T2 will always have a special place in my heart, but regardless.. I am officially DONE with this franchise!! Don't even bother wasting your money.",Terminator - Dark Fate

This movie is like watching several movies mashed together. The basic plot is unashamedly a rehash of T2. We got played for suckers, when will holly-weird learn. How many box office flops before they wake from being woke?
*Spoilers*
Only joking this movie is already spoiled. I recommend watching this so you too can shout at the screen and shake your fist. The best thing about this movie is the franchise is dead. Was that the plan all along?",Terminator - Dark Fate
459,yaornw,"Not a bad sequel, just not epically great",5,3 June 2020,"When James Cameron returns, the expectations are high. And if Dark Fate has a flaw, it's that it doesn't live up to those expectations. It's not a bad Terminator film, it's just not great. And great is what we needed after such a long wait. Like too many sequels before it, it retreads the same ground, and that's the problem. Terminator 1 and 2 were each distinct enough to bring new worldbuilding and ideas. The films since have mostly just retread a formula without much significant development. The return to creative direction of Cameron implied the promise of breaking new ground, and that just didn't happen here. Is there lots of over the top action? Yes. Arnold? Yes. Linda? Yes. But the new characters, while serviceable, just aren't as interesting or dynamic as what we need for something fresh. Their backstory is interesting, and the actresses are fine, but the characters are mostly more of the same as thing play out. And so we are left with the feeling we've seen this all before, which if we're going to do that, we might as well go back to the original source which is great and better than watch an ok retread. It's too bad too. Because Cameron had a hive mind of science fiction minds throwing out ideas and yet he doesn't seem to have let them really cut loose in any significant way. This film could have been filled with surprises, instead it's just what we expect form a Terminator sequel except one thing: the unexpected. That's what we wanted most. Not getting it leads to disappointment. And thus the film and franchise fail.",Terminator - Dark Fate

This movie starts a new timeline with a story that looks completely more of the same, full of recycled concepts that we've seen in other Terminator films but now with Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger coming back to their big roles and as a fan, that's what I really wanted.
The action sequences are good but their editing is full of cuts and sometimes that can be a little annoying.I liked, even expecting something better and different. Take a look if you're a fan, but don't expect to watch something incredible. Like I wrote, this movie is more of the same.",Terminator - Dark Fate
462,mr_sharma,Fun if pointless and miles better than Genysis (but that is a really low bar),6,15 December 2020,"After Terminator 2, Terminator films have been well....why did they bother. May be Terminator 3 was an interesting diversion and Salvation had potential. Genysis was utter, utter rubbish.This latest cash in on the franchise provides a predominantly female led crew of protagonists. Does it matter? No. Anyone could have inhabited these roles except of the role played by Arnie (that's not a spoiler...it's in the trailer).Time travel has become just some convenient method of story telling missing out logic and paradox issues and failing to answer questions like how the hell did a terminator actually grow old and how exactly do ""let's have a go"" drug cocktails work?The main problem, of what is really a B movie fun actioner, is it's lack of originality or indeed any empathy for any of it's characters.There has been a resurrection of sorts in recalling back plots from the first two films, bringing back Sarah Connors and Arnie but all of it just seems like a rehash with a few comedy touches and no real sense of danger. And that lack of danger is really down to the script. It's serviceable in what it does but there is simply no love or reason for the audience to say, oh no he/she is dead....If you had never seen a Terminator film, yeah this could seem original but I suspect the majority of the audience are those looking for that mythical pot of gold that is an original Terminator film. Something that does something that follows on from the first two and delivers something genuinely new and interesting.Unfortunately, this film (like a more plausible version of fast and furious without the serious OTT) doesn't do that.Pity for a script co written with James Cameron.To give you an example of what I mean, take Rocky.Rocky set the standard. Rocky 2 did a sequel that discussed what made Rocky who he was in amongst the newly found wealth and fame. All good.Rocky 3 introduced the charasmatic Mr. T. Something different.Rocky 4 went Ivan Drago. Memorable but ultimately getting very silly but nevertheless fun. Rocky was becoming a caricature or even a symbol of America in the time of the Cold War.Rocky 5 (the least liked) tried to go back to the roots and it failed.And that was that. Rocky had run it's course and there was nothing to say.Except, Stallone had one more preposterous story to tell...from the viewpoint of the aging cowboy. What makes Rocky who is....despite his age and it's impedance and from that was crafted something beautiful....something original....something different....preposterous idea but oh so heartfelt. It felt like a Rocky film and worthy of being part of the Rocky cannon.That sign off was the signal to create Creed and develop the storytelling of legacy and what is a father? Good stuff.All that was there in Terminator 2 and sadly that genuine humanness is lacking in all of the subsequent films.I cried at the end of Terminator 2.I just switched off after Terminator: Dark fate and wrote a review.Completely unaffected or showing any emotion whatsoever.Oh well. May be the story of an aging Terminator may someday be told and we'll all end up loving it.This film is a Saturday morning switch your brain off enjoyable couple hours of your time. You really won't be talking about it by Saturday evening.",Terminator - Dark Fate

*This movie feels like the same old roots again and maybe thats a good thing?*Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the legendary terminator we all know and love and is light hearted than ever before he's know joined by Linda Hamilton who plays Sara Connor who absolutely Steals the show every second she's on screen.
*We are now also joined by two new characters Grace who is the new badass terminator/human wich has a with a great background.*Gabi is also new and has a very interesting twist in this film without going in on details.
*for those who dosen't like Females leading a movie, give me a break already it's 2019 i don't have to say anymore.*The action was great maybe the best in all the terminators films and maybe that's because of the outstanding Vfx (special effects.
*I tought judgment day had a great story don't get me wrong but this film has better effects obviously cause it's made 28 years after so the action is getting great*so i would finish by say i personally think that this is a perfect followup to a great franshise it has bring in a little more to it that just make it fit in even more!

Hollywood and everyone involved with this film should be ashamed and quit their job immediately so nothing like this gets created ever again!They just had to throw-in the tons of feminism, PC, illegal aliens, detention centers, A comedic Mexican terminator..3 female leads (one with butch hair), first half the movie I thought I was watching a Spanish flick ripoff due to most dialog being in Spanish, I had to double check this was the movie I paid for..then Linda halmaton showed up...so yeah there is much much more just constantly rubbed in your face, sorry but the Mexican girl is not believable as a resistance leader or whatever she does (unites other feminists?), also its funny she looks the same age when they show 20-40 years in the future, LOL, if you actually watched terminator 1 and 2 you can see how John was brought up always dealing with issues and was prepped as a kid and was just tough sob (foster parents, nuts mother, hacking, thugs, terminators ...etc), why would anyone follow this girl and her man (everyone) hater cyborg, because she can speak Spanish and English?, actually the whole cyborg thing was a joke since they are absolutely useless against the machine (which looked like the same machine in the future so one would think they would build the cybernetics to combat that specific model).Halmaton says the cyborg has no clue about this future (how cellphones can be a tracking beacon), but later the cyborg does some 'future stuff' on the phone to track the text messages - clearly she knew about cellphones, she is just USELESS and allowed the girl to keep a phone the whole time...btw funny the phone had DIP switches LOL are we back in the 90s?Then there are tons of plot holes - like why this new AI (separate from skynet), wanted to go back in time and take her out when she wasn't even a good resistance/feminist leader, and why their robot design is taking on a human form, there was only one design? (in t2 they had to evolve to blend in), what would be the point of a hard skeleton and carbon/water overlay that can split?... in the future the humans were flying in this big easy to detect apc thing with jet engines lol.How this cyborg girl gets sent back in time and why? (I thought the time machine was part of skynet...), she failed at every task, even in the future the machine made quick work of her, and how did she save the commander? she got tentacled like everyone else, and wasn't even near him.....useless.blah not even going to continue making sense of this mess. I do know I will not watch any future Terminator movies or any BIG name remake, learned my lesson., seriously 1 and 2 were awesome.Lesson LEARNEDBTW I love a female lead when it's done correctlyFemale leads done right.

473,vuileharry,A highly enjoyable movie and the silly ratings,9,16 January 2020,"People that give this movie a 1 or 2 star can never be taken seriously by anyone with a functioning brain. 1 or 2 stars is exclusively for movies like 'Battlefield Earth' or 'Hellraiser 9', and you can't possibly put this movie in that range. No matter howmany of them there are: giving a movie like this a rating below 4 shows that you don't understand what rating between 1 to 10 means. Or you're just being extremely silly for weird reasons.Then there is the seemingly endless line of whiners about 'sexism' and 'oooo the greenhaired women are coming to destroy us all'!! Basicly they will give the movie a 1 star because there's a woman in it. This goes towards laughable and is also not to be taken seriously. I can't help but wonder if we're dealing with a parade of 5-year olds...And then there is a far more sensible group of low raters, from who I suspect they just want to keep watching Terminator 1 and 2. This at least I can understand.Yes T1 and T2 were MUCH better movies. In fact, both those movies wrote bloody film-history!! But: they already exist and nothing in the Terminator world is ever gonna come aywhere near them. You want to watch a really GREAT movie? Go watch T1 or T2 or else you will have to watch something totally else!Now I only made this into a 9-star to compensate a bit for the silly amount of ridiculous 1's that make absolutely no sense. But I actually think it's a high 7. Because this movie is just meant to entertain and: it does!

Besides the politically correct, the squalid feminism and a mediocre cast (Davis and Hamilton are weak) the most execrable thing is the way in which they raped the character of the T-800 making him a sort of involuntary comic character, poor Arnold, I can't believe he lent himself to such an abomination.I just hope that now Terminator 3 is reviewed, an excellent and underrated sequel and also the TRUE final of the franchise.Do yourself a favor, avoid this crap.",Terminator - Dark Fate

476,Chance_Boudreaux19,Will it ever die?,4,24 October 2019,"Much like Skynet or Legion or whatever you want to call it this franchise refuses to die. It's lifespan was two great movies, yet it insists on making more and more sequels that keep failing miserably. Terminators 1 and 2 are nearly perfect and should've been the whole franchise because really there was nowhere else to go after T2's ending which was perfect and left the fate of the world open to interpretation. Apart from trying to show the future, which Salvation tried to do and did not succeed the only way this franchise can keep going is by rehashing the same idea of a Terminator being sent from the future to hunt a person that is vital to humanity's resistance against the machines in the future. But there is a sort of twist in this one which anyone will be able to see coming from a mile off. It turns out the Terminator is there to kill the main female character not because she is going to give birth to the future leader of the resistance but because she becomes the leader. If they wanted to go this route they should've gotten a different actress for the role as not for one minute did I buy that Natalia Reyes can rally people to rebel against the A.I. She was very bland and her seemingly inspirational moments did not resonate with me whatsoever. Mackenzie Davis is also not the best actress but she is more serviceable in the role she fulfills. Linda Hamilton is good and Arnie is great and seeing him on the big screen is always fun. I wish both of them could've been in a better movie but it is only because of their performances that the movie gets 4 stars instead of 3. Most of the movie is just one action sequence followed by another action sequence with a large portion of them being uninspired and bland. The best action sequences occur in the first twenty minutes and when T-800 fights the new Terminator. The movie hints at a sequel which will inevitably happen but I refuse to watch it as I can officially state I am done with this franchise which simply has nothing to offer anymore. There is no reason to continue and no place it can go that will be remotely interesting. It's simply a dead horse that's been beaten to death over and over again for over two decades and unfortunately this will probably continue for at least two more.",Terminator - Dark Fate

As a standalone Terminator film it is a lot of fun and really well done.
And yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger is in the film! It takes a while of story to get to him, but once he arrives he is in it until the end.
There is some controversy surrounding the politics of the movie. There are a few things that are mentioned briefly but THEY ARE NOT the main point of the movie!

I didn't find it boring and the action was good. I think when you compare it to the first two then yes it falls short but as it's own movie I thought it was good and entertaining.
I do feel they retread some old story ideas, more like a greatest hits of the first 3 while ignoring 5 and 6-and thankfully they did but to pour on the hate for this film was unwarranted.
I did find the female leads a bit of a PC move but all were great and felt it was more for show and unnecessary.
The story line is a bit of a recon and thought they were trying to set up future sequels but I also thought this film marked a deserved end to the franchise. Where else can this story go that hasn't already been told?
This movie has moments for the fans and offered something for new viewers but then again why erase what T1/T2 did? They merged all the first 3 into this one and again while I liked the movie I still feel it was a good ending of the franchise and should be treated as such.

Like a lot of you I'm such a huge fan of the first two films, and the first movie was even my first R Rated movie I watched when I was 6 years old, so I indeed have some nostalgic ties to these films. I've seen 3, Salvation, and Genisys, and while those aren't great I still had some sort of enjoyment from those movies for what they are. Dark Fate I thought was going to be the true return to form, they got Linda Hamilton back, James Cameron was involved, it's rated R! I really thought this was going to be the true sequel to T2, and this is what the movie proudly marketed itself as. I WAS BETRAYED, BE-TRAYED. This movie completely destroys the Terminator mythology in just 5 minutes which is astounding. If you love Terminator 2 as much as I do, if you love the idea of John Connor and seeing him as leader of the human resistance in the future, you're gonna hate this film. They take the story in a certain direction that completely reboots the entire timeline post T2. And I'm sure you know what it is, John Connor gets killed by another T-800 and is basically replaced by a new character so the franchise can be PC moving forward. The movie never bounces back from this terrible story decision and I found it really hard to enjoy knowing that John would not be a main character going forward. I'm totally fine with changing the formula in these franchises if you need a reason to keep going, but they don't even have the audacity to tell a new story here. It repeats the plot of Terminator 1 while also carrying elements of T2. And who knows they could make the timeline a bigger mess by having John and Kyle Reese travel from a different timeline but do we really need to see anymore of this? Please avoid this movie at all costs, save your hard earned money or use it to buy a new copy of the first two films. Please don't support this, don't give them the hope of continuing this franchise, just terminate it now!!",Terminator - Dark Fate
490,namikazedante,One of the BEST !,10,17 February 2021,First off don't believe the score this movie has on this site. I would rate it more like 8 or 9 out of 10. The story is great and with very good tempo and the characters are believable. Some cheesy lines towards the end but I gotta say this is one of my favorite action/drama movies now. So sad that I was let to believe it sucked just because of people who can't understand what a great movie is. And also Arnold is amazing in the movie and funny too haha,Terminator - Dark Fate
491,Nathan4,Too many unanswered questions,5,1 October 2021,"I know going into a movie like this to leave logic and reason at the door and just enjoy the ride, so my problem isn't with how a solid metal person is also simultaneously fully liquid while also being able to do other things that don't make sense. No, my problem is with the massive questions created by the plot of the film that we're waiting patiently for them to finally get answered...eventually...right? ...only to get to ""roll credits."" The first half of the film is a solid 6.5, but the combination of the story leaving the audience frustrated and Linda Hamilton's increasing presence on the screen (Surprise! She's still a terrible actress) causing me to say ""ugh"" more times than I could count...brings it in with a disappointing finish.",Terminator - Dark Fate
492,btkb,Pretty Good! I Liked It,9,16 June 2020,"I give it a 9/10 because it is pretty good.The storyline is about the same as the first one. Possibly the second one as well.It doesn't involve John Connor anymore since the future has been altered.I'm wondering if this movie is set to a different universe since we see a different Terminator from Schwarzenegger.It is still not that bad. It is entertaining. You get to see Arnold fight. Some might say it is not good, but you will enjoy it, if you are a big fan of Terminators.",Terminator - Dark Fate
493,asphyxion_,Embodies Hollywood's rampant decay; highly indicative of American Mainstream Cinema's most glaring flaws,1,16 February 2020,"There's absolutely nothing memorable or satisfying in the latest Terminator offering; what we're given is a souless husk of a movie that is devoid of any real inspiration. The days of practical effects requiring make up artists and sfx producers to stay on their toes and invent new ways to blow an audience's mind have been replaced with computer users rendering low resolution CGI in Maya or Adobe with no concept of the laws of physics or cohesive/mellifluous film editing. It's an insult to the price paid for a ticket in this day and age when the special effects in the latest Terminator movie can't hold a candle to the effects from Judgement Day. In the days of near-supercomputing-capable PCs with processing power several hundred times stronger than the computers used to process Judgement Day's cgi, would make you believe that the effects we see on screen should look so cohesive and real that it would be impossible and imperceptible to the human eye to tell the difference between pseudo and actual. Instead, we are denched head-to-toe in low-rent CGI that's actually comically bad and palm-facingly phony/unconvincing, which breaks any possible immersion almost entirely. The only thing saving Dark Fate is a mind-blowing object-mapped ATMOS soundtrack..the audio is jaw-dropping. But as they often say: "" no matter what, you can't spit shine a turd""",Terminator - Dark Fate

Yeah the effects are better, and the action is pretty much as you would expect, but to virtually rip off the original film? Big let down for me. Linda Hamilton just came across as a bitter old woman, and Arnie, well, enough said. There just wasn't the tension or the real scary visions of the future of the earlier films. It reminded me of a long TV episode, I
loved the Terminator franchise, but I thought this was a massive let down. Gets five as a stand alone action thriller, if you haven't seen the original watch this first.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I was semi-supportive until 48 mins in, then it morphed into some victim-y hard luck lady drama, with bad dialogue and peppered with (not untimely, but annoying in fictional entertainment) cultural messaging. The signaling/innuendos aren't the issue, its that it's appearing at all in a sci-fi franchise based on entertainment.One of the mains gets regularly injured, going unconscious, and/or sick, which is bizarre and idiotic if the narrative is supposed to be that a soldier-rescuer is about as relentless and indestructible as a full terminator. Future Augmented Lady-Only Problems? Like, WHY would there be built-in weaknesses, such as a need for what looks like semen injections?The witty banter and clever tag phrases are missing entirely, but at least there weren't stripper scenes or sexy outfits for no reason.It becomes intolerably farcical when the dynamic becomes 3 emotional and embittered mortal women supported by the immortal, adaptable, unemotional father and husband figure, Terminator 1.It's a shame it was so poorly done.",Terminator - Dark Fate

All effects in general are very good. Good direction. The performances seeems VERY GOOD. Still it seems saturated with the action, too much and lacks taste. The film also starts well and then falls into a hole and has a hard time getting out, SSSLOWWW and when Arnie comes, it gets up; i don't feel good tempo; slow by pieces and a lot of action on others, that is, I don't think it has a good editing. Is it bad? NOT AT ALL, but it didn't convince me. Worthy sequel to the first 2. Many will hate it for what they did with a certain character.",Terminator - Dark Fate
506,ivo_shandor,How do we we outdumb Genysis,1,28 September 2020,"We thought Terminator: Genysis was dumb, Terminator: Dark Fate takes the cake. You think to yourself, well, Genysis was terrible. Then you see Dark Fate, and you're like, that was also terrible, but it gets worse in different ways. It was reminding me so much of Dark Phoneix, a bad movie that thinks it's trying to spout a good message; then it falls flat on it's face. While shot slightly more competently than Genysis, it quickly turns into a Looney Tunes farce, complete with flying Terminators. It's dumb, frustrating and I just wanted it to end. It also answers none of my questions and throws its own message into the garbage. It's like watching a messy nightmare happen before your eyes that you can't understand. It's not treated like any direct sequel to Judgement Day, it's like it forgot the first two movies existed. Every decision about it is either confusing or irritating. It's clearly a soft reboot, though I think we need to invent a new term, sledgehammer reboot (to the face), where it's not trying to be subtle about letting the past die (kill it if you have to). So thanks for that, James Cameron. It's dumb, it treats me like I'm dumb, and is filled with ham-fisted social commentary. If it's one thing people want to see in their action movie about killer robots from the future, it's social politics. There's weird acting and awkward acting from our main characters and moments that just killed the franchise outright. There's terrible visual effects that even the movie was embarrassed about, where the trailers had some of the worst effects I've ever seen, and they quickly cut them down or out entirely in the finished product. During the movie, I could see the exact moment in Arnold's eyes when he stopped caring about this stupid franchise; the moment he realized he was too good for even this. It's one saving grace is that it was rated R and had a few decent action scenes, but given the state of movies, that's no victory in this or any galaxy. It's like the producers were thinking, they bought their tickets, they knew what they were getting into. I say, let 'em crash.",Terminator - Dark Fate
507,LincolnSixEko,A HUGE slap in the face to Terminator and T2.,2,6 February 2020,"T2 is my favorite movie of all time. Action, storytelling, characters, direction, pacing, special effects are all spot on. I watched T1 and T2 back to back to prepare for the so-called ""true sequel"" to T2.Here though, were treated to a continuation of T2 that makes absolutely no sense. It's like everything that happened in T2 never happened, or if it did it was just a waste. Killing John Connor in the first 5 minutes of the film... absolutely ridiculous. And the way the Terminator kills him is so casual too.The first 20 minutes or so is set in Mexico, so it being 2020 (or 2019 if you watched it in the theatre), it has to be politically correct or someone on Twitter will complain about it so we get everything subtitled for us dumb Americans instead of them just speaking English.There's so many other things I hate about this movie but I'll cover the worst of the worst:
-Arnold is a learning machine yes, but they took it too far with him feeling ""bad"" about murdering John Connor so he helps a woman and her son and basically becomes his stepdad.
-Its way too reliant on heavy CGI instead of a good story line. And much of the CGI looks kinda crappy especially for a movie with a $190 million budget.
-Hispanic Terminator can run fast, jump high, dodge bullets, make multiple stabbing weapons, separate himself from his endoskeleton, infiltrate data lines and even create a gun out of nowhere. Sorry, but that's just WAY too much. Explosions, guns and fire don't kill him, but somehow the skinny enhanced human fem-dude obliterates him with her...power cell? And the human girl is the one that stabs him in the eye with it??? Cmon.
-Arnold doesn't even show up until an hour is left of the movie.
-Linda Hamilton has absolutely no chemistry with anyone in the film. From a character I rooted for in the first and second movies, here she's just a foul mouthed vulgar old b**** that I disliked most.I hate this movie. Since it bombed at the movies I was still hopeful it would be a decent Terminator film before watching it, but it's all just a huge waste of everyone's time. RIP Terminator.",Terminator - Dark Fate
508,pnathan28,It's not terrible,7,2 February 2020,"I have to say it's not the worst Terminator sequel, actually the best one since T2 (which isn't saying much).

509,Mynameisroman,contains everything thats wrong with hollywood those days,5,31 August 2021,In its core its a rehash of everything we have seen before only worse. As many said before some characters are almost a parody of their former selfs. The writers wanted to mess with the viewers expectations. So they also included a couple of surprises that no one asked for. They even succeeded in gender swapping a key character which happens a lot in movies theses days. And of course lots of stupid jokes. The action seems to be all CGI so nothing really exiting happening. I hope they won't do another one.

514,derangedxzombie,The most 'Terminator-ey' sequel since T2,7,8 February 2020,"This film got a lot of criticism because it features 3 females leads, or 2 in particular; a female Terminator and female survivor being hunted. The female being hunted is Mexican, the Rev9 Terminator doing the hunting is a Latino male and there is a homosexual relationship or pointers to such. This can all seem somewhat SJW pandering; trying to please a certain group for clout, a group that won't even watch your movie, only criticize if they're not pandered to. On the one hand, movies can really do without taking this route; one that's now very yawn-some and cringey, as it holds no authenticity in the choices made. This is certainly a negative point.But on the positive, if you can overlook this SJW pandering, the movie is good. It feels most like the Terminator 3 we never got. The futuristic scenes depicted feel more in alignment with what was shown in T1 & T2 (not the bog standard apocalyptic settings in the other sequels that are in a hundred movies). And the action sequences, the explosions and fights are all really good, they're entertaining.This would've scored higher without the SJW pandering and choice of 1 or two characters. The actors did fine in their respective roles though. Worth a watch on DVD/TV/Stream, probably would've been good at the cinema because of the explosions and fight scenes.",Terminator - Dark Fate
515,huntersmithx,Has this franchise met its' dark fate? Not quite yet.,7,3 November 2019,"""Terminator: Dark Fate"" is a gritty and solid follow-up to ""The Terminator"" and ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"". It's the ""Superman Returns"" of the franchise; ignoring several reviled installments in favor of a continuation from the masterful second installment.It mostly works; and major things working its' favor are the high octane action and well rounded main characters. The sun shines on Linda Hamilton's excellent return as Sarah Connor; a smart, cunning yet witty and vulnerable warrior. Welcome hosts here are Mackenzie Davis as cyborg heroine Grace and Natalia Reyes as Dani Ramos. Gabriel Luna's villain Rev-9 is a worthy follow-up to Robert Patrick's T-1000.The film amps up some interesting ideas from prior installments. Humor and wit is used more organically here than in 2015's ""Terminator: Genisys"" and some other recent blockbusters.It does lack some of the practical effects and heightened reality present in the first two classics. The action sequences that work outweigh some towards the third act that are too over-the top. I can understand if people say that this story is derivative of the second film, although there's a fair share of new elements to make this not a complete retread.While not a masterpiece, this is definitely a step in the right direction for the series.Grade- B",Terminator - Dark Fate
516,bobbyf,The death nail of any action film: It's boring.,4,18 November 2019,"The Terminator franchise was one of my favorites. I love time travel, the apocalypse, etc. and the first three -maybe 4 - movies work for me. Genisys was a betrayal of all that came before and violated the continuity of the time line.
This movie... sigh. First, it has an obvious social agenda- feminism - SJW - pro immigration - I don't want my action movies to preach at me. Just blow stuff up.
Next, there are long stretches in this movie where nothing happens and I was bored to death. I was actually checking my watch hoping it would end.
There's also too much fighting. Yeah, we get it already. You can't kill this thing with conventional means, so stop trying, already. The futility is exhausting.
And from a production stand point, the movie is visually dark. It's actually hard to see what is happening sometimes because everything is so dark. Arnie and Linda mailed in their performances.
And there's the total ignorance of everything that came before. Hey- you don't like where the story went after T2? Then fix ti from where we are. Don't completely ignore the timeline. Ignore Genisys- yes, but pick up after Salvation. Show us the discovery of the time displacement lab. Well, on second thought, just leave it alone now.

517,JWJanneck,Wokeness isn't even its biggest problem.,3,18 January 2020,"So, yeah, it's woke. Female warriors, a Latino terminator, a Latina resistance hero, the works. No black guy this time (did Black people somehow got dropped from the identity politics grid?), no gay folks either (although apparently the androgynous vibe of the heroine from the future did register in some circles, so maybe that counts), but yeah, it is politically correct, as seems to be de rigueur in early 21st century educational cinema: all woke and, apparently, pretty broke.But here's the thing: that's not even the problem. At least not the biggest one. Women had played various major roles in the Terminator universe before, Sarah Connor herself, obviously, there was a Terminatrix or two, so what's the big deal with a female leader of the ""resistance""?The real problem with this installment isn't wokeness, but simply that it's a lousy movie. It really is. The writing is dull and uninspired, the dialog for the most part plodding and unfunny (Arnold has a couple of lines that might make you chuckle, but that's it), the characters (especially the new ones) are vapid, uninteresting, and impossible to relate to, and the acting, especially by Reyes but also Davis, just really, really bad. And that's the long and short of it. The special effects were competent, the fighting well choreographed though ultimately predictable and largely pointless, but as a movie, it was just not a very good one, and also had been done much better almost thirty years ago.Had the writing been funnier, smarter, more light-footed and ironic, perhaps self-deprecating now and then, had the acting been convincing, the plot been less predictable, and had the characters been more interesting and three-dimensional --- well, it would have been easier to look past the ham-fisted attempts at educating the public in goodthink a la Hollywood. Alas, it was a stinkfest, and a woke one to boot, and it deserves to become a major loss for the studio(s) that produced it, so all is well.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I have made an exception for Dark Fate and Bohemian Rhapsody. I watched 30 minutes and turned it off. Bad script, unbelievable reactions of the woman who gets saved and the terminator takes too much poses that make you doubt his machinelike origin. The female saviour might have been ok, but when Hamilton made her entrance I turned it off. The franchise has downgraded to the level of a B-movie in the slasher genre.",Terminator - Dark Fate

521,leoalexanderscott,Back to the future with the oringal concept: a decent terminator movie.,9,17 November 2019,"I had a choice of two movies to see at the cinema. And both equally didn't really thrill me with their rehash or flogging off more instalment attempts of a yesteryear franchise. So, I selected to watch Terminator: Dark Fate expecting yet another half-baked failed attempt that just doesn't live up to the original film or three. I must say I was completely thankful that I did find the time to watch this latest Terminator flick. Having ignored most of any marketing prior or during its release, I was confronted unexpectedly to witnessed two aged actors Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger working together again; triggering the nostalgic magic of the franchise original concept. The terminators are faster, quicker and deadlier. The fight for survival is louder, more explosive, and more challenging. And the jokes are good poky-dot smirks to settle the apocalyptic tone. This is defiantly a Terminator movie that distance itself from recent instalments, using the notion that simple works best, therefore making the movie a worthwhile enjoyable episode that you should first see on the big screen prior to buying or renting a copy; all without needing to be a fan.",Terminator - Dark Fate
522,pkneer,Not Bad But Not Good,3,5 December 2020,"Overall, this is not a bad film. If this was not the latest film in the franchise of a highly beloved series, it would get higher marks. Acting pretty mediocre, but special effects were good, and action sequences decent.But holy cow, come up with a new storyline, will ya? Terminator comes from the future to kill the leader of the resistance while a human from the future is sent to protect them. Gee, where have we seen this before? The storyline and script is unacceptable and I understand why this film bombed at the box office.I've read where one problem was the fact that the strong leads were all women - BS. Linda Hamilton was the lead in the first two films and no one complained. The problem with Dark Fate is not gender, it's the script. Pretty awful. If someone watched this film without knowing any other Terminator film existed, then it's not bad. But that is impossible - everyone knows the story - and personally, how they handled John Connor in the beginning was a huge turnoff.If you're a fan of the first two Terminator films, you will not like this one. Truly a shot at making money, nothing more. Very disappointing.",Terminator - Dark Fate
523,TheLegendOfThe42,An utterly pointless sequel,2,18 January 2020,"Like many people, I went to see this film with a bit of hope. Yay, Jim Cameron was finally back to save the franchise, right? NOW we would get a valid sequel to one of the defining movies of the 90s: Terminator 2 - Judgment Day!Well, nope. Instead, we get some lazy writing, stupid fan service, forgettable characters and a plot that needs its medication to make it to the end of the movie. Easily could have been a J.J. Abrams movie.I won't repeat all the points having been made by countless other reviewers, only those I haven't seen that often:1.) The score.Holy mother of God, could you please stop giving Tom Holkenborg (aka Junkie XL) gigs like these? With every score he does, he raises the bar when it comes to forgettable, bland and generic music. If it wasn't for the great Terminator theme by Brad Fiedel, Tom's Fruity Loops score wouldn't have ANYTHING close to memorable. And holy moly, he really tries to ""mexicanize"" the theme. You know that feeling when cringe is close to physical pain? Yeah.2.) The charactersHey, remember Sarah Connor? Yeah, she's here. Doesn't matter that she's a granny now, you're supposed to think that she's completely badass. Well, she was in the first two Terminator movies, especially in the second of course, but I couldn't help but feel sad when I saw Linda Hamilton in this one. Almost 30 years after the second installment, there is little left of the badass she once was. And you know what? That would have been okay if only the story had taken that into account. It just undermines the suspension of disbelief when you see elderly Linda Hamilton being pressed into something she clearly can't be anymore, and that made me sad.Then there is Latina John Connor. I already forgot her name. But she's the new hope of (Wo)mankind. She's so awesome that she's beyond words. Nah, just kidding, she's just incredibly bland and forgettable. Whatever.Then we have Grace. Now here we have something, I feel. Or could have had. Mackenzie Davis really tries, and she's actually the only one I kinda cared for in this film. She manages to give life to a pretty generic character and steals pretty much every scene she's in. Not that it would have been that difficult, but still. I had expected to dislike her, like every gender-swap nowadays, but I didn't, I actually liked her performance, and I wish she could have had better material to work with. So yeah, at least this film made me aware of her.Arnie is Arnie. I love Arnie, but this was a tired and toned down appearance. His story is completely unbelievable and quite ridiculous, but I still love Arnie. Gosh, he's old. More sadness.And yeah, that's actually all I have to say about this film. Somewhat comparable to the Star Wars sequels, this is a poor attempt at servicing fans and jumping on the feminist bandwagon, and although it isn't nearly as bad as, let's say, Ghostbusters 2016, it still took another piss in one of my revered franchises of the 80s and 90s. And just like with Star Wars and Ghostbusters, I don't consider this to be canon. In my mind, this is just fan fiction that can never reach the levels of those filmmakers back then. Even more sadness, damn.Oh, and did I mention? Please don't give Tom Holkenborg gigs like these? Like ever again? Thank you!",Terminator - Dark Fate
524,willamanah,Surprisingly Good,8,21 February 2020,I don't know how many installments of Terminator are out now but this was actually really entertaining. The new characters brought some interesting advancements and their performances were really good. I was expecting Arnold to have a larger role and for it to be tired but it wasn't and I liked his performance to.,Terminator - Dark Fate
525,multiplayerxgesource,I was extremely WRONG. Pure genius.,10,16 May 2020,"I wanted to hate this movie so bad. After all the gender programming being forced by Hollywood and the media I was losing hope in strong female characters.
Now don't misunderstand me.... I LOVE T2 and I've always thought every movie of this franchise was a work of genius besides SALVATION. I think Salvation is a cool movie to see the machines in an actual war, but I HATED the characters in it and Jai Courtney has a history of screwing up films he stars in because of his EGO. BUBBO THE OWL was left out of the Clash of the Titans remake for this reason.
Anyways, I will say this movie was just way beyond anything I expected in a good way. The female leads were awesome and Linda Hamilton was one tough broad for her age in this. Even the terminator was intimidating in this.
JOHN HAS BEEN DONE TO DEATH. Yeah you heard me I didn't stutter. It makes sense that fate would find a way to get around him being the only savior against the machines and destinies would evolve into a need for another one.
THIS is how you create strong female characters for film. Cameron and Miller need to team up more often. This movie is truly a work of innovation and genius technically and emotionally. It sets the bar extremely high for Hollywood and female leads.
Honestly? Pick a day when you want to see something really original and watch this film. It has a groundbreaking opening sequence that is worth a $1.80 redbox drop alone. Good job Jimmy and Timmy. Well done guys. Well done!",Terminator - Dark Fate
526,clh-1,Pick a Lane!,4,3 February 2021,"There actually are some really good things about this film; Linda Hamilton's return as Sarah Connor is great. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a Terminator tasked with finding actual meaning in its existence exceptionally well. Mackenzie Davis makes a fine performance, and the action and special effects are top notch.
But, and it's a pretty big ""but"", the franchise isn't doing itself any favors. The films have become something of a pseudoanthology; with each sequel claiming to be the true sequel to Judgement Day. And that's where this film loses the viewer. The first thing the film does is throw out the entire point of the second film, when it wasn't really necessary. Then it gives us exactly zero reason to get invested in this story, because we have no reason to believe that it won't also be wiped away by the next installment. And there's the problem; by bouncing from continuity to continuity, the film doesn't allow itself to be anything more than popcorn entertainment. And for a franchise that started with two near-perfect films, that's the real disappointment. And each subsequent ""Part 3"" hasn't lived up to the high standards of their forebears.
Rise of the Machines took a more comedic approach and set up the idea of John Connor actually being the fabled leader of the first two films. Salvation didn't quite live up to that. Genisys wasn't great, but it had some interesting ideas, and ended with room to go somewhere new. But this film... Well... The above highlighted cast give their all.",Terminator - Dark Fate

T3 2003 is still and will always be the 3rd film, this film proves that. It had an intetesting concept but failed at the hands of a director willing to place it all in Hamiltons corner. We all grew up on the terminator films and its alwayd going to be about Schwarzeneggers , his name made the movies what they are not the character actors they tried to push in your face due to feminism. If Hamiltons name headlined the 1st or 2nd would they of been as big as they was.....NO... Its nice to see her back but it didnt work out in the right way. The best storyline is the one that wasnt told with the T800 killing John then leaving to enjoy and learn about life afterwards. that would of been epic. Or making Arnold a bad guy again and smashing a guys face in a brick wall crushinh it. Also when the new John Connor girl sends her new machine into the past she must of forget to tell her that on the way you will meet Sarah Connor who will teach me my foundations and be like a mother to me and then meet another Machine, as these 2 are very important in my life.... But No she doesnt know them and treats Sarah like a bag of trash, so goes to show even Cameron didnt eye over the script before filming. Arnold gave all he could and for this I gave it 4 stars...

What bother me was a major death, scenes that make you shake your head, like how are they still alive. Their explanation of Arnold. too similar to all the previous terminator movies.

However, even I couldn't unconditionally love the previous 'sequels' 'prequels' and whatever else they tried to do.
This one, I loved. From the stellar cast and the easter eggs and nod to the originals, the movie had it all.
It still can't be judgement day, but wow it came closer than the other attempts.
The chemistry between Davis and Hamilton is worth noting. Both bad ass women held their own. And then the new 'mother Mary', she wasn't to be trifled with either.
Loved it.",Terminator - Dark Fate
533,kythia,I don't understand the bashing,7,2 February 2020,"The Terminator saga has suffered through quite a few abysmal movies, from Terminator 3 to Genisys. They even managed to screw up the TV show with its great actors in the second season. You'd think the Terminator audience would have learned to somewhat moderate their expectations, but instead it seems like bashing everything Terminator has become a sport to a disgruntled crowd of so-called fans.As someone who still holds the original two movies dear as part of my childhood, I really liked this movie. Its a worthy successor, picking up all the important leads from Terminator 2 to the Sarah Connor Chronicles. It seemed like they ignored season 2, which is okay with me.Gender-nonsense means nothing to me, so I couldn't care less if the leads were male or female or cyborgs or whatever. They played their role well and created a great action movie with interesting plot twists and a solid, if somewhat short, Mad Max-like backstory of future flashbacks.I honestly don't know what the Terminator fans expect of a Terminator movie. Just like games about the Colonial Marines of Aliens it is probably impossible to please them, and I am glad James Cameron didn't care.If you like Terminator, this is a movie for you!",Terminator - Dark Fate
534,foxhound-37781,Yep. the rumors are true.....,1,9 November 2019,"Right at the start of the film, John Connor dies.... rendering the first two terminator films utterly meaningless.This movie is just an overloaded CGI mess filled with beyond their time actors and a plot that looks like it must have been written by a child in kindergarten, dark fate sucks and that's all there is to say about it. this film is supposed to ignore every other Terminator since the second film. but it goes two steps further and completely ignores ALL of the terminator movies altogether. James Cameron should be downright ashamed of himself for being a producer on this rubbish....",Terminator - Dark Fate

They had their flaws but at least they kept the story moving. This is just a gender swapped plagiarized version of T1 and T2. Its a shame because Grace was a great character and loved the actress that played her. Dani Ramos was forgettable and had the charisma of a rock. Surely there were other POC's that could've been cast? Regardless, the story was unoriginal anyway. Just watch the older movies again.",Terminator - Dark Fate

OK - you have to suspend your belief in physics, some of the ideas and tropes are familiar with the standard ending, and the all-female lead trio of characters may look woke, but the story rolled along at a brisk pace and there was plenty of action.The only really over the top set piece was the part where the two airplanes collide in midair and there is frenetic action inside the plane as they eject the Humvee. Not only was there too much action, it was difficult to follow with the choppy editing and shakycam and hard on the eyes.I am not going to whine about how young John Connor was shot in the first five minutes, nor how this is an alternative future.In summary - good film, good entertainment; much better than recent (comic book) offerings in the action genre.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Imagine if movies, their creators and the media could shut the hell up about politics in fictional work. And if you want to implement such topics as artistic freedom and social criticism do it subtle and skillfull. Everyone who rides this weird hate train for some fictional internet trolls who hate women should just shut up.

I really hope they dont make another one. I do hate the new age crap where CGI plays key in the whole film and that the new age terminator can literally do anything by jumping around like a futuristic monkey or turn himself into a bloody pencil if he wanted to.He can literally turn into 2 different people but somehow struggles to kill one person. The whole idea is ridiculous but they somehow make it work....just!Worth a watch if youre a T1 or T2 fan but dont get your hopes up. Just try to enjoy,Terminator - Dark Fate
539,twh-00286,"Not bad, if you've never seen another Terminator",5,23 January 2020,"It is okay, but just seems like another rehash of an already done movie.
Too many ""close calls"", but none of that character development that makes you really care about the characters. Moves pretty fast, but it's also just one thing after another which becomes kind of redundant. Unless of course you count seeing the T1 and his ""family"", which is just odd.Killing off the ""the savior"" that we have come to know in such unspectacular fashion was also quite a let down. It is like trying to disregard the other movies just to push this one forward. Could have been handled much differently.Fun for a quick escape, but don't expect more than that.
Of course, having seen the other Terminators I am a bit biased.
Perhaps this should have been either a ""re-boot"", or a type of Terminator movie like Rogue One was to Star Wars.Conclusion, according to this series no matter what we do eventually (and soon) we will create AI destined to kill us all using Terminator like machines. Whether Sky Net or whatever they call it in this version seems to come to power and you know, terminate all but a few. Guess there is just no escaping that, which means we could see many, many more versions of the same story.",Terminator - Dark Fate
540,Daviteo,Terminator: The Force Awakens,7,11 February 2020,"First, Terminator 2 is among my Top 5 sci-fi movies, along with the original Alien, probably Back to the Future, among others. So I'm going to try to be as honest as posible and not just slam this film because it's not T2.First, the movie oscilated between a 6.5 and 7.2 for me while watching it, so I settled on an even 7 as my score. This is ""average."" If Dark Fate were on a pendulum, it would sit right in the center, neither ""good"" nor ""bad.""It's not cheesy enough to be outright silly and hillarious like Tim Miller's breakout film Deadpool, nor is it gritty and dark enough to fit in with T1 and T2. The way I see it, even though Cameron's name is on the poster, this is just another branch of a timeline that split off from the ending of Terminator 2, and it's neither better nor worse than most of the other films or Sarah Connor Chronicles.Second, the movie definitely has left-wing undertones. I'm actually pretty liberal myself, and although the political messages they were pounding didn't offend or tick me off from a political perspective (the Mexican border, migrant and immigrant situations, gender politics), I could see how they could upset peole who weren't prepared for such overt politicizing. I feel some politics in a film is fine if it's subtle, a far-background plot point perhaps, but Dark Fate literally screams it ""LOOK AT HOW WE'RE DEALING WITH THE BORDER SITUATION IN THIS MOVIE!!!!!"" Putting one's worldview or politics in a movie subtly is fine, but what Dark Fate did was too much.Third, and most egregious: this is The Force Awakens of the Terminator series. Two leads in Linda Hamilton and Arnie are back. It's great to see them both in action in the same movie. Hamilton does as best she can with the material-it's not expertly directed like her breakdowns in T2, but it works well enough. Arnie is Arnie, and you've just got to love him in whatever he's in.And Mackenzie Davis tries, she really tries hard, to do a good job with what she's given. It doesn't work, but I give her pionts for giving it her all. So you've got your cast. The story does exactly what The Force Awakens does: this is all new but the same. In FA, it's not ""The Empire"" but ""The First Order,"" which is exactly like the empire, but, totally not. Without giving anything away, I feel there were a thousand and one alternate ways they could have lead off from Terminator 2 but didn't. In fact, one of my favorite ideas is that since Sarah Connor and John are still alive at the end of Terminator 2, that means they didn't destroy all the chips (the timeline would have been reset and there'd be no Judgement Day if all the future technology were destroyed in the present day). Instead, Dark Fate plays it super safe, and that's a big problem.Finally, everything just felt so ""meh."" The music is forgettable. The CG is questionable, especially night-time green screen segments, and there's not real buildup or catharsis during scenes, they just sort of ""happen."" My eyes glossed over after the halfway point when action sequences got out of hand. I kept thinking to myself ""uh huh, sure.""So, Dark Fate takes notes from the recent Star Wars sequels and seemingly some of the bad parts of T3, Salvation, and Genisys, and makes kind of a middling hodge-podge a supposed ""return to form"" that lands with about as much bounce as a T-800 on a trampoline.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Too much bad. Very little good. The Rev 9 terminator I found very cool. Kick ass. The hybrid human I found her very believable and found myself rooting for her.

This movie basically was a redo of the 1991 classic: same story, a follow up actually, but this time with a more female cast as would be expected in the me-too era. And it was not that bad, actually. Acting could have been better, though, especially by the protagonist Natalia Reyes who was terrible. What can I say? I liked the smooth mercury look of the 1991 terminator better than this black rather wooden version, too.Apart from all that, what all the producers since Judgement Day have forgotten over and over again, is that we would rather see a perspective, a movie, from the future: that is where the plot should be played out! Not the same stuff in the present: a terminator from the future wreaks havoc in the present day etc. etc. Just a Genysis did not add anything, this flick does not take the franchise to bigger heights, either, not even with Linda Hamilton who did a good job, though.

And I do not know why, because work with the existing storylines and use your creativity for something new. It is a poor remake, but worst than Star Wars: Force Awakens because it burns its beautiful past to make a new ugly house.
So what is wrong. Hamilton is useless in this film? She is not the same character with the same concerns. She is bored and a sidekick. She is so old it is distracting--honestly. Every time I see her I think of anti-ageing cream.
Arnie is funny, I do not mind him so much.
Mrs Latina is horrendous. How many bad ass Latinas are they in the world? Where did this shorty teddy bear come from. She will save the world as much as Donald Trump would run for president in Iran. Honestly she is so small and cute to be taken seriously. And the filmmakers should know this was not going to work. And her acting and back story is silly and forced.
CGI is HORRIBLE. Did you see those bricks in the walls when they fell apart in the trailer? Did you see the explosions? Did you see the car burning. Like did they have money issues. Technology is advancing so why does this film look worse than Terminator 2? After watching this terrible film I had to clean my mind and watch Terminator 2.

Further, the sound level is excruciatingly loud during action scenes then drops to barely audible during the rare occasions the ""actors"" are actually saying something.

553,tfc,"Another yummy serving of Terminator flavored Hamburger Helper. It's ok, but this would make it better.",4,8 June 2020,"Take a box of Crunchy Taco Hamburger Helper (HH), add some Terminators, and voilà! A TV episode/movie ready in 15 minutes. Because the movie is but a kludged derivative of past Terminator movies, I felt 4/9 was being nice. Terminator: Dark Fate had nice CG effects, nice cast, nice plot, nice fighting, nice property destruction, nice antiheros, nice villains, and nice interpersonal conflicts. How nice, two hours wasted. I like Crunchy Taco Hamburger Helper it is one of the better flavors of HH, but the quality of the ingredients can affect the outcome. If some good meat was used (plot), good cheese (humor), whole milk (irony), real butter (science), and fresh onions/spices (characters), you could easily overlook that a box mix was used.Now, if I could offer a few modest suggestions of what I wanted to taste, I believe this movie might have achieved 7/9. Since the hero worked at a factory I would have made her the future head uber-geek in the resistance and that was the reason she was being terminated. Mexico does have high tech industry billionaires and is not all cinderblocks, tin roofs, donkeys, and border crossers. The human augmentation program would be more nanotechnology based so people would still be a mostly human frame (make the humans half Gray Goo just like the REV-9). Seeing the human augmentation done in a grimy operating room was not believable. I would have emphasized more that our current technology created by ""good"" people to save us from ""bad"" people will likely boomerang on us now and definitely later on. I would have left the T-800 (as Skynet's de facto temporal representative) a heartless machine rather than the human love drivel. The T-800 simply used the family as a cover and the humans were too obtuse to see that Carl was a Terminator. The only reason the T-800 uses and joins the humans was Skynet only wants to subjugate the useful humans (>10%) to feel secure and still ""serve"" those humans worth keeping, but Legion want to totally exterminate all biological life as being old school (pulling wings off flies). I would have made the coup de grace scene at the last simpler, like injecting or shooting Mercury with other special metals to pollute the Gray Goo to weaken the REV-9 enough so it could be boxed). At the last the T-800 would take away the boxed REV-9 and tell the humans ""I'll be back...when Skynet commands it."" Thus the cast of characters (and the duplicitous authorities in the know about Terminators) would be left wondering if humans are the real winners. Another thing that leaves a bad taste (handful of salt) is the over use of property destruction to add spice to a mostly gristle plot. After all, if we are dealing with evil AIs, you would expect more efficient pernicious deviousness and less 100 pound sledgehammers.

Something similar is happening at https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/terminator_dark_fate. Critics are panning a film the fans are liking.
I just watched Dark Fate and I am very satisfied. Nothing will ever recreate the magic of T2, but this is a close 3rd and pays excellent homage to the original.
Themes of redemption, forgiveness and growth are explored, both human and cybernetic.
The action sequences are chest gripping, and don't drop a single beat. The relentlessness of the new Rev-9 antagonist is comparable to that of T1000 in T2. The ruthless combat sequences are just mesmerizing.
Both Hamilton and Schwarzenegger give a mature and nuanced performance, without melodrama and plenty of depth. The other casting is quite adequate.
The ending was also quite emotional and charming, again paying homage to the originals but still being unique.
No one ever expected this to top the predecessors, but I do agree it is a seamless sequel.

558,Z21708,"This is a good action movie, but a bad Terminator movie",5,29 January 2021,"I just want to get this out of the way and say that this is a good standalone movie, but it's a terrible Terminator movie. A big reason why I think that is because they killed John Connor, and ditched Skynet as a villain, and replaced it with some BS ripoff called Legion. As far as the story and writing go, this isn't necessarily a bad movie as far as those qualities go. I liked a few of the characters and I did feel like it had a somewhat decent story. The effects are fake as heck however. I mean, really, they just do not look good at all. But the fight choreography is good, and the action overall is good.But as a Terminator movie, its... very bad. I've definitely seen FAR worse sequels, but I feel like this might be among the worst in the series (although that's entirely subjective). I didn't like how they portrayed this movie's T-800 as a ""family man"", I just found that completely nonsensical. I also didn't like how they shoehorned John Connor and Skynet out of the story, and I really didn't like the overtly PC message they kept hitting you in the face with (even as someone who is fairly liberal).Overall, if you're just looking for a good beat 'em up action flick, this is the movie for you. If you're looking for a good Terminator film, I'd recommend giving this one a skip.",Terminator - Dark Fate

560,ed-503-465183,Hollywood desperately needs some new fresh ideas,3,25 October 2019,"If you've seen the previous Terminator movies in this franchise, you've seen this one. There is absolutely nothing new. It's the same story and same plot, except with a female ensemble. Writers, producers, and directors seem to think they can remake movies with female characters or minorities and sell us the same movie all over again, and we'll buy it. How stupid do they think we are?Don't get me wrong, the production value of Terminator: Dark Fate is top notch. They obviously had the resources to make a great film. They also had the actors, although changing out males for females isn't enough to make the plot or story fresh and new. I get it, woman can be strong too. That's something I've known since, well, my entire life. Ever since I can remember there have been strong female and minority characters in movies and TV shows. I don't understand why Hollywood feels the need to do it now. At some point they probably remake the movie Roots and cast an Irish female to play Kunta Kinte . Its awkwardly obvious what they're doing.IF the story is good with great characters I don't care who they cast. There have been plenty of good movies over the past half century with strong female and minority leads . There is nothing groundbreaking here. Hollywood should stop focusing on gender and ethnicity and start focusing on entertainment.",Terminator - Dark Fate

The special effects and pacing were fantastic. I liked the new characters and the terminator model. The Mexican-border setting had a bit of current-day immigrant social commentary peppered in.

Who they kill off within the first 30 seconds of the film! Which by the way renders two of the greatest scifi action films ever made completely pointless.Its the equality version of Terminator 2. They tried to latch it on to the end of Judgement day but by killing a young John Connor it completely destroyed the point.This franchise should have ended at Terminator 2.

Oh dear oh dear, for those that love the terminator story be warned, they destroy the story line with his episode and Sarah's whole life's work essentially becomes futile and frustrating... If you belong to the group who have not watched the old episodes this may be a meaningless sci fi movie, full of plot holes and unexplained idiocies.. The fight scenes are reminiscent of something we would do in the playground as kids, fake and unconvincing. Grace: (can't remember the actresses' name), where do I begin with her, a wooden performance, unfit, and looked like she had never exercised in her life. As a character she is seriously flawed, sent back to protect the young girl, but the other two women spend all their time protecting her as she needs constant shots to get her through ??????

570,imjaredross,A Solid Sequel That Loses Steam After the First Half,7,2 December 2019,"Terminator: Dark Fate is yet another attempt to revive this dead franchise and so takes the Halloween (2018) route by disregarding all films after Terminator 2, making this the true sequel to that film. In the end it is a solid attempt giving us possibly the best film in the franchise since T2. However, it is not a total win. Ever since T2 ended this franchise has tried their best at making the film again in form of Rise of the Machines, Genisys and now this film (Salvation being the only film since T2 to do something new and different).Dark Fate ends up just being a retread of what we've seen before with a new shade of paint. However, I cannot deny I was extremely entertained throughout a majority of the film. Dark Fate has some great action especially in its first half and actually manages to produce a few compelling characters along the way.The first moments of this film are probably going to interest fans or deeply upset them, but I found this early twist to actually be very interesting and wondered where the film would go from here. Sadly, it just becomes Terminator 2 yet again, but it's not bad it just feels like a terribly missed opportunity to do something different and rejuvenate this franchise. The film simply replaces Skynet with a new antagonist Legion and overall this detail doesn't matter because there's not enough to differentiate them so it might as well have never changed in the first place.The action in this film as said before is a lot of fun especially in the first half of the film. Being directed by Tim Miller, director of Deadpool you get that same brutal action especially in one of the first fight scenes in the movie that takes place on a highway. It's in the trailers and well filmed, choreographed and just a lot of fun. However, as the film goes along the action becomes more and more stale and with very little grit to it. A strength in the film also lies in the return of Linda Hamilton who gives and incredibly fun performance. It's also just great to see her again. That said the best addition to this film is with Mackenzie Davis as the character of Grace. They really did a great job at making this character feel compelling. There's a lot to her character that is discussed during the film and Davis manages to give and extremely compelling performance. Also, the opening of this film has an amazing beach scene taking place in the future that felt like something right out of T2.However, this film fails in the main focus of the film. This young girl who is the new John Conner. There is very little to this character and no reason to ultimately care about here. There's some odd choices as well with Arnold Schwarzenegger's terminator that felt like a desperate attempt to recreate the T-800 from T2. The film also just ends up feeling very tired in the second half and just drags on.Dark Fate might be the best sequel since T2, but it's still a little too messy. With too many comparisons to T2 and very little in the way of new it feels kind of pointless and for many will seem like a waste of time. Overall I enjoyed it. I liked a few of the new additions the return of Linda Hamilton, Mackenzie Davis and the action set pieces, but it's far from what made the first two films so great.",Terminator - Dark Fate

572,vikpk,Ruin of the whole franchise,1,23 April 2020,"Hollywood is out of control. To propagate their leftist, progressive, feminist agenda they are willing to destroy the few left icons of their success. Cameron, the original director of Terminator 1, a known antichrist, has returned with a vengeance to kill his own original. Grandma, instead of baking and taking care of grandchildren is sporting an RPG and working hard at out-cussing a Scorsese movie. Women are men, Arnie is a female-like sensitive robot who cooks and knits. The new John Conner is a woman and a Mexican immigrant. I am not making this up.Even the action is girlie as the ""tough women"" try to be men. Women are in charge, men are muscular backdrop for female strength, vision, stamina, ingenuity and valor. Laughable.Hamilton's character even succeeds in making a joke out of the famous come back: ""I'll be back!""Utterly ridiculous. There is nothing left in Hollywood. Shame on Arnold for agreeing to end his career by participating in this parody of a flick and faint reminder of times when action movies were fun to watch. Unless you are a millennial in ""zer"" safe zone this movie will make your stomach turn with its outlandishly obvious, down-your-throat, and inappropriate propaganda.The Terminator was finally terminated.",Terminator - Dark Fate
573,Camerenth,Very generic action movie,7,2 December 2020,This movie is not bad in any sense. It is just fine. Most of the actors try their best with the material.

574,mertafor,Hollywood's future is darker than this story,5,15 January 2020,"There are many things to say about this terrible flick but I want to point out one specific thing instead. Terminator 2, which is a masterpiece, was made in 1991, almost 28 years before his one. Right after watching this one I checked the movie's budget immediately. Apparently both movies have the same budget (188 million dollars if you calculate the inflation). In other words this is not a B type movie. So you have a serious budget, you're 29 years ahead of the first movie with countless filming and CGI techniques and somehow you choose to make a rehashed Terminator remake or parody in the end. Movie fails at every level in comparison : acting, cgi, cast, cinematography, script etc. I wish I could say style over substance but none of them over above. If this is how Hollywood progressed in 30 years, I think there will be darker days in future.Furthermore they focused so much on making a polically correct version of Terminator, they missed the entire point of making a sequel. Replacing male savior and Terminator with females doesn't transform a movie into something new. It's still the same story told before.One last thing I must say Mcenzie Davis does a great job. She clearly gave everything she has. Kudos to her. But unfortunately she doesn't have that carisma Linda Hamilton has and therefore her performance doesn't give the excitement that I expected. Also nice to see Linda Hamilton still ""got it"".",Terminator - Dark Fate
575,saull28,Original and interesting,10,25 May 2021,"An alternative story, really good the parts where they make it realistic, in every possible way, too bad the other movies where John Connor exists are bad stories and the effects are cheap and dumb; this movie should have been the pattern to take and make good ones.

576,dazjohnson,Surprised me,7,25 May 2020,"Started the movie thought it was OK but not great, then after while I began to feel it was really Terminator 2 !! rebooted. all over again, but when Arnie came in I really began to like it what made me pleasantly surprised. I would change two things though the Linda Hamilton Character - Sarah Conner was not needed at all (probly needed a payday and was owed a favour) she was just not convincing as a bad ass and looked seventy actually (63) in real life and 15 minutes shorter runtime would have been ideal. But overall not bad considering the 2015 offering what was bad and boring as hell. But would still end the franchise there its run its course to be fair.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I saw the movie for Linda, Sarah Connor who was amazing once again as was Arnie as the family man Terminator.

579,sean-curtin-517-748378,Return to fate.,10,10 November 2019,"First up the trouble with this film is not the film itself but T3 and Terminator 4(aka Salvation).My strong recommendation is to watch only 1,2, Genisys and then Dark Fate and your going to find the overall story MUCH better.The biggest issue is that many people have become desensitized. With T1 and T2, everything was new and amazing. With T3 and T4 it was absolutely nothing we didn't already expect in a Terminator movie and let's be honest crap story writing trash.With Genisys we start to see more thought return to the franchise and personally I enjoyed it. Then with Terminator Dark Fate we finally get a REAL sequel and it was brilliantly written. I was shocked at many of the subtle changes James Cameron incorporated. In fact many people think it's a political nod to girls on top, but I don't see it that way.Some people have thrown around the gender issue and seriously it's nothing to do with that. In fact the start of the movie clearly shows why. I didn't have a problem with the characters and I will say something that shouldn't spoil anything for anyone who hasn't seen the film yet and that's that I really felt for the character Grace who was completely a victim of the society she had grown up with. In fact there's absolutely no guy bashing in this film, it just happens that there's more female characters than male characters. So what!!! I'm a guy and I absolutely hate the women have to have the main roles just because and you know what, that's not the case with this film, in fact the characters seriously have the raw end of the deal. Linda Hamilton was amazing as the always excellent Sarah Connor, I loved her in the first two films and I absolutely love her in this film of which I'm glad for her return. She shows a seriously added dimension to the character which has grown and sadly while almost forgotten by time and given an incredibly bad wrap still carries out selfless tasks in honor and memory of.....(can't say as you'll have to see the movie to find out, it would be a spoiler.)I'm not a sexist, never have been but I do hate guy bashing just for the sake of it. That's seriously not happening here and I felt Sarah Connor required these characters to help her through a very dark time which sadly she's continually had nothing but. You can't help feeling drawn into the character. My only objections were the harsh nature of which Grace shows towards Sarah which at times if I'd been female and in the room I would have slapped her. But Sarah just takes it and it doesn't phase her. She's a wounded but strong character through and through. The new character was a surprise also and I liked Dani very much. She was most protective of her brother and her father and a caring character.Perhaps the only issues I had were the over the top scene in one of the aircraft but it was certainly a welcome addition to the continued story, not a wish wash waste of time like the 3rd and 4th films.It's frustrating that this movie didn't come out before the sequels of T2 but alas it's taken this long to come to fruition and personally I was glad it did. Alas for some fans perhaps it's a come a bit to late to achieve the impact it no doubt could have, had the 3rd and 4th movies come about. A also found Terminator Genisys fit will with this film but perhaps that should have come after this film.Anyway, I'm hoping for a 6th and final film to the series to show us the actual turn of the machines and the ultimate war that resulted but alas with how so many are currently finding the film and the blaze couldn't care less attitude they now have, it may not happen. I think the biggest problem is that there has been so many movies that have topped even T2 since those first 2 films that the Terminator franchise(which really took a lot of steps back with the 3rd and 4th films) is coming in too late to capture the enthusiasm of the action sci-fi film fans who have since seen films like 'Guardians of the galaxy' and at least a couple of the Transformers films for example. These films have almost certainly pushed the action film thrill of an explosion every five minutes to the absolute limit and in fact it hardly even makes someone blink anymore. Go back to the 80's when everything was more comedy and not so hard hitting and this film would have been ground breaking. I thought it did at least have an interesting new take on the Terminator(can's say anything else due to not wanting spoilers in this review.)Go back to how you found the first 2 movies, then watch this movie and go from there. You will be rewarded and feel the magic of this movie. don't think of it as trying to be the latest break all boundaries mega amazing block buster eye candy delight of the century and if your a Terminator fan, you will surely see the joy of a REAL continuation to the film. I'm certain James Cameron would have extreme pain massaging in the new film to ignore the 3rd and 4th films but he's managed it and if this movie is not what you thought it would be, then it's simply because of those 2 movies, not because this isn't a good film.Enjoy it for what it is, the awesome return of Sarah Connor, one of The Terminator's most prized characters and thank goodness she's back and perhaps even..... she'll be back!!!!!",Terminator - Dark Fate
580,cary_howe,by far the worst in the series,2,23 March 2021,"I hated the opening scene then they switch to an action scene immediately followed by tedious pandering to a Mexican audience. I have zero problem with casting any nationality just don't pander. Everything these days is about pandering trying to expand the audience to new markets. These are NOT creative decisions they are purely marketing decisions which is why they never work. I watch a lot of foreign films but I HATE having to read subtitles because they are trying to expand markets. Do it for creative reasons not sucking up to new markets. Part of the trouble with pandering is they focus too much on it and too little on story. The reason for the big action scene so you could slog through the all the pandering. Can't you make characters of a certain ethnic group without hitting us between the eyes with a 2X4 to make sure we noticed? I might have been able to make through that part like the movie Logan but in this case the rest of the film sucked. This is a change that's happen over the last 10 to 15 years. Look at a film like Dirty Harry. His partner was Latin but he didn't speak with a thick accent and they never once had to use sub titles. Focus on story. Completely tossing the old storyline and calling this the first true sequel to T-2 is offensive to fans. There's still one story left to tell and it's the gold watch story. Time travel fans will understand but the one story that wouldn;t break the mythology that could be very different is telling the story of the origin of the timeline. It's the only one John Connor wouldn;t be in because he hasn;t been born, ever. Tell the story about the first time Kyle Reese came back and fathered John Connor. His introduction to Sarah Connor would be very different and there would be no terminator at that point chasing them. Only after Connor is conceived would the loop be established then Terminators can come back. That should have been Terminator 3. I even figured Arnold could play the head of security at Cyberdyn and that's where the computer came up with the T-800 design. It would have given Arnold a chance to play human and maybe fight himself as a human. You could even do a cool scene where Arnold explains to Sarah that if Skynet prevents Kyle Reese from coming back her son won't be born and this leads to the creation of the loop where Connor is actually trying to make sure he's born himself. There's, a compelling story that helps clean up details and would have rounded out the trilogy. Instead we got a string of crappy films that only exist to wring the last few dollars out of the franchise. If you want to appeal to a Mexican audience make Danny Trejo the new terminator. Now that would be fun have him and Arnold fighting only short little Danny is tossing him around like a rag doll. Ah, what might have been......",Terminator - Dark Fate
581,stevenrobertson-97899,She'll Be Back.,7,20 September 2020,Make no mistake they'll drag this franchise out for another film with the Sarah and Dani.Not sure what's up with the other reviews about leading ladies or woke or whatever. This film with the three female leads carries itself as well as a film with three male leads. In fact I really liked Grace. Sarah needs to be careful she doesn't turn into a Parody too much. Yeah she's still bad ass but the frequent 'oh sh*t' and 'machine motherf*cker' didn't really suit her original character and bordered on cheese.Can't decide what Arnie brought to the film. I think they could have done the film without him but then would it be The Terminator? I don't know.The action scenes are fabulous. Very similar car chases and scenes to Raise of The Machines. The plot is a rehash of T2 in many ways. But the film is probably the strongest since T2.So over all baring in mind that nothing will surpass T2 the film was entertaining and worth a watch.Ps Arnie aged better than Linda.,Terminator - Dark Fate
582,LanternSwapnil,Worthy to be Watched One More Time!,8,9 November 2019,"Killing John Conner in the beginning was really bold. The whole previous five movies were running around John and Sarah and this one just took that part away and still managed to make it a fun ride.I loved first three movies and the fourth one and that fifth was just kind of okayish. Both of them was not much fun. Finally I say they should make more of it with the current story arc.For me, villain is the heart and soul of this movie. He was just close to unkillable and his powers made him a worthy opponent even for Avengers.Arnold wasn't much impressive to me this time. Giving him a touch of human feelings worked when he met young John or the more older John in second and third but here having a family and doing thing just FOR JOHN did not make much sense. The representation of a loaded with human emotion killing matching wasn't up to that mark.Action is the best part. I was shouting, yelling and clapping on many scenes. Action was really jaw dropping and that's the best ingrediet that make the movie a roller coaster ride.I wish we had this one before Salvation and Genisys.",Terminator - Dark Fate

584,pulikd,TERMINATOR 3. Take 2. No future for men,5,3 January 2021,"This installment ignores the three that came before it because it wants to be a direct sequel to the first two films in the franchise. It opens with a short glimpse at the future war against SkyNet only to immediately jump as far back as the nineties where two things are made clear. First, no Judgement Day happens because of the events of the previous movie. Second, John Connor is out. It is 1998 and an Arnold shaped terminator finds Sarah and her son at a beach where it shoots the kid in the chest. Down on a wooden floor, in a pool of blood, the young John is dead. The terminator then leaves.Upon release, ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" was compared to ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"", and the comparison is valid. It wants to develop that good old story but cannot accomplish that, therefore, it tries to simply copy that old story. In order to do that, it takes the past and makes it pointless, destroying it, getting it out of the way.Once the first two movies are out of the way, this one immediately jumps to 2020. Two time travelers arrive. One is a terminator, the most advanced yet. It was sent here from the future by a new artificial intelligence called Legion. The target is a young girl named Dani Ramos. Apparently, she will be important for humanity later on. The other time traveler is here to protect Dani. She was sent here by the human resistance. Her name is Grace and she is not entirely human. She's much like Marcus Wright from ""Salvation"", only the incredibly complicated work was done to her by humans, not by machines. After a worldwide nuclear disaster, with nothing to eat and nowhere to live, in a world lain waste. ""Dark Fate"" is easily the most implausible terminator movie so far.The new bad guy is not scary. And even the technology does not help. However, the actor, Gabriel Luna, is good. He is not to blame for what the REV-9 is in the film. In fact, Luna is perfect for the role of a terminator, if you think of it. He does not look special, which makes him perfect when it comes to sneaking upon the target. In a good way, he reminds me of two other actors. Back in the eighties, James Cameron, I hear, wanted Lance Henriksen to be the terminator because the terminator is not supposed to be easy to notice, unlike the muscular giant Arnold was back in the day. The other good old actor Luna reminds me of is, obviously, the one and only Robert Patrick.But the script handles him in a horrible way. This model is supposed to be unstoppable. Even Grace says you do not fight it, you run from it. But in the very first encounter, Grace literally kicks the terminator around like a feather pillow. Also, he talks when no talking is needed. Akin to The T-3000 in ""Genisys"", only that one could do so because it used to be human.Dani Ramos is the new young Sarah Connor, right? Wrong. There is a scene in the film where Dani is revealed to be the future humanity savior. Basically, she is the new John Connor.John Connor, according to the first two films, is the person he is thanks to his mother who raised him in a particular way, and the experience he gains throughout the story. Dani Ramos, according to ""Dark Fate"" is the person she is because she can inspire people to go to war and, literally, she can fight and beat down opponents hand to hand. Apparently, these are all the qualities a fifty kilo human female person would need to save the human race in the darkest hour and win the scariest war ever. A war in which you fight an artificial intelligence that has access to all the weapons it should wish. ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" is easily the dumbest installment in the franchise yet.In the film, there are two scenes where Grace needs clothes. Both times she can choose, both times she robs the man, not the woman. Apparently, all sizes fit her, contrary to how the male anatomy and body shape are different than those of a female one. Again, this movie is not smart. There is, however, a detail I loved about her, as a character. She's carrying inside of her the only tech that can destroy the REV-9. So, all the weapons we have in our time are useless against the terminator and it is only through another device from the future that the killer robot from the future can be stopped. Really, that was a nice little detail.Linda Hamilton's performance was quite impressive. Arnold was good, even though his part was not that big and respectful of the character. His performance was very strong, especially in the quiet scenes. The action scenes are very intense, but there is too much CGI. Like ""Genisys"", only worse.",Terminator - Dark Fate
585,annahudak-70828,A Decent Return to Form,6,2 April 2021,"This was in interesting movie. Tim Miller pretty much decided to remake the first Terminator and throw in some aspects of Terminator 2 as well. Honestly, I'd say he did a good job. It was far from great, but we'll get to the problems soon enough.The good: I liked the characters, even the new ones though they were admittedly overshadowed by the old cast, but Natalia Reyes as ""Dani Ramos"" is a decently enough compelling character who I would love to see more of, though it's unlikely that a sequel will be happening.The tension was always felt throughout the movie, they did a good job making you feel the danger, though admittedly, sometimes it was a bit too over-the-top, which leads me to the negatives.That plane fight scene felt like something straight out of a video game. It wasn't enjoyable for me at all. Also, the last fight in the factory was pretty forgettable for the most part, right up until the end when Dani finally fights for herself. That was pretty awesome to see.In the end, this was a pretty decent movie. It's a shame it didn't do well, I feel that this was a good start to a new trilogy, but it's not likely that will be happening now.",Terminator - Dark Fate

A mere copy of Terminator 2, just made to highlight the female empowerment, but without tension, good action and iconic moments. The aging Sarah and Arnold Terminator symbolizes well the anticlimactic and sad end with dishonor of a saga.

587,jjdausey,Great to see Hamilton back in action and Mackenzie Davis too,6,5 November 2019,"But they have tried to relaunch this franchise so many times with diminishing returns. And while it's great to see Hamilton back and Davis is strong (who on earth chose the bland Brie Larson as Captain America over her?), the problem with the movie is it is no longer telling the most relevant tale of our times. Technology is not the real threat; climate change is. Judgement Day is likely upon us due to abuse of our natural resources. This is the story that should have been told, not this rehash of the ""future robots are bad"" storyline.",Terminator - Dark Fate
588,pirlo2004,Liked it more than I thought I would!,4,28 October 2019,"Quick run down of my likes and dislikes!Grace was awesome, best part of the movie and I thought I'd hate her - Finally a strong female character without the screen writers having to keep trying to brainwash me into believing it!
Loved the use of Arnie and didn't cringe as much as I thought I would.
Loved the effects.
The evil Terminator wasn't as bland as the trailers made him look!
The humour worked.Sarah Conor was so so for me, I know some people loved her!Really didn't like the complete dismissal of Skynet and John Connor, but this is only a slight gripe as I can always pretend this movie doesn't exist.
Thought Dani was a weak actress, despite being easy on the eye.
Parts of the film felt rushed.
There wasn't much emotional connect to some of the early deaths!
Underwater battle near the end felt messy and 'unrealistic' (can you use that word in a movie about robots from the future!)All in all a solid 6.5 from me, which isn't bad considering I though I'd hate it. There's the odd bit of social pandering, which I've come to expect these days but if a film is half decent I can kinda ignore it, and this film was half decent!",Terminator - Dark Fate
589,thecrafts-66710,Might be the end of the Franchise.,5,24 February 2020,"That is not a spoiler, per say, but without telling you the ending I'm putting that out there (review title) because it was so poorly done and I think did poorly at the box office.
I only gave it 5 stars and would've gone lower except it was nice to see Linda Hamilton back - kind of. Basically, she just wanted to show how tough she is buy carrying large guns and the liberal use of the ""F"" word. So, it was nostalgic but not impressive.
Honestly, I liked the much maligned last two in the series before this one. And, this one was basically a remake of the very first one. Very similar story line. Lots of shoot-'em ups, explosions, car wrecks, and cops, security, and soldiers getting killed. Even has a very similar ending.
So, again, I'd be shocked if this franchise can continue. And, one spoiler: I watched the entire credits feed at the end and there was no teaser hinting at a sequel. Good!",Terminator - Dark Fate

591,TYContact1,"As a Cameron Sci-Fi fan, it's an enjoyable ride with familiar faces and a relief that the franchise landed a good restart",7,7 November 2019,"This Terminator instalment pales in comparison to the 1991 iconic film in terms of cool technology and memorable scenes, but as a T-fan, I'm relieved that finally this one is in the right direction: competent cast, nostalgic BGM, smart-ass one-liners intersecting smooth, fast paced action. The terminators in this round have some added improvements, so the chase-fight back plot cycle action scenes don't look too repetitive and predictable. Kudos to the underwater scenes - must be a b* to film (^_<).The directing and editing didn't seem polished though; at times I felt like being bumped off the ride...
The whole movie experience was not impressive - considering Cameron's name is attached to the project. I wished he spent some of his time devoted to Avatar and Titanic to the Terminator series.So this instalment feels more like a B movie sequel. Once again, the CinemaScore site was spot on. If the studio green-lights another film, we can't expect Arnie and Linda to keep coming back to kick some machine asses",Terminator - Dark Fate

Poor poor republican snowflakes that can't stand to see anything else than white males on the screen.

593,phil-83737,The Worst Terminator Film so Far,3,24 September 2020,"I've just finished watching this and as a big Terminator film fan, I so wanted to like it. It had everything that should have made it good, the return of Linda Hamilton and Arnie plus the involvement of James Cameron.
The reality however is a big disappointment. It's as if the studio insisted on as many strong women roles in it as possible. Arnie appears after about 60 mins and things improve slightly.
The whole film has scenes and lines that are reminiscent of the previous films, in other words they have taken stuff that worked in the other films and shoved it in this one. If your a fan of the franchise you'll spot them a mile off.
After this I hope they don't make another and that makes me sad as I really enjoyed the other films the earlier ones being the best.
This film is mediocre at best and that's being kind.
After statements from Hollywood etc I'd expect a lot more inclusive films that tick all the boxes but don't really work in reality this is just one of those.

This is yet another movie from Wokewood that feels the need to destroy previous male characters and replace them with female versions that are poorly written. Why? Because we gotta replace all men.Rather than doing something good like Alita, Jame Cameron sells his soul to Wokewood by attaching his name to Herminator: Woke Fate. The CG is bad, no practical effects at all. The story is a beat for beat repeat of everything that's come before in previous Terminator movies, making this movie utterly pointless.So what do we get?

597,thenextrushmagazine,A remake in disguise? I'll come back for the next one,7,30 October 2019,"It's a story that started when I was in diapers and it lost me just after 'Rise of the Machines' and barely got me back in when Game of Thrones' Emilia Clarke took on the role in 'Genisys'.Total fan of 'Dark Fate' with a few criticisms.Did it beat the legend of 'Judgement Day'? Not quite, but there's enough token nostalgia in there for many to enjoy it with their kids and a balance of backstory and new characters for the franchise to carry on without Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton. However that's the deal breaker for me at this point, this movie completely reverses the timeline of the story that people have invested it in for decades and it's practically a remake incognito. What wins us over every time, is the continual advancement in CGI. Unlike the T-1000 and T-X from the previous movies, the new Rev-9 on the hunt for the heroine now has the ability to split into two when fighting multiple threats.James Cameron always knows how to throw a cinematic party with signature car and in-flight explosions, with the crackling crescendo of guns and missile launchers using Schwarzenegger's classic Cyberdyne Systems Model 101 character to provide comic relief. Instead of the usual ""I'll be back"" and ""Hasta La Vista baby"" this new Terminator seems to have been domesticated for 22 years providing some hilarious moments discussing grocery shopping and interior design with the same blind innocence when calculating the probable success or failure of a mission. I'll leave that for you to figure out.Having purposely not read the synopsis beforehand i deliberately went in with no expectations and the simple imprint left from 'Judgement Day' because let's face it, you could pretty much get by without the other films that come after. Hoping for a reprieve from the (in my book) unmatched second installment, there was a lot of promise from the opening scenes that reintroduce Linda Hamilton back to the fold. It's a 'Judgement Day' flashback of Sarah Connor in one of the most memorable scenes ever, showing this character in her prime. Whether they admit it or not, movies post Judgement Day were affected by the offscreen divorce of Hamilton and Cameron back in 1999 and when you think about it, the Terminator story was always really about her.In one of the most shocking moments of the film which completely redirects the story so far into a new tangent, a 1991 CGI Schwarzenegger, Hamilton and Edward Furlong have been recreated in a scene that you just didn't see coming. It was delicious to watch and somehow also disappointing.For those that remember Skynet, Sarah's Connor's efforts weren't a complete waste, but decades later the AI takeover still manifested into a future organization called Legion, with a new target who is destined to birth the future leader of a resistance. Sound familiar?Dark Fate carries on the blockbuster trend of Star Wars' The Last Jedi and X-Men's Dark Phoenix with a female 'terminator' (told you, it's a no-spoiler review) taking the lead, it's a great rehash with updates for the new audience its made for. There's a nice nod to the past as the baton is clearly passed on to the next generation and new story. Terminator Dark Fate begins showing in Australian cinemas nationally tonight.

598,rockinkettles-1,The trolls were wrong. New Terminator is action packed.,8,1 November 2019,"This is an honest review. I am not at all connected to this movie. I am a regular movie goer who is a fan of the Terminator franchise. I of course think that the original and T2 are the best of them all. The original is still my favorite because Arnold was great as the bad guy. This new Terminator has some great action and special effects that are similar to T2. There is an impressive action packed- hold on to your seats- car chase at the beginning. It is fun to see Arnold and Linda reunite although they are getting too old for this. The movie has nothing new to say except for having some new characters and a new Terminator that is similar to the T1000 from T2. The trolls on here who gave this a bad review just really need to get a life. Wine, wine, wine. That's all they do. Instead of comparing it to T2, if you go to see this, see it with an open mind like I did and just sit back and be entertained. This could be the beginning of a new franchise, but it would be nice if it ends here. Although I wouldn't be surprised if we see a whole new reboot or remake of Terminator with an entirely new cast.

It's nice to see the plot well tied together, unlike the mess that was the last Terminator film, which had been a travesty for writing.There are a few things that bug me, there is a black major, who I feel was intended to be played as some reference to Dyson, but it just was a random guy instead. Also, some dialog can be painful to here.Canon purists will not enjoy things that happen in this film, especially in the start, but I'm not one, so I'm fine with the thing that happened. Freed the plot to get away from the tired angle that they have been working since T2.Terminator films at the heart, are chase movies, this movie does that well. The thing that T2 has, is that when rounding out the film to make it seem more than just a chase film, they filled it out well with characterization, and growth. This one does that too, but not as well.But it's worth a watch, a great film for this stage of Schwarzenegger's career.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Three minutes to erase our beloved storyline! It was such a bad premise I thought for sure J.J Abrams directed it.
Later, we find that the Arnold Terminator who killed John Connor is living with and taking care of a Mexican woman and her son. The Arnold Terminator is now a family man!!!! He also has grown a conscience and has learned to love....at least as much as a killing machine can learn to love. Oh yeah, his name is Carl too. I cannot even fathom how this script made it anywhere near a director. I am dumbfounded by the ridiculousness of it all.
The action is terrible CGI garbage. The fight scenes defy physics, the laws of gravity and common sense.
And just for arguments sake.... There is only one future that these machines know and that is a future where John connor is the savior of humanity. Yet somehow this movie has terminators going back to kill a new savior of humanity whom they've never even encountered before....bad....very bad premise.

But first, let's clear the table.1. To make sense, just pretend that you've seen only the first two Terminator films, and then attach this one to them.2. Some of the action films take place at night, making it difficult at times to tell what is going on.3. The Ah-nold Terminator is... If you thought the one in part 2 was a good guy, then this one here is a NICE guy... I cannot imagine Darth Maul doing something like raising a family, for example.4. Someone once wrote that the new Star Wars films have become a feminist shriek-fest. Same here. No terminator should be bossed around by anyone.Those said, even the enhanced female version of Reese is a huge improvement on her original male counterpart. I wonder, what will they think of next?

608,cyguration,Feminist Trash,3,24 February 2020,"People saying this movie was an insult to the franchise are right.The first 10 minutes basically makes it known exactly what kind of film this will be.Two thirds into the film we get one of the most cringe-inducing plot twists in the history of movies.This female led, feminist-themed take on the sci-action franchise is probably the worst out of all the Terminator films just because of how much it spits in the face of the franchise in order to push a pro-immigration, pro-feminist, pro-woman power message.You probably think this is all hyperbole, but feel free to watch the film for yourself. In fact, I'm being WAY too nice compared to the tripe that is Terminator: Dark Fate.The only reason it gets a 3 out of 10 stars and not a 1 star is because I'll admit that I was on the edge of my seat a bit for the first major chase scene in the film. The setup for the chase and its execution wasn't perfect, but it was barely plausible enough to hold your interest.But from then on the movie just went downhill and stayed downhill.They never explained Grace's augmentations, and more importantly they never explained the Rev 9 Terminator.Literally, they go the entire film without explaining WHY it can split in two, and how the nanomachines could survive the time travel. They never explained why the machines sent back a Rev 9 and not one of those tentacle Terminators that could fly in the air and drop down as pods.They didn't even explain exactly what made the chick Dani so special. Their explanation will leave you scratching your head and asking more questions than they answer.I didn't think it was possible but this was actually worse than Terminator: Genesys and I used to rate that as the worst Terminator film ever made, but at least Genesys had the common courtesy of not ret-conning the first two films or taking a crap on the quality of the franchise in general.This movie is frustrating just thinking about it.",Terminator - Dark Fate

616,pinemaples,History's Not the Only Thing that Repeats Itself,8,21 November 2019,"In much the same way last years's Halloween pretends every sequel to the original 1978 John Carpenter classic never happened, Terminator: Dark Fate, directed by Deadpool's Tim Miller, ignores all three movies that James Cameron, this installment's producer, didn't have a personal hand in. Genisys also kinda tried to forget Rise of the Machines and Salvation, but let's not talk about that. (Although, full disclosure, I really did like it!) This time around, Sarah and John did indeed make sure Skynet never comes to power, thus changing the future... sort of. The robot apocalypse still happens, just with a different mechanical overlord, now called Legion. Time is intent on staying the course, despite Christian Bale's famous now non-canon speech. As such, the story itself attempts to justify the recycling of plot mainstays: there is still a girl who gives rise to a savior, there is still a time-traveling hero to ensure her safety, and there is still a Terminator sent to kill her. Fortunately, Dark Fate ends up subverting this to some degree, but regardless, whether that justification works is up to personal debate.I have no problem comparing Dark Fate with the older Terminators because the movie itself doesn't either. The beginning is loaded with fanservice designed to send franchise die-hards into 1984- and 1991-flavored flashbacks. Dark Fate can't help itself with repeating classic Terminator lines, often with new twists. Within the first 15 minutes of the movie, Mackenzie Davis's character Grace reworks the familiar quote into ""Come with me if you don't wanna die in the next thirty seconds,"" while the returning Linda Hamilton herself gets Arnold's classic ""I'll be back."" Not only that, but in the opening scenes we are even treated to (admittedly good) effects-assisted younger renderings of Linda Hamilton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and T2: Judgement Day's Ed Furlong.I would say that all of the lead actors give, at the very least, passable performances, but that would be underselling it. The strongest by far is Mackenzie Davis as Grace, Dark Fate's answer to Kyle Reese. As an augmented cyborg super-soldier, Davis's character intentionally reflects her delivery: sometimes routine and mechanical, sometimes passionately human. She is sent back to save a young Mexican girl named Dani Ramos, this timeline's version of T1's Sarah Conner, sans romantic subplot. Gabriel Luna portrays this movie's liquid metal T-1000 - wait, sorry - ""model REV-9."" Luna doesn't have the same innate intimidation factor that T2's Robert Patrick did, but he puts on the emotionless, stoic expression well enough. Natalia Reyes, despite her role as Dani, the girl at the center of the story, isn't given much to work with. Most of her lines run the gamut of yelling, crying, and confusion. I feel like Linda Hamilton had a much wider range in the original movie alone, to say nothing at all of Judgement Day. This time around, though, Hamilton is pretty one-note, spending the majority of the movie either delivering flat sarcasm or spouting sentences that include the word ""kill."" Looking back to last year's Halloween again, the writers would have done well to take further inspiration from Jamie Lee Curtis's similar return as an older, hardened version of a beloved protagonist, where she displayed a fair amount more emotional versatility and vulnerability. Arnold himself is a lot more fun to watch, with surprising quality in his comedic timing that is actually enhanced with the obligatory robotic monotone. I'm well aware they brought The Governator back just because he's the face of the franchise and his involvement alone guarantees tickets, but I'm really glad he was a part of this production regardless. I just wish he had been in the film longer, as his presence feels honestly rewarding when we finally get to him.Of course, Terminator is not a character study; its primary focus on action is also its strength, for what that's worth. It revels in pulling the camera back to frame explosions and then zooming it in for facial close-ups. The REV-9 largely likes to rely on the T-1000's moveset, almost exclusively using the good ol' knifehands. The few occasions he does his own thing are when he's at his best, breaking out some cool new tricks, but those moments are sadly a little too few and far between. What worked well, though, was when the firearms were sometimes used to comedic effect, with the bullets and buckshot that hit the REV-9's chrome-domed noggin mimicking the slapstick humor of an Acme boxing glove or a Three Stooges-style pie in the face. What I liked most was when the fights emphasized Grace's and the Terminator's shared command of sheer speed, which is utilized to great effect. Both of their characters move almost faster than the eye can track, and it is a true thrill. There are some genuinely competent setpieces in a good variety of locations with ideas that make me wonder why I haven't seen them before. At the same time, though, the way each fight scene starts gets repetitive in a hurry. It feels like the writers kept playing a game of mad libs that is entirely made up of the sentence, ""But then the Terminator shows up in a (mode of transportation)."" Car? Bulldozer? Semi? Helicopter? Airplane? Each vehicle is bigger than the last, but only to artificially up the scale of each encounter. The biggest issue that really holds the action back is that, for a lot of the time, it doesn't feel real. I'm not talking about the CGI- I'm genuinely surprised how consistently my subconscious failed to question whether the camera actually filmed a life-sized titanium endoskeleton performing on set almost as frequently as it filmed Gabriel Luna's actual face. No, the problem lies with the movie rarely making me believe in Davis's or Luna's martial acrobatics, and I'm sure part of that reason is that neither of the two are trained fighters. In many cases, each punch pounded or sledgehammer slung feels artificial. That's not to say it isn't highly entertaining, because it is. I had a great time seeing Davis, Hamilton, and Schwarzenegger take names as Luna's REV-9 blazed a ceaseless trail of destruction.Terminator: Dark Fate once again tries to revive a franchise that just refuses to give up, and yes, I'm part of the reason. With each installment after the action landmark title Judgement Day largely receiving lower and lower general public opinion, these movies have lately begun to garner a lot of controversy and hate: some fair, some unfair. But for better or for worse, ""Terminator"" is a household name that helped bring the genre where it is today. It doesn't need to reinvent the wheel again, but it wouldn't hurt if the writers tried to play it a little less safe. Criticisms aside, Dark Fate is a perfectly enjoyable semi-sci-fi action movie. It's not a deep watch, so it's perfectly acceptable to turn your brain off. This isn't exactly the first time the series has attempted to relaunch a new multi-movie storyline, but I'm hoping that this time they finally stick with it. There's no cliffhanger ending. Nothing feels hugely left out. But there are a few avenues that seem unexplored, and some promises set up that I hope they capitalize on in the future. I want to find out if it's a future worth seeing. One thing you can count on, one way or another, The Terminator will be back.",Terminator - Dark Fate

All the triggered insecure males on board of the ""oh my god. a female can't be an action hero, let hate this movie"" train.
The movies have great action and really good effects and I think plays a great homage to the original movie and a bit to the second one.
The plot was good, simple but still good. Makes sense that Skynet no longer exist because John and Sarah destroyed it at the end of T2 so is natural that humanity continued its path of self destruction and a new entity was created instead of Skynet.
The Rev 9 was good, kind of like the T100 in T2. The actor was spot on.
Again, it's a really good movie that has the feel and vibe of the first 2 and ignored the rest which is good.
All the bad comments and trash talk comes from insecure males still living in the 70's that can't stand how come a female has a leading role in an action flick.
Watch it for what it is, a terminator movie that is really good and ignored the triggered trolls that can't stand the fact we live in 2019 and women are no longer inferior to men, and by the way I am a dude.",Terminator - Dark Fate

621,TheOvereducated,"Important to have low expectations. That said, I enjoyed it.",7,6 March 2021,"I had to go see this, I've always been a fan of Terminator. I went with low expectations though, because of the movie's director. He has directed Deadpool (2016), one of the worst movies I've ever seen (thankfully without paying for it). There, the humor is as shallow as it gets and the story non-existent. Now let me sum up my thoughts for ""Dark fate"":1) The backstory is clearly repetitive of past Terminator movies. There were also quite a few over-simplifications throughout the progress of the story.
2) It's duration was too long. Some scenes were dragging and when Arnold's character showed up, it felt as if a second movie is starting up.
3) Some ""Deadpool-comedic"" dialogue is present, but thankfully it works well here most of the time.
4) There are quite a lot of decent action scenes, very cool!
5) I didn't like the young Mexican actress's acting. I did like Hamilton's and Davis' though, and Arnold's obviously. Gabriel as a bad Terminator is also good, yet I find the Terminator from Genisys (Lee Byung-hun) more menacing.Overall, ""Dark fate"" definitely had flaws and a not very creative story, thus it doesn't live up to the very good Terminator: Genisys, but it's still an enjoyable action movie.",Terminator - Dark Fate

With a new location, we are introduced to a new 'main character' who would impact the future, but she is utilised as a side character with Grace, Sarah Connor and the T-800 feeling like the only main characters.The CGI in this movie is amazing, it has never looked better in the Terminator movies, and we see some new fighting techniques used from both the Terminator and the humans.Linda Hamilton returning as Sarah Connor is very enjoyable and feels like a very accurate version of her many years after the events of the first Terminator movie. Her conflicts with the T-800 is very entertaining as well, and is not over exaggerated.",Terminator - Dark Fate
627,CorumJI,Very decent film...,9,1 November 2019,"Now, first off... I am going to say, I don't hate on T:Genesys. The problem with the Terminator films is that they have a very tight causal loop which makes it exceptionally difficult to actually tell a new, interesting, and decent story. Plus T2 was an awesome, ground-breaking movie. T:G was an effort to break out of that loop so other aspects of a story could be told. But whatever. Too many people Did Not Get It. Fine. So now we get T:DF. Which is a different effort to somewhat do what T:G did, and an equally good, if not better, effort towards that end.Yes, they did do a female centered take on it as far as the heroes go. I'm totally fine with that. They did not rip its arms off and beat you over the head with them, they just bopped you on the top of the head a couple times lightly. Enough to be obvious. but not enough to be distracting overmuch. They could have edited the speaking parts out and just let the movie slide on its own female-centric merits (you don't need to be TOLD about the limited need for male saviors, you can see it for yourselves), and that would be an improvement, but not a significant one.All in all, for an action-movie, as you expect from a Terminator movie, the drama and plotting is well-done, the characters thinly but adequately developed, the motivations clear and reasonably derived. The stunts and FX, as you would expect, are top notch. There are one or two issues, perhaps, but nothing much. It certainly holds together better than a typical Fast and Furious film.",Terminator - Dark Fate
628,chasemykleby,"In this new direct sequel to T2, Skynet doesn't rise, but instead gets a name change.",6,2 November 2019,"""Terminator Dark Fate"" Review
(6/10)The Terminator franchise has always had a fundamental problem: past the hit film that kicked off the story, nothing that happened in the series really mattered. The timeline got complicated, screenwriters monkeyed with the story mechanics, directors brought new special effects into the battle to keep the action fresh. And yet every Terminator story basically assumed the same thing: that a sentient, murderous AI called Skynet would rise, design a series of powerful kill-bots called Terminators, largely wipe out the human race, then send Terminators back in time to kill off anyone who might have a prominent part in resisting the genocide. But in this new direct sequel to T2, Skynet doesn't rise, but instead gets a name change.
Like Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Terminator Dark Fate revives the beloved old characters while introducing a new generation of characters to (it hopes) a new generation of fans. After a quick prologue set in 1998, the story jumps to Mexico City in 2020, and we meet the franchise's usual unholy trinity: one unwitting civilian who will eventually help humanity overthrow its robotic overlords; one Terminator sent back from the future to kill them; and one resistance agent sent back to protect them. Squeezing in two generations of characters, Terminator Dark Fate is nearly as overcrowded as The Force Awakens was, the upshot being that the plot is convoluted.
It's hard to review this movie without giving away spoilers, but if you have seen the trailer or any terminator movie, you kinda know where the movie is going already. Linda Hamilton returns to her legendary character. In the interim, there have been stand-ins and a series of sequels that all in varying degrees disappointed; and the once beloved action franchise has become long in the tooth. This Tim Miller directed movie ignores the franchise's multiple past continuities in the aim of crowning itself as the originals' lone worthy heir... It's still not even in the same sport, much less ballpark, as those movies, but it's the closest we've come.
Directed by Miller with more intensity than any of the other non-Cameron sequels, the action is blunt and often brutal, even as it relies too heavily on CGI (though the Rev 9's liquid skin separating from its metal endoskeleton is a neat all-in-one villain effect). Still, it's the cast who salvages the first half of the movie, which leans on the same story beats of the original to a fault. But what truly makes Dark Fate's case is of course Sarah. Hamilton still simmers with a quiet, constant outrage about the life she's been handed, as well as a vivid capacity for dishing out that same sorrow to her metal foes. The script can lean too heavily in places on supplying her with one-liners and four-letter quotables, but as the movie progresses, it adds extra dimension to Sarah's bitterness from T2.
Dark Fate certainly sets up for another sequel, but this vein feels pretty tapped out. I'm not sure Dark Fate has really rebooted its franchise, and it definitely doesn't offer an ending better than Cameron's final minutes in T2. Nonetheless, it's a steady actioner that pays appropriate tribute to the past.",Terminator - Dark Fate

632,HollywoodJunket,Judgement Day is Still the Winner!,3,6 November 2019,"The opening of ""Terminator: Dark Fate,"" directed by Tim Miller, opens with a scene from 'Judgement Day where Sarah Connor (played by Linda Hamilton) is forewarning about a dark future where no one survives while locked-up in a mental ward.Fast forward to two years later after Sarah and her son save 3 billion lives after deterring and killing a time traveling robot called the Terminator. A bug in the computer system causes for a tragic loss for Sarah. Next, flash to the current time places the new target in New Mexico. This time, its a future leader that is sought to be terminated. We soon discover that Sarah, even after being a wanted outlaw in 50 states, is still chasing these Terminators sent from a slightly varied future to protect and preserve the human race.Just in the first two Terminator movies, a protector for the target is sent at almost the same time that a Terminator is sent. This time the protector is a female human, Grace (Mackenzie Davis) who during a battle was made into a sort of hybrid human/robot. Unfortunately, this puts her at a bit of a disadvantage when the inferiority of her body causes for slow-downs in her endurance level. Why would the future leader send such a protector? It's eventually explained in the latter half of the movie. While the new Terminator, called a Rev-9 (Gabriel Luna) is carefully planted to blend-in with the locals, there's nothing exceptionally notable about this character. While past Terminators had stand-out features, the first being an impressive build, a distinct accent, mannerisms, and a steel inner skeleton in actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The second Terminator, T-1000 (portrayed by Robert Patrick) displayed an evil presence, distinctive edgy features and an enhanced ability to turn into liquid metal. The current Terminator doesn't display any exceptional upgrades. It's more like the features from the first two have been combined to create this new model that is equipped with any one stellar ""wow"" effect ability.Past Terminator (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) re-enters the picture, this time as an ally. He seems to switch back-and-forth from bad, to good pretty consistently throughout all three movies. The 'Dark Fate writers want audiences to believe that this robot was able to live out life disguised as a human, even creating a family for himself. And, they don't know he's a robot? Clearly, something must be wrong with them.A good portion of the movie had slower moments that made the effort to establish human connections. It makes sense that 'Dark Fate would take a part of 'Judgement Day to expand upon. That is when a young John Connor tried to train the Terminator about different human emotions. However, 'Judgement Day had a better balance of action vs. human relations that made it a more enjoyable, well-rounded action film than 'Dark Fate.Dark Fate's ending keeps in the tradition of the first two Terminator films finale scenes where an ultimate battle occurs in a factory, leading to the same fate of the Terminator as those previous movies.In the closing scene, it can be assumed that a new ""Sarah Connor"" will take-over, and the actual Sarah Connor takes her under her wing where some intense training is sure to follow. Hence, creating a new slew of follow-up films.",Terminator - Dark Fate
633,Iusedtobeacat,Disappointing,5,9 November 2019,"Before reviewing this title, I'd like to make it clear that I didn't watch Terminator 1 or 2. So, I have no way of comparing this sequel to it's prequels but I'm going to review it as an independent film/story/plot. I don't think the prequels play a huge role in this one, so it wasn't necessary to watch them. There are some flashbacks that provide a ""some"" albeit minimal context to the story and a new cast too.
Therefore...
I'm going to divide this review into two segments likes and dislikes. So, let's start with the likes.
1-The acting was pretty good. The characters were bearable for the most part, except for one which I'll discuss more about later.
2-The action sequence and the special effects were good.
3-I liked the story from a female POV although that's not as shocking now in 2019 soooo....
4-It was watchable.
__________________________________DISLIKES:
1-The plot was boring. It was such a cookie cutter. Unoriginal for an action film. I didn't really feel connected to the characters I felt like they were all pretty arbitrary.
2-There were a lot of PLOT HOLES in this movie, the heroine comes from the future but what happens now? Does her going back in time alters the future? Does it have any impact on the future? Or is it all good? It's almost like her going to the past and changing it was inconsequential. Which leads me to believe that maybe the writers didn't think deeply enough about this plot and just used it as an element.
3-The grand savior of this specific movie is super annoying. She's annoying to the core and she has a hard time making the right decisions over and over again in this movie, she's super naive and super dumb. To the point that when she was revealed as the savior I was like whaaaat? You must be kidding?? I don't know how the writers didn't think this through? How can you present someone as being the dummy throughout the film and then expect us to believe that they're this powerful heroine all along? Like the ultimate solution to the universe's existence? It just sounds weird and out of place. I found a hard time rooting for this unlikely heroine because I couldn't believe it or buy into it.
4-If humanity was destroyed by the AI in the 2040s, how come humans possess this powerful technology to time travel? I don't get it. They don't explain that in the film. They also don't explain how they managed to augment the humans? Why did they not have that technology before this war took place?
___________________________________________________________
VERDICT:
I think this movie would have been great, if the writers took enough time to think about how they would develop the story. It seems like they had an idea but they had no way of making it make sense. It's for sure a missed potential.",Terminator - Dark Fate
634,rubya,It's not that bad,7,26 January 2020,"I get why some people may be disappointed this film isn't the sequel to T2 they were hoping for but if you watch the film without any expectations, it's not that bad.
Even the currently fashionable female power theme is not as bad as in other recent films, mainly thanks to Mackenzie Davis who I think carries the movie.Ok, the future saviour of humanity who needs protection is now a woman. Some may be upset it's not John Connor but lets face it, he was never the hero of the films, he was what drove the main characters. His replacement isn't great though.
Sarah Connor is still badass but also slightly annoying.
Carl (Arnie) really is just for the fans as the explanation for his existence is a bit lame and easy, and as a terminator he doesn't make sense. But hey, can't make Terminator films without him!
Coming to Grace (Mackenzie Davis): she really pulls it off. She's strong without trying to be a man, vulnerable without being weak, she's believable and the fight scenes don't look stupid. I particularly enjoyed the chain action. She's the kind of female action hero that I like and reminds me of Ripley in Aliens, not over the top. The film would have had a much lower score without her in.
The bad guy has some cool moves but yet isn't scary compared to the first two films' terminators. He talks too much and looks casual most of the time rather than like a killing machine or a predator.All in all it's not a masterpiece but it's not boring and there are some good action scenes.",Terminator - Dark Fate

The classic first words uttered by the protector were only second to Arnies 'i'l be back' so was a little disappointed with the replacement line 'if we don't move we'll be dead in 30 seconds ' - just didn't feel the same. The terminator was very good but the female protector looked like olive from Popeye and inspired little confidence. The film is boring in parts and the new saviour forward story was equally uninspiring. Wasn't feeling the whole Mexican vibe. Overall it wasn't too bad a watch, the opening snippet from T2 really set the tone but the movie waivered shortly after. If you are a die hard JC fan, you will really notice his directorial absence, vitally, you never feel the nervousness you did when watching the original.

639,mwelliott99,Not great,6,26 October 2019,"Was really looking forward to this but it's a bit of a let down. My thoughts:
It has neither the tension of the first film or the humour/characterisation of the second.in the 80's/90's having strong female action leads was innovative and interesting. The men are all weak or stupid. This approach is old hat and tedious. Human relationships are much more complex and interesting and nuanced than this. There are no good male characters in this other than Arnie. The female focus didn't work - my wife fell asleep and didn't think much of the bits she did watch.sadly Arnie & Linda Hamilton are getting on a bit.'Sarah Connor' was just a grumpy old woman. I should have some sympathy for her but didn't. Of the three leads (all female) only really had an interest in/concern for the McKenzie Davis character. Didn't care what happened to the other two.making Arnie 'human' with human emotions/sympathy destroyed the fun of his character (not understanding humans). This holes the film below the waterline.there was nothing new in the bad alien. No shocks, no surprises. All the same stuff that we've seen before. The leads didn't even try and deal with his molten self in a different way. Nothing.we knew the bad T was going to emerge from the final explosion, that Arnie would die, that the girl lead would live etc.and please no more scenes of terminators shooting ray guns and treading on skulls etc. Seen it before & we've got the message.the Mexican sub-plot was dull and we've seen this stuff before.the story was poor. Cameron just moved the same pieces around. Terminator taking the man's clothes - let's have the female 'Terminator' take a man's clothes. T saying 'I'll be back' - let's have Sarah Connor say that etc. Really, is this best they can do?I'm sad to say it but although T2 was possibly the best film I've seen, I think the series has had its time. They've run out of ideas and it probably needs a new team in charge to stand any chance of future success.After T2, the best of the sequels is T3 with Clare Danes. A menacing terminator, clever twists (Arnie being 'infected', great humour and good action.",Terminator - Dark Fate

It is perhaps the best version of terminator series after Terminator 2: Judgment Day I guess. But before watching this viewers should forget that there were other terminator movies released before this post Terminator 2: Judgment Day. They should see Terminator 2: Judgment Day rather. This movie begins with the backdrop of Terminator 2: Judgment Day. So there is no need to recall other stupid terminator movies already released before this. Without experimenting too much this movie rather deals with a simple story-line and Terminator:2 like character backed with stunning VFX and action sequences. Linda Hamilton could not emote that well and that's a let down. There were a few clumsy moments as well in this movie.
Gabriel Luna as the main villain did a great job. So without much expectation because of the stupid earlier versions of terminators post Terminator:2 this movie is surely pretty watchable.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I knew that Sarah was back is all.I was VERY disappointed. It's a silly idea to promote female heroes by killing off your male heroes. Is that some kind of plot gimmick that we're supposed to believe? And then, to top that off, the Terminator feels guilt and remorse over having killed John Connor and proceeds to help Sarah kill more Terminators.The ""Augmented"" female sent back from the future in the opening sequences falls off a 35' overpass in Mexico City and slams into the ground, and we're supposed to believe she's OK? Are you serious? The augments are to the various body parts, even if armor is built into the skull, do you believe a fall like that wouldn't scramble your brains?That defines the problem I have with all the comic book movies anymore, they are just too unbelievable to be worth watching anymore. If they're gonna be fun, then have fun, and make people laugh. They just made this one to promote an alternative, a female hero. Hmmm...Action - OK. Acting - OK. SciFi plot, ridiculous and effects overall unbelievable. Sad, because T-2 and T-3 are definitely some of my favorite movies.",Terminator - Dark Fate

651,fjk1138-731-161881,T3 is the Godfather compared to this,2,15 January 2020,"I personally liked all 3 of the original Terminator movies. T Salvation was OK, and Genisys was generally meh but I still watched it more than once.Then you have this piece ...A mess of a movie, loaded with plot holes. Ignores its own rules established by the previous movies. Doesn't really offer anything new and barely explains what's going on. Get the idea?All of the actors phoned it in, including Linda Hamilton who was really great in the first two movies by comparison. Arnold's part was a complete joke - a ""human"" terminator? Seriously, that blows beyond words. The ONLY good actor was MacKenzie Davis, I thought she kicked ass and was solid in her part.Killing off John Connor was done so quickly and matter of factly that it has zero emotional impact. They then shove endless action sequence after action sequence at you immediately afterward with zero regard for what just happened to John. All the emotional weight of the first 3 movies was shot down in flames in a matter of seconds and practically forgotten about until 2/3 of the movie later. Nice job there, James Cameron.Speaking of Cameron...supposedly he considers this the ""true"" 3rd movie in the franchise. So that means it does not call out any mention of ""alternate timelines"" existing, and it completely IGNORES T3, T:Salvation, and T:Genisys. Not a hint, a mention, nada.And speaking of ""nada""....This movie was obviously written for the South American foreign market audiences. Someone at the studio must have checked the demographics and said ""Ahh, we've had good reaction to action movies down there....we'll make this one take place in Mexico with Mexican actors"", who by the way, were all as weak as their characters were written. Note to Hollywood - you can't just slap people of different cultural backgrounds into a movie to appease the ""woke culture"" trend; they actually have to ""act"" and people working the script have to actually write a solid movie. To quote John Connor from T2: ""Are we learning yet?""I actually was hoping this film would have had some minor fun moments, but even the action sequences are nothing you haven't seen before. And for it being 2020 the CGI in some places doesn't look any better than what T2 did back in 1991. It's all the same smashing/stabbing/melting metal crap you've seen before.I hope there aren't any more of these. Let the series die with whatever little dignity it has left. Too bad they can't send a terminator back in time to stop the greenlighting of this stupid movie.",Terminator - Dark Fate
652,homdeb1058,Good Movie,8,16 November 2019,"I liked this movie. Of course to be fair I liked T-Salvation and T-Genisys. I think the problem is how you look at these sequels. Some viewers seem to think they ruin the original story line. I view them as bonus movies, extras, side stories branching off the original. Maybe the question is whether when a time line is altered does the old one disappear while the new one continues, or are they both alive and running simultaneously and how do you know which one you'll end up in if you jump time? Furthermore, do you suppose an AI capable of practically destroying the human race and orchestrating the rise of the machine world wouldn't have it's fingers in a whole bunch of different pies? Terminator Dark Fate has all the right Terminator stuff, old and new characters, virtually indestructible terminators, a plethora of cool weapons. action galore, impossible battles, dry wit Arnold, sarcastic Linda, gungho new guy McKenzie, and new reluctant future leader Natalia. Yes if you want your Terminator story to be a single, unchanging reality thru past, present and future, maybe you should skip it. If you can look at it as a new parallel/branching time line to an old familiar story --you might enjoy it. Hey, any Terminator is an improvement over T3. I give it a 7.5 rounded to an 8 out of 10.",Terminator - Dark Fate
653,Sam_Ash_76,"An Unintelligible, Poorly Paced, Poorly Acted, Poorly Written Mess Of A Movie",1,1 December 2019,"Before seeing this film, I had completely low expectations. The ""Terminator"" universe, for me at least, ends with the second film. ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" is, still to this day, one of the greatest films ever made, and its conclusion remains one of the most satisfying conclusions of a movie. Then came the sequels, which I didn't bother watching. I don't know the quality of the other movies purely because I had no interest in watching them, however, when I heard about this one bringing back Sarah Conner into the fold, I felt an obligation to watch it. I wish I didn't.Let's begin with the biggest positive I have for this movie, the glimpse it showed at the beginning of ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"", I enjoyed seeing the old archive footage of Sarah in the asylum rambling about the terminator. After this, we go straight to 1994, where Sarah has been de-aged... perfectly. It looked incredible. I was super excited at this point because I thought the movie might revolve around that year, and be a literal direct sequel to Terminator 2. It wasn't.The decision to kill John Conner is possibly the worst decision to kill a character in any film or television show. I immediately felt the urge to leave the theater. You cannot kill a main character of a franchise in such an anticlimactic way. The film just continued to become worse as it progressed. Actually... just before I go on to talk about how much I hated this movie, Sarah and John were successful in defeating Skynet and stopping the future in 2029 from occurring... Actively acknowledged by this film. How come a Terminator comes back and kills John? It makes... literally no sense.The movie flashes forward 22 years and we briefly follow the life of a woman Dani, a terminator spawns in to kill her because shes the future John Conner who will help lead the resistance, unknown to us (the audience) at the time, but further explained in the film. Another woman, called Grace, who is 'half human half machine' spawns in and tries to save her from the terminator. Dani loses her brother and father to the terminator and leaves with Grace, they're followed by Sarah Conner.Sarah shows up and saves both of their asses, even though they seem less than thankful considering she just saved their lives. Grace consistently annoys Sarah, and the viewers, by insulting her across the film's runtime. Why the writers couldn't have just had a nice relationship between the characters... I'll never know. Grace explains the future set in 2042 where a group known as Legion has created terminators that have betrayed the humans and started killing them. Not only does this make the experience of the first two films less valuable, it literally destroys the point of their existence. Everything that Sarah and John did to save the world is just reset and the future still happens. Just leave this franchise alone.How does Legion even exist? The audience isn't really provided a good explanation other than, ""they do"". Getting back to the terrible plot of this piece of garbage film, Sarah tells Grace and Dani about messages shes been getting on her phone that end with, 'for john'. They decrypt the messages, and find out that the coordinates that are tattooed on Grace's chest is the same location that the messages are coming from.They begin to go to Texas and eventually, after wasting an entire hour of our time, find the terminator that killed John in the beginning of the film. Understandably, Sarah is upset... because he literally KILLED HER SON. However, its played for laughs. He has a family now and a conscious, don't even ask me how that 'works'. He talks about his job of selling drapes... but just an hour before we saw him brutally murder an innocent eleven year old kid... how are we supposed to 'root' for this character?? He is purely despicable and I wanted him to die the minute he showed up on screen.The gang eventually is tracked by the other terminator and Grace sacrifices herself, alongside 'Carl' (the terminator who murdered John), to stop the terminator from killing Dani. The film ends with a lackluster messages of 'hope' with Sarah and Dani in a car ready to stop other terminators... or something. It really is never fully explained what the ending actually means. Are both of them close now? I felt no chemistry between the actors through the entire film.I hate this film. So much. It ruins so much about the terminator lore and destroys the meaning of hope after the second film concludes. It kills John Conner, and the terminator who killed him is a character we're supposed to 'like'. This movie is genuinely one of the worst pieces of trash I've ever endured. I hate it so so so much. I'm done with this series, I will never watch another one.Score: 1.0/10",Terminator - Dark Fate
654,Habibi-Universe,Please End This Franchise Already!,3,14 November 2020,"Tim Miller's 'Terminator: Dark Fate' (2019) is the 6th(!) and hopefully FINAL film of this washed out franchise!This is by far the worst one out of all the 'Terminator' films. It is so bad that I don't even want to give you a summary of the plot!I have reached the point where I am sick and tired of these stupid rehashes!
I do not want any more new 'Terminator' films made! The first two are awesome, but the rest is poor and THIS ONE is pure garbage!I'm so happy that this film did not have a mid- or end-credit scene like in 'Terminator Salvation'! Hopefully this was the last one. Huh, Paramount, are you listening? Let this franchise go!I really thought that bringing back Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor would make the film at least a little better, but unfortunately that was not the case whatsoever! I actually thought she was really unlikable in this film and the horrible lines the woman had to say, I gotta say, I kinda feel bad for her! I am sure Linda Hamilton was hoping for a more glorious return which evidently wasn't the case!In my opinion the CGI was fine, but really not groundbreaking whatsoever! The story is super generic and the characters are all unlikable and badly written and THAT scene in the beginning of the film... you gotta be kidding me! This movie basically completely laughed in the faces of 'The Terminator' and 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day'! Totally unacceptable!
The pacing of the film is also really bad. I genuinely had a hard time making it through the full movie!Overall, 'Terminator: Dark Fate' does about everything wrong a film could do!

It's a far less powerful movie than Terminator Genisys, so from that perspective it's a little disappointing, but it's still entertaining, especially if you're new to the Terminator movies.Some reviewers complain about the ""feminist"" ""angle"". After watching, I'm left feeling for these precious little neanderthals - I mean get real! 3 of the 5 main characters are female. Whoopy do!
Others are unhappy that inconsistencies have been introduced into the franchise! Huh? The movies are about time travel which isn't even freakin possible. Even leaving that aside, every movie in the franchise starts by changing things. In T1, the machines managed to send ONE Terminator before the device was destroyed, yet T2 happened. In T2 they destroy sky net, but it changes nothing as Skynet evolves in a different way. Because Time Travel exists, anything can be undone /redone. So this movie makes further ""changes"" - perhaps it's ""failure"" is that it doesn't dwell on trying to present a stupid argument as to ""how"" thing got changed.So watch with an open mind.

As a ""sequel"" to T1 ans T2 though, it's bad, really really bad.From the moment they killed off John Conner from the get go I know this is not going to be good, and sure enough it's not good.Let's start with the positives though. Arnold Schwarzenegger is fantastic in this movie. He's once again the shining beacon of good in this sea of mediocrity. Linda Hamilton is great. Makenzie Davis though. Yeah, that girl from The Martian? She's great in this movie. Her looks isn't great though she looks like Justin Beiber if he's a woman. The new girl though, Dani Ramos, she's bad. In some scenes she's great, others she's unconvincing. The new Terminator is great, BUT it feels like the idea of TX from Terminator 3 but done ""slightly"" better. The music is meh too, feels very quiet and not much else. The CGI though.... It's very bad in some scenes. It took me out of the movie immediately.The plot though... It feels like T1 and T2 put into a blender while adding unnecessary and uninspired stuff. That's this movie. Some scenes felt really like they just replicate the scene from T1 and T2. They add really nothing new to the story. You got your Terminator, you got your guardian, you got your first car chase, you got some slow character building moments, you got the big finale, you see the pattern already? Some scenes are also odd, unexplained and made no sense. Like, how could a Terminator can feel emotion? That already contradicted what Kyle Reese said in T1.This is easily the most mediocre Terminator movie post T2 I've ever seen. At least T3, Salvation and Genisys had something new to offer. This one feels like T1 and T2 for the new generation, but we've seen this already. And it's sad.To be frank, I'm actually prefer Genisys over this not gonna lie.

Natalia Reyes and Mackensies Davies are great. Even Gabriel Luna's Terminator is interesting. He is as deadly as Robert Patrick's Terminator but with more charm and personality. There are great actions scenes and some may reference T2 but they are all tense. You fear for everyone because this latest killer Terminator played by Luna is convincingly more dangerous than any other Terminators in the franchise.

676,ismaeelbuttib,Underrated,7,15 February 2021,A real good sequel to the original two we all love.,Terminator - Dark Fate
677,susana-c-fernandes,The only sequel that should have happened,8,5 November 2019,"After Terminator 2, it's a well known fact that the franchise went to hell. Several actors played the mythical characters John and Sarah Connor, none of them charismatic, and the sequels failed to reinvent the original story (except perhaps the one with Christian Bale) always returning to the basic plot: humans running from killer machines. Oh, by god, let us forget the one with ""evil"" John Connor (this could have been an interesting twist but got revealed in the trailer!!!!!! Oh well).Anyway, regarding Dark Fate, my advise is to watch it as if none of the other sequels were ever made. Dark Fate also fails (if you want to see it like a failure) to reinvent the original story. It is still humans running from a killer machine, with the occasional difference to make it interesting. Still, there are 3 main positive points to it:it's the first sequel where almost all the characters are played by the original actorsthe (evil) Terminator does some very impressive stunts, is more powerful and versatile than ever and can be truly chilling. He is also the first to act as human as the baddest of them all (T1000). Still, Robert Patrick remains the best, why the hell wasn't he cast???it's one hell of an action movie! It's exciting, entertaining (CGI fails once or twice though) and thrilling to watch, and has an emotional side to it that reminds us of Terminator 2 - machines can learn to live with (and ""love"") people.Two other points worthy of mention:
SPOILERS AHEAD
this is the first time a Terminator movie successfully places women in the spotlight. There are 3 female lead characters. Dani's not merely the womb that will give birth to a man who will save mankind, SHE is the one who will save us. Also, this is the first time that Sarah Connor is given the hero status she deserves. I loved this and it's what saves this from being ""just another Terminator movie"".in my opinion, killing John in the very beginning is the best thing that could have happened to the character. Edward Furlong is John Connor. If he's no longer interested in playing the part, you better kill the character for once, because no one will ever match his personality on T2.END OF SPOILERSI love Terminator 1 and 2 (probably watched the latter over 100 times, no joke) and its characters. That said, I might be a bit partial on this review. Keeping it real though: this is a ""no brainer"" action movie with impressive sequences that will have you grabbing your seat. It has the refreshing points I mention in the spoiler section and is the first time we get to see the real Sarah and John Connor again.Go watch it on the big screen for the best experience and for a proper farewell to Terminator.",Terminator - Dark Fate

679,jeddjong,A Sarah Connor Chronicle,7,23 October 2019,"The Terminator franchise is a defining one in the genres of sci-fi, action and horror. While the imagery and the catchphrases have become ingrained in popular culture, the film series has struggled to recapture the glory of the first two entries. The underrated spinoff television series was sadly short-lived. James Cameron, who directed the first two films and helmed the theme park attraction but has had no direct involvement in the series since then, returns as a producer for this sixth film.Terminator: Dark Fate learns from the failure of the previous entries. The most recent Terminator film before this, Terminator: Genisys, was a jumbled mess of multiple timelines and attempted to remix beloved elements of the series, alienating fans in the process. Dark Fate benefits from more of a back-to-basics approach, presenting a straightforward story without relying too much on exposition. It functions as a direct sequel to Judgement Day, with all the other films taking place in alternate timelines. This is not dissimilar to 2018's Halloween, which was a direct sequel to the 1978 movie and ignored the many sequels that were made in the intervening years.The film's biggest asset is Linda Hamilton, who has not appeared in any of the films since Judgement Day. This is much more than the glorified cameo which we could've gotten, with the Sarah Connor character front and centre.
Hamilton took some convincing to come back on board, and the film really wouldn't have worked if she had said no. Hamilton easily conveys the no-nonsense toughness fans of the series know and love, but also delivers a genuinely good performance beyond that. The R-rating means that she gets to swear a whole lot, and she's amazing at it. There are several moments when just a look from Hamilton tells us so much. This is a character who has been through the wringer and would like the world to think she can just shrug it off, but there is a lot of sadness and pain that she's internalised - when those shards are visible, that's when Hamilton's immense contribution to the movie really registers.Arnold Schwarzenegger appears in more of a supporting capacity, but completely steals the show when he's onscreen. The film wisely makes use of Schwarzenegger's comedic talents while also preserving the formidable physical power associated with the T-800 character.One scene in the film showcases the most convincing digital de-aging/face replacement effects I've ever seen.The film clearly aspires to the heights of Judgement Day, so it is noticeable when it falls short of those heights. There are moments when the film is almost emotional, and while there are some moving beats, there is nothing nearly as sublime as ""I know now why you cry, but it's something that I could never do."" While the stronger connection to the first two films anchors Dark Fate in the tone and mythos of the earlier movies, it also prevents the movie from being too innovative on its own terms. Also, much of the events in Judgement Day seem to have been rendered moot - not quite to the level of ""Ripley finds Newt and Hicks dead at the beginning of Alien 3,"" but it does approach that.While some action sequences are brilliantly executed, others feel just a touch too synthetic. The visual effects are leaps and bounds over the somewhat unpolished work seen in Genisys, but there are still moments when one thing made of CGI is being thrown into another thing also made of CGI. Out of necessity, the earlier films made ingenious use of practical animatronic effects and miniature models. Director Tim Miller of Deadpool fame is a co-founder of Blur Studio, best known for making animated cutscenes and cinematics for video games. The action sequences in Dark Fate can sometimes come off as a little too video game-esque, but Miller does often demonstrate a keen awareness of how to place elements in space to create action sequences.The Dani character is sympathetic and Natalia Reyes gives the role her all, but she can sometimes come off as a little whiny and is not written that well.Another way that the film echoes Judgement Day is in its villain, the shape-shifting Rev-9. Like Robert Patrick, Gabriel Luna is less conspicuous in a crowd than Arnold Schwarzenegger, meaning the Rev-9 is more convincing as an infiltration unit. It also has a neat gimmick of being able to separate itself into liquid metal outer shell and endoskeleton, allowing it to perform tag-team attacks. Rev-9 is perhaps a touch too indestructible, such that the action sequences become a little repetitive.Mackenzie Davis' Grace is a great addition to the canon. This reviewer enjoys seeing actors whom one wouldn't typically associate with action movies take on action-heavy roles. Davis underwent a complete physical transformation to play the muscular, angular Grace. There is a tragedy to the character, who has sacrificed her physical autonomy for the cause, so she is always sympathetic.Terminator: Dark Fate is in a way commenting on the history of the series. There is so much that's memorable about the first two Terminator films that it's hard to resist the temptation to make constant references to them. Yes, Sarah Connor does say ""I'll be back"", but Dark Fate demonstrates restraint and refuses to lean on the series' storied past as a crutch.Terminator: Dark Fate is not a film that strictly needs to exist, but by building a strong connection to the second film and by getting Linda Hamilton back in a starring role, it satisfyingly echoes the franchise at its best.",Terminator - Dark Fate

683,nadblaster,What a disaster,2,20 September 2021,"Bafflingly bad. You'd think getting Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger back together would at least add an interesting note of drama, but instead they've decided to rewrite Sarah Connor into a bitter, one-liner-spewing b---h and Arnold Schwarzenegger - you know, the original bad-boy Terminator - into a ""funny"" family man.Probably most surprising to me was the surprisingly bad CG graphics used in this movie. The first scene has legitimately incredible CG, and every scene afterwards looks fake, overdone, and childish. It is a sad fact that Terminator 2, a movie that is officially 30 years old, had better computer generated graphics than this movie. Almost as bad are all the new characters. Your mileage may vary but I found myself completely unable to care about any of them at all. The new ""hero"" character is boring, the new ""VIP"" character is one-dimensional and annoying, and the new villain vacillates wildly between ""unfeeling killing machine"" and ""LMAO so funny and relatable"". Sarah Connor herself is now a completely unlikable psycho who is impossible to identify with. I have no idea who wrote this story but they deserve to be fired.I regret watching this.

Then they kill off John Connor. Not something i liked but it was done well (CGI).
the First battle Between the enhanced woman and the new Terminator - in my opinion was very good.
the movie continue's ....... at a medium pace. i can deal with that.
THEN!!!...............
Arnie appears. All settled down and working as a Window blind fitter or something like that. This was the point i nearly lost the will to live.
A Terminator living a human life..... not only that but, he has a frikkin girlfriend hahaha. oh come on. A terminator, in a relationship and working as a blind fitter? REALLY??? who actually wrote this? im actually laughing as i type this! Why didnt Arnie or Linda or anyone look at the script and say ""Hell no, are you actually kidding me"".
Linda Hamilton back as Sarah Connor was awesome and i think she did it well. The enhanced human character was actually very good (minus the recharging nonsense). If i didnt enjoy the action scenes this movie would have been rated lower. Embarrassing parts but some good action.

690,simonkie,A new spin on a old story.,7,15 October 2020,No spoilers here but judging by all the negative reviews I would guess they most likely didn't like the movie from the first 5 minutes. The story doesn't EXACTLY follow the previous films but it does somewhat hence the new spin on this classic franchise. That's not saying it's bad as I can understand the direction they choose to take but it is a little disappointing which again could result in many negative reviews for the story.Now on to the film itself. With this being the 6th film in the franchise I hoped to see this film show the newest model Terminator doing something I've never seen before and it did not disappoint. The first action sequence was fantastic and the newest Terminator model is as terrifying as you would expect. Linda Hamilton reprises her most famous role as Sarah Connor who is still the bad ass we remember from T2 and of course Arnold is back as a more humble Terminator. The real star of the film is MacKenzie Davis who plays a half human/cyborg designed to fight off the newest killing Terminator machine.Overall it's a very different story BUT also a very entertaining film. The story however different does make sense and the action scenes are top notch. If you're open to a different unique story you will like this movie and if not you will not even give it a chance. I gave it a chance and I was glad I did.,Terminator - Dark Fate

A badass woman in her 60s with her wrinkles and all, a short, brunette, Mexican woman who speaks Spanish as a relevant character, the hero is also a woman and none of them have a love interest. Only two relevant males, one is Arnold and the other is the big bad. Definitely something you don't see everyday in Hollywood. Maybe that's exactly why people hate it, because it's a decent Terminator movie. There's a machine with a mission, people run from it and try to destroy it. I don't know what people were expecting, but I guess they weren't ready for this. I'll make sure my 1 year old daughter sees it when she grows up a bit, it's tiring to see 40 year old women playing the mothers of 35 year old men.

Evil terminator comes to kill the savour of earth, and some enhanced person comes to run Interference.This film lacked what it needed the MOST, a backstory to the terminators. How they think, what went through their systems before ending it all. Their world after judgement day, their army and their way of life/existence.Otherwise, since Terminator 3, 4 & now this one... there is nothing that separates them from each other.Expected more from Tim and James.

694,mathijsschaap,"Way better than expected, but where's Tim?",9,8 March 2020,"Let me start by saying I did not mind John Connor's death at all. It's what this franchise needed in the first place, just like Halloween's need to change the brother-sister subject. Since Edward Furlong, not one actor could replace him portraying John Connor.I don't know why, but the first half of the movie, I could not stop wondering why Tim was not in this movie. You know: John Connor's ginger friend. He was pushed aside by the T-1000 in T2. Tim must have felt that exact moment how cold this T-1000 was, no human warmth at all. It would have been a logical choice to make Tim the new hero of the future. Actor Danny Cooksey is still out there, acting and all. It would have been possible.The action scenes were terrific and kept me on the edge of my seat, which I did not expect at all.It has its flaws. An REV-9 apologizing for destroying a shed? He's a cold killing machine, for crying out loud. Terminators never apologize.But all in all, this movie is a very good sequel to T2. Nice to see they've made a collection of the good things from T3, T-Genisys, Salvation and the tv-series.Lena Heady did a great job portraying Sarah Connor, but Linda Hamilton will always be the original loved one. Emilia Clarke however was a lame Sarah.Arnold Schwarzenegger's part is exactly right in this one. I had a hard time accepting the fact a T-800 can produce offspring, but he moved me with the line 'This time, I won't be back'.I've been a fan of the Terminator for 35 years now.

695,michaeltong-29180,Why?,1,18 January 2020,"Did you like John Connor? Were you happy he survived and stopped Skynet? Well this movies hates you and give you the middle finger in the first 5 minutes. It undoes T1 and T2 just so that it can reset the status quo, but this time with a girl. That's it.Remember Terminator's central theme about the value and responsibility of motherhood? Dark Fate doesn't. In this movie, motherhood is something to be scoffed at and not something to revered.The whole concept of Terminator wasn't that Sarah was just a womb. She was the woman who was going to raise a leader. Her value wasn't in the mere fact that she could give birth, it was that she alone could impart the wisdom necessary to make John great. Terminator elevated the role of a mother over that of a military leader and an action hero. Dark Fate does not understand this.In and of itself, the film is not terrible, but as an attempt to reboot the Terminator franchise it fails completely and basically ends up hitting all the same beats as before. It's pointless, and that's why I'm giving it 1 out of 10.",Terminator - Dark Fate
696,khaabd,Now it is necessary to stop,4,19 January 2020,"From 2003 this series began to decline, but with James Cameron's return to this segment, I was very optimistic, but the shock was greater, Personally, this was considered the worst part of the series and even worse than the part of 2015, and real abuse of the first three parts, especially the first two parts in 1984 and 1991, A great and lame movie plot shift from the legendary hero that set the film series John Conner to another character who has no hero traits that saves humanity, In addition to not providing any new addition, the same thing that we saw in previous films, we saw it in this film very badly, Speaking of acting, he was very bad from all the actors, especially from the alleged heroine. Personally, I exclude Gabriel Luna who played the role of REV-9 as his facial expressions were commensurate with his role.I think now and more than ever it is time to stop producing other Terminator films.",Terminator - Dark Fate
697,drhoads-93743,Hits big and misses big,7,19 October 2020,"Dark Fate has some big successes; unfortunately, its failures, although few, are big.First, the special FX: Some of the CG in this film is phenomenal. I mean terrific. But a few of the shots are so plastic that it detracts from the movie. I didn't see this film in theaters, but I can imagine that the audiences laughed at the low quality CG in some shots. They were really cringeworthy. It's such a shame because many of the special FX are terrific. Even from the beginning of the film when there's a big shot of Mexico City, it just looks so fake. If you contrast this with T1 and T2, those are real shots of LA. They look real; they feel real. Why do these filmmakers think the CG is going to fool us so they can save a few bucks with location shots? They look bad and they feel plastic.One other minor criticism I have of the cinematography: I really hated the handheld camerawork for the closeup shots. It made me feel like I was watching an episode of 24 or something. Just doesn't fit in a Terminator film.Arnold is terrific in this film and so is his character. I found this character's storyline to be very strong. He's very funny and there is some real depth to who he is.Linda Hamilton is very good -- not great, but very good. She's a grieving mother who is pissed off at the world, so it's understandable that her character comes off a little unlikable.Gabriel Luna: The villain. He's good. Not Arnold in T1 or Robert Patrick, but he does a fine job. He's not very menacing, but his capabilities as a terminator are menacing. There is a strong feeling throughout the film that he can track pretty much anybody anywhere in the world, and this builds suspense. I also very much liked how they explained his capabilities.Mackenzie Davis: I was a bit worried about this character watching the previews, but she really is a strong actress and a good character. I overall think they handled this part very well.Natalia Reyes: This character and her storyline are the weakest part of the film by far. Some of it is not her fault in that the film pretty much had to kill of John Connor in the beginning, so she had big shoes to fill. I frankly didn't buy this character at all. She's a beautiful actress and was fine in her role, but not anything close to great. The explanation for why her character is the driving force of the film just doesn't work. It's not believable. They tried everything they could to toughen up the image of this sweet, beautiful, petite Columbian actress, but they just couldn't do it. Her story was already weak on its own, and this weakness is compounded by her being terribly miscast. She's just the wrong actress for this film. Not an ounce of roughness in this woman. So it just fell completely flat. Unfortunately, she is supposed to be the main storyline. So all the strengths of this film get essentially wasted on this horribly thought-out plot.So overall, it's far better than its three competitor sequels to T2, but it's not up to the task of being called a ""worthy sequel."" I'm not trying to be unrealistic here. It's hard to compete with T1 and T2, which are legendary films and T2 is perhaps one of the greatest sequels in cinema history. Dark Fate is just lacking. But it is strong enough for Terminator fans to enjoy if they are willing to accept that it has some major flaws. Watching the storyline of the T-800 is entertaining enough, and so is seeing Arnold and Linda back together again. Watch this with an open mind and you'll enjoy it. Going in expecting it to be as good as T2 will just make you pissed off. So do yourself a favor and go in with an open mind to have some fun. Arnold is terrific.",Terminator - Dark Fate

700,maue-19674,Terminator - Blank Page,5,20 March 2020,"Although touted as the 'real' Sequel to the original T1 and T2, this release still struggles to emerge as something fresh from the morass of 'Other Sequels' and even the original two films.
Many were hoping to re-engage with both Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor and Arnold's 'old' 101 Unit - the problem being that the Filmmakers appeared to be more interested in building a 'new' Franchise.
The REAL issue here is that virtually all of this has been seen before in various Terminator films - the plot of this one is a re-run of T2 with yet another incarnation of a 'future Terminator' sent back in time to kill...oh, you get it!
The story is straightforward 'Terminator' fair and the fight sequences are OK - it's just that there isn't anything really new here - you could just say that this is almost a Reboot - and you wouldn't be far wrong. On the performances side, it is MacKenzie Davis's character 'Grace' that is the real centre of the entire Film - despite showing physical strength, you can feel the vulnerability and the sadness of her. Elsewhere - Hamilton comes across as hard as nails whilst Natalia Reyes has a tough time trying to convince that she will be humanity's hope. Many people did not like (or believe) that Arnie's 'Terminator' in this film has now gone 'native' and assimilated with humans. Now I have to say that it is the logical next step of his 'last' incarnation in Judgement Day - after all, does he not say 'I know now why you cry'??
All in all, the Film IS entertaining but sometimes appears to be merely echoes of other Terminator films - a sad end to this journey.",Terminator - Dark Fate
701,ErReads,Loved it!,9,3 November 2019,My husband I just saw this movie and both of us thought it was fantastically entertaining! The action scenes were great. The characters were extremely likeable. The plot didn't really matter much (and it was a fine plot anyway) because I think the main point focus was the chemistry of the characters and the creative action sequences. Now I admit... nostalgia was a huge appeal for both myself and my husband. I have always loved the two original Terminator movies. I saw them as a teenager and have watched them many times since. I loved seeing the Arnold's terminator and Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor. And I really liked the two new characters --Dani and Grace - just as much. Honestly... I am not sure what is behind the negative reviews. This is not an indie art house film. Not sure what the critics were looking for.

707,BLAlley,Repetitive but Decent Sequel to T2,7,5 April 2020,"So the protector and the savior are women this time. So what? Why are males so insecure they suffer crippling anxiety any time more than one woman appears in a substantial role? Sure there are examples of characters being thrust upon us to serve an agenda in some movies and shows, but I never felt that was the case with Dark Fate. To me it was merely one of the ways they tried something different in spite of the overall familiar plot, just like allowing Sarah and John to succeed in stopping Skynet only to realize certain evolutionary paths are inevitable. Doing so also provided better justification for alternative technologies and production aesthetics.
That's why I wish Salvation had been a reboot. It doesn't fit into the series at all but is by far the most original of the Terminator movies since the original. Dad that been the beginning of a retelling it could have been really interesting, eventually having the resistance fighters find the time displacement machine at the end of the second movie.
While Dark Fate isn't as original as Salvation it's still entertaining. The opening sequence was shocking but necessary and it was great to see Sarah back, even though her life of expected peace was short-lived. As much as I enjoyed Dark Fate, the franchise is tired and should be given a rest until someone comes up with a truly original take, possibly continuing from Salvation if not completely from scratch.",Terminator - Dark Fate
708,ChubbyChecker,Pretty much more of the same,7,4 February 2020,"Yes, the franchise is back in the hands of James Cameron. It would have been nice if he had chosen to direct the film, but I guess he's too busy planning the umpteen Avatar sequels that nobody actually believes are all going to see the light of day.Also, yes, Arnie is back (yet again), and so is Linda Hamilton this time. To be fair they both do a good job and I would say their presence enriches the film rather than just being a marketing gimmick.So what's the problem? Well, I'm afraid we've seen it all before. Basically a robot is sent back in time from the future to kill an important historical figure. Does that plot sound familiar? It should, especially if you've seen almost any of the Terminator films. The only film that veered from the formula was Salvation, to mixed reviews.Unfortunately that well worn plot doesn't cut it any more. Either the franchise needs to take some bold new steps or just finally be terminated for good.The reason I gave this film such a high score (7) is that it actually does the formula remarkably well. Far better than either T3 or Genysis did. I guess that's the Cameron influence at work.One more thing, nobody says ""Come with me if you want to live."" That's pretty much an unforgivable error in my eyes. The only film to make the same mistake before this was T3, which was a poor film for many other reasons too.",Terminator - Dark Fate

710,vaultoverseer_15,Incredibly Mixed,5,21 August 2020,"Here's the thing about this movie. There's this angle that's kinda going around on the internet that this is the worst terminator movie. I just can't agree with that at all. Sure, if you want to compare this to T1 or T2 this is nothing. But I think calling it worse than the other movies is a huge overstatement. Here's my review:1. The action: this is exactly what you want to get right from a terminator movie. And for the most part, this movie does really well. The whole fight in the beginning with the truck and in the factory is great. Other bits like the airplane scene and final fight are p good. Some bits are a lil to excessive for my tastes, but it works well. My main criticism with the post T2 movies (excluding Salvation) has been that there never really feels like an impact to any fights. T3 feels like a cartoon and Genisys feels like generic modern action schlock. Yet I feel there is a lot of improvement here. The action is well choreographed, easily to follow, and exciting. Plus, it's FINALLY r rated again.2. Visually - this is one of the aspects I am also very happy about. Again, excluding Salvation, The post T-2 movies have been very poor when it comes to visually being a terminator movie. Moody lighting with cool blue contrasted against the harsh orange summer heat. This movie doesn't do that, but I feel as though there was enough bright and dark contrast to work. It just feels as though this is the dark terminator universe again. This isn't just some generic action schlock.3. Characters - This is where I get into negatives - but there are still some positives. First off I really like Grace as a character. She's strong but also vulnerable and complex. Arnie's cool here as well. And I think the Rev-9 May be the best terminator post-T2 (which IMO isn't saying much but still). On the negatives, Dani is an incredibly weak character. Her personality is that she's a hero I guess. Just very weak personality. It's nice to see Linda Hamilton back and they give her stuff to do, but We didn't need her and she just has the exact same arc she has in T2. She learns to trust Arnie. Kinda lame.4. This is obviously the worse aspect of the movie. To me I don't care about the plot too much as long as the movie is well made. Yet the story is so bad it really pulls my enjoyment of this movie down. Firstly, they kill off John Connor. That makes T2 so dark when you think about it, because John spent that whole movie finally connecting with the T-800 only to be killed by the same type of robot. It's admittedly a terrible idea, but to me ever since T-3 the whole timeline has been stuffed. If this was the only movie after T3 I would've hated it more. Seeing as we've already been told that the whole story ofT2 doesn't matter I don't care that much. But the problem is, even then with that ballsy move the movie never justifies it. The whole idea of judgement day happening again with new machines ends up being more convoluted. Which is frustrating because the basic plot is the same. Yet so many decisions are baffling. I think the problem I have with this movie is that it has to relate to John and Sarah Connor. There arc has finished so leave them alone. This movie tries to do thAt, but then has Arnie and Linda Hamilton show up anyways.

712,JasonXIX,Franchise: Terminated,6,15 January 2020,"This really isn't a sequel to T2. The plot of this movie actually negates the first two movies, only to retell a similar story. There are some great action sequences, but the story is basically the same as previous Terminator films: Someone from the future is sent back to the past to protect the 'only hope' in the future.We know from T2 that Skynet is stopped, so Judgment Day never happens. But none of this matters, because a new company called Legion, ends up doing the same thing in the future anyway. Basically, this movie tells us that an AI Judgment Day is inevitable. Even if they stop Legion in this movie, another company can just take its place in any future sequel.",Terminator - Dark Fate

714,avatarthomas,Good terminator movie,8,6 November 2019,I personally loved this movie. I'd say it was a very good return of some moved characters and James Cameron. This new timeline follows on perfectly from the second movie and manages to flow seamlessly into it. It has some slow bits especially towards the beginning which made it drop a star for me and some of the dialogue was a bit clunky. But besides that I loved it. The action seems were so well choreographed and performed brilliantly. A welcome return to two characters who portrayed their characters in this new world perfectly for what they'd been through. The ending set up for another movie but also left it in such a way that it could be ended there which I thought was a perfect ending,Terminator - Dark Fate
715,Gatsby81,Entertaining and definitely not that Bad,7,29 October 2019,"Good that I didn't listen to some of the obviously ridiculous ratings. People there is not only black and white or good and bad. And this movie Without any doubt better than average. It is crazy to compare this or any movie with Terminator 2 since T2 is the greatest action movie in history!!!
The story has some lacks of sense that is true but you need also to understand that it can not always be terminator traveling back in time to kill John Connor.
Mackenzie Davis Is doing a great job and it's good to have the original cast Hamilton and Schwarzenegger back. However I wished to have more from Arnie since he is the terminator and without him you can forget about the idea to create a terminator movie.
I hope there will be another part with a better script but as a huge Terminator fan I can recommend to watch dark date if you don't expect to top Terminator 2 - since this will never ever happen.",Terminator - Dark Fate

718,carl170,re: To Rival Terminator 1 or 2 - is a big ask. However this film brings it back,8,25 October 2019,"Alot of people have given this the thumbs down. Maybe the bar was set so high within Terminator 1 and 2, that any other movie made within this series was always going to struggle.However, I like the format of the film - follows the lead from Terminator 1 and Terminator 2 in regards to story line - but with twist.Linda Hamilton is a welcome addition to the story; and so Arnie. But I wish they could have included more of Arnie with maybe a computer layer at his home.For Instance (Like for the Character played by Gene Hackman) - within the movie called Enemy of the State (1998) - Starring Will Smith.
There we are taken back to his Edward Lyle (played by Gene Hackman) lair - and we see that he has the latest Computer systems and Anti Blocking/Detection/Computer devices as well.But it would have been cool to see such a setup, since settling down. We saw the weaponry cupboard so to speak. It would have cool to see a more impressive Computer cupboard as well.I liked the addition of Mackenzie Davis (As Grace). Her portrayal as an augmented human was credible and believable ( As we are see this happen in front of own - Eyes!
As I believe there are people within the world now add A.I BITS WITHIN THEIR BODIES! I THINK SWEDEN HAS A LARGEST AMOUNT OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THAT HAVE ALREADY DONE THIS!)I liked Natalia Reyes in her character, and she did have good scene to play as well.I am looking forward to any potential sequels with her in it as wellGabriel Luna was GREAT!
He reminded me of The 1-1000 in Terminator 2.I wish was more even subtle and clever then he was shown. In regards to not having too kill so much all the time, to reach his intended victims - (only when he had to). Then we could have appreciated how clever he was...There were a couple of scenes which I believe that they could have left out and made it more believable.Like the last Airplane/Fight scene and the Underwater scene. I think they could thought of a different scenario there.They were Loads of T1 & T2 references included within this movie. I can't wait to see them more of them as we are told that this is going to be the first of a trilogy of new Terminator films. I liked it..",Terminator - Dark Fate
719,swhite_1119,Why???,4,22 January 2020,I'm so glad that they made a point and gave us the usual Hollywood PC and bring girl power to the Terminator franchise. I'm kidding of course the characters are not very likable and the story has way too many holes. The franchise should have stopped after T2 since then it's been nothing but s money grab and poor story telling,Terminator - Dark Fate
720,ksb77,Frankly...Very Disappointed,2,25 October 2019,"Well what can I say? I'm a sucker !😔. So with that budget this is what they came back with? Really! Some high octane set pieces that were underpinned by essentially the same story. A liquid Terminator..nothing new, an enhanced human (covered) in T4. Some throwback to what life is like in post apocalyptic earth..you seen it all before and executed much better. Well done to the actors though. Linda Hamilton was great. Arnie was a comedian but the same as you've seen him in T2, T3 & T6. This franchise has run out of steam folks, yet some more sequels will follow. Why do these film makers not go by the mantra that less is more? Like my big bag of pop corn this just serves up a superficial sugar rush and yet delivers little real satisfaction. Remember how taught that first terminator was or how epic that second one was. Well this has forgotten those edgy roots and come out all guns blazing. Stick to the original and it's sequel instead much more satisfying than this nostalgic rubbish. There really isn't much more to convey. Save time ..spend it wisely with family and save your very hard earned cash on a nice bottle of wine. Shame on you Hollywood. Leave it be and make something original please.",Terminator - Dark Fate

722,brandtair,The had the materials to make a good addition but failed miserably in execution,4,20 September 2020,"The beginning is quite promising. It starts with a redo of the famous naked entry of the future. Something that in the original was probably made for the ladies that has to watch this with their men.But this time it is a female. The way they portray it is ver well done. It is made to prevent sexualizing it. But very pleasing to watch for the ""cis"" men. The part for the females switched to female empowerment.So far so good.Then the acting is terrible (script combined with actors not seeming to know how to feel and look during the scenes)The realism is completely gone. A repetition of that one female terminator. The army is portrayed very unprofessional and the backstory from the future does not very much connect to the present which means there is nothing cathing any attention after that entrance scene.Could have been so much better with a better director, team of writers and maybe actors ( have not seen some actors act in other pieces so cannot really say.)",Terminator - Dark Fate
723,bjoernidler,Let's be fair...,7,28 March 2020,"I'd like to begin with a little thought experiment. Imagine it's 1991, Terminator 2 has just come out. Also, let's imagine the internet and  had existed at that time. What would many of the comments look like?""OMG, the Terminator has gone soft! He is a father figure now! T2 has officially ruined the Franchise!""""The T1000 doesn't look scary at all! What's with that liquid metal crap???""""This kid actor that plays John Connor can't act!! This is supposed to be the savior of mankind??""While browsing through the comments to Terminator: Dark Fate I thought: Why are people today so much more unforgiving than before? Is this the worst film ever? Would the same people trash T2 if it came out today?Anyway, I watched it and I was surprised in a good way. Not to defend everything that happens here, the new Terminator has its weaknesses.
You can of course critizise it for killing off John Connor and basically telling a new saviour story. You can also be angry about replacing Skynet with a new dangerous AI called Legion.But you can also be thankful for the return of Linda Hamilton not just as a cameo but as a main character.
Also, the film is a chase movie again. The main characters are on the run constantly, which is one of the key elements of T1 and 2.
Also, most of the irritating humour from T3 especially is gone. Yes, Arnold has some One-liners again, but the overall feel of the film is much darker and even more violent again.
Finally, the film offers some fresh ideas that haven't been seen in previous Terminator-films. Some of them I like more, some less.So I actually agree with some critics who claimed this the third best entry in the series. I mean have you seen what happened since T2??*T3 has a weak villain and relies too much on stupid jokes.
*The one with Christian Bale had some potential but turned out quite boring and didn't really feel like a Terminator-film.
*Genysis was all over the place and it had Jai Courtney (I don't know why this man is still acting...)I'm happy with the decision of the filmmakers to ignore everything that happened after T2.
Also, I have tremendous faith in James Cameron, who was involved as a writer and exec producer here, that this is close to his vision for the Terminator Franchise.Again, I don't know why people are so hard on this film. Yes, it's not perfect. But in no way is it the worst film in the Franchise.",Terminator - Dark Fate

725,rightkeith,Embarrassed I paid actual US Dollars to see this,2,13 November 2019,"I was bored to tears during this movie, but when it ended and I turned to my buddy he said he thought it was great. Let's face it, there are plenty of people out there who don't need a creative plot, character development, continuity, or interesting dialogue. They just want to see unstoppable metallic cyborg goo get riddled with bullets, slashed, chopped and burned for 2 straight hours.There was zero likability of the main character. Zero investment in whether she lived or died. Zero originality of how the Terminator uses his abilities. He just ""plugs in"" to the net and instantly finds anything he wants. Zero creativity as to how he tries to kill his target. All he does is run at them? Over and over and over. Zero intellect into how this terminator uses his super-morph ability. He can slash through almost any object at will but when he gets his hand around Sarah Connor's neck he just throws her??If that wasn't enough, we also have to endure this movie checking off all the boxes of the hipster political/societal agenda to make sure we can see how ""woke"" this movie can be. We start off with a Hispanic (check), female (check) hero who takes care of her useless brother (check) and dad. We then move to a truly tragic scene in an automobile factory where we find out machines have replaced most of the downtrodden manual laborers (check). Dang machines putting people out of work! Really? It's Economics 101.... inventing machines to do manual labor is the reason we're not all still freaking farmers. We find out this new breed of Terminator is the result of evil military leaders (check) developing military grade AI. Then we get a delightful chase scene in a cruel US border detainment facility (check) where every Border Patrol guard is mercilessly butchered (check). Then our heroes, who of course genuinely have a good reason to come into the US, have to go on a dangerous trek to make it across the border (check) and are mistaken as malicious members of the Sinaloa drug cartel (check).Next is 45 minutes of meaningless action and narrow escapes. They randomly get on a plane for no other reason than what seems like the director wanted a big plane fight scene. And end up at a dam facility because.... It looks cool?

What I fail to understand is why don't the makers of the movie keep it close to a more natural realistic reactions of a human interaction with extreme unusual situations (within the limits of the fiction itself) where it doesn't feel like its a movie and instead the viewer finds it more relate-able to a real world situation. I found many scenes in the movie that really put me off and I lost interest and rather felt like watching a typical action movie with expected results but with a very serious theme which could have been made million times better. Sorry I love Terminator but it felt like NOTHING SPECIAL and NOTHING SERIOUS. One last thought that came to my mind was, if someone in future wants to kill someone in the past, wouldn't it be easier to just poison their food or something instead of going through all that destruction..!!!

All the actors have done reasonably well and does nothing that is an eye soar. Ofcourse where the movie fails, is to create that emotional connect which John Connor creates with the Terminator in Judgement Day.

The visuals are great, the movie has a good pace and good action. Also I kinda liked the enhanced human Grace, it actually makes sense having enhanced people in the future.But the Rev.9 didn't feel nearly as menacing as the T-1000, even T-X was more menacing. The character Carl made even less sense as Pops from Genisys. Also the alternate future angle didn't work for me... people/fans have invested in the Skynet future with John Connor and now it's a different thing which we have no connection with... weird choice.

It was great to see Linda Hamilton in one again and as an action hero. I'm a little younger and still feel strong too. She is a very nice lady! I loved seeing her around Malibu when our kids were growing up. We were both hooked on romance novels at the same time!! Arnold and Linda were both great!!!
People are living to well over 100 now! It is good to see middle aged people still doing intense action movies! It still felt great to see the bad guy getting knocked around. I think we needed to relate to some of the characters early on in Mexico more so we could really hate him, like we did Robt. Patrick in T2. Robert's character was just mean, this guy was just kind of a dic. Wanted him more mean to hate him, to further enjoy seeing him get beaten up, but not too over the top like Charlize Theron did in The Huntsman. It's just a fine line. I am hoping Arnold and Linda will be back for more.The cool thing is that in a series where the characters travel through time, plot ideas are limitless. Those were great characters! The premise of making ones own destiny is still empowering! 36 years later and I'm in a similar position physically and appreciate the motivation to be kick ass!!!Job well done you all!

I thought to myself wow this is the best Terminator since T2 and I'm really enjoying it.Second half of the movie is more like a separate film. As soon as a certain character is reintroduced we begin to get comedy, plenty of face palm moments, continuity errors and lots of well over the top huge CGI battles which are out of place with the first half. Characters who 20 mins earlier were uneasy and distrusting of each other now act as though they lifelong loved ones. We get smacked in the face with feminism, something which feels organic and excellently executed in the first half of the film then second half it just feels forced and at times used for comedic effect which falls flat.Overall Linda Hamilton is brilliant, Arnie out of place, the first half really good the second half fairly stupid and unnecessary.",Terminator - Dark Fate

To me, this movie feels like a spit in the face to Terminator fans, and an insult to the franchise. It was a waste of the cast, and it is completely forgettable.

Maybe I would not have watched it.Many people claim it's bad, nothing new. Some also are pissed because suddenly we have female heroes everywhere. True, if you want to watch something completely fresh and new, then maybe Dark Fate is nothing for you. In a way, Dark Fate really tries to follow up on T2. Without going into details, we have an all-powerful Terminator hunting his prey and well, in a way if you watched T2, who might find quiet some similarities.Here my statements why the movie is not as bad as people say
1. Gabriel Luna is amazing. I loved the new evil Terminator and I believe he was the perfect shot. Why? Also because he looks somewhat like a nice guy and at the same time he very convincingly plays the machine
2. Having suddenly female heroes should not make men bad. Seriously guys? Dont you have better things to complain about? If you are conservative, feel free to watch every movie from the beginning to the early millenium years again. From John Wayne to the Action Stars of the 80ties and 90ties, you will enough white men being heroes. Yes, we had three strong female heroes, what is the problem? we also had two really stunning male fighters as well.
3. It is still something you would expect from an action movie from the beginning to the end. Lots of fighting, action and shooting. Yes, if you do not like that watch something else than Terminator.From the downsides. Yes, for me Dani was also not so convincing as a Sarah Connor had been in T2.The transition from damsel in distress to heroine did not convince me too much and somehow there was something missing which made her the person that was targeted by the Terminator.All in all, it is a nice watch.

The original Terminator is a great movie, no doubt. It still stands up as the best of its genre, like the first Alien. The second was, like the second Alien film, an exercise in taking it from sci-fi horror to sci-fi action to gain a much wider audience, even though it's not as good a movie it was incredibly successful. Since then it's been a bumpy road of rewriting the history within the movies to keep things moving, Dark Fate isn't the worst, it's actually pretty good as an action movie, Genisys is the worst, followed by Salvation, Dark Fate then Rise of the Machines.

Yeah they killed off John Connor, yeah they made the heroes female. So what! It was fun to watch. I think people look for deep meanings in movies, and then get disappointed when the movie doesn't live up to their expectations. Sometimes you have to relax. It's not meant to be a serious topical drama, or a historical document. It wont pose any serious questions, nor answer any.I'm not great at technical reviews, so here's some stuff in a list. You might agree. Or not.There were some cringe moments -
""I keep my phone in a chip bag to block the signal""Poor explanation of why John was killed.Poor explanation of why Carl's wife hasn't questioned his Terminator-ship....but every movie has cringe or weak parts.Cool stuff :
The resistance dropship with crazy 4 independent engines""Octopus"" terminatorsLiquid metal over a metal endoskeleton that can split into two TerminatorsAugmented human. Much better than the one in T4.Carl. Great lines!! The drape conversation alone!!The augmented Grace gave enough backstory of her future-self, to give relevance to her involvement in this story, and the future of mankind.Slicing the fly.

So it is fair to say it is a sequel to a 90's film.

Minus 3 stars for the instant transition of Dani into a battle commander and the ludicrous ending battle scene. I was actually bored and wanted to fast-forward through it.
Plus 3 stars for having Linda Hamilton. She was the class, and star, of the movie.
Plus 2 stars for having Arnold and his work in the film.
Plus 1 star for having kept the theme's music, which I enjoyed.
Plus 2 stars for Mackenzie Davis work. She would have been a much better choice for the ""Sarah"" role.

There seems to be this growing faction of fans that are physically unable to say anything positive about something they have already deemed bad before even watching.When you give a movie one star, you're literally giving it the worst possible rating, deeming it unwatchable. The worst of the worst. Movies that are so bad, one is unable to find one redeeming quality.I give Terminator Dark Fate 7.5 but am bumping it up to offset the ignorance if others giving it a one star rating.

Dark Fate represents a nice return to form for the franchise after Salvation and Genysis (I liked Rise of the Machines so STFU) and does really good at getting thr franchise back on track. Its fairly similar to T2 in terms of plot and story which some could see as lazy and I would have done some things differently but from what I saw I liked. The new cast of characters were really good, The legion Terminator was a really convincing baddie and the young girl or the new Sarah Connor did extremely well for a relatively new actress.

Terminator: Dark Fate is faithful to the franchise and is an action-packed entertaining movie. Period.
It's good to see Linda Hamilton again. And they even made Arnold's character work. Weakly, but they did it.

766,tonysobon,Terminator reboot not sequel.....,5,13 December 2020,"This one is not as bad as the last 2 or 3 i get confused on the name and order of this franchises movies now.It's basically what Disney did to Star Wars only at least they didn't give a bait and switch with bringing back the old characters to try to tie in a new set of movies...............o wait yeah they did do just that...............A lot of people of an issue with females playing the roles normally that would be for a man but i can get past that part of it. At the same time Arn-OLD is just that , to old to be playing this part and same with bringing back Sarah Conner(linda Hamilton). I will say she still can somewhat play the role but her real life age shows and makes it hard to really believe she would be able to do the things she does at her age.This was suppose to be a true sequel to T2 but i call BS on that since basically everything from T! and T2 plot was stopped and just replaced by a different company. That part of the storyline is just sad and makes it like the first 2 movies didn't matter and in to many ways kinda makes this movies plot not matter since it's clear they are just going to use the troupe ""where there is a will there is way"" and even if this movie spawned sequels it's clear how it would turn out without having to sit through the movies and then have another reboot making this storyline not matter. It's crazy that either they didn't think people wouldn't figure this out or just don't care.Again forgive me because it's hard to remember the titles of of all these movies but for me T1 and T2 and the one where Arnold comes back to save a young man John Conner are the only ones that should be watched. I know the 3rd one i'm talking about didn't go over great for fans but for me that one at least followed the original storyline and i basically look at it as a bonus flim if your a really big fan of the first 2.Overall with all said i do also want to point out the ""bad terminator in this one just looks and feels off , he looks and acts like a model and less menacing then any other. I mean he looks more like a boyband member then a terminator.There is enough action and since it does basically just kinda redo the first 2 movies it's not unwatchable but not something you pay to see and watch when it's on TV and your bored. It doesn't help also that T2 was so well done that it holds up to this day very very well. If younger viewers had not seen T2 and watched this first if you went back and watched again basically the same plot i think you would still like T2 better even tho it's an old movie by now.",Terminator - Dark Fate
767,superartstudio,Character building is too weak,5,22 March 2021,"Dani has been pushed around all the time and did almost nothing. This is not a problem consider she still got no clue when she was targeted, but she talks big which makes her kind of annoying.Grace has very questionable plan, she came back, attacked a bunch of normal guys, and just wanted to hide Dani away. And when Dani refused, she could not think of anything else.Old Sara is a good character, but T800 sending an old lady killing terminators while he's selling curtains is a bit hilarious. Rev 9 is too smart in searching targets but too poor at using weapons. And I still can't figure out what's the benefit of having the skeleton form, liquid form is way more powerful and flexible. Also I don't understand why T800 and alike don't destroy skeleton form once and for all when it's separated, it's obviously too weak to brutal force. Maybe destroying it would make dev 9 even stronger?Also, as an Asian male, I'm seriously offended by the lack of Asian characters in this movie. There are Latinos, whites people as main characters, and some black people, but no Asian faces are there. Is it because Asians don't fit in military theme?

I liked the humorous dialog and the occasional look that made me smile or chuckle. Too many movies today are a jarring amalgam of action and farcical comedy. No thanks. I'll take my action comedy dry, thank you.
It was great having Arnold and Linda back, and honestly, they had all the funny parts. Mackenzie, Natalia, and Gabriel were fantastic. Though a much smaller part Diego Boneta made an impact as Dani's brother.
I would also acknowledge the cinematography, but bad editing is all that kept me from a 10.
Gabriel's Rev9 and Mackenzie's Augment stole the show, for me, with Sarah and the T800 as a solid second line of defense. Man, if I'm calling in the Cavalry, I chose Arnold and Linda!
Grace, the Augment, had 3 phenomenal fights. The sledgehammer scene, and the toolbox smash had me HYPED. But Grace dressed in black with that Chain is my sexuality!
I watched it 4 times. Each time awed by the fights. And smiled at the same lines.

770,fromTull,I choose the evil Terminator. All day.,3,18 March 2020,"Stop me if you've heard this one. There's three women in a truck. A half organic les'bun. A gun lovin' granny. And a Mex'can. . .we've got ALMOST everyone packed in here. Besides an interesting and relatable character.
Yeah, THATS how weird it is when an old white dude tries to be the voice and savior for groups who have their own voices and didn't ask him to be theirs.
Yeah, it's a James Cameron pic, so it's very ""extra"", and attempts to accommodate everyone (everyone). Almost everyone (excluding white guys and the Cherokee nation).
Action is good, film looks great, but anyone who gives this film more than 3 stars (and that's generous) is either out of touch or out of their minds. It was a chore, to be honest. The hype from part 2 is silly because now it seems John Connor was of no importance, EVER. New timeline, new rules. We just had a new Terminator movie five minutes ago and with this addition to the franchise the story is so fragmented its laughable. The cringey call back lines didn't help. Mackenzie Davis as the heroine (putting on that fake husky voice) is horrible. I know people will hate me for this, but with these all female casts, I don't feel that adrenaline rush because I can't invest in it. I'm not afraid of them and I don't fear for them. I know they're safe from harm and I know they're good people which makes them boring. This isn't a choice, it just feels like the stakes are higher with guys (maybe because of their violence and they're morally questionable?) The evil terminator in this one does a great job and the film gains tension whenever he's on the screen. The rest of the time it's just thinly veiled SJW speak (get ready for social commentary on immigration, male and female dynamics and metoo moments). Along with laughable situations (granny get your rocket launcher). Every post-menopausal woman I know is at risk for Osteoporosis and broken bones, not out breaking Terminators, but I guess this IS FANTASY. Another problem, I love a diversified cast, but it's having the opposite effect of what was intended by becoming a distraction instead of unifying. Ensembles in films today don't feel organic, they feel PLANNED instead. Like the producers have to tick off every box and thus, it's too perfect to be a reflection of reality. Ghostbusters? meh. Batwoman? Nah. Charlie's Angels? HA! Charmed? Meh. Now Marvel has a transgender character coming out, and Buffy is being rebooted as African American. Taken separately I love these ideas, but as one onslaught it just feels like 'Attack of the Tryhards'. Movie Gods please make this stop.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I agree with other reviewers that the reboot is bizarre and this series has long gotten to the point of trying to squeeze blood from a stone.No fault of the actors, this movie suffers from plot holes, a bad script and strange but also boring and predictable synopsis. Nothing we haven't seen before already; this entire film suffers from the ""paper-thin disguise"" trope. The new advanced robot vilain, which is supposedly unbeatable (character Grace says you run from it), makes unwise, unstealthy decisions again and again. Isn't conserving energy and avoiding contact with witnesses and being seen on cameras basic tenants of being a successful, undetected hunter?I was going to pass on this but ended up watching on Hulu for the CGI and fight/chase sequences.

a grocery carrying ,dog petting guy who sits with his legs crossed like a gay fashion designer.Now for the leads Linda Hamilton is still bad ass but there's a new protector from the future a very unlikeable butch lesbian terminator oh sorry a augmented feminist woman.

774,A-Finn,Proper Sequel? Meh.,5,16 November 2019,"To be fair, this movie only proves that any attempt to follow up James Cameron's finest works is futile. In spite of the superiority over its previous 'terminators', this Dark Fate does not surpass Cameron's very first two-finest-prequels(?); I believe Tim Miller didn't attempt to beat his predecessors' work, he's just directing the ruined story (ironically, Cameron ruined his own original story) he chose to direct; thus, Miller's work is not really futile. I did enjoy the spectacle. James Cameron and David S. Goyer are responsible for the whole dejavus they put in this one. Then again (if we must) who's to blame? It's nobody's fault . Let's just blame it on Holliwood. lol.And then again, the intensity and the depth of this sequel never reach the level of the first two movies. Despite the ruined story, I was so pleased by this so-called 'proper sequel' as a standalone action film. If you're a Terminator fan, I suggest you to not expect too much from this one or else you're gonna get disappointed.

Why, if you're going to make a Terminator movie do you use the same formula over and over and over again that has not really worked well since Terminator 2?Super advanced and now deadlier machine comes back from the future intent on killing someone. The Resistance, whatever that is, sends a protector to save the day and mayhem ensues, there is a ton of collateral damage, wrecked vehicles, dead bodies, crashed planes, helicopters all that the authorities never seem to notice.Its a formula that FIVE of the six Terminator movies have followed. Some better than others.People crapped all over Salvation. Fine. The only thing is at least they had the wherewithal to try something different delving into the machine war and getting into The Resistance a little bit and how it was all put together.This movie is fine. I question the decision to kill off John Connor in the manner he was I think its was absolutely silly and just a plot device to get Arnold into this movie. How the hell would the T-800 find them hiding in Mexico? Who knows.. its never stated. If Cyberdyne systems was destroyed and the August 29, 1997 Judgement Day was stopped, why would there still be a T-800 at all? All of this is brushed over.There is a new evil machine computer company that did what Cyberdyne Systems was going to do and its called Legion and THEY now carry out Judgement Day. Which is still called Judgement Day. They have some new kinds of Terminators, which will remind you of the TX from Rise of the Machines except this one has the ability to split itself into two pieces, a liquid like the T-1000, and an exoskeleton, which actually is kind of cool.It was great seeing Linda Hamilton back as Sarah Connor and oince you get passed the John Connor killing, it was great to see what a Terminator does when it completes its mission. What do they do? Shut down? We all know they cant self terminate and despite this T-800 being one of the most wanted fugitives on the planet has managed to carve out a nice little life for itself. That was awesome to see and really should have been fleshed out more. I would have loved a 2 hour movie just on the Terminator living its life after its mission.The movie is fine. Its a well made action movie. The biggest flaw is we have seen it all before, no matter how many new abilities they give the killer machine or the protector.The problem is they should have tried something new with the franchise. There are endless possibilities from this world than just to simply recycle the same thing that's been done so many times before.",Terminator - Dark Fate

This is little more than a desperate rehash of former glories. Linda Hamilton is utterly one-dimensional and looks like she wandered in from comic-con on short notice. Arnie is a terminator coming of retirement one last time - which looks true for both this film and life in general. I like Arnie, but it's over.The other characters, like the story, are by the numbers copies of ""bad terminator"", ""protector"" and ""the future of humanity"" with a little woke culture and a poor attempt at feminism.The CGI is obvious, but still feels more ""real"" than a lot of the script.

785,DelphinusMinor,I gave it a chance.,1,19 January 2020,"This is a real life quote by the actress that plays Grace tells you all you need to know about the movie and her motivations for doing it. White man bad! See quote below.""As a viewer, I'm personally less interested in the damaged, white, middle-class male figuring out his dreams and more interested in maybe an underdog figuring out how they're going to survive in a world that doesn't necessarily invite them in."" - Mackenzie DavisOf course her character does the most damage to cops, specifically white cops. Imagine hanging around this kid in real life? Analyzing everything and whining about everything.The first twenty minutes of the movie was almost entirely in Spanish(With sub titles). Thing is, sub titles in the theatre are distracting. They are okay for a few moments but when they are constantly necessary you tend to miss a lot of visuals in the movie. There is a small novel worth of subtitles. It goes on like this thru the whole movie, which is a total dud anyway. Terrible writing, no character connections. But wait, calm down, I have no issue with any of the Spanish but the primary demographic watching this will likely be English speaking. So why not have the actors speak English and to get that South American east Los Angeles vibe using Spanish accents?I am so disappointed with this pile of trash.

786,phildexter,Pointless and poorly executed.,1,28 October 2019,"CGI to the max, was liking watching a video game for half the film with characters flying around the screen and over the top stunts. Nothing compared to T1 and T2. Even the music was diabolical, generic and barely stood out. The character or Grace was excellent and Sarah and Arnold were ok. Offered nothing new ans just rehashed T1 and T2 in a very poor manor. I literally couldn't wait for it to end. This makes the other sequels look good, and they were terrible.",Terminator - Dark Fate

788,etmachina,Best entry in a while. Exceeds expectations.,7,12 April 2021,"I really wanted to like T Genisys, but it goes off the rails. Dark Fate really doesn't. Just strong action sequences all the way thru to the end. Linda Hamilton owns her scenes. I had my doubts, just a ""legacy"" casting gesture? Nope. Mackenzie Davis as well. I was already a fan of hers from Halt & Catch Fire. IMO she's a great actress, very emotive, and she's great in all the action scenes. Dani Ramos isn't the most compelling character, but Natalia Reyes does a fine job as well, no complaints.Putting three female characters as the leads might smack of lip-service to trending social issues, but this is how to do it. It's not heavy-handed, it's not calling attention to itself constantly. Believable bad-asses. Largely due to LH and MD. The scene in the border detention facility is another obvious reference to current social issues, but it similarly exceeded expectations. It's not overplayed or heavy-handed. It doesn't drag. It's just a good scene.MD's ""augmented"" character is basically a stand-in for the traditional ""good/reprogrammed"" Terminator, or Kyle Reese in the first movie. This allows for a bit more emotional development between the characters. Just enough, they don't overdo it. Sarah Connor is exactly the same character as in T2 - tough as nails. I appreciated it.I also appreciate that for the first time the whole concept of Skynet, of a computer network that becomes self-aware, is actually borne out in the plot. The Terminator/REV-9 can tie into internet and GPS satellite infrastructure. This is a frequent plothole in many of the previous movies, as the Terminators wander around far more clueless than you'd think, given such abilities and the whole concept of Skynet (or ""Legion"").Finally, also want to give points to Gabriel Luna, who is stony-faced one moment, fluent in Spanish when needed, then pulling off a surprisingly good Texas/Southern drawl the next. Fun. Reminded me of Robert Patrick in T2, the dichotomy between stony-faced Terminator one moment then slipping into a just slightly-off impersonation of a human. Good job. Arnold is here as always of course as well, but what's to say about that, he can do this role in his sleep at this point.From best to worst, I'd honestly put this right behind T1 and T2. It's def better than T3, Salvation, or Genisys.",Terminator - Dark Fate

The action and story were good, so why get medieval on a movie review?If anyone was expecting for the Terminator series to follow some kind of cannon, too bad.

The acting, story, well placed action and the emotion. DF has way to much action as if to cover up the fact that the writing and flow were atrocious here. It's 2020 now, Hollywood should know better. Fast, unrealistic movements makes for HORRIBLE visuals. Don't overdo it!!Why was Mackenzie Davis's character Grace in this movie? Just pointless. Gabriel Lunas Terminator did not have the menacing presence of the T800 in the first 2 movies. Natalia Reyes was not convincing in any sort as this world savior. Horrible decisions on all those parts.Now the part that hurts me the most. Linda Hamilton was the LIFE of T1 and T2, for her to come back and the creators not give this movie the blood, sweat and tears of living up to the first 2 is just infuriating. Did they even try??? No way in hell should Arnold or Linda have signed up for this crap, it's so disrespectful to them and what they gave and left for the world to enjoy for decades in T1 and T2.

793,BennyTV,Terminator Terminates the Terminator... genre.,5,27 October 2019,"No one is talking about the obvious paradox... creating this movie erases T1 and T2, therefore how THE Eff, is this a ""direct sequel"". Yea I know that was the point; but really, its a bad idea for soo many reasons...At least those movies still exist in the real world and are forever cemented in history. Second ""Paradox""... if every terminator sequel is considered terrible.. at least they were worthy of the title ""Terminator"" because, well... the term is just synonymous. If you go up to anyone on the street over 7 and say ""Skynet, t-1000, John Connor, Sarah Connor or cyberdyne systems model 101..."" we all know what you are talking about. I didn't feel much of the SJW, i don't care if the savior of mankind is male or female, who gives a hoot... but WHY terminate the name ""Skynet"", why Terminate the name Connor? Thats what makes me LOVE THE INSTALLMENTS. The basic law of time travel that propelled all Terminator movies... from T1 to chronicles... they all follow this basic rule. A future war, a solution, an ""if, then, else"" response by the machines, a delay, and a loop. The grandfather paradox is better known as the Terminator paradox- thats how much this pop culture icon effected our planet. The least you could have done, JAMES... was at least have ""grace"" know the name, ""Sarah Connor"" (who clearly never heard that name) because, you know, the whole ending is based on the fact that ""Dani"" will be the new ""John""... to be raised and become the future Awesome savior in Johns name. how does the future not know of the past? How does Dani NEVER mention Sarah to Grace? Shame on you James Cameron. This was the least time-travel themed ""Terminator"" movie/episode, idea, EVER. Shame. Also, just... WTF? John Connor mowed down In the opening scene? Laughable. Would be a better movie without the ret-con. Also, are we supposed to know Major Dean?

The first Terminator 3 was okay, but nowhere near as good as the first two. Salvation was good, in the sense of being a breath of fresh air. But it was nothing special. While Genisys was horrid, Dark Fate is even worse. Yes. Dark Fate is trying so hard to be good, and while it technically is better than most of the previous films, it's actually the worst Terminator film of all time. It's also the worst movie of 2019. Why?Because for starters, if you were expecting anything but another watered down Terminator 2, prepared to be disappointed. It is literally just Terminator 2, but it's horrible. It has none of the same charm. But, worst of all, it completely mucks up and ruins Terminator 2.

They look like remastered T2 scenes, punctuated by every action tropes under the sun since that movie came out.Still, it could pass as an entertaining flick if it wasn't tanked by liberal ideology and overall lazy writing. The characters are so shallow and their arcs so unbelievable that I ended up rooting for the villain. It's as if the producers thought the movie would be good as long as they could fill it with women and minorities, as if these characters wouldn't need any kind of proper writing and development.This is despicable but all too common nowadays, where signaling social justice virtue seems to take the place of making enjoyable movies as the primary motive behind productions.Oh, and don't get me started on all of the inexplicable holes in the movie. It's like the writer redefines the rules of the technology in each scene to conveniently move the plot forward.Four stars for the special effects team, the performance of Mckenzie Davis, and Schwarzy still kicking it.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I mean instead of hitting with bazooka, How about HCl bomb? or some other chemical.
We have cut diamond and other metals. I mean there must be a chemical which can eat terminator metal or nano bots which can reprogram terminator by attacking with virus?
Seriously, still attacking with bb gun, How is that helpful? Grace could have brought two power course from start?Also how did the robot knew to send Mexican terminator in Mexico? Why not a Indian terminator in Mexico? Why did the legion decided to make small 5 ft 6 inch terminator and not 7 ft hulk?Also has legion heard about drones?

802,johndavidson-1,"A retread, but worth watching one last time",7,30 October 2019,"I've no illusions here. This is largely a rehash of the original with a slight twist on the plot and the inclusion of Sarah Connor as well as the Arnie terminator provides a nostalgic nod towards the first two movies.The opening sequence which reveals the death of John Connor at the hands of another Arnie terminator , post judgement day, is spent too quickly and too cheaply. It smacks what it is... a plot driver.. And could have been dealt with much more elegantly.
As it is it does much to unravel the first two movies, rather like Alien3 did to Aliens, without adding to the Sarah Connor character in any meaningful way.
The eventual meeting between Sarah and the retired Arnie terminator is telegraphed and underwhelming. For a character previously driven mad with grief in previous movies she takes this too neatly in her stride. A better movie would have pitched her as a more complex and conflicted hero and made her a threat to the eventual happy ending.The action sequences are what saves the film from utter irrelevance.
Although once again the near psychic ability for the new fangled terminator to find its prey is hampered by it being dumb as a sack of rocks.

806,hsarikayaa,Retired terminator movie was fun,8,3 November 2019,"I just read the bad comments and they are right in terms of how the last 3 movie was made to serve holywood kind of products more and to make money. If you try to dig the movie more and ask questions like ''do characters make sense?'' ''how is the plot evolved'' or ''is it anything like the first trilogy?'' and so on so forth, the answers are most likely negative. So why 8 starts is my decision? Because eventhough lots of things bothered me while i was watching like others, I decided just to have fun and i did. I mean retired terminator living with his family in the woods sounds funny doesn't it? Action scenes were so good even with lots of cg. It was the best movie after the first 3 ones. I apparaciate it.

I did not like any of the characters, except for Sarah Connor herself and don't get me started on Arnold's Terminator in this movie. The film just feels like a 'been there done that', with nothing new and the story has been convoluted in such a way that it's best to just ignore this much like Salvation and Genisys.Another franchise ruined, I'd say just watch the first two films and even Terminator 3 is not a bad watch and then skip the rest.

809,Billybobble1,"CGI first, story second",6,25 January 2020,"One thing I have to say about this movie is in the opening scene, some characters look like they did from T2, the sfx for that small scene are incredible, just incredible.Now moving on, I am a fan of the Terminator fiction, it's been a slowly sliding scale since the first one but I have never felt appalled by the sequels, not like the Predator sequels (apart from Predators which was okay). It is true you do have to let a lot of storytelling slide to not be offended their continuation of the franchise.Unfortunately the longer this movie continued the harder it gets to accept the story it is trying to tell. For visuals it is pretty spectacular but as a keen gamer, good graphics do not equal a good game.I try to go into movies with as little knowledge as possible and I was surprised to see James Cameron's name in the credits as a writer. I would imagine the holes in the story were known in the production but were glossed over by trying to immerse the viewer in the action and explosions, I would say they were moderately successful in this respect. These days I kind of accept a movie like this will be style over substance, it's a shame and review scores reflect this. If it makes money though don't expect this to change. The cynical side of me thinks having a hispanic flavour is to appeal to a wider audience regardless of if the story is up to par. I think ericck90 did a good summary with his 3/10 review 'We did this'. Like Judgement Day, this kind of production is inevitable.The first two minutes is well worth watching just for the jaw dropping effects, beyond that I stand by 6/10, you can watch it but you'll soon forget it.",Terminator - Dark Fate
810,jameskidac,A big fiction roller coaster that doesn't pretend to know all the answers!,8,31 October 2019,"This show is typically casted, with strong women and killer men. The action was fantastic, watching all of them beat the living crap out of each other. However, the attributes of the strong women are pretty generic in the sense if you have lived in a military camp, you can see every soldier has that trait. For it to only be the women in the poster means either all the guys got preoccupied with cyborgs and forgot basic survival instinct, or their brains melted.I mean the lead who is supposed to be the next big thing, she is so underwhelming it is sad because we have current lady leaders much stronger than that, and risk their lives and don't look like a deer lost in headlights but the show designated her to be the one so it is. However, that's why the title is fiction and fantasy, which is great fun. In the future when Hollywood figures out how to make real leaders who happen to be female (i.e. Aliens, Lara Croft) it will be even better because right now I honestly think they don't really develop the characters as they did a Sarah Conner, or Ripley, its just so plastic. And the problem is if these plastics are the only hope we have against cyborgs, we are doomed. Most of the time they survive through sheer luck, and movie magic, nothing to do with leadership.

Good, because it would have been a complete waste of time for anyone to sit through this two hours of torture. There is no emotional connection with anyone except Arnold Schwarzenegger's character. My second mistake in the last two months was to purchase this movie on Vudu than to rent. What a waste and a complete disgrace to my movie library in Vudu. Can I get a refund please Vudu?Sarah Connor has no code of conduct when it comes to language and she loves her potato chips, but seems to be in great shape? The main character is a new comer who cannot act and is probably the beginning of the end of her career. There is no story line, no pacing, and main characters absolutely bored to the bones and waiting for a paycheck. The only positive coming out of the movie was Arnold Schwarzenegger reprising his role as the T-800.Now this review is coming from a person who loved the first three terminator movies but this franchise has been downhill after that.My advice, enjoy the first three Terminator movies, and avoid the later revisions or sequels.",Terminator - Dark Fate

814,Rageypoo,Interesting take that falls flat on its diverse face.,2,11 February 2020,"So obviously this film is filled with social and political correctness, the typical SJW stuff, and while some of it would be believable, it's so obviously contrived that it pushes your suspense of disbelief to the max.It's pretty clear that the magic of the terminator is still there when Arnold shows up. His ""Carl"" character is still charming and interesting, and along with Sara has a decent dynamic albeit a bit overplayed. The idea that John was eventually killed by a T-800 and yet somehow they were still successful in stopping judgement day is really interesting to me, that there's an entirely different timeline and outcome is a pretty awesome concept really that doesn't pay off in any way.The fight scenes that were heavily CGI were not that engaging and the main character's acting just wasn't her fit, it was really unbelievable that the fate of the future relied on this woman. The big reveal had no pay off either it was a twist that made little sense and left you going ""yea right"" the rest of the movie.This terminator's new ability was more or less the same feeling, more ""yea ok"" than scary or believable. T2 gave you a sense that they finally made a terminator that was in fact unstoppable, and it had some suspense and mystery...I think the script has been so repeated and the outcomes so predictable that you just start to lose interest since you know how the story is going to end.I thought they had a really interesting story with Sara and the new T-800 but ultimately the characters surrounding the story were just not that interesting or important, though I will say Mackenzie Davis looked stunning and did a fantastic job considering the writing and the weak main character, did the best she could.If they could make a movie that didn't rely so heavily on current politics and social norms in a way that made it feel like it was its own would be far more entertaining. Movies nowdays pander to these things constantly that ultimately take away from the depth of the movie. They are so unecessary and shouldn't be a part of it. The original terminator has a woman for the hero and yet I can watch that without being force fed that all women are strong and beautiful and can do anything. Instead it took a very unlikely situation and made a powerful character that I could believe. If Hollywood could get past the SJW stuff and preachy messages they could get back to what made movies great in the first place.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Time to move on esse. This movie is exactly what the franchise needed - a soft reboot, a breath of fresh air. It is a kinda of a sequel to T2 and kinda ignores the other movies so I am not quite sure where it sits in Terminator lore but the action was solid and enjoyable.Lets be honest it does not matter anyway. Every movie with time travel creates so much confusion so I do not care anyway. I do not think that even fans can explain Terminator movies. What wanted was a bold, fast paced action movie, Humans fighting deadly machines and that is what I got so it is totally worth seeing in the cinema. The bits in future were pure honey.Linda Hamilton was really good. All the cast did really good job. The newcomers were fun to watch. Grace was athletic and it was joy to watch her in all fightinig scenes. Augmented human, what a clever idea ! Arnold was in such a good shape. Just wow.The sets and action in the first part of the movie was less CGI than in the second half but it was still fun. Large, bold explosions and very clever action sequences with new terminator were exhilarating.

823,botev1921,"Good action movie, lovely effects, totally underdeveloped",7,25 October 2019,"It's a shame that people who make Terminator movies refuse to listen to what fans want to see. T2 was great not because of its CGI or action, but because of the depth of characters and darkness of the storyline. Dark Fate is much better attempt than Genisys, or at least not as obviously repetitive, but they turned it into nothing more than an action movie. Sure, all the huge stunts and amazing effects are cool and the REV-9 is one amazing killer-machine, but there is no depth whatsoever and one can't help but feel let down and wanting to see much more about the actual characters story. It's still a decent entry into the Terminator universe and fans should enjoy it. It is easy to watch too.",Terminator - Dark Fate

825,hagner2,"Good acting, fun time, average execution, same storie, BAD decisions.",5,28 October 2019,"It's a ok flick if you look it as a stand alone movie. But for me, HUGE fan of genius James Cameron, the opening scene was a slap in the face, disrespectful, and after that, nothing could wash the bad taste. Cameron is THE BEST director, no one is at his level of cinematography and perfeccionism, but as a writer and producer, this time he screw it up very bad. In fact, he throw away his credibility stating Edward Furlong was in the movie. SAD. Tim Miller is not at the same league as Cameron. Cinematography is bad.
I'm giving 7 stars for the effort made by the crew. But as a experience for long date fans, this movie does not deserve 3-4.
Lets adress the main drawbacks:
1) Lies by the producer.
2) SAME story
3) Not so good FX
4) Bad cinematography, does not match T2.
5) WORST end of a character in history of movies. Agravated by the fact Cameron himself critisized Aliens 3 for the same reason. The opening scenes ruins the rest of the movie and even ruins the predecessors.
6) Terminator design in future war are cartoonish, not so grounded.
The goods:
1) Cast works. Even Arnold, with dificult lines, nailed it.
2) Funny. Carl is funny.
3) Grace is a good character. I would like to see more. Augmented humans are a curious concept.
4) The brief discussion about machines taking jobs of human workers.
As a fan of James Cameron I'm disappointed because this movie is nothing more than a money grabber. Go to see it if you want some inconsequential fun time.",Terminator - Dark Fate
826,hagner2,BAD DECISION,5,28 October 2019,"Cameron, I love you, man. You are a master in your craft. You are the best. But you know, I know, that you screwed up hard this time.

I'm glad I did because of all the Terminator movies I would rank it third behind the original and T2. It's a spectacular Terminator Battle Royale with comedy and even some Terminator chivalry. I think a lot of the negative comments are coming from men whose manhood is challenged by females in leading roles. Come on guys we're just putting your insecurities on display. Great flick so glad I checked it out.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Obviously, the original director is taking this in the direction he had originally intended and has ""omitted"" the other sequels.
I loved this movie. Special effects were excellent, it offered a great storyline for an update taking place in 2020, (instead of a cop, the protagonist shapeshifts into a border patrol agent) and it followed the winning formula of ""new robot-new abilities.""",Terminator - Dark Fate

833,Dark-Wolverine,Thanks for destroying the franchise,6,16 November 2019,"For starters, I'm a huge fan of 1st two movies. The 1st was great,the 2nd was a masterpiece, 3rd was good, the 4th was a different,yet a good one and the 5th sucked. The trailers of this didn't bring an appeal to me,yet I had some hope for this.I am let down. Even the involvement of James Cameron wasn't enough to save this.
Pros:
The first truck chaseLinda HamiltonRev-9Arnold's arcCons:
The messed up timeline:At the beginning of this movie,they changed the entire timeline and again,messed it up.The cliché plotThe new characters: the newbies were mostly meh, there wasn't anything that was interesting in themArnold's arc: yes, it was a pro factor but,his arc was really limited. You can't even get to know him much and the new concept he had in his arc wasn't well explained.The Terminator design: Rev-9 was an interesting character,but,his design was too CGI. There wasn't any reality to that.The action: apart from the beginning,the action scenes were mehless Terminators: for the 6th instalment of this franchise,they only involved 3 Terminators.So,this was my take on Dark Fate.
I would not suggest this as a must watch, even to the fans.",Terminator - Dark Fate

835,Devils_advocake,Girl Power!!!,7,25 October 2019,"There is no fate, apart from that which we make for ourselves, or that which the makers of the terminator franchise keeps churning out for us!It's an enjoyable flick, that just ignores the presence of those that came after T2. In essence it's an attempt to make T3 with a twist. It works if you keep an open mind (and forget the other 3 movies since T2).It follows the same old concept as others - one terminator and one protector come back to save a future human leader. The leads are all female which was refreshing but I wasn't keen on Natalia Reye's character, just found her squeaky voice slightly annoying.Great to see LH & Arnie get rolled out together in a terminator flick, that pretty much was the highlight of movie for me. Apart from that it's run of the mill, nothing you've not seen before (unless you've never seen a terminator movie). Loads of CGI, some cool fight sequences etcAll in all its worth a watch but sadly it's one you'll of forgotten about within a month (much like salvation and genisys - yeah you'd forgotten about those hadn't you!! ;) ). It gets a 7 for the presence of LH and AS on screen, without that I dunno, I probably wouldn't of gone to see it in the first place!",Terminator - Dark Fate

838,andyhise,"Wow, am *I* swimming against the tide here ...",9,7 November 2019,"Oh how angry everybody is about this one. But I'm one of the original TERMINATOR fans, saw it a dozen times in the 80s. And I went to the premiere of T2, had ticket 00001 in fact, given to me by the British distributor (long story). So I've been a Terminator fan (James Cameron version, not the rest although T3 ROTM was half decent, especially the ending) for 35 years now. Crikey.And yes, I squirmed at the female-empowerment overload. This has upset many reviewers on IMDb, and having not, one, not two but three female protagonists does smack of PC tokenism. Plus, in an era of Hollywood de-ageing, Linda Hamilton in TDF looks like she's been digitally super-aged. I don't think the 4K Blu-ray will be particularly kind to her. Maybe it was some sort of timeline thing that I missed...But I didn't mind the early shocker, which sent some of the fan boys incandescent with rage. I just wanted the movie to give me a decent explanation for it, which - to be fair- it really didn't. The whole goodbye Skynet hello Legion thing seemed a bit arbitrary to me, and it's never explained with anything like the clarity of exposition which the previous, Cameron-canon Terminators gave us.So, up till now, it's a four out of ten, right?But I just wanted it to tell me a story, show me new things, surprise me, give me some proper canon moments, and damn it I wanted a big old factory at the end where it's all resolved.I got all of that. There's a succession of good SFX set pieces, original chunks of spectacular peril, delivered without TOO much unlikely superhuman ridiculousness. The whole crashing plane > giant dam section was great. Maybe I come across as being easily pleased, but believe me I'm not. After seeing probably 2,000 films in my life, I have a pretty fine-tuned rubbish-ometer and it simply didn't sound the alarm this time.Plus, hooray we did end up in a factory, and I was glad we left all the Tex-Mex stuff behind before the end.Acting-wise, Annie was reassuringly wooden, just as he always is, Natalia Reyes rather bland, Gabriel Luna was charismatic and has a good look and, as I said, Linda Hamilton was just absurdly masculine and wrinkled to hell. In fact, the whole thing was a little bit LGBT, if you factor in the androgynous Mackenzie Davis - although hers is the star turn by a mile.I had a great time with it. It's way too violent for kids, which is another plus in my book. It's a proper R-rating, and apart from a few sly Arnie moments it doesn't pander to the DEADPOOL generation with unneccesarily snarky humour. It's a pretty serious meal.So I'm giving it a nine - and I'm sorry for the one out of ten brigade. Shame you weren't on board with me x",Terminator - Dark Fate

841,aj1218,"The third ""Terminator 3"" fails for the same reason the other 2 did",4,2 November 2019,"This is the 3rd attempt at creating a trilogy of terminator movies after T2. It fails and it fails for the same reason the other two did, the theme is wrong. The original 2 movies were made with a theme that it is our humanity that will save us from the machines and it is our humanity that makes us strong. In the original the only reason John Connar exists is because Sarah has a very human moment and sleeps with Kyle. The future of humanity succeeds because she is human, and does a normal human thing and becomes a mother. In T2 they deconstruct it a little bit. Sarah Connar has almost sacrificed her entire humanity to protect John. She acts more like a machine than Arnold does, and it all comes to ahead when she nearly kills an innocent to save the future...but she doesn't. She can't kill a man in front of her family. She can't do it and after that she scene she slowly regains her humanity, and it is her love and connection that allows her to fight for the future...Because what is a future if we lose our humanity... The original 2 still hold up to this day because those themes are so strong. This is why James Cameron has said multiple times that terminator ended after T2 and that the praise he gave the other movies was to help his friends make money.This movie says leave those themes lets make everyone badass and subvert expectations in order to reboot the franchise... This movie is a cold calculated cash grab that comes from the Hollywood machine and it shows. The studio is Skynet, putting all the supposed right pieces together to make what should be a passable movie, but fails because it has no soul.As for the politics displayed in the movie. Nothing is inherently wrong with having politics in movies, but when they are on the hot button topics of the day, it will horribly date this movie. The illegal border crossing and other jabs at the current political situation will seem VERY dated in 2 to 5 years. Timeless sci fi movies from Alien to Bladerunner don't touch those with a ten foot pole for obvious reasons. Traditional Science Fiction deals with larger issues normally about the nature of technology and humanity. This doesnt make the movie bad, but it hurts it because it is done so poorly.
*Spoilers Below*The movie starts out with some great special effects and some amazing deaging on both Sarah and John. It occurs after T2 and the world appears to be safe. Until a random Arnold shows up, kills John and then just leaves...This opens a lot of plot holes but I won't nitpick that. It kills the past. Just to kill the past.Enter Danny, She has same problem that a lot of current female protagonists have in today's cinema... She has no flaws. She helps the family, is the best at her job, she criticizes her boss and doesn't have any character issues. She is superwoman and hard to relate to because she is a strong independant woman that don't need no man... The sad part is this makes her more of a robot than most characters. In a franchise that is supposed to be about the things that make us human save us from technology, she is the worst type of protagonist.Grace could have been a good character, but she doesnt get enough development. I really dont have to many negative things to say about her because the other characters are so glaringly bad.The new terminator is a bit of a joke. This is the first ugly terminator and the least cool one. He has very similar powers to the T1000 except he can make a clone of himself. It is cool but what makes most terminators creepy is that uncanny valley that they have. The way the T1000 crooks his neck before stabbing someone, the robotic English of the T800, even the other two T3s had better terminators that shared this ability... This one lacks it.Arnold and Sarah are poorly used in this movie. The story of the years between T2 and this movie would have made far better Terminator movies than what we got. The T800 slowly learning what it is to become human and learning to be a parent and father would be a good movie and a good counterpoint. It would be like going from Ender's Game to Speaker for the Dead. Two polar opposite books that involve the same characters. Sarah's story would not be as good because she would throw away the character progression she made in T2 and become that unloving killing machine that she becomes in this movie... It is a lot of wasted money and potential in those two.The plot is all over the place. We get a new evil corporations, because reasons. We dabble into the current crisis at the border for reasons. Sarah by herself somehow manages to defeat Skynet because reasons. Arnold has been able to text and message Sarah because reasons (Sarah lets a stranger tell her what to do for 30 years because reasons) We have to go visit Arnold because reasons. Arnold suddenly has more human emotions despite not being reprogrammed because reasons. And it goes on and on.Summary, this movie is a piss poor when it comes to story and themes. The action scenes are well done and the effects are good, cinematography is adequat (this is the only reason it gets a 4, it is a technically well made movie). But all the technical ability cant save you from a poor story. I have never wished more for a terminator to kill a protagonist.

Not perfect (the Mexican girl could've been given more depth, to name something) but no other sequel was perfect either. Cheesy, corny, yeah, but so were the others. The acting was good, there was some nostalgia (Linda and Arnie back in) and a lot of action reminiscent of T1 and T2. I was surprised at all the hate reviews.

It has been implemented with care and the characters are all quite likeable and feel like they got genuine motives driving them. I don't feel like the 1 star reviews are justified at all.Have you peeps forgotten how bad the last 2 terminator movies were? They were really quite painful in comparison to this.This movie is basically an endless long chase, and I'm personally missing a few beats that reveal more about the villain that the characters are facing. The bad guy is rather mute - and after the overly rambly villains in the previous two movies this is definitely appreciated - but lacks depth and a sense of true agency because of this.The story is quite predictable. The new terminator terminates, rather than infiltrating. I've always liked that about the original movies, where characters had no idea who they were really dealing with, creating a bit of paranoia in the process.Still, wouldn't mind to see more of this branch of the Terminator universe.",Terminator - Dark Fate

The unimaginative new feature is the decoupling of humanoid form from the hardwire that constitutes the REV-9, but that may have worked with resulting function-loss, making it a bit less invincible.

When I heard that there was a new Terminator movie coming out, I was so excited especially with Cameron attached to it. I totally disregarded the other sequels, remake, reboot et al after T2.T2 was an awesome sequel because of the complex human relationships and the clear and loud message of hope for the future. In T:DF, John Connor is killed by the T model that saved him in T2. What the?? Such a disrespectful way to show that this movie will be nothing like the originals but then to follow the very same formula except let's add in the 21st Century movements such as metoo and cultural representation.Sarah Connor (played by magnificent Hamilton) was iconic and should have been enough. T:DF however needed to bring in a female cyborg (Davies) as well as a female protagonist (Reyes) and Connor. Once the CGI action started, it was all about that. Reyes was quite wooden for someone who had just lost two family members - one where she actually witnessed their demise and for someone who is destined to be an important leader, she wasn't really bothered to ask a tonne of questions.It was too much for me to go any further, even for Arnold to show up. It wasn't just the feminism angle or the casting of ethnic actors with limited range that made it unbearable, it was the attempt at trying to retell a story that didn't need it all. I have no idea why Cameron wrote it as these days he's clearly more into deep sea diving and its technology development rather than movie making - perhaps he's lost it due to one too many dives.I will eventually watch the whole thing but am not holding my breath.

This is normally a good thing , there's a good chance I'll enjoy it, but this Terminator deserved any and every criticism, as a stand alone it was at best mediocre, as a key part of the franchise, it brings about it's demise.
There was nothing fresh in this. Most of the action seemed to be a cut and paste of 1 & 2, but now the terminator seemed to be able to fly, divide into 2, and grow tentacles; probably to appeal to the Marvel fan or the hard of thinking.
I've seen and enjoyed the new Bladerunner and, The Martian, but for the life of me I don't recall Davis. Here in a main role, she really doesn't impress. Initially see seems to affect a Robot-y demeanor, which is odd as she is an(enhanced) human, maybe its her acting style or bad direction.
Much worse though is Hamilton's role, I like and respect Hamilton but she should have given this a miss, to resurrect her character after nearly 40 years was just wrong. It was like they were dragging round a senile bad-ass granny, it was as if she has become a parody of herself. But it wasn't really her fault entirely, she had been given some of the most cringe worthy, cliched cheesy lines in movie history. Arnie turns up, but adds little more than his name.
The other protaganists I barely remember.
In T2 Robert Patrick was a frightening and relentless Terminator,scary. Arnie forged an ersatz parent child relationship. These aspects reached out and connected with the viewer. I felt no emotional connection with TDF whatsoever, I didn't care what happened to the characters, or even the human race.
There has been a lot of discussion on whether this was trying to be woke, I suppose its a fair comment. But if your trying to make a woman-prominent film you have to create more intelligent developed roles, it's not enough to stand in mens' shoes and say lines that could be written for men. Perhaps more woman should be involved in the whole production process, particularly Direction and scriptwriting.
At the moment I don't think the is any need to be concerned with future T movies.",Terminator - Dark Fate

865,Jozinek,Enjoyable but not brilliant like the first two.,6,9 November 2019,"Now I haven't seen Genisys, Salvation or Rise of the Machines, so I can only really compare this movie to the first two, and to be honest, most people would see that as the most reasonable choice anyway, considering the fact that every Terminator movie that's come out after Judgement Day has been trying to live up to it and the first one.I'll start off with a brief summary of the plot: after the events of T2, Sarah manages to protect her son from other terminators that were sent to kill him until one eventually accomplishes his mission. Sarah is broken because of this, and the terminator that killed her son, having no more orders from the AI that had now been prevented from existing, disappears. Then we're introduced to Dani, who's our new John Connor as well as to the new liquid terminator (the Rev-9) sent to kill her and the cyborg soldier, Grace who was sent to protect her. Grace and the Rev-9 are from a new future where a new rogue AI called ""Legion"" has taken over and Dani is the leader of the resistance.New antagonistic force, new protector, new saviour of the future. Basically key indications of a reboot. But the most important question regarding films remains: is it worth my time and money? Well.... yes and no. Yes if you want intense action sequences as well as great scenes with Arnie and Linda (especially Arnie, who's basically the comic relief of the film. He learns how to become human during the following decades after John's death and becomes a family man, and his dialogue is cheesy yet amusing, so there's that). No if you wanted a truly terrifying antagonist that would live up well to the T-1000 as well as a brilliant and engaging relationship between the new characters like John and Arnie's one in T2.On the topic of the antagonist: it's a bit wimpy. I mean, it gets its ass kicked by Grace several times and later on gets flung into walls by Arnie like a rag doll, which contrasts to the T-1000 and how much more of a better fighter it was than Arnie. Also the Rev-9's capable of incredible things such as forming handguns, which it barely uses in the film.There's a scene set in the future war against Legion which shows Rev-7's (which I presume to be older models than Rev-9's) having these razor sharp tentacles on their backs as well as their hands being permanent blades, whilst killing off human soldiers with ease. During this scene I was just wondering ""why the heck isn't the Rev-9 doing this crap?"" I mean, it would dismember Grace no problem, probably strangle Dani like a boa constrictor and it looked terrifying. But the Rev-9 is a skimpy skeleton who only uses blade hands and the occasional duplicate (which the Rev-7's are also capable of), this was frustrating as well as straight up stupid.On the topic of Dani and Grace's relationship: it's a bit bland. I mean, with John and Arnie, John was teaching him new things to act more human, whereas Grace is devoid of any kind of humorous moments with Dani that would've made their relationship memorable (e.g. I remember Arnie smashing the coin compartment of a pay phone open so that John could call his adoptive parents as well as John teaching Arnie one liners more than pretty much every interaction that Grace had with Dani).So overall, it's fine. But there's another question that I'll give a brief answer to: is it a reboot worthy of starting off a new trilogy? Considering how badly it's been doing at the box office, probably not. Also some people in the cinema looked pretty bored at times, and some even left. Do I blame them? Not really, considering how this film fails to create as much of an on-the-edge-of-your-seat suspension as the first two did. Also some people were complaining about political undertones like Sarah's ""they're comin' after your womb"" comment. But regardless, I still consider this as just above average, I enjoyed it which was the most important thing, but it's just kind of weak in comparison to what it's trying to live up to.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Rambo? Predator? you notice with all sequels the more thats made the worse they get in most cases...i guess after all the terminator movies they've just ran out of ideas which is understandable and i doubt there will be a new one surely?To conclude, if you get the chance to watch it for free like me and need to pass time then go for it but if you have to pay then i wouldn't...i don't like bad talking movies but i feel like its best to be honest so if they make another they hopefully don't do the same thing but who knows...have to remember all these actors are getting old unfortunately...cant expect them to film it like the old ones where this massive scary looking dude just slaughters people...when you look at Arnold you don't have the same ..idk vibe i guess? its like having the current Arnold do another predator like the first..do you see what i mean? just wouldn't be the same.",Terminator - Dark Fate

It would get a 6/10 if this were a generic action film. If you have never heard or seen a Terminator movie, you would no doubt be entertained by this flick.
However as a Terminator fan this film will spit on your childhood memories, will destroy the characters that you learned to love during the 80's and early 90's, disrespects its fans and disrespect its own legacy... As part of the Terminator lore this film is 10 times worse than Genesys. This film is a travesty. As a Terminator film this one deserves 0 out of ten stars.
So, if this a decent generic action film worth 6/10 and an absolute pile of feces as a Terminator film deserving 0/10...let's average out to 3/10.
It seems that giving it a 3, I am being fair...but I still feel that the disservice this travesty is giving to the people who went to see this movie based on Nostalgia and Hope of the revival of the franchise..This movie deserves much less than that...But stick to the 3 stars to be somehow congruent.",Terminator - Dark Fate

869,timsharpe1,Excellent follow on from T2,9,23 October 2019,"Absolutely amazing follow on from T2. I was left impressed, there is a little more lead with the female cast which was good to see, but Arnie did not take a back seat either. They should now leave the Terminator films alone with no more & hopefully that was Arnies last. I have disregarded the ones in between so am just focusing on T1, T2 & this one. Other comments have said that cgi was too much, but I disagree. Yes, there's probably more action in this than in T2, but this isn't T2 is it. There was plenty of action in this movie right from the start so did not disappoint. It was really good to see Arnie & Hamilton back together in this one. Would I recommend this film? YES. Would I watch this again? YES. I will also be adding this to my Blu-ray collection when the time comes.
There are some small good references to T2 in this one that also nicely link them too, but I won't say anymore. Just go watch it. I have not given this a 10/10 rating as I felt that T2 deserved that rating, this is just a fraction under that so well worthy of a 9/10.",Terminator - Dark Fate

872,RobertWhitebrow,An insulting cashgrab.,3,27 July 2020,"This movie does too many things wrong. If you loved the T1 and T2 plot lines - tough luck. Dark Fate erases them in a 2 minute flash back, spitting on both fandom and source material. Apparently terminators can pop back through time on whim and one of them does get John Connor. To be honest at that point I had equal amounts of disgust for the ease with which they insulted the original movies, as well as a building anticipation since this COULD have been a bold enough move to spice things up story-wise. And with every passing minute that anticipation dimmed, replaced by a gradually more erect middle finger for this movie.This is how you waste potential. You start of with the exact same way - two terminators warp in, but wait! one isn't a terminator, but an ""augmented"" human. Oh and she's a female. The other terminator is male. while I give props to the actor for mimicking the T 1000's facial expressions, unfortunately it is more of the same, that we've already seen in a much better movie, 25 years earlier. The general rule of this movie is that if you're a guy you're either a sniveling lowlife, a villain or get offed within 5 minutes. On the other hand every female is a golden queen. Film makers must really learn to nuance things. I don't mind a healthy dose of ideological spice, but this is beat-you-over-the-head-at-every-turn, do-you-get-it-yet type of plot contrivance.Aside from gender-swapping the vast majority of the main characters this movie clearly has no original ideas of its own. Remember in T2 the scene where the T1000 chases them in a huge rig? Yeah, this one has an identical scene. Remember when he chased them with a helicopter? Yep, got that too. Remember how the whole thing ended in a factory with molten steel? Got that too! And this is by no means an exhaustive list of repetition. It would have been better as a remake or a reboot if they planned to copy so much of it and slap a new paint over it.Now, back to plot fails - If you are going to erase the entire plot that the fans fell in love with, you can really make something good with it, right? Well, they don't. It's like they didn't like their Toyota car, so they sold it to buy the same Toyota. What happens with John Connor, the legendary leader of the resistance dead? Oh, nothing, there's another just as legendary leader of the resistance that the plot conjures up. Except this time it's a she, and is hispanic. Aside from those two ""super important changes"" nothing else is different. Oh, but we learn that in the new future Skynet doesn't exist! Cool, so what did happen? Oh, nothing, there's still a super computer AI that guides the machines, just this one is called Legion. Uninspired, rehashing, copycat cash grab.To be fair, the characters themselves are played well and the actors are good. Almost all of them are charismatic and deliver very decent performances of how their portrayed characters have their own agendas and emotions. Well, all except the ""new John Connor"" McGuffin girl, who, for the leader to unify human kind against the machines, has little to no personality. All she does offer is an attitude and no skill set. Sadly, not even Arnold and Linda, along with the great addition of Mackenzie managed to save this train wreck of a plot.",Terminator - Dark Fate

874,LiveYoLifeLikeYouMeanIt,Makes Genisys look like a masterpiece,2,1 November 2019,"There are movies that amidst all the schlock have moments or aspects that can indeed be admired. Everything might not fall into place perfectly but they are yet worthwhile viewing experiences. This not the case with Terminator: Dark Fate. The painfully pedestrian title and poster serve as warnings. A mind-numbingly dull and formless film with not one redeeming quality in any department whatsoever.Terminator Genisys was not too good a film by any means but it was perhaps fun in its own right with a neat plot and characters, commendable acting and CGI action. Dark Fate meanwhile lowers the bar a huge deal. At a time when movies are having to get ever more inventive with their storylines, narratives and treatment of characters, comes Dark Fate with a story so inexplicably a straight rehash of everything we've seen before. Given that the story is the same, are the characters well fleshed at the least? Nope, the new characters are given a couple of minutes to introduce themselves before the action gets going and suffocates all else. Of the returning Schwarzenegger and Hamilton, the former appears far too late into proceedings to save the mess, and the latter while given a handful of things to do is a pale shadow of the person in the originals. Okay, characters themselves might be stale but how about their interaction and engagement with each other, anything refreshing? Nope, the dialogue exchanged between the characters is bland and uninspired, with little aside from variations on ""We can't stay here"" and ""We have to keep moving"". Early on friction between characters is hinted at but instead of capitalizing on it and using it to infuse the story with tangible tension and angst the script stays kindergarten and leaves it to the action sequences. This is an action movie, is the action any good? Not one bit. From tired re-imaginings of terminators from the originals to quick cut shaky cam and a noisy incomprehensible background score, the fight scenes are forgettable. No sense of tension or danger just a lot of bullets and running.I'm genuinely surprised that the director of Deadpool directed Dark Fate. The complete lack of pacing, cohesive editing, shockingly basic cinematography, and the fundamental absence of tone throughout all give in to a B movie at best. This is a movie without vision or scope. There is no beating heart. Aside from a couple of lines courtesy of Schwarzenegger there is not a hint of humor. And the ending attempts a show of selfless sacrifice and redemption but with all the mush that comes before it, it all falls flat.Scorcese, I wonder, if Marvel itself is not cinema then where does that leave Dark Fate?",Terminator - Dark Fate

878,jwp-54567,Death by ideology.,3,18 January 2020,"This movie was made with an agenda, and unfortunately it wasn't to do justice to the Terminator franchise.It's dripping with ideological agenda, from feminism to trying to highlight the plight of poor illegal aliens 'caged' at the border (or 'detainees' as the evil Government workers call them so they can sleep well at night), to mocking US citizens for stockpiling weapons on the assumption that civilisation may end, at which point said citizen will need these weapons to defend their family, and perhaps the most cringe-inducing is that our deliberately brown female protagonist certainly doesn't give birth to no man that saves the world - oh hell no, it's the age of woman power after all!Unfortunately, the creators lacked the intelligence and capacity to pull off their agenda tactfully. What we have here is crude and blatant, in-your-face ideology that the creators want you to swallow, and that tarnishes the film.Some of my favourite movies have female leads, such as T1, T2, Aliens, Resident Evil, Lucy, Alita Battle Angel and more; the difference is that disseminating ideology was not the motivation of the creators, and that's why they're revered by fans whereas Dark Fate will be relegated to the trash heap of film history, as yet another sequel infested with gangrenous wokeness.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Does it succeed? To my humble opinion yes. First of all, the idea of Sarah's return is a smart move. The whole storyline was based on her from the beginning. Hamilton's performance is conveincing and well acted. Arnold's part proves for once more that there can be no Terminator film without him. The action scenes are simply explosive while the overall acting is of high quality. The actors really look the part, despite this not being a drama film. The plot elements although I shall not discuss them provide numerous elements of surprise and it is evident that the presence of Cameron boosts the film into a higher level. To conclude with, I believe that the franchise will be revitilised after this entry and that the box office figures will justify all of the cast's efforts.

881,NurgleTheUnclean,I enjoyed it!,7,21 January 2020,"I read so many negative reviews I felt it needed some balance.Terminator Dark Fate to me has all the right criteria for a Terminator movie:
1) Villian Terminator is what you would expect, relentless, indestructible, clever, powerful.
2) Lots of peril. The heroes are always on the run, the terminator chases are relentless and spectacular.
3) Lots of action. The fight scenes are well choreographed, and fun to watch, plenty of explosions, car crashes, death defying stunts.
4) A plot. The plot actually has more depth than the originals, reviewers dismiss the plot because it may have some heavy handed political innuendos that they disagree with. For me I liked where the plot went, while there weren't many plot twists or surprises, it was plenty rich enough to keep me interested the whole time.
5) Decent performances. I generally consider Mackenzie Davis an obvious overactor, however I thought she did a great job. Gabriel Luna, was in my opinion the best Terminator there has ever been, charming and robotic at the same time. Linda and Arnold, were there ever overacting selves, with all the cliches, but I wasn't bothered or distracted by them. Natalia Reyes certainly wasn't my favorite, but either was Linda in the original Terminator movie, so in that respect she played the role she was supposed to, and at the end was completely acceptable.Overall, it's a tense thriller with non stop action that left me looking forward to the next generation of Terminator movies.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Gone was the subtle crafting and directing from T2. Lots of good action but none of the tense drama off people and cops coming into contact with IT.

Completely changes the story, with the introduction of Skynet v2. A few things make sense. The intend here is probably to dazzle with bold action scenes and CGI. It is what it is. The great time machine that washes away everything.Acting wise , Linda Hamilton is great. She brings the old Sarah Connor back , that beloved kick ass character we all missed. Mackenzie Davis is great too, but she is not given much to work with. Arnold looks like he is having fun with it. I'm sure his paycheck plays a big role in that. The new savior of humanity is kinda without a presence. Wooden, lifeless. But the biggest disappointment is the villain terminator. A non threatening, bland, chatty robot, that fails to intimidate. New trick tech kinda works, but its far from enough to save the character.I'm not really mad. And it is not really that bad. What makes it bad, is the context in which it was presented, as the new T2. But the writing is weak. Pointless really.

893,michielodb,Just dissapointing,5,26 October 2019,"I absolutely love the first two Terminator films, as do we all. They were fun, energetic, emotional, thrilling, just everything a sci-fi and film lover wants to see. Yet ever since the geniuses of Hollywood wanted to make this into a money-grabbing franchise, it's all gone downhill. I had some faith in Terminator: Dark Fate. Mainly because Linda Hamilton was coming back and the director of Deadpool was taking over. So at the very least, I was expecting a movie with entertaing action sequences. However, troubles and cold sweats started to occur when I saw how many trailers and movie clips there were releasing before the thing was even released. After seeing it yesterday...my fears were sadly confirmed.The most positive thing about this movie (notice how I call it a movie and not a film) is that it tries really hard to fit into the same universe as the first two Terminator films. It's very fast-paced, very energetic and feels like a rollercoaster. Only this movie more feels like an overblown sequence of events. The pace in this movie is on the wrong side of fast-paced. This mainly comes because of the overuse of music. Even the most minute scenes have a lot of energetic music that just doesn't make it flow very well, but that can also just be me. The new evil Terminator, the Rev-9 is a very cool and new type that we haven't seen before. Gabriel Luna also does a pretty good job at playing him. Of course, Arnold is always a joy to watch, yet he is extremely underused here. I can see his purpose in the movie, yet at the end of the day he really felt useless. Apart from that, there are also some moments of action that are visually well done, but they are minimal since the CGI used in this movie is a lot of the times very obvious.Something that's very apparent is of course the whole female cast. I have absolutely no problem with a female cast, I really don't, but jezus christ at least make them good. Linda Hamilton as Sarah Conner, although still pretty good, really feels tired. If you compare her efforts here with the ones from Terminator Judgement Day, it's like night and day. Mackenzie Davis as Grace is alright. She does a decent job but her character really feels like the personification of women empowerment. Yet all she does is act like a man throughout the whole movie (she even wears man clothing), is this really what women empowerment is supposed to be? But without a doubt, the elephant in the room is Natalia Reyes as Dani. She plays a huge role in this movie and she is just completely miscast. She undergoes this arc throughout the movie, which is good of course, but it's just the most unreal and fake thing I have ever seen when it comes to characters arcs. I didn't believe her transition from point A to point B for a single minute, resulting in a lot of her perfomance being forced and even crinchy. Last but not least, the beginning of this movie ruins almost everything about the first two Terminator films. I don't really have a problem why they did what they did, but the way it is executed is really bad and very dissapointing.Guys, this movie really tries its best at fitting in with the first two Terminators and I sort of respect it for that. But this is a very bland and forgettable movie filled with political agendas and unrealistic characters. Watch the first two films again because the end of Terminator Judgement Day will forever be the one true ending.",Terminator - Dark Fate
894,Matt-441,They never learn,7,2 November 2019,"There are so many fake reviews trolling this movie , describing scenes that are not even in the movie. Here is an honest impression as a Terminator series fan:Casting: 7/10
Davis, Luna, Hamilton, and Arnie were well cast. Reyes was a poor choice for such a major role. Reyes' facial expressions and emotions were quite stiff and lifeless even by Arnie standards. They should have cast Dafne Keen Fernandez (from movie Logan), Alice Braga (from movie Predators), or Zoe Saldana (from movie Guardians of the Galaxy) if a native Spanish speaker and female gender was essential.Character development: 6/10
Not enough flashbacks to draw the audience into Reyes', Hamilton's, and Arnie's past lives. The opening scenes were great, but more of it was needed. The story telling was too superficial and rushed. The result is an unfortunate lack of empathy for the main characters.Action sequences: 7/10
Solid fight scenes. The agility of Davis and Luna were conveyed very well. Arnie and Hamilton cgi action scenes were engaging enough. Reyes was sorely lacking athleticism despite cgi enhancement. She could not convincingly do simple things like running without looking like a clumsy oaf. Again, casting Dafne Keen Fernandez, Alice Braga, or Zoe Saldana in place of Reyes would have helped this movie a lot.Storyline: 7/10
The trailers revealed and spoiled way too much. If you've seen the trailer, then you've seen about 90% of the plot. The remaining 10% are major B-movie plot holes that were just sad to watch.Script: 6/10
Arnie had a few great lines here that made the movie audience collectively laugh out loud. Hamilton's character was given many smart alec one-liners that lacked wit and conviction. They just came off as being cheesy and utterly forgettable. If you are used to the witty banter in Marvel movies from the past decade, the lack of sharp wit in this movie will disappoint.Watch, Rent, or Skip?

Why? Because it is just IMPOSSIBLE to make a sequel to be at the level of those movies (personally I don't even think that T2 is at the level of T1). Those movies were original, ballsy, well scripted and kind of resolved everything in the story. We carry them deep in our hearts and is just foolish to think that they could be matched.

Except for the first half of the movie, the rest spurned out to a forgettable drear.It seems that the writers have mysteriously ran out of creative juice and ended up rehashing the same old same old boring story of the robot-from-the-future-going-back-in-time to terminate the saviour of the future. Dark Fate failed to to elevate above the smart T2 Judgment Day.Given that Cameron brought in a retinue of gifted writers like David Goyer, Billy Ray, Justin Rhodes and story by Cameron himself, Dark Fate is a forgettable drear. Watch out too for the night scenes that was so poorly lighted it flashed by into a dim monochromatic blur. If critics reviews for T3, Terminator Salvation and Terminator Genisys were flaccid, Dark Fate is bereft of vigour, aimless and uncompelling.

Half the movie is in Spanish, but then given the current climate, what with the snowflakes thinking that nobody needs to file for residency when it comes to immigration, it's understandable. The protagonist is a woman because women being able to do anything a man can do is all the rage now. However, in the movie she did say she was human just augmented. Trust me, she isn't augmented in the right places. The dialogue was written by a 6th grader, its either that or Hollywood writers are on the verge of illiteracy these days. It is absolutely pathetic. Then there's the action. Loads and loads of CGI and nonstop action. I guess they figured if the action never stopped no one would notice the inane dialogue. They were wrong! Then again, it could be they figured the smartphone generation with the attention span of a gnat would walk out on the movie if something wasn't blowing up every two minutes. Either way it gets boring in a quick hurry. Just when all this isn't enough, Grandma shows up with an automatic shotgun and a laws rocket. I almost fell over laughing. I kind of felt bad for a bit, because it's obvious, whoever put this together, meant for it to be serious.

Arnie and Hamilton are the worst things in it by far. Luna is perfectly acceptable as the Rev-9 but Reyes and Davis are very good, especially Davis. She's a flawed character and completely believable. Arnie is unnecessary comedy value and Hamilton is a nasty piece of work. Completely unlikeable. I wasn't rooting for Sarah Connor anymore. She maybe has reason, which brings me to the spoilers...
The treatment of John Connor is appalling. We invested in his mythos in all the movies and to dispense of him like this movie does, is a travesty.
I'm not a fan of mid movie reboots, (Halloween, Superman Returns etc). It's sci-fi, you can create any reason for the changed timelines. Say Connor somehow created alternate timelines and this is just another. Avengers Endgame used this method to get around it's own time line mess and it works.

Linda Hamilton tries to return to the role of Sarah (just like Jamie Lee Curtis returning to Halloween or Carrie Fisher returning to Star Wars), but her character's story is not as compelling as the filmmakers seem to think.All of these films struggle with the same question: what do we do with John Connor? This character sits in the middle of the franchise like a black hole, with massive gravity but casting no light. So far, four attempts to solve this problem have all seemed to fall flat.Personally, I was excited to see the franchise get carried on from either of the last two visionary starting points: Salvation, or Genisys.

However, the characters and dialogue are head scratching many times. You're either annoyed by statements that don't fit the situation or its character. The story in itself is for a Terminator movie very dull since it doesn't add anything to the world or lore. I keep asking myself how much of a hit or miss David Goyer can be.The direction is OK even though I sometimes didn't know why actors behaved the way they did and since it happened multiple times I blame the director for it.Except for the first fight with the hammer the action felt like it dragged after a while since you didn't really felt the stakes.Overall the Story outline is unimaginative, the dialogue bad, the characters forced in certain ways and overall a movie that doesn't give you anything except for a few action scenes that aren't even really impressive.Let's say goodbye to a franchise that probably should've called it a day many days ago.",Terminator - Dark Fate

It was easy to believe if this was going to be a true sequel to the original two movies. I was dissappointed with the direction they took with this one. I appreciate they wanted to show the strength of the female characters and have the spotlight more on them, but that doesn't mean Schwarzenegger's iconic T800 character has to take a back seat.I was also dissappointed with the fact they did indeed kill off John Connor. I was hoping for a twist on that part of the story and eventually see Edward Furlong play an adult John, but sadly it never happened. James Cameron should never have claimed Furlong was returning considering that was pretty much not true if you don't include his facial likeness being used for the young John Connor. But I will say the CGI effects to make the characters look younger for the opening scene were impressive, I certainly didn't expect to see a younger Sarah Connor.And then we have Skynet no longer exisiting. I know this was already revealed before the movie was released but I led myself to believe Skynet would still have a big part to play in the future. I hate say this, but this installment takes away the purposes of the first two movies, when I was expecting the idea of this movie was to expand on those purposes.Oh.. and Schwarzenegger's T800 (or Carl) selling Drapes for a living and having his own family.. yeah..

911,stephen-abraham,Look its not a terrible movie. A good sequel suffering from franchise fatigue.,7,22 January 2020,"SOME SPOILERS AHEAD.
People had bagged this a lot online.
Yes its not ground-breaking like T1 & T2.
But I was genuinely engaged with the plot and on the edge of my seat with the amazing action. The ideas were compelling: the new future enemy, the unstoppable Rev-9 was a persistent threat just like T1 & 2. I didn't know where this was going to head - and not being a US citizen and seeing the boarder wall and facility actually felt fresh. They get caught! The story had me until until the underwater scene which lost me due to the absurdity.
Sure there are plot holes but it felt like a good Terminator film. It felt right. I really enjoyed Grace's character - I really felt for her. I got the same sort of teary emotion at the end when she gave her life. Likewise with Karl. The opening had already been spoiled for me so I can't comment on how that would have felt to see.
There are so new ideas here. I like that T2 actually DID end Skynet. It made sense that they sent several T800s back. Sarah Conner was great and her interplay with the leads felt real and grisly.BUT: this is the 4th go at a sequel after 3 failures. Everything has been tried and hasn't stuck. As a fan of the first two films its very very hard to not have this ""bad taste in your mouth"" about it all. And so as the movie-goer there is a similar scenario as with ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"". It wasn't terrible, but the ""The Last Jedi"" WAS terrible and so it suffered.

The storyline is boring, without life, without anything redeeming qualities, it is to be a waste of my time to watch this and to be honest, the studio should repay the people their money for watching this.They had an oportunity to continue after Genisys, to create something new. But some smuck, whoever makes the call, said they wanted to continue from T2, but instead of continuing, they write some storyline that deserves at best to be a spinoff, not the main movie.Just an example, when they encounter ""carl"" everyone except Sarah seems more than willing to trust what is a Terminator, not even a reprogrammed Terminator, but the actual one that killed John Connor. Yet, nobody of them except Sarah seems to blink , instead they tell her to stand down, to be calm etc. This after being chased by the ""bad guy"" of the movie and knowing first hand what a Terminator does.another example, the protector, I would not call her girl or woman or augmented queen b***h, she is more than willing to do nothing but hide in a cave in middle of nowhere until when? NONE of them thought about finding out where this new Legion was being built and stop it there, instead they rehash what happend in T1 and T2.I don't get whats with these reboots, they are even worse than the old saying that sequels sux, this is even worse, this is not even a B movie, its not even worth to call a spinoff.I am dissapointed in the director and story crew, this was a utter waste of time.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Linda Hamilton brings gravitas, and the circularity of the screenplay brings both characters together meaningfully for their's and Grace's futures.

It seems to me, that long running franchises such as The Terminator, Star Wars etc just get lots of hate, simply because people have fond memories of 15-20 years ago, when they watched their first Terminator movie.
Ppl were younger, and more easy to get swallowed up by a movie. Not to mention, people have watched 1000's of movies since their first T1 or 2, which means it takes much more to impress people now. I bet, if Dark Fate was the first Terminator movie ever released, everyone would say ""Dark Fate is the best, nothing comes close"".In short, to me Terminator Dark Fate was one hell of a rollercoaster-ride, I didn't have a spare second to look how much popcorn I had left, the CGI was on point, and i didnt get the feeling CGI was added just for the sake of it. I liked what Grace added to the movie. (And while I strongly dislike PC ruining recent Hollywood productions, I don't think it was a problem in DF.

928,ben-snooks,Terminators in the age of mobile Internet,8,21 January 2020,"Linda Hamilton is great in this. A strong presence like in T2 where she helps to hold the story together. Dark Fate film is about passing the batten and also about a new beginning. I liked it with some reservations. Mackenzie shows her dynamism as an actor in her role. Her character combines many of the different qualities she demonstrated in Halt and Catch Fire packaged together, except for maybe a romantic element which would not have suited this 2 hour film.I actually think it took too long since T2 to make a Terminator movie that has tried to explore some of deeper topics such as Man's destructiveness, technological development without restriction and what it means to be human. This film tries to renew some of the hard science fiction that T2 touched on which made it a great movie. If Dark Fate was made 20 years earlier then the franchise could have been saved. Unfortunately T2 is now a classic film and Dark Fate is mainly cashing in this late in the game. Cinema going tastes worldwide have changed with most new releases trying to get tickets sales in China and India which have massive new middle classes to bring in. Unfortunately those viewers would not have experienced T1 or T2 as Western audiences did on the big screen - with their celebrated special effects and breakout actors. The differences in audiences tastes today seemed to have made Dark Fate a difficult movie to make, needing to meet today's expectations of Political correctness and instant gratification. Arnie's T101 mixed with Kindergarten Cop. Interestingly, the idea of a terminator with Internet access pops up though I'm not really sure why a Terminator needs to visit a data centre to gain access to some photos. An example of an inconsistency where this film is desperately trying to stay relevant. This film, like a few others released lately such as Blade Runner 2049 and Rambo: Last Blood serve as elegies to the actors and the characters that were created in another time. This is perhaps the best way to view Dark Fate, without expecting it to deliver too much that is new but rather help you to remember and celebrate what is old.",Terminator - Dark Fate

The movie starts with John Connor being killed in 1998. If they stopped judgment day on T2, how come we have another terminator to kill John Connor ? Moving on, Skynet was destroyed, now we have Legion, with a female leader of the human resistance that needs to be protected. So it means, that no matter what you do, no matter how many times you prevent the war, it will always going to happen. So, the ""there´s no fate but what you make for yourself"" makes no sense. Cameron already destroyed, or denied everything he did and said on the first movie when he made the second (nothing dead will come thru on the time displacement machine, yet we have a liquid metal cyborg), now he did it again.

Without it, it's just not there. Maybe they lost their shirt to the original composer or something but at no point in the film did I feel the same thrill or interest as I did the first 3-films.Now granted at least #4 and #5 weren't as good but at least they had music to drive it. This last terminator #6 (Dark Fate 2019) is just crap without any decent or good music.That counts for half of the film so I have to take my rating of 6 out of 10 and snap it right in half. This is not a silent film, why there are such a low output of music for this thing is just beyond me.And Terminator should be done. Sure it was nice to see the original actor for Sarah Connor again the original Terminator played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, nonetheless, it wasn't enough to save this train-wreck of a movie.No rewatch value.

956,briandoodo,"Personally, one of my favorite Terminator films since T2",8,6 February 2020,"There have been many sequels and soft reboots of the terminator franchise. This is more of a direct sequel to the first 2 films and with Linda Hamilton it sure feels like it.This film takes place many years later, and in reality it was filmed many years later. So you can expect a different Sarah Conner than you remember in the first two films.What I like about the film is that it has decent action scenes and for the first time in several years it dares you to think just a little bit. The first two Terminator films were cautionary tales about technology and man's unhindered ambition. The first two films showed us that when it comes to our natural drive to evolve, we must be careful not to try to become more than human and to surpass ourselves (our humanity). We do surpass our humanity in T1 and T2 and blinded by our ambition we nearly destroy ourselves.Ironically, we find our salvation in the same manner... by using that same technology that has surpassed us, our humanity to save us all.This film is a lot more intelligent than the previous...several films. It show cases drone technologies, it humanizes a terminator, it has a character who is augmented, half machine/ half human... in many ways it's a subtle social commentary of what may be to come. It's another cautionary tale that makes itself far more relevant than the past several Terminator action film flops, if you're paying real attention...Mackenzie Davis is also very easy on the eyes and has a very strong, likable screen presence. Arnold reprises his role... I'm not sure what the intended deeper theme or message of the film was/is...or if one was ever intended. However, for the more verbal viewer, it won't promise to be Blade Runner but it will invite you into a space for reflection. The film is set in the modern era of technology, drones, cell phones, surveillance, augmentation, implants...Admittedly, it's simply a very relevant time to live in to be reminded of the cautionary tale in the first two films. It's a very real reality currently that the military is working with AI and trying to create nonhuman soldiers. There is talk about computer AI running and organizing, supervising, over seeing certain businesses or even military planning...I do enjoy this movie and I admit it's not a classic like the first two films, I still find it very entertaining. I actually find it's simplicity and basic formula to be a positive thing. The previous films were getting so over the top, silly, goofy and they just didn't work anymore.I feel like this film goes back to some action film basics and just tells a pretty straight forward story, which some how actually makes for a more complex story, because it feels more real, more relevant and isn't just focused on giant explosions and violence.The terminator having a family is one of the ways this really is brought to my attention. They spend a few minutes on this character development which I really thought was fascinating...Honestly, in this day and age I think that this film was lost in all of the sequels that have come out in recent years. People either wrote it off or wrote it off as some feminist agenda.I don't really see a agenda, regardless of casting... casting films with men or women to make them appear stronger or heroic is what we call equality.... sometimes it happens in the same movie... Which if you don't remember was exactly the case in this franchise several years ago with Terminator 2 and arguably Terminator 1...",Terminator - Dark Fate

very short.",Terminator - Dark Fate
961,gerick_goldwyn,***4 MINOR CHANGES TO THIS FILM WOULD HAVE MADE IT A BOX OFFICE SUCCESS!! READ ON IF YOU DARE!!***,5,26 March 2020,"The first and most obvious change, the writers should have NEVER killed off John Connor in the first scene of this film. This was a massive mistake, and a huge disservice to T1 and 2 (as well as the original TV series, the Sarah Connor Chronicles). It was bad enough that they made John the villain in T5 (Genisys). I mean seriously, what were they thinking?! But, killing John off in the first 5-mins of this film was even worse. As a result, the first and most obvious change would be, instead of Sarah stepping out of the car to save Dani and Grace at the start of the film, it should have been John Connor (Christian Bale) instead, at the same age he was in T4 (Salvation). So, people could place the timeline and see John Connor at his best again in an alternate future. This would have instantly redeemed the Terminator franchise. So, even though John Connor stopped Judgement Day in T2, he still fighting the machines in T6 (Dark Fate), and doing everything he can to prevent a second Judgement Day from coming to pass. Furthermore, Christian Bale would have brought a massive amount of people back to the movies to see T6 (Dark Fate) if he was a part of this franchise again...Second, as a result of the first change, it's John Connor receiving the anonymous messages, not Sarah. As a result, its John hunting down the terminators. Consequently, Dani, John and Grace go to look for the anonymous texter together, which ends up being both Sarah and a T101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Sarah and John had a falling out after they stopped Judgement Day. John wanted to keep fighting/training for the war to come, while Sarah believed they had won, and wanted to settle down somewhere and live off the grid. This change also remains loyal to the alternate end in T2 (Judgement Day) as well as T3 (Rise of the Machines), i.e., in the crypt John Connor says, Sarah believed they were free, they stopped the war, while John never really believed that, etc. As a result, their conflicting ideas (for the future) caused a rift in their relationship, and eventually caused them to go their own separate ways. As a result, Sarah and the T101 have been looking out for John from the shadows, sending him anonymous text messages so he can destroy the terminators that are coming back from the future. John's example inspires Sarah to keep fighting. That's why she is helping him.Next, the T101's backstory. Sarah (and some of her friends) rescued the T101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) from the US military. Fearful the US government could use him in some way again to engineer another Judgement Day or Skynet. But, the damage was already done before they arrived. After the T101 terminated Katherine and Robert Brewster, he was captured. Just an FYI, Katherine and Robert Brewster both appear in T3 (Katherine Brewster is John Connor's wife). As a result, the US army gained full access to Arnold's CPU and memories. Consequently, when Legion arose, the Artificial Super Intelligence (or ASI) had full access to the T101's memories, which included a detailed account of SKYNET's future, which the ASI referred to when orchestrating its own Judgement Day. So, in other words, Legion learned from SKYNET's successors and failures when launching its own war against humanity. As a result, Legion's Judgement Day (or war against mankind) was far worse than SKYNET's ever was... Given it learned from SKYNET. Furthermore, Legion also saw how effective SKYNET's terminators were in wiping out humanity, so the ASI created its own line of terminators, which were based on SKYNET initial designs, which were also far more effective at killing human beings. Hence why both futures (John's and Dani's) look almost identical. Legion based his future and war off SKYNET's. This change would actually explain a lot to the fans. To me, I found it absolutely ridiculous that both timelines (SKYNET's and Legion's) looked almost identical when they were 2 completely different timelines.The final change, at the end of the film, John, Grace, and the T101 give their lives to save Dani. So, John dies, fulfilling his destiny of saving the world, by saving Dani, the next great saviour of humanity in the war against the machines. Moreover, from the change above, Legion learnt from SKYNET, just as Dani learnt from John and Sarah, which gives T1 and 2 some significance in the new terminator trilogy. To leave Dani to be trained by Sarah, embodying the qualities of both John and Sarah, a mother and a father figure. Now, this would have been a great story and made all the fans happy. John kicks ass again and saves the world. So, does Grace and Arnold Schwarzenegger, ensuring the film remains politically correct. Furthermore, like the writers wanted, John dies, but in this version he dies a hero, the saviour of mankind (just as he was always written)...Now this is a cool story with only 4 minor tweaks... What fans wouldn't be happy with this?***FILM REVIEW AS IS***While the film was far better than what the critics said. I just had a couple of issues with the film myself.1 (of course) was John's death. Initially, I thought it was an absolutely insane idea, however, after giving it more thought - I realised it was actually quite clever. I just didn't realise SKYNET was killed off with John. The writers just didn't execute it very well, or give John's death meaning. This was the x-factor missing here. They just killed him off like it was nothing. Anyway, while outrageous, this is why I thought John's death was clever: In T1, we learn that John was conceived by a man from the future (Kyle Reese). While in T2 (Judgement Day), we learn SKYNET was build based on the terminator it send back in time to kill Sarah Connor. So, both John Connor and SKYNET were conceived in response to one another, i.e., SKYNET sent a terminator (it designed) back in time to kill John Connor, and its CPU was eventually used to create itself, or SKYNET. While Kyle Reese was sent back in time to intercept that terminator, and ended up conceiving John Connor. So, it's the whole chicken and the egg scenario, i.e., what came first, the chicken or the egg? Or, in this case John Connor or SKYNET? Stewie (from Family Guy) calls this a ""temporal causality loop."" So, the universe created John to destroy SKYNET, so when John eventually destroyed SKYNET and stopped Judgement Day, the universe closed the loop, by killing off John, restoring order or balance to the universe. Or, in other words (as mentioned above), John Connor and SKYNET were conceived in response to one another, creating a temporal causality loop. However, when John stopped SKYNET's conception, he broke the loop. So, no SKYNET, no John, etc. This was probably the timeline trying to repair itself or restore balance to the universe. Or, as V (from V for vendetta) once said: ""I (like God) do not play with dice and do not believe in coincidence."" So, this is why - I believe - John was killed off in T6 (Dark Fate). If this (or something similar) was mentioned by the T101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger) in T6 (Dark Fate), it would have been a great twist in the series and added an extra layer of coolness to the movie too. It also would have been an interesting way to kill off John Connor as well, and give his death meaning somehow. After all, even John Connor is no match for the universe or causality, etc...OK. Disappointment number 2. One thing I really found challenging about this film was, the first half of the movie completely revolved around 3 women, which turned T6 (Dark Fate) into an action, chick-flick for me. Not that I don't like seeing strong, confident women on screen. In fact, I really can't wait to see the next Wonder Woman film at the movies. I think it could be the best movie released in 2020. It's going to be absolutely amazing!! However, in T6 (Dark Fate), it just felt really misplaced. Furthermore, people need to be pre-warned before walking into an action chick-flick, not blind sighted by it. But, more than this, T6 (Dark Fate) should have never been a female-orientated movie. Moreover, it turned Arnold Schwarzenegger into a secondary character in his own franchise, which is just crazy! I understand the film was trying to be politically correct in today's world, which I agree should be the next frontier for movies today, however, the writers should have known this was never going to fly for T6 (Dark Fate). I mean seriously, how many girls do you actually know who would want to see a Terminator film at the movies? And, like I said above, if Christian Bale was a part of this film, it might have added a much needed counter-balance to 2 or 3 women running around on screen for the first half of the movie, which might have worked. And, sadly, I don't think Linda Hamilton, Mackenzie Davis and Natalia Reyes were strong enough to carry this film, especially for a reboot.Anyway, to spite these few issues, I would have liked to see a T7 with the same cast, but it doesn't look like it's going to happen now, given that T6 (Dark Fate) completely failed at the box office :/ However, I truly believe, the 4 changes mentioned above would have made all the difference between a box office success and a box office failure. However, there biggest challenge was T5 (Genisys) was just soooooo bad, was anyone really going to come back to see another terminator film at the movies? No, especially not with this story... So, better luck next time folks!",Terminator - Dark Fate
962,richard_markham,Just watched all the Terminator films ending here. Not impressed.,5,29 December 2020,"We didn't see this at the cinema so this viewing, at the end of a Terminator binge fest, was our first.I had hoped that they might have improved on Genysis. But sadly not.I can barely remember the film, the day after.Watching all the films really does show how good the first and second were and that Salvation was too bad either but this one is just a re-hash with no new ideas to bring to the table. Much like the Alien series that get progressivly more tired and pointless.I don't really understand why they made this, other than to try and wring a last few drops of cash out the franchise.So many scenes are just repeats of previous films and so many things are just daft. For example, why bother to spend years building an arms cache of weapons that will all be completely usless against your primary opponent???

963,emmahamilton-86644,Why the toxic reviews??,8,3 March 2020,"First: To address the whinging of those threatened by a female heavy cast- (and there are at least a couple of reviews I've seen that are like that on here)- I really enjoyed it.I'm a female. I hate PC-ness. I hate femenazis; so trust me when I say, that just because this film has a lot of ladies in it, it's not a ""feminist"" film. I notice when films try to be that, and I didn't feel it with this.I don't whine when 99% of the films that are made are male dominated, so the male reviewers whining about the ""feminist"" aspect can shut it!!Second: I was a teen when I saw T2 for the first time. My sister and I were obsessed with it, and it remains- along with the original which we saw after- one of our favourite films to this day. I know this is a sequel. But it will never, ever compare to the first two. I watched it without any real comparison to the originals as I was well aware it could never match up.Third: It's an entertaining, exciting film in its own right. People have probably become Terminator-d-out because of all the films/ TV show, but I only saw the TV show, and one of the films, and just accepted them on their own merits.This is what people should do with this film. Accept it won't be like the original or the sequel, and enjoy it for what it is: a tense, exciting, dramatic well played film with a strong cast, amazing action sequences and characters I didn't think I'd see again in this franchise but who play their roles well, who it was nice to catch up with, and yes, who appeal to the nostalgic in me.So stop expecting 1984 or 1991, and just enjoy a great film with some familiar faces, and great action sequences.",Terminator - Dark Fate
964,Donnie_Quixotic,Terminator: Oestrogenesis,4,9 March 2020,"Not a single new idea other than a new future emerges in which the company that creates the Artificial Intelligence is now called ""Legion"" instead of the much cooler sounding ""Skynet"". This new future eventuates because John Conner's biological makeup is now considered inappropriate to be humanity's saviour, so he is brutally wiped out at the beginning of the film by a second T800 that apparently was unaccounted for by the future resistance as they failed to send an additional protector. This effectively voids the events and importance of the previous films in quick and throw-away fashion. But it does allow for a more appropriate biological character to be ushered in to take his place.The dialogue is mostly perfunctory, witless, uncreative, and yawn-inducing ""let's go to the place to do the thing"" type effluence, peppered with mostly obvious humour, and uninteresting exposition.The acting is mostly flat, the direction is completely uninspired, and the images flicker quickly across the screen so that you don't notice how shoddily composed they are, except during the quieter character (they have no real character) scenes in which it looks like a shoddily composed TV soap opera. There's just no distinctive visual style whatsoever. The sound does have the distinctive Terminator theme tune, which is nice and is the only thing other than the presence of Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton that remind you its a Terminator movie.4/10 because it is crap but bordering on merely mediocre.",Terminator - Dark Fate

969,thesupertomster,Basic but entertaining,5,28 October 2019,"Dark Fate is the safest and least risk-taking instalment of the Terminator franchise, and yet it's still a breath of fresh air when compared to the overstuffed train-wreck that was Terminator: Genisys. In many ways, Dark Fate is a reimagining of the original 1985 film, but set in the modern day, filled with plot contrivances and featuring newer, less interesting characters. It's therefore unsurprising that the best part of the movie is the returning characters from previous instalments, who steal the screen and take all the best lines whenever they're around.The smartest move made by the film was to ignore every Terminator movie apart from the first two, ditching the ridiculously complicated plot from Genisys and returning to good old robot action. Despite the new terminator having less charisma than Arnold Schwarzenegger's thumb, the premise of an unstoppable shape-shifting machine fighting an augmented superhuman with the help of an aging Sarah Connor will produce some entertaining action no matter what.

972,critic-14,Gaping Plot Holes,6,6 November 2019,"The movie is entertaining with great CGI, including John and Sarah from years ago, but the storyline as a hole makes no sense,1. In T-2, Sarah destroyed the chip and the arm as well as all of the research, so there was nothing left to copy. That should have ended Skynet's ability to create robots. But now Skynet has been replaced by Legion,, so why would Legion send back another T-800 to kill John? Where would it have gotten the technology to create one, and if, as we learn, Skynet no long existed, how would Legion even know about John Connor, let alone care whether he lived or died? And why would it and how could it create a new Arnold model? Wouldn't the altered timeline have changed whom the models were patterned after? Meanwhile, not only can Legion build cyborgs similar to what Skynet could produce, but better ones that can split into two: one a T-1000 liquid metal and the other a Stan Winston skeletor.2. Legion sends back a REV-9 liquid duo cyborg to kill Dani the future John Connor persona. In the original Terminator film, it was made clear that only one Terminator and one human could be sent back though time, which, by the way, appears to be an easy to build mode of travel in any future. So Sarah and Dani and Grace and Carl (Arnold) tems up to defeat the REV-9. But so what? Dani is still a threat, and so why can't more REV-9's be sent back?. There are no more power cells or friendly terminators to destroy them. That would definitely be the end of Dani.3.Why doesn't Legion send a terminator farthere back in time kill her when she was a child? Or, better yet, why not kill her parents or one of her grandparents before she or her parents were conceived? As proven in the Sarah Connor Chronicles, terminators can be sent at least as far back as 1929.4. Since Carl told Sarah that he was able to determine when time traveler was about to come through (by what technology?) why didn't he alter her when Grace or the REV-9 were about to appear, and how did Sarah know where to appear to rescue Grace and Dani, since there was not time displacement at that point?5. When Grace puts a chain into the REV-9's mouth or when Cart binds his arm, why couldn't the REV-9 just melt through and reassemble as it was able to do previously?6. Why didn't Sarah die from cancer? This was established in both Terminator 3 and the Sarah Connor Chronicles. Did the fact that Linda Hamilton smokes ten packs of cigarettes a day in real life magically cure her?7. How did the resistance, in the midst of the annihilation of humanity, come up with a way to enhance humans to make them almost as strong as the terminators? That's a pretty neat trick when most of your floors are covered in human bones and broken bricks and there isn't even enough food to go around. Plus, there's no longer an Internet and technology stopped working the very first day according to Grace.8. Are we really supposed to believe that one woman without any scientific or electronic skills, by rallying a bunch of homeless people in her area, could make that much of a difference that Legion would use so many resources (remember, Sarah said they sent back a lot of terminators previously) to kill her?9. Why is Grace's power cell so different from Carl's? Wouldn't it have been more viable to use his power cell to destroy the REV-9 rather than Grace's, so that Grace could live?10. If you have a time machine, why not send Grace or others back in time to prevent the software that created Legion from every being made. Should a civilization advanced enough for time travel and advanced cybernetics have the ability to create a virus to prevent the Internet from developing sentience?But then I also ask why the people who built Jurassic Park never learn.",Terminator - Dark Fate
973,mayhugh-92626,DON'T LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS!,10,4 November 2019,"All these people rating this movie a 1 or 2 are CRAZY!!!! I mean what the heck did you all watch?!? Me and my husband just got back from seeing this movie and are huge Terminator fans. My husband is a tough critic and he said it was good. After reading the reviews I expected to be disappointed. But the movie was great! Within the first 1O mins it was non stop action. The characters are great and so is the acting. The lead Natalia Reyes is a Colombian actress who is mainly in Hispanic movies and most people aren't familiar with her previous work. But, I think she did great as a lead and held her own against Linda Hamilton and Arnold. Check the movie out for yourself to determine if you do or don't like it. If you are that skeptical go to a matinee where its cheaper but go see it.",Terminator - Dark Fate

If you had never seen a Terminator film then you would think this was excellent. I've seen them all and this was pretty exciting and visually stimulating from start to finish. Yes, has some similarities to T2 Judgement but with updated and additional SFX, which will do me fine since T2 is one of my all-time favourite movies. Not really sure what the negative reviewers were expecting? Give it a chance, as it is certainly better than the 3 movies that preceded it.",Terminator - Dark Fate

However, if you can let past comparisons go, you might enjoy a decent action flick.I thought the augmented soldier thing was really interesting. It's embarrassing, but nice to see the original players. If Linda Hamilton could grow a beard she might look better. Wow. She didn't age well.If you're offended b/c white males played the original hero, the Arnold Terminator, the Robert Patrick T-1000 Terminator & so on, then you'll enjoy this movie b/c white has been replaced w/ Hispanic & male has been replaced w/ female.Politics aside, it was a jolly good action movie.

979,rellik0078,Sarah Is Back as BAD_ASS But movie is HALF_ASS,4,23 January 2020,Do not believe the critics. do not believe the fans .do not believe the good reviews. this movie was basically crap... I am very disappointed. thank God I did not watch it in the movie theater. I watched it online for my streaming service.. Watched it part from Part. and I can 100% say this is definitely not a Terminator movie. this is a movie for the new generation but if you love The Terminator 1 and 2 you will definitely not like this one. This movie with so rushed. it was definitely not directed good. yes Arnold returned and so did Sarah Connor but it was just rushed .there was actually no good parts. everything was like CGI and animated....like no swear words. there was no gory bloody parts...Would I watch this movie again. I probably watch this 1 more time... but I'd watch the first one or the second one first... the first one and the second blew me out of my seat. it was literally a full-on action movie that you would actually die for. I don't understand why these half-ass movies keep coming out when they're never going to beat the original or even come close to it....I am very sad very disappointed very insulted with how this movie was made. basically what happened is they actually just killed this movie.... Not much more I can say at this point in timehow can I end this review off by saying this. the only thing good about this movie is the first five minutes where John Connor actually returns but he only has a 30 second part which really sucked.. don't waste your money wait for it to come on TV because that's all it's worth... Is it the worst movie out today absolutely not but is it the best movie out nooooo..take my word . coming from a guy that's watched action films for the last 20 years. coming from Terminator 2' face off' ' true lies' Sylvester Stallone films' John Claude van Damme' Steven seagal films. every movie you could probably name from the 80s and 90s had the best action heroes. I have seen these movies million timesthis Terminator dark fate movie is far from it.I'd rather actually go back and watch Bloodsport or hard to kill than this crap.... Again very disappointed.... but hey some fans might like this crap but like I said it's for the new generation not the old like when I was growing up... ...,Terminator - Dark Fate
980,bluestrat,what a disappointment,2,8 November 2019,"While i'm all for older actors getting parts, this is one instance where they shouldn't have. some very poor overall acting, poor dialogue, poorly written and acted scenes and an entire sub-par script.
if you really like this franchise...do not see this movie. it will only negatively impact your entire terminator experience.",Terminator - Dark Fate
981,suleimanb,"Watch it, it was good because it Linda Hamilton ( Sarah Conor)",8,30 October 2019,"Okay well at the first hour of the movie the sequence was really bad and slow and I began to feel bored. However after the first hour , things change. Excitement and action with a good sequence and good acting. Linda Hamilton is really good , she gives you deja vu to this period where terminator was a great movie from the last century.Ignore the negative reviews and go watch it. It will give you adrenaline rush.Not bad at all !!",Terminator - Dark Fate
982,james-218-791197,Nothing new here,6,22 February 2020,"I still haven't learned my lesson with sequels. I see the trailer, I get excited, I watch the film, and realise it's never as good as you want or hope.There's nothing new here, except for the political correctness. It basically writes off the first and second films altogether, and introduces the half man/half machine nonsense that made Genisys so bad, an aged Arnie like Genisys, and yet another type of Terminator (this time a combination of robot and liquid metal that can split into two).The plot is basically the same as the original film. So really what we're judging this on is the CGI, which was really good - some great action scenes and fights - however there's nothing original like T2 gave us.Linda Hamilton is dreadful too.It's ok, but not the return to form I wanted. T2 remains the best film in the franchise.",Terminator - Dark Fate
983,leroyhenzen,Great movie,9,27 January 2020,Wow! What another great movie in the Terminator series! It's amazing to see Sarah and the original terminator back again with that old hatred and fire. Sarah Conner is a bad ass!,Terminator - Dark Fate
984,ub92,Lacking in key areas,6,27 March 2021,Story is as expected from a Terminator flick. So pretty good. The dialogue was also punched up well since Salvation and Gen. The action is also substantially better.The film however had a weak performer. Who is unimportant. But the role is substantial enough to affect one's experience.,Terminator - Dark Fate
985,pantelisandreou98,Still nothing tops T2 aka the greatest action movie of all time,5,7 November 2019,"Well that was just quite disappointing, i was expecting so much from this movie with Cameron returning as producer and Tim Miller as a very promising director (previously directing the incredibly well made deadpool) but still with all that talent behind the camera and in front of the camera, what's lacking here is the script. Instead of telling a new and fresh story they decide to retell a mixture of the first and second terminator films with not even close to the outcome of those movies.One other grand problem this one has is ( i'm sure you've heard it by now) the death of a major key character (John Connor) that it felt so out of place and not really justifying the reason to do such a thing. Look at first i was wondering - okay the did that because they have a reason, maybe this will develop later and create something cool from it - but no, no they did absolutely nothing with it. It was just there so Linda Hamilton's Sarah could later on in the film look at Natalia Reyes character (which was a vey weak character in my opinion) and say oh so you are the next John... i mean come on.. that's just poor writing..Arnold Schwarzenegger is also once again part of that bumpy franchise. At this point there is no place that you could take T-800 at least story wise but here they did something that is kind of ridiculous and clever at the same time and that is if you could dig into the existence of him in the first place in the beginning of the film. He offers some chuckles and laughs with some action sequences that we've quite seen before and done better and his presence here is somehow underwhelming.Mackenzie Davis, Natalia Reyes and Gabriel Luna the newcomers here are all great in their parts, especially Mackenzie who gives her all and she looks that she is very talented (everyone of these new characters are very talented) but still as a said earlier with Natalia, the same goes for Gabriel Luna as well. They fail to fulfill the greatness that their characterization could have gone. With Gabriel Luna being not as effecting nor menacing as Robert Patrick in T2 and with his terminator design although being something fresh (separating to two terminators) ultimately becoming something completely wasted as when they do the trick it only works against them, serving only momentarily thrills. Please note that some of the VFX here are noticeably bad just as they were in the trailer, very cheap-looking. It's a shame that this comes from a 180$ budget filmLind Hamilton is great though. I loved that she was still the same bad-ass woman that she was back then. If only the script could let her take Sarah Connor to other, more interesting routes.Overall here we are again with a sequel that is not equally and not even close to the greatness of T2, i think we will never get that worthy sequel and maybe it's for the best. I still think that T3 is better from this one, still not great salvation just okay and Genisys being the absolute worse. Sure this one can give an entertaining night at the movies with the presence of Linda and with Mackenzie offering worthy action set pieces, also with Arnold making a mainly acceptable (although disappointing) unexpectedly funny return. Go with very low expectations and you might like it. Don't expect anything terrific though The factors i mentioned are what help terminator dark fate from a total termination, till we see another one which is very unlikely after the reception of this one at the box office.Rating: C",Terminator - Dark Fate
986,dr-cheyno,Dumb on so many levels,4,15 April 2020,"My understanding of the story line. There really was no story line. Same old, same old John Connor oh you're a MAN. Bang you're dead.
Pass the baton onto the female franchise. Insert whaterver her name was i forgot the lead characters name already. She's basically the new John Connor for whatever reason. Also replace Skynet with Legion.. there were done here.Next, the most annoyingly dumb moments that were hard to process.1. If you're a guy, you are going to die. If you're a female, you will survive. These are the rules.2. A decrepit Sarah Connor who needs a walking frame more than a shotgun plays the cameo of badass grandma vs yet another terminator. The end result? An endless comedy. She even takes out 2 cops unarmed..
Man.. the old terminator movies used to be like sci-fi/horror not sci-fi/comedy..3. A terminator with a family portrait, when asked about said portrait of son and wife replies to Sarah ""I met his mother, Alicia, a few months after i killed John.""
Seriously WTF? That is beyond forced.
Arnie after killing John apparently has no mission and therefore turns into the modern family guy, again has a kid. But hey guess Nano sperm is a thing now even in Arnies old model.4. Same old same old. Protect this person because they're the ONLY person that can apparently say to other humans. Hey.. let's fight the robots instead of each other. We can win.. blah blah - copy & paste cliche speech. So protect that young girl at all costs!5. Why is Arnie ageing as a terminator at all? I understand not wanting to use cgi but this is just stupid. Arnie, just say no PLSSS.6. Terminator chases the girls onto a plane just taking off. Plane takes off and Arnie & terminator fight on the cargo bay door. Of course terminator goes falling off after a couple of minutes. But guess what? He can magically teleport himself into ANOTHER plane and catch up them, ram them and jump on board the plane again..FFS...R.I.P
I'm officially done. I knew it would be your typical modern crap remake, took the punt and paid for it. Oh well. Serves me right.James Cameron, pull your finger out and go back to making Terminator films that were scary not this PG family crap. Makes me want to vomit.",Terminator - Dark Fate
987,maartendierckx,A very tired afair,3,3 November 2019,"Too many characters sloshing down an action packed slide show.The old: John Conner is dead. Just aborted from the story.Sarah Conner had an interesting arc in the first two movies. What did the loss of her son do to her? Well, she tells us: she's an alcoholic, hunting machines. That's a writing no no of amateur proportions: we're not shown how damaged she is, it's told to the audience. There isn't time for anything else, to be fair, with all the characters needing their own five minutes in the spot light, and the jarring action scenes.Arny's back. He plays the role of the terminator that killed John. And then, sort of, felt bad after the fact, taking care in a sense of Sarah. And he has a family and a job. The menacing death machine, that unforgettable nightmare thing is now been reduced to a sour joke. Schwarzenegger does have some really funny lines, but they underline more than anything how terrible this movie is.The warrior lady sent back to the past? She any good? Yes, actually. Solid performance, of all the actors btw. But apart from her menacing physique, she's not been given much to work with. She's cyber Reece.I forget the name of the main character. That in itself demonstrates how engaging her part was. She's John, if John delivered standard ""we've got to make a stand"" type monologues to inspire the gang. Formulaic drivel.That's the problem right there: the story follows all the beats. All the check marks have been met and yet the end result is a soulless thing, a machine brought to life to make money.The story itself is just so weak. The terminator is awful. An unstoppable machine, relentlessly tedious. Do they do something with Sarah teaming up with the killer of her son, the nightmare that had hunted her in her past, killed her lover? Her friends? Nope. Is there chemistry anywhere? Njet. The action is solid? Meh. Very loud and nonsensical.There are some interesting ideas. For instance, they have to cross the US border and for a moment it is rather intimidating; Then the action happens and they just walk away from the internment camp, towards the next action scene.
Stupid stuff:
The terminator is an interior designer now.Sarah, the alcoholic wreck, uses her contacts to get a carrier plane. The bad robot crashes another plane into theirs and everyone survives falling out of the plane.Instead of luring the bad guy to some death trap, the main character heroically decides it is time to take a stand... without any weapons or hope to defeat the thing.There's a distorted feminist message somewhere, too. It feels rather empty though and quite cynical. Summarized by the characters themselves in a sickening dialogue, telling us Sarah was just the womb to the savior, nothing more, and that the new main character is the savior herself. Sarah Conner was not just a womb to John. She was his mother, savior, teacher and protector. She was a fierce and damaged and fascinating character. The writers did not understand this at all; or didn't care.",Terminator - Dark Fate

992,SteveFOX_86,"Not Great, but not Bad either",6,26 October 2019,"To spare the long stuff - the film is watchable, especially in IMAX.
The plot is convincing and the pacing is not bad along with some really good action scenes, but a lot of die-hard T1 and 2 fans will be very pissed off in the first 4 mins of the movie, as was I.
I managed to move past that, but some definitely won't.On to performances:Linda Hamilton kicks ass and doesn't take any names. Refreshing and exactly what the franchise needed.Diego Luna is solid as the new Rev-9 which is much better than the trailers had you believe.Davis is convincing in action scenes but tends to be too melodramatic in dramatic ones.Arnold's part was very well written, but the Oak can now barely walk and almost every scene of him doing any kind of action requires tons of CGI which the film kinda goes overboard with.The worst part of the movie is Natalia Reyes.
She really doesn't fit the part, neither physically, nor acting-wise.
Just too tiny and childish/doll-looking to be believable in her part.
Even worse than Gensys, this time we have both Davis and Hamilton who make Reyes look, feel and sound totally out of place and even laughable at times.Overall, this movie doesn't need to exist and barely holds its own, but is at least cinema-watchable and could even warrant a casual second or third viewing. I wouldn't bet this would warrant sequels just like T3, Salvation and Gensys before it.
My hope is that, someone goes back to the drawing board, skips Arnold, Hamilton and Furlong and just does the all-out future war we all wanted to see.",Terminator - Dark Fate

995,john-lancia-1,"Average movie, noob director who got lucky with Deadpool and loads of gender politics",4,14 January 2020,"Tim Miller clearly got lucky with Deadpool, he lacks vision and clearly was not up to the task of bringing back this franchise. FFS, he only had a couple of directing jobs before this. One wonders how he was handed this, other than maybe Cameron knew he could easily boss him around without having to go to the trouble of directing it himself. Lets hope he gets over the whole Avatar movie thing and gets back to directing good movies again.
Gender politics out the wazoo. Tired of having to suspend my disbelief as I watch 110 lb women beating up and tossing around guys twice their size. Hey Hollywood, there are believable ways to have women get the best of a man (or men LOL) that don't involve going head to head with them.
I have no idea who Dani is, I have nothing invested in her and the movie does nothing to invest me in her. Mackenzie Davis is a pleasure as always, she and Arnold are the two bright spots in this movie. Linda Hamilton is great, but the roll is unbelievable as its way to physical for a woman of her age. Lazy writing, why does everyone, even the senior citizen need to be an action hero. I am completely uninvested in the antagonist, he's generic and nothing about him is really new. His whole backstory seems to have been pulled from someone's behind. He just pops out of nowhere and is completely unconnected to the terminators of old. Just an average looking guy walking around and being average. I would rather watch a couple of T800's duking it out, bring on the robot musclemen.

The main actors did not seem invested in their characters and the emotional cues seem misplaced at times i.e. the actors seemed lost and they looked like they were trying hard to act/stay in character.Mixed with lame/poorly timed/cheesy humor and extreme character transition (e.g lost and meek to resourceful and confident out of nowhere), it made the movie seem like a B-grade made for TV or direct-to-dvd/bluray/streaming release. The plot twists try to be smart, shocking and funny, but they felt cheap and ridiculous as though the movie was a parody.Also, I can conclude that the trailers revealed too much which made the good parts not surprising. There is a lack of sense of fear/horror/suspense/techy to this sci-fi flick, unlike previous Terminator movies including the 'disowned' sequels. The soundtrack was also disappointing as the trailers gave an epic mispresentation. I gave 3 stars as the CGI and action sequences were pretty alright although not a game changer.

I actually really like the twists and plot points to this movie and the climax was satisfying to me unlike the previous 2 movies. I really don't understand the hate as I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and ending. And Linda Hamilton is back still a badass in her old age!!! Arnold too! The new terminatrix is cool too.

This makes the first two great Terminator films pointless, how disgraceful. John Connor is the chosen one, he always was from the very beginning but now they kill him off because today a WHITE man being a leader and savior of mankind is now ""offensive"".This movie replaces a white male leader to a minority female leader, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE??!! John saves mankind from a apocalyptic future, this new uninteresting female John does the same, again WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE??? WHAT'S THE POINT?? OH I know, its to push an agenda.So Arnold's memorable character T-800 kills John Connor (a young CGI Edward Furlong) in the first 5 mins of the film and Sarah failed to save him. The T-800 walks away to live in a mountains. Over three decade later we see an old man T-800 and has been living with two humans, a ""wife"" and ""child"", he's a family guy now because supposedly this old man Arnold has been adapting human anatomy ever since he killed John Connor and when it meets Sarah HE APOLOGIZES FOR KILLING JOHN!! ARE YOU EFFING Kidding ME??Terminator is pure machine, did they forget about ""No pain"" ""no remorse"" ""no pity"" ""no fear"" and in T2 ""I know now why you cry but that is something I can never do"" but in Dark Fate it feels...human..SMFHI will not discuss about the new characters, I dont care about them and the new Latino bad Terminator, who gets his back kicked all the time, whatever. Terminator franchise has been terminated for good.P.S. Terminator films died after T2.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1005,Sam56800,Mediocre,2,29 October 2019,"Mediocre at best. Not much different than the other miserable terminator sequels after T2 - just another popcorn flick in my opinion. The groundbreaking ideas, story, and technology explored in T2 are nowhere to be found here. It simply recycles a lot of the ideas you've seen in previous films. Cameron's involvement seemed to have little effect on the movie.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1006,dragon3611,Oh Dear!,5,9 November 2020,"Like many reviewers I am a huge fan of the first two films and had high hopes for this film to bring the franchise back to greatness, especially with Mr Cameron's involvement.
I am sad to report that it has failed in this respect. What it has turned out to be is an okish movies with loads of CGI and lots of the ""strong women"" agenda injected into it that seems to be one of the legal requirements these days - and that's about it.
Arnold and Linda, bless them, are looking tired now and have not been helped by an awful script.
Look, I can write down a terrible idea for a script in a few minutes - here goes.....
Right, how about we have Arnie as a new bad Terminator who kills John Connor in the first few minutes then decides to retire and settle down with a wife, kid and dog - he could call himself Carl and have his own business selling curtains or drapes....
Well sad to report that this is what actually happens in the film!!!!!
This was the final straw for my other half, who swore, got up and went to put the kettle on.
Arnold says at one point in the film ""I won't be back"" - I dont blame you Arnold.
Some of the effects in the film are good but there is one bit at the start when the bad Terminator is in a factory and he leaps about 25 feet up to another level and it looked so fake it made me laugh.
So there you have it - on its own terms it is a bit of entertainment to get you away from the real world for a couple of hours but I think they should knock these films on the head now - I don't think it is actually possible to top the first two amazing films and they should stop trying.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1007,joeman32,Worst Terminator in the franchise,3,27 January 2020,Linda Hamilton and Arnold couldn't save this one. Bad writing is bad writing. Terminators came off as more annoying than badass.

For those that get confused with multiple time lines and the like, matters are much more straightforward in this film. Along with some nice touches relating to the first two films. The action and the acting is on point, and the special effects seamless.
Every film needs a bad unstoppable terminator, and this is where this film excels. Avoid the spoilers as this is without a doubt the best part of the film.

1010,pvmerridew,How I hoped it wouldn't be...,2,19 September 2020,Not going to waste my time with a review on this...however...Absolutely shocking and out of respect for the original I've given this a two.,Terminator - Dark Fate
1011,lu_silvestri,Why so many haters?,7,12 March 2020,"Terminator Dark Fate exceeded my expectations.I sincerely expected an irrelevant, generic film, most of all, as was terminator genesis, but I was surprised.The film managed to innovate maintaining the aspects of the old ones, of fighting that holds our attention, unexpected twists and a well-developed story.The film manages to create a new timeline with new events that make the film innovative, instead of focusing on the same timeline and events that revolve around Sarah and her son JohnThe film kept me entertained from beginning to end, with action scenes comparable to the old ones, and without containing meaningless or poorly explained elements.Arnold Schwazeneger's participation was epic, and all the characters were convincing.There is a political agenda in some who criticize the film negatively, for having Mexican and female characters. In this case, it is not characterized as a feminist agenda or anything like that, since all the characters fit perfectly in the plot without being something very artificial and without credibility, even though this feminist militancy has already ruined many films, in this specific case I believe that it has not compromised credibility so much.As for the Mexican characters, it makes perfect sense, since ""the new Sarah"" is Mexican, so they found an actor ethnically compatible with Mexico (the bad terminator), precisely because the ""new Skynet"" knew where their target would be, and tried to make it as convincing as possible, so that he can disguise himself among civilians, something that would not happen so easily if the exterminator had a Nordic phenotype (for example), which is unusual in mexico, and would culminate in the individual having the appearance of a ""gringo"" and calling attention, everything that the Legion wants to avoid, as he tries to be as disguised as possible among the crowd.People are irritated by the film without reason, I don't see why so many complaints, this film was worthy of belonging to the exterminator series. Unlike Genesys that tried to innovate and ended up being generic, the dark fate terminator managed to innovate, bring something new, and keep the essence of the old.I found the story very well constructed, innovative, and the characters and the story compelling. The film surprised me, as I did not expect to see such a good film on the basis of such bad grades. I believe that most negative reviews are wrong, I don't understand why they think a movie like this is so bad.The only part I didn't like so much was the plane scene, which conveniently fell into the hoover dam, and ignoring some laws of physics, not to mention surviving water pressure and a drop of tens of meters, but let's face it, this is a film franchise where a robot from the future goes back in time to kill a leader of human resistance, so we can elevate suspension of disbelief a little.In addition, the villain is really dangerous, being the best exterminator ever made, extremely intelligent and effective, unlike Terminator Genysis, where they kill several exterminators as if it were a joke.The ending is pretty good, making a clear reference to the end of terminator 2 where Sarah Connor is in the park watching the kids play after they beat Skynet.And this film is one of the most underrated films I have ever seen, it deserved at least a score of 7 here , it is not fair what the ""critics"" are doing with a film as well built as this.10",Terminator - Dark Fate
1012,merlinsk,"I don't care what the haters say, I f*@#ing loved this!",10,4 March 2020,"I was 13/14 years old when I walked in to see the 15 rated Terminator 2 in '91 and honestly came out of the cinema a different person - I'd experienced nothing like it before. I bought the behind the scenes official magazine - the 90's version of DVD extras, the Marvel comic adaptation and the soundtrack and T2 remained my favourite film for the rest of the decade.I've approached every sequel with a mix of excitement and trepidation that I might relive some the the feeling that I got from T2, and each time I've come away disappointed - T3 was abominable and remains the worst effort, Salvation came close to what I'd imagined as a sequel to T2, but lacked something and came across as a good sci-fi war film, but just didn't cut it as a Terminator movie and although Genysis had potential it was spoiled by the weird timeline plotholes.Now, finally, Cameron is back and it shows!People have complained that it's a rehash - it isn't. Yes, there are similarities, but there were similarities between The Terminator and T2 too - the truck chase is in both, the factory is in both, but those similarities didn't detract from the quality of the sequel and they don't here either. To me there was only one action set piece that was very familiar - the early truck chase, and so what? It's a signature set piece that let's you know its a Terminator movie! All the others are either original ideas, or, in the case of the REV9 flying a police chopper, significantly different. Let's face it, the Terminator films are chase movies, how many ways to chase down people are there?!Granted, the REV9 is not as menacing as Robert Patrick's T1000, but it would take a miracle for anybody to get close to what is an almost perfect performance from Patrick, and despite some comments here, he is a worthy antagonist in a role that is tantamount to trying to play Hannibal Lecter in a post Anthony Hopkins world.Much has been made of John Connor's death. It was the right decision. Skynet was gone. As far as Sarah and John were concerned it was over. Without his death, they would have led quiet lives - no military training, just John growing up as Mr Ninetofive, no longer the saviour of the human race and Sarah would have no need to be in this movie, she'd be throwing giant balls around in the care home instead of being a motivated Terminator hunter able to help the new leader of the resistance.Which brings me to the backlash against this being a female led movie... So what? Its not a Ghostbusters type recast just for the sake of political correctness - Terminator had a strong female lead in 1984 for Christ's sake! John may have been destined to lead the resistance, but he'd have been nothing without the strength, resilience and determination of his mother. The whole franchise has been about the strong woman holding the destiny of the world in her hands, Sarah was the key to it all, and now Dani is the key to the new future, and good for her!The aged T800 is also not a rehash of Genysis - Cameron suggested that idea for Genysis, and now brings how he saw the idea to fruition here. And it works. It even makes sense - we know the T800 can learn and feel an emotional connection to humans, we saw it with 'Uncle Bob' in T2, so it's perfectly acceptable that a surviving T800 would learn to assimilate. What else could he do? We know he can't ""self terminate"" so he carries out the ultimate infiltration.Finally, after 29 years, a Terminator sequel I could come away from with a smile on my face having regained a little of that same feeling my 14 year old self felt all those years ago.The script is excellent and is convincing when so many time travel scripts fail, the acting is quality, apart from a wooden Linda Hamilton but that is no surprise and is bearable. The de-aging of Sarah and John is astounding, it will take your breath away, but for some reason the de-aging of Arnie doesn't quite convince somehow and the CGI pretty much remains that way all through - sometimes excellent, sometimes seeing the join - which is a shame considering T2 was a pioneer of CGI techniques.It's a shame that this didn't take at the box office which sadly probably means that there won't be further chapters. I for one am gutted about that.This movie does not deserve the vitriol aimed at it here , I hope it isn't motivated by the right-wing anti-#metoo, anti-PC, anti-'anybody but Americans being involved in Hollywood movies' crowd, but sadly I think it may just be the case...Ignore the reviews, including mine - they're all just opinions after all - go see this movie, watch it with an open mind. You never know, you may just be transported back to the 90's just like me!",Terminator - Dark Fate
1013,chaybear,Sadly average at best,5,24 October 2019,"I wanted to idolise this movie with a promise to terminator glory days from producer James Cameron and Linda Hamilton herself... However it sadly failed to deliver on so many levels. Even if this had been the first terminator movie ever made it still would of been average as hell, there was nothing unique or origjnal about it, no groundbreaking special effects, way to much cgi, a total redo of the John conner storyline which I hated... Linda Hamilton once was a hero warrior queen to admire and now she performs her lines in a camp way thst makes you laugh cos its so silly. Also why do men director's and producers have to turn strong women into women with booze and drug issues? Can't we just have a strong women withiut addiction issues?....

I really do not understand the point. Hollywood wanted to please whom with this? No normal people who liked the first 2 parts could bear this horrendous motion picture. The rest of the parts were even more horrible. Hollywood is so extremely dumb, they believe this is the type of movie we all want.No, we want movies with brain and heart!

It's hard to believe that the director and producers sat in the editing room and screening and said, ""this is it, this is the story we want to tell"". John Connor makes a brief appearance at the beginning of the movie but is quickly killed off because, well, in today's PC world you can't have a capable white male as the hero that saves humanity. Instead, we get 70+ year old geriatric Sarah Connor and a young Mexican illegal girl that save the world. They even throw in the T1000 morphing into a border patrol agent!

But it's just missing that special something. It suffers the same dark fate (see what I did there!) as the rest of the sequels after T2.

Grace, the human cyborg, is convincingly played by Mackenzie Davis, and Linda Hamilton rocks a Sarah Connor. Natalia Reyes as Dani shows the growth in her strength and courage throughout the film.

Everything was filmed Super Close Up! when what was often needed were some wide angle shots.There were multiple writers on this film, which is never a good sign to begin with, and not only does it show (in a bad way) it's like each fight/dialog scene was given to a different writer, with the explicit instructions not to talk to the other writers about how to tie in their scenes.The acting was also terrible with Linda Hamilton turning in her worst performance of her career, the only one who seemed to be taking their role seriously and trying to give a solid performance was Grace (Ms. Davis) everyone else was phoning it in.Saw it on opening day, there were 9 or 10 other people in a theatre designed to hold hundreds.

1039,rahmansadikur,Terminator has some romantic love affair lol,1,24 October 2019,They already messed up this movie I already knew the plot before the leaks don't take the genius to figure it out sorry Carl T800 kills John Connor in 1998 1 year what suppose to be judgment day there was no Edward furlong they just con the fans he was just the face of was digitalised I'm all female action women but when you ruin the existing story just to compliment the 2 girls it's worrying we live in a political correct environment but should you ruin the origin of the story just for the sake of it one thing genesis and dark fake has in common that John Connor gets killed off twice lol a lot of hardcore fans won't appreciate it James Cameron didn't care enough to fix it properly. bad acting all round bad story but rev 9 I was quite impressed with Sarah Connor was always great to see her true warrior . T800 has a small part( Arnold ) I'm glad I didn't pay for the ticket hope it flops so they never make another terminator movie Terminator was the best terminator movie of all time if James Cameron had any balls left is to to put the alternate ending of T2 and banish all the other Terminator movies terminate them for good please please say I'll won't be back.

1041,rahmansadikur,Terminator Dark crap,1,24 October 2019,John Connor dies this terminator makes me laugh to the max I'll be surprised if the movie makes a profit lol terminator having a family have they finally lost the plot wow I was gonna watch avatar 2 but after James Cameron helped ruined the film just goes to show he don't care bout the terminator franchise so I'll stop caring bout the avatar sequels the hell with James Cameron once a brilliant filmmaker I'll always be grateful of the films he gave us but this is a huge slap in the face to us true terminator fans thank you messing up this movie first it was father of the bride met terminator ( Genesis ) then you got run away bride meets the terminator ( dark date) I prefer salvation at least they tried to do it with dignity even rise of the machines was not bad even they got Linda Hamilton back true bad A but they ruined that character to sorry I'll hope they won't be back the only way is for them not to go to the cinemas hopefully it be an ultimate flop I'm pretty sure Untied states would be aware of the leaks I'm pretty sure it be flop there two I don't know what else to say except please terminate these so called sequels please this is beyond terrible,Terminator - Dark Fate
1042,rahmansadikur,Don't trust these new generation they ain't got a clue that gives the 10/10 lol,1,24 October 2019,We are the true terminator fans we know the origins so we ain't obsessed you people give ten out of ten because if you watched the original T1 and T2 you would surely wee yourself this ain't some marvel they have made this beloved terminator franchise into a high school reunion rubbish killing of John Connor was and forever will be the worst decision definitely slap in the face might to us real Terminator fans knows what they are talking about all you marvel fans out there don't talk how obsessed we are if you clearly don't know what they talking about I will give it props Rev 9 I thought was a cool looking villain grace acting pretty well dani Ramos bad acting bad directions I think you made the fans upset by killing John Connor just to replace by a girl character that nobody cares about simple you might as well put Carl (the age T800 in a tutu ) him married him being a father figure and you say you grew a conscience you a nothing but a cybernetic organism a CPU that was programmed and ordered by skynet to kill of John Connor how can you say you grew a conscience and another bad creative side of things man don't know if I should laugh or cry seriously Linda Hamilton is a true warrior shame she had to suffer the same Dark Fate she'll be having nightmares by taking on this project,Terminator - Dark Fate
1043,rahmansadikur,What nonsense James Cameron has lost his touch,1,25 October 2019,"We ain't got a problem with female warriors Linda Hamilton came in a time where movies actors mainly men but Linda was a fierce warrior she was the heart and soul of the movie, Terminator 2 was the best not because of male or female because the way it executed by James Cameron.At the end of the day you shouldn't make that sort of stereotype decisions how men are this that and other Dark fate will fail because the way they destroyed the origins of the story in Genesis ruined terminator 1 by rehashing 1984 and now in Dark fate they ruined terminator 2 because they killed off John Connor we ain't got a problem with female action hero's but when you meddle with the existing story completely wipe out the character and put new characters that no one cares about especially dani Ramos bad acting bad decisions bland story with no ounce of salt. Grace I'll say was good in the movie Rev 9 good choice of a villain but killing of John Connor was s bad decision any true terminator fan will tell you this and Carl getting married that is a terminator joke of the century and skynet gets replace leGion ,Rev 9 don't matter who gets killed off they'll will always find a replace very bad story telling it's sad you need 9 writers to ruined this film for lot of people Terminator 2 should of ended there where Sarah Connor stopped judgment day behalf of me and other terminator fans I'll wont be back.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1044,rahmansadikur,Very misleading Please terminate it for good,1,27 October 2019,"John Connor dies no more skynet , Carl T800 gets married after he kills John Connor and no Edward Furlong ain't in this movie except for digital purposes only last bout 3 mins in the movie but you see him on the casting list it's a huge slap in the face to us fans huge slap in the face for Edward furlong character

1046,rahmansadikur,Simple for terminator fans just don't see it say I'll wont be back this time it's for good,1,4 November 2019,You guys know the leaks by now but yet you rock and Moan you knew James Cameron lied about Eddie furlong being in the movie he's been killed off the movie but yet you go to the cinemas and see it and then moan about afterwards we warned you guys number of times of the leaks and please save your money check out the  spoiler alerts before seeing the movie save your money if you have any conscience what so ever it didn't even deserved to make 1 million let alone a one hundred million you guys help make that happened even though it looks like a flop but don't make it go any further other wised Hollywood will think we liked the movie when we don't simple logic I'm gonna use a arnold one liner ''I don't have respect for people who has no respect for logic'',Terminator - Dark Fate
1047,rahmansadikur,James Cameron and Tim Miller are idiots,1,4 November 2019,Dumb movie dumb story line it was James Cameron idea to kill off John Connor and then lied to us that he be in the movie pfff Tim Miller is the worst director ever imagine if you want it all universally appeal movie then stick to marvel or child friendly movie but don't turn a grown up movie into your own playground without knowing the fact James Cameron you have destroyed your fanbase my respect for you is 2-10 I can't give a zero because you gave us the first two terminator movies titanic and avatar but after your disloyalties to us fan I'm gonna be the first one to say  that I won't watch your future avatar films on cinemas I hope a lot of fans will agree with me,Terminator - Dark Fate
1048,chrisdye-17493,Action movie of the season,9,4 November 2019,I walked in the theater well aware people hated this movie but I went with a halfway open mind and let me tell you I loved it there was a ton going on so plenty to enjoy there were even a few laughs i totally say this is a movie to see,Terminator - Dark Fate

1050,me-79344,"Stop it now, enough !!",5,15 December 2020,"Only good thing about this movie are the action scenes. Other than that, there are plenty of negatives. The movie is a regurgitation of Terminator 2 with male John Connor being replaced by a female. I don't understand how one can make sequels if the story does not allow it. This movie seems to be more of a money minting thing which is banking on the success of the first two films to carry it through. Save your 2 hours and watch the action scenes directly on YouTube instead.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1051,almighty4,Surprisingly good,10,3 November 2019,"I saw Terminator (1984) in theaters as a kid. So as a huge fan of the first two films I feared another  sequel. It's a kickass action movie. With great performances, See it in theaters",Terminator - Dark Fate
1052,manmadan-1,Woman empowerment,7,1 November 2019,"If you see the latest Hollywood movies which had one thing in common. Women centric. This terminator is also falls into that category. Kudos to that. But we shouldn't expect Arnold as a lead star as it is advertised and if so, you will get more disappointment. Those who watched T2 very recently won't like this movie since this is mere resemblance of T2 with different actors. So, what this movie is offering you extra.
Mackenzie is in leading role. Very attractive. She had to tell ""I'm human"" all the time , to audience.
Linda has done her part as good as leading character.
Natalia has performed well and deserved to be saved from machines. There are few scenes which needed extra polishing in terms of dialogs, editing.
What is Arnold is doing here. He is helping to pull the audience into theatres. That's all.
I'm saying again, if you compare T2 with this one, this is going to be like Tesla vs Accord. Accord is affordable and many people likes it including me.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1053,furfur-1,"Dreadful dialogue, poor storyline, nice action",7,26 October 2019,"The dialogues of the movie are really bad. Almost always when a protagonist says something it feels kind of wrong. The worse part is by far the character of Sarah Connors and it is hard to overlook her.Beside this the storyline is pretty thin too but not bad. Some ideas are nice and I guess they made some courageous decision in the plot.The action scenes are really good. Yes, its basically always the same thing, some robots fighting each others and its well made. I had the feeling I had in the past watching T2.I found my peace with the movie, sure there was some obvious potential upward but we all know from our own experience that there is a lot of potential down. So dont expect that much and enjoy the action.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1054,JDoc33,Entertaining but not even close to T1 or T2,7,29 January 2020,"I love this franchise so I go into each sequel with great hope. As have most, I loved T1 and T2 - both were 10/10. T3 was a step down but I thought it was still pretty entertaining and kept with the story well enough. T4 Salvation sucked. T5 Genisys was at least entertaining although I didn't like the fundamental story and character turns. Dark Fate was probably most similar to Genisys with several story flaws and they were a little heavy-handed with their SJW message - here's a tip: if you want to make a movie that shows women can be heroes just like men, just create a story with a woman hero (see Alien franchise and the T1/T2); there shouldn't be a need to explicitly write it into the dialogue. Frankly, it comes off as condescending. This said, I did not think it ruined the movie.There was quite a bit of humor, especially when Arnold shows up. Between many of his lines, and the new terminator's lines, hardcore fans will be bothered by the out-of-character dialogue, but I was willing to look past it.Overall, it was a little disappointing, especially as a Terminator sequel, but it was at leas entertaining.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1055,gabaod2,how can this be a sequel?,4,27 January 2020,"Did the writers not realize its the t-800 trying to protect Jon in T2, and not trying to kill him, so why would a t-800 kill jon at the beginning of this film?

After watching this I didn't regret watching any of it it had a great movie plot and terrific action all the way through to the end. anyone who says otherwise is clearly a moron or not and a non-terminator and sci-fi fan so that the movie can truly be respected and enjoyed.

Which really didn't make any sense??The story is exactly the same as the original two but skynet doesn't exist it's a new future.There was so much potential with this movie yet it was so poorly written it's a shame.Arnie and Linda deserved so much more.I can see this movie being treated like the Ghostbusters 2016 remake as it focuses on women only.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1060,fantard,CGI: Cinematic Garbage Intensifies,2,5 November 2019,"The Arnie Terminator robot is now a drapes (curtains) salesman who lives with a Hispanic woman in the countryside -- complete with trusty mutt companion and a rocking chair -- and whose ageing seems to now run deeper than merely his epidermis, with even the metal endoskeleton of this apparent one-tonne hulking machine, swaying in a zephyr (...I know, I know -- John's ""gimmie five!"" hand slap moved the T's hand in T2... But, that movie was GOOD; Dark Fate is anything but).This timeline version of Sarah Connor is a crotchety cat lady, who seems to be stuck in some menopausal loop -- causing her to pulverise her dentures, through her constant, elderly angst induced grinding.The new Terminator (hunter) is... you guessed it -- NANO TECH!: Hollywoeful's new, do-anything magical technology, that allows the film 'creators' (*term used ironically) to throw all semblance of logic and continuity out of the window (Question: Why does a nano-bot Terminator need to seep into a computer KEYBOARD in order to control control it?... Skynet-cum-Legion didn't have USB 3.0 technology in the post-apocalyptic, time-travel-happy future?).Then we have the ""saviour"" of the homo-sapien species: an Instagram generation, air-headed, teenage Latino girl (naturally)... To compliment the aforementioned Latino nano-T, and Arnie's Latino helpmate (of course).
>""It's like pottery. It rhymes."" ~ George LucasRounding out the leads, there is said she-Jesus's obligatory protector: this time, a cyborg of sorts; who, in-keeping with the ""WOKE"" zeitgeist (the U.S. zeitgeist, that is) is an incarnation of Ellen DeGeneres--had she decided to fully transition.The film itself is irrelevant, as it completely defecates all over the Terminator legacy, while presenting one of the most vacuous and poorly conceived pieces of sci-fi cinema since... Well, not that long ago. The action set pieces make Capcom video game intros look like Terrance Malick's flowing curtains; the blither betwixt, as pertinent to the astronomical pay cheques all those who partook in this scatological schlock were clearly beeline focused on, as the dialogue is in an instalment of Resident Evil.Look, I've been one of the biggest critics of oft-derided "" cinema -- for context: ""Watchmen"" being one of the very few, pure comic book films that I've genuinely enjoyed -- after realising, well over a decade ago, that the process line production philosophies of the Mammon-worshipping film industry, combined with the exponential rate of technological advancement, would invariably bring down sci-fi cinema as whole. So, the fact that T:DF is a conga line of strung-together video game cut-scenes, is hardly surprising to me.Nobody listened to me then, and no one will listen now. Why?... Because, as with the world at large, the overwhelming majority of film-goers are far closer to what would clinically test as being of a ""subnormal intelligence"". It is these dull, bovine eyes, representing the demographic of easy-to-amuse cash cows, who the film industry must arrest with their computer-generated boom-crash operas -- in order to continue to propitiate to their patron daemon of wealth disparity and greed... Immolating all artistic integrity and creative merit along their merry way to the netherworld.As karma would have it, Terminator: Dark Fate will lose money -- hand-over-fist, in fact (*at time of writing, it is projected to end up US$100M in the red). However, this will in no way deter avaricious producers from investing into such bottom-feeder bilge -- safe in the knowledge that every patrician film-goer lost, simply frees up the market for further exploitation of the endless masses of mindless mouth-breathers... And the reality of this now imminent, dark future, is as accursed a fate as any imaginable for this entertainment medium.After all, if our species forfeits the only string to its bow that separates us from the animals -- creativity -- would we even have reason to fight an artificial intelligence that deemed us disposable? Really makes one think...
2/10",Terminator - Dark Fate
1061,sameenuk,Just left feeling empty,3,24 October 2019,"I should begin by saying i never watched any Teminator film after T2. I noticed many people recommended this film on the back of it being better than genesys. I'm coming at this fresh after watching last night.Deep down, the film isn't a sequel of T2. Its a self-conscious retread. The weakness was in the story. Its very much an action film with a lot of chasing, CGI and some brilliant fight scenes.I believe this film is full of plot holes. This is a slight spoiler although very well trailed. In essence, the opening of the film starts with the death of John Connor as a teen by an Arnie who was meant to have been in molton lava but sent back in time. Linda then asked, ""if they destroyed Skynet then who gave this order"". And here I agree there was this lingering distrust between Arnie T-800 and Sarah o'Connor.Thats where the problem starts in this film. In essence they left the question unanswered and simply transitioned the plot so Skynet was rebranded as Legion and a new target found for a terminator.Lets be fair to this film. Where it invested in the story, e.g. the story of Grace - i think was very well done. She had a character arc revealed slowly. The film swerving to the big reveal over the relationship between protector and protected. It was good story tellingAlso, the terminator, aside from the hokey CGI was very very menacing and relentless. Some good use of unsettling music. He was very convincing. But they kept pushing this wierd exoskeleton with its own almost semi AI. This thing was unstoppable in the same way as the terminator sent in T2 to kill John Connor.But the problem was the breathless chase and action scenes. They were huge and major set pieces, including two C5 bombers. It just didn't stop. I felt the film was levering these in (including borrowing from T2) just to hide from a lack of story.That left the characters. I have to admit i felt very little for Grace. Sarah o'Connor got my nerves. Arnie as a kind of reinvented himself terminator seemed lacking. And its because they didn't bother to explore the character. Grace asked Arnie whether he developed a conscience, shocked, they left it.Arnie protected Sarah o'Connor from certain death - but wasn't she meant to be the one protecting the world from him. Their relationship was actually weird as it turned out just as he was getting orders when he was a T-800, now he was giving them for a human to do the terminating. But did they explore that contrast, no, because there was no a time.I've said very little about the crux of the film. the character of Dani Ramos. And it was because she was pretty but forgettable until the end. Her brother was the more compelling character. She toughened up by the end in much the way Sarah did.What i do remember are the imaginative fight scenes, the almost devilish like agility of the Rev-9, the physics defying mechanics of a liquid metal T2. But there was nothing at all about AI or the role of advanced intelligence.For an advanced machine, it sure seemed to fall for the same traps again and again.I hoped for more than this from this film. It was highlighted and had a great trailer. But it really was a very superficial film. There was no depth to the story, and the film almost was looking for any way to a carry linda hamilton",Terminator - Dark Fate
1062,gbrezina2015,At least it has Linda Hamilton,7,30 October 2020,"I didn't see any of the other movies since #3. This one is not bad, at least it's a terminator movie which is better than no terminator movie. And it has Linda Hamilton. She is the main feature in every Terminator movie without her there's no movie.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1063,JerryCantrell,Did people give this an honest chance?,10,10 October 2020,"Title says it all. Much like a band such as Radiohead taking a different direction with Kid A, this movie brings exciting new things to the table while remaining true to it's sources feel.
I'm easy to please though, other than Terminator 3, I've been a pretty big fan of the series through and through. Still, I really marvel at how well they integrated two of our favorite heroes with new depths and storylines amongst newbies who admittedly took to the roles very well.
Something I noticed on this feeling that kind of escaped me last time when the lead three female roles are on the road, I'm not sure I ever saw a collection of more feminine badasses on screen in my entire life. It felt natural, and not force fed either, all believable in their roles.
Linda Hamilton absolutely slayed it in this. I loved how both her and Arnold had important parts in the movie, but that the other actor is held their ground and didn't require them to completely steal the show to make it work.
Say what you will, but if you didn't find the action scenes in this impressive and creative than, well I'm not sure what to say to change your mind.
While this may fall just short of being a classic, the ridiculous three-star ratings in the like, are just irritating and a part of a bigger problem where people either overate or underrate movies severely these days.
I'd rate this a very very solid 8.5/10. Just finished rewatching it today, and it's probably the most modern movie that I've actually taken the time to rewatch and enjoy thoroughly the second way through in a long time.
Of note, Mackenzie Davis absolutely pulled off the badass roll fantastically.",Terminator - Dark Fate

1065,shnames87,"Not the best, Not the worst",7,26 December 2019,"I love the Terminator franchise and will go see any of them any time. And I understand that it is hard to follow Terminator and T2 Judgment Day. This movie did its best to follow those two and went along as though T3, Terminator Salvation as well as Terminator Genisys didn't happen, I'm fine with that since in a movie series with time travel it is easy to still enjoy them as a different time line of events. But it is far from the best one and had an ample amount of flaws that made me regard it as just meh and feeling that 7/10 is generous.The acting was fantastic that is hard to argue with and the cast did a wonderful job. I enjoyed their performances and like all the new faces as well as the old. The actor can only do so much with what they are given to work with.I did like the over all story and the new direction it took away from the other films. But at the same time it seemed like it was trying to make you forget about the past movies and try to make its own series with this being the starting. The story could have been done while maintaining more of what made the old films great. It would have been nice to have more characters from the first two brought back in some role or another other than the ones that were. This is some what hinted at with an air-force officer at one point but never followed through with.I was reading before the movie and some people seemed to have an issue with the predominantly female cast and those people should just keep quiet. The Terminator franchise has always had a strong female lead and I see no problem with them adding more female characters into the mix, more power to them for it and it was done very well.My biggest issues with this film were with how the story was told, some visual issues I had and the general flow of the film which made it lackluster.The story is told from multiple perspectives I feel, stemming form all three main characters as well as an old terminator. All of which had interesting stories to tell but they seemed to jammed in to make any of them all that good. In the first two the story is confined primarily to just Sara Connor and Reas in the first one and the Terminator in the second one making for less drastically different stories to try and combine togetherThe visuals of the movie are aggressively CGI and it made the movie seem cartoony at times. The director went over board with the outlandish fight scenes that had to be done with CGI to make them work, the first two relied much more on practical effects and used CGI to smooth out those practical effects where this one was just all CGI at many points. It lacked much of the grit that made the others so great.The general flow is to fast and jumps far to often in sequences where we see the future there is little back ground given and seemed very brushed over. There was to much additional information that they skipped over in order to have drawn out fight scenes. It should have been longer.Over all I would say to check it out if you like the series but unlike Terminator and Terminator 2 which I can and would watch over and over again. I will not be in a rush to see this one again any time soon",Terminator - Dark Fate

1068,DreadfulA,Terminator franchise after 1997 is a deleted timeline,4,28 January 2020,"This movie should have never been made. Can we send a robot back in time to prevent this? Or maybe convince James Cameron to do this in the nineties when the franchise was still fresh? But instead we got Titanic, and the franchise was allowed to continue after 1997.The biggest flaw of Dark Fate is that it tries too hard to be serious successor to T2, but instead the movie turned out a big mess. I love The Terminator, and even though T2 was a mighty movie it was still basically a remake of the original with a 100 times the budget and emphasis on action more than scifi-horror element. Both movies played on different strengths but worked because they had vision and focus, but Dark Fate has none of that. It is not ""dark"" or as frightening as the original, and the character development is nowhere near as remarkable as in T2.The cast did a pretty good job, and Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor was as badass as ever, but then we have two more heroines, Dani and Grace, who left poor Sarah into their mighty shadow. Sarah seemed just as ancient and obsolete as T-800: a relic from deleted timeline, who served no purpose in this movie, unfortunately. What can you do when you have a new female John Connor and female Marcus Wright, an enhanced soldier as powerful as this new cyborg called Rev-9, which seemed to be a mixture of previous models like T-1000 and T-X. Although it didn't have weapons like T-X but could separate into two detaching the liquid form from metal endoskeleton, which was pretty cool. Unfortunately the actor was not very menacing as a terminator and I almost felt sorry for the character since it played a part of a ragdoll and was many times underpowered against the joint female resistance forces.Let's be honest here, I have nothing against a female hero, one at a time, but this setting seems to become the norm in many movies of recent (Star Wars) where women consume the whole (action) movie and it really just looks stupid. Like I said, Sarah was tough enough in T2, she didn't need sidekicks, and here T-800 or ""Carl"", an iconic villain and Arnold's most recognized character was downgraded into a housewife, huh? Who the hell wrote this drivel? Come on! How times have changed... And yet they think that audience is going to swallow that crap claiming that T-800 felt he didn't have a purpose after finishing his mission and suddenly grew an equivalent of a concience and became a family man?! I have never laughed this hard when watching a non-comedy. Many people critisize Genisys, but at least it didn't take itself too seriously, and Pops had decency to live in solitude and not grow an ego. Many times as a kid I imagined what would a terminator do if have killed John? Maybe self-destruct, but deffo not pretend to be a human. T-800 are infiltrators merely by design and appearance, without programming they wouldn't do anything, at least not feel urge to seduce a woman. And don't give me the bull about Carl's relationship being non-physical, seriously? As if a woman wouldn't see anything wrong in her man that does not sleep, eat, use toilet, exercise etc. ever, yeah right. If humans are that stupid, maybe Legion should win. Oh, and one thing, if Cyberdyne Systems/Skynet timeline was deleted, why did T-800 still exist? And where did this Legion originate? No explanation whatsoever, shows how much they care.Big franchises nowadays have unfortunately steered very far from creative freedom and only rehash and collect ticket sales. It's just sad that former great directors like Cameron and R. Scott lose their touch, and I think they should leave the beloved franchises alone if they lack so much vision to do anything with it. Dark Fate basically took every action scene and plot twist from first four movies and gave nothing new, just made the whole storyline even more confusing and idiotic. I might just take it back and claim that a reason why Cameron probably didn't do a third movie in the nineties, is not because he wanted to do other things but because he obviously didn't have a vision of it. Otherwise it would be held clear to this day and carried out accordingly. A creative person does not lose one's unfulfilled vision, ever. Dark Fate is just a rushed generic action flick and not deserving to be counted as Terminator movie, let alone a sequel to T2 timeline.",Terminator - Dark Fate

1071,jamesjump,It's really not that bad,9,4 November 2019,"Honestly it's really not that bad, it could have been a lot worse, like the past three sequels, which were awful just awful. Spoiler ahead:
So the beginning of the movie they killed John Connor, okay fine they're basing the whole rest of the movie on this. And there's going to be plot point repeats from the original T1 and T2 ahead, but hey, what else were they supposed to do? I mean to make it fresh and relevant what else were they really supposed to do? They've done everything else in the sequels that sucked already... to make it new and fresh and relevant, this is what James Cameron thought he had to do! So...fine, once you get past that and you accept that it's an entirely different movie albeit with some of the same characters as the former first two movies, then you can sit down and have a fun ride. If you're going to be like one of these trolls that have given it a one or two rating just because you didn't like the way James Cameron took the story, then of course you're going to be bitter by the end.
But, if you sit back, try not to take it to seriously, youre in for some fun action and some mind-blowing sci-fi, you might actually even have a good time.
I mean all these movies are, excuse me, these sequels, are anymore, is just junk food for the brain. If you're expecting more than that you really will be disappointed.
And of course some of you will be saying of course I'm disappointed! I was expecting more! This is James Cameron after all! He should have done better...well sorry to disappoint you, but he's not perfect, he's human, unlike the machines in his movie, he did what he thought was best for the movie, and quite frankly, I agree.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1072,malcolmwrites,Serious Question. Serious Problems.,3,10 November 2019,"I'm a huge fan of T1 and T2, and even Genisys, on second viewing, was better (or, at least more entertaining) than I remembered it. I could live without T3, Salvation, and the Sarah Connor Chronicles and never lose a minute of a sleep. Which brings me to Dark Fate.I look for newness in films like this. Something unique and original. T1 and T2 were ground-breaking in their own ways. Dark Fate takes a chance (for which I give it full credit) by successfully and admirably switching away from the cliched ""man as savior"" trope. I love that this is a Terminator action movie with all the chases, stunts, battles, shootouts, close calls, etc. but with no men in it. (The meat of the movie involves three women and two robots.)[Note: This is the part where some sanctimonious and embarrassingly insecure misogynstic knuckle-dragger goes on a rant about my ""liberal agenda"" and ""man-hating"" and blah, blah, blah. For the record, I am proud of being a liberal-it means treating everyone with empathy and respect and recognizing that I'm not the centre of the universe-and I have no love for so-called ""men"" who are threatened incontinent by anyone with two x-chromosomes.]Okay. Enough of my own ranting. Back to the movie...I didn't like it. Other than its heroic evolution in gendered story-telling terms, it adds nothing to anything. It's a CGI fest with all the same highway chases, improbable / impossible escapes, mass murders of innocent civilians, and the slaughter of countless anonymous police officers and guards, all at the hands of a far too indestructible pseudo-cyborg. Put spandex on everyone, and you've got yourself a very average, by-the-book superhero movie, which it's not supposed to be. This is supposed to be sci-fi. The two genres require a different set of suspended disbelief.The biggest problem I have with this movie, though, is the timeline. Maybe I'm missing something, but doesn't T2 end with Good Guy Arnie committing suicide, effectively wiping out the last remaining chip that could possibly lead to Cyberdyne / Skynet, Judgement Day, or to the creation of any other Terminators?If so, where does the Terminator who kills John Connor come from? I honestly don't know, and I'm fully open to an explanation. I spent most of the movie trying to reconcile this seemingly gaping plot hole.On top of that, I've got a gripe with the indestructibility of the Legion Terminator. If it takes two hours for our three heroes (including an augmented wonder woman, an actual terminator, and the future savior of the human race) to kill just one of them, how on earth did humanity manage to last more than six or seven seconds trying to fight against them in the future? A couple dozen of those immortal, two-in-one terminators could wipe out all of civilization before you could say, ""Arnold Schwarzenegger.""Okay, that's enough for now. I won't even get into the incredulity of some parts of this movie. (Standing stock-still on the extended ramp of a military transport plane in flight, driving a Hum-V underwater, using a length of chain to defeat a bullet-proof machine, etc.)If you're a fan of the franchise, skip this one. Sure, it's got a unique gender twist, and it's canonical according to James Cameron. But that doesn't mean it's any good.",Terminator - Dark Fate

1078,auritone,Terminator Deja Vu,5,2 December 2019,"Dark Fate is not a bad movie - it is just an amazingly irrelevant one making it almost offensively mediocre.
I felt there might have been a glitch in the Matrix, because if you have seen Terminator 1 and 2 (or 3 for that matter), you have seen this one. It hits all the same story beats and even has almost identical scenes with a little variation. We have the Terminator hunting our heroes in a truck, we have the jail scene (now changed to border patrol), we have the Terminator that can change into anything or anyone it touches etc etc. But most baffling of all they decided to change John Connor (the pivotal character of all previous Terminator movies, with the exception of Genysis that turned him into a villain for some reason) to Dani Ramos and Skynet to Legion. You would think they did that in order to tell a different story, but you would be wrong. It is in fact the EXACT same story - AGAIN - making the opening scene completely irrelevant. I can only speculate, but it seems to be there for shock value alone as - despite director Tim Miller's explanations for this choice in interviews - it has no impact what so ever on the overall plot - it is merely a re-skin.
Another gripe I have with this movie is the action sequences - especially the one leading up to the final confrontation. It is a very long and elaborate sequence involving a crashing plane and a dam, and feels incredibly out of place in a Terminator movie. Have we had over the top sequences in Terminator before? Yes, but they usually involved the Terminators while the humans were busy getting out of there. It created a nice contrast between the invulnerability of the Terminators and the frailty of humans. To see humans bounce around like rubber balls in a sequence so over the top it would feel quite at home in a Superhero movie, frankly made me laugh out loud.
Hollywood, things do not need to be be bigger, have more explosions, or x number of wow factors to be intense. Just look at the original Terminator... All you made here, was a cartoon!
With that said, the actors do a fine job with what they have, the action sequences are well done (though they get too over the top for me), and the movie is overall well made, and if you have never seen a Terminator movie my personal gripes should not bother you.
But I have to thank Dark Fate for at least making me find a rather surprising feeling of renewed appreciation for Salvation, because at least it tried - failed, but tried - something a little different, rather than telling the same story over and over and trying to hide that behind ever more elaborate and cartoonish action sequences and a somewhat desperate appeal to nostalgia through Linda Hamilton's beloved Sarah Connor and Arnold's T-800.
You get a better sense of nostalgia by just watching Terminator and Terminator 2 again.
Terminator sadly seems to be a franchise that can only tell one story.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Obviously not as good as the first two, but honestly can you really expect anyone to make anything close to T2? That's a once in a lifetime movie that is as close to perfect as you can get. I went into this expecting trash and I was quite surprised that it kept me on the edge of my seat with great action and a far better story than the previous sequels.

10/10 for Linda und Arny",Terminator - Dark Fate
1087,iremvidewb,Seems incomplete,3,14 January 2020,"The Connor story that Terminator-watchers are familiar with is pretty much this film, except instead of John there is Dani (who will lead the resistance) and instead of Skynet there is Legion (which is the identical future threat). The problem is that this movie does not tell the story better than the Connor version and therefore lacks a reason to exist other than to sell tickets to watch people and robots fight.Where the Arnie Terminator would have been the muscle to protect John, there is now a human who has been enhanced with future robotic technology. Overlap occurs when the Arnie introduced in the starting minutes decides to help later on, making it a puzzle why John is killed by this Terminator at the start instead of being protected by it; but of course, this otherwise unnecessary complexity is needed for the John/Dani swap.The hybrid named Grace had enough about her to be interesting with different parts of her life being shown. The character of an innocent eventually becoming a soldier hardened through hybridization just to keep up with the bots yet still vulnerable, being just one of many soldiers destined to die, shone through in Davis' acting.Dani, however, had no such depth of character. It is possible she could learn it through the hardship to come. But she doesn't really do that much throughout the movie except for one decision at the end (""this is our kill-box"" the equivalent of ""it ends here"", the scriptwriters trying to indicate readiness for leadership). When she learns that it is she who will be leading the resistance, the moment is quite forgettable. I did not get any sense of awe or terror about the magnitude of that statement and the unprecedented kind of suffering now sure to be awaiting her.As seen in The Sarah Connor Chronicles, not only has John been training for his future leadership position at the head of humanity's resistance but the prospect of such responsibility has a certain emotional derangement that he also must deal with. In Dark Fate, it seems that Dani bares her fangs after one decision and accepts the future simply, only hours after having been parted from a very different life to what she has just entered.A final point on John Connor: I know it is just a movie but I found it distasteful to watch him get shotgunned as a child. The Terminator-vision and camera angles mostly obscured his wounds but considering the same story (but with Dani and Legion instead) was told anyway...Legion replaced Skynet. Same threat. The Arnie mentioned a calculation he made of end-of-the-world scenarios justifying his home armory; I wonder if 'Legion' could have been one of these alternate scenarios to vary the story a bit. How was Legion created? Could it have been prevented? What people were responsible for its development? Why does it, too, create Terminators? None of this was answered because it is actually Skynet for another movie.The fight scenes were imaginative enough but the CGI nowadays is just too obvious and everyone knows the outcome; one or two characters may die but not the hero. The fighting is just the loading screen for this outcome. What would have been interesting is if the supposedly 'deadliest Terminator' won and the ""dark fate"" was sealed. They could even bring out more movies with characters trying to rectify the dark fate despite their one hope being lost.There was a moment when Sarah had the enemy Terminator down and out in front of her but she ran back to watch her car getting stolen instead of finishing the kill. She seemed so prepared. I think she could have ended the film right then if she hadn't been written to be distracted.The vision of a future being dictated by an anti-human AI with control of deadly weapons captures the imagination, but all that was done in this film was an inferior retread of something already made. 3 stars for Grace, production values, and not being offensively bad.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1088,wire_,Terminator: Dark Fate (2019),1,2 November 2019,"Terminator: Dark Fate (2019)Once again we have a movie about nothing but another movie. And in what's become a stereotypical formula of banal, derivative, demographically pandering action nonsense. A shameless milking of a franchise, level and degree of plot and characterization here are so repetitious and pitiful it defies reason.The script is almost untouched by thought. But in a way scarier than pure ignorance: this product eschews thought altogether and we have to wonder if the infotainment industry is the AI the characters are fighting against. This movie utterly disdains knowledge of every and any kind. As if someone or something is doing extra work to make dumb, it's a production of an execrable psychic pablum that's computed to sell to some lowest common denominator. Like TV news, you become dumber from watching this stuff.There are five scant minutes of enjoyment to be had here in company of old Linda Hamilton meeting Arnold (Carl) at his woodland home, where he passes time hanging drapes, scanning for time waves, sending cryptic terminator arrival coordinate texts to Hamilton's bag of Lay's chips (yes, potato chips) and endlessly rehearsing a game-nite Corona beer commercial. The humor of the Deadpool director peeks through in this interlude--cleverness akin to the first 20 minutes of Deadpool, during the setup, before it flips into claptrap.Here the enjoyment comes from the situation that T101 Carl, once freed of his directive to destroy John Connor, has an epistemic realization: he needs a reason to live! So he becomes a step father to a boy like John. Arnold plays it stern but surprisingly light on his feet, and it feels fun. Too bad these five minutes are just a desperately needed rest-stop in this otherwise relentless vehicular incursion of the neocortex.Save for this precious five minutes, TDF blows every other chance, no matter how small, to have fun with the series, and to reflect on the nature of experience, aging, and wisdom.It seems as if this decade of movies there is inspiration and writing talent behind the scenes somewhere, trying to get work done, but it keeps getting sidelined by producers at the controls of a script analysis computer. Like Terry Gilliam's Brazil is a formal description of the movie industry.I feel for Linda Hamilton as she clearly cares about her character. She's fully present, this script doesn't allow her to manifest past a relic.The two leads in this movie are props to make it pliable for viewers born far after the original movies. As the main story arc tracks these two, what we have pure demographic pandering. Great news, World! A latina chica can be the leader of a revolution against against the crazy militaristic machine of capitalism--er, no The Man--just like back in day any red-blooded American boy could grow up to be El Presidente of the USA.Not!Entrée the sheer contrivance of the screenplay: the hero becomes the hero because she's the hero. And eat your vegetables! So ""Dani"" becomes the leader of the ""human resistance"" (whatever this term means, esp as A.I. Carl is pretty much now at the top of the human game by virtue of platonic fidelity to his wife, willingness to change diapers and ""being a good listener"") because as a sort of pretty Ché Guevara, Dani saves and befriends a cutely androgynous /girl/boy/girl being harassed by stereotypical redneck... Oh, never mind... And this girl becomes--though forces and logic that will forever remain unknown to viewers--physically augmented into a sort of robot, who then is sent back in time to protect our nascent leader-to-be, so the ordeal between them can lead to leader-to-be's leadership. Whew. And yikes! This stunning plot cycle requires an impetus, supplied directly in the form of a T E R m i n A t O R who can be both TXXX and T1000 at once. He has no personality at all. He's just an inverted mcguffin supplying needed pressure to push nascent leader to become Dear Leader... Waagghhh! Yes they really wrote it this way.As an aside, now that I think about it, hero-is-hero-because-hero is a teleology for this age in that it eradicates causality in the creation of meaning and substitutes a catch phrase: ""You can do it!"" This feels both true to life and slyly artistic.As another aside, I've seen no other movie that wanted so much to be over at the outset. Old Cameron was obliged to produce one damn more movie and he just gritted his teeth and went 'OK people let's get this over with!...'In T1, the recursive plot cycle is done artfully with a clever deployment of the Grandfather Paradox around a love interest for the protagonists, which audiences generally had no reason to see coming, and which was delightfully foreshadowed by the setup with Sarah's roommate's on-the-make BF. Yet even if you do see it coming, It unfolds with several layers of reveals and character awakenings. In T1 we're both shown and told a bizarre course of events. This is enjoyable, and makes for a cool movie because our rooting for Sarah is impelled by feelings of excitement and mystery for a young women energized by a strange fate to a heroically new yet traditional expression of love.So TDF tries to be a beat-for-beat rehash of T1, the same way Star Wars EpVII was a beat-for-beat rehash, except TDF leaves out 3/4 of the beats. And it resorts to boringly telling us what's going on. But what's to reveal? You already know. TDF is a silly cartoon.Interestingly, the ascension of Dani requires the eradication of Mid90s John Connor at the outset. And Dani has a protector in Grace, leaving Hamilton nothing much to do but pine for some antiquated ideal of a post-feminist womb.Also interesting is that men don't quite exist in this movie, in an inverted case of the Bechdel observation.Arnold playing the T101 surprised me as the one human-being in this tale. And he plays it like an ex-Governor of California!This movie's action is a slugfest of visual noise without tension, purpose, or physics. Time loops in scripts, even as insipid as this script is, are fun as they play with the nature of memory and anticipation. But ignoring physical law is ruinous to action, making it ludicrous and painful to watch. These dayz all the action is simulated, just some fever dream in a warehouse of CG operators; an engineered hallucination.The most vibrant scene in this movie is lifted verbatim from T2JD and stuck underneath the opening credits. Recall the video recording of anguished, grunting Sarah Connor played on the raster-scan TV of the mean prison psychiatrist: ""Anybody not wearing 2,000,000 sunblock is gonna have really a bad day!""It's also pretty cringey out of context and comes off as lost in time and place. The threat of nuclear annihilation--which is still a very real and present danger--seems to have long since been occluded from the popular mind, replaced by dread of the slow-motion anthropogenic climate bomb that's been going off continuously for the last 250 years. So why should the specter of nuclear war frighten us now when it's so made-for-TV?I was not unhappy to see latent weak polemics about how horrifying and militaristic US border policing has become. Seems America also has long since shoved the Berlin Wall and Apartheid down the memory hole.There's a quip about the lunacy of gun-fetish survivalists which felt forced, but at least it's in there.These gestures are the evidence of a Cameron touch. Though they're phoned in; hackneyed and trivial ideological subtexts with no bearing on any course of the events.There's also a quirky moment at Arnold's crib where when he (Carl) remarks that Sarah's arrival may expose his true identity to his ""wife"" who along with his ""son"", exist as nothing more than props. Holding a lime-capped Corona, a boozy (we're told but not shown) Sarah and Carl openly discuss how Carl's wife hasn't noticed he weighs 400 lbs, pointedly suggesting that Sarah has sexual ideations about T101, whom she still hates and wants to destroy. This sort of odd humanity is scarce but welcome in a movie about killer robots and lack of industrial ethics.Don't let me get too twisted on this last point. The real hazard of technology is not that robots will reign supreme over people, it's that people are turning into robots. And this movie is close to the edge, because it trivializes everything it touches and uses applied psychology to sell itself under auspices of an insipid platitude of self determination. Watch and become free!This ""product"" is DOA, and Arnold will tell you so himself during the course of events. Genisys is almost profound and engaging by comparison, omg.Cameron must be suffering from same industry institutional decay as George Lucas to let his name be connected to this. The rot is in the industry head.However, if the contents of this movie is merely its subtexts, and there are various, ranging from hazards of surveillance and militarism, ideals for more open families, and more civilized medicine, then these are a few tiny reasons to not give up hope. These subtexts are James Cameron's indelible marks upon the product and signs there are still human beings employed in production.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Remember in T2 when the T 800 went head to head with the T 1000 and always lost because the T1000 was better. In this movie though Rev 9 has awesome capabilities it is whipped by the T 800.Some action scenes are rip offs of the he ones in T2.The hand to hand combat is not elaborate like the one in T2.

The last-minute appearance Arnold Schwarzenegger is rewarding. This story is no goofier than any of the others, there will always be potholes in time travel movies. The most enjoyable thing about the movie is the action sequences. I've seen every Marvel movie in the last 10 years and Marvel movie action is so predictable, a slugfest which is so boring, watching superheroes punch each other. These fight scenes were completely chaotic and impossible to predict where they were going to end up which was so much fun. Same with the car crashes and helicopters and planes.

I understand, with a reboot comes new characters/actors. However, Mackenzie Davis was painful to watch and the concept of her character was equally stupid. She was a scene killer at every turn. She had no chemistry with the other characters. Nothing about her backstory was interesting. Mackenzie Davis' acting skills are so unbelievably poor and painful.On a positive note, the fight scenes and chase scenes were very fast, new, fresh, and exciting. The special effects and actions scenes are top notch. I love that Linda Hamilton was brought back to this series finally.

At the time of writing this, I've watched 1h of the movie (half) and I'm sick of it.Next may contain SPOLERS!1. Why in gods name mexicans? Statistically speaking, a chinese person has 1/5 chance of leading the resistance. But no, because some country's politics won't allow it. Nevermind that. The story is always about america, so they move there.
2. New terminators. Plural. From ""future that never happened""? But killed John. What they intended to do. But their future never happend. Why? Who cares! L - Logic (left the chat).
3. New terminator has some tricks. Probably better CPU or some crap. Can make a clone of some kind, can change to whoever and WHATever, but he feels like that clumsy guy in your class that can't do $hit. Instead of producing a weapon and shooting he runs at you. But when he runs at you, he kills other people in his way. Seriously, the director of the movie should be fired!
4. Too much CGI. I guess, it's easier to make a computer image of frozen cloth falling on the ground, than to make actual frozen cloth falling to the ground (sarcasm). I understand that it's sci-fi, but why?! It's overusing it till the point it sickens viewers!
5. Of course, the icon heroes. And new players. Do you remember your first job? The one you hated the most but you needed it becasue it would give you good recommendations for the next bigger job? This movie is like a promotion for those actors. But sadly, their acting SUCKS! Even in 3rd rate movies you can see more feelings, emotions from actors, but not here. Even old Sarah seems like a crazy old B. who has to retire.
6. The story - nothing new. Absolutely. Even the movie before thsi one had some interesting plot twist. But this one is a terribly copy. And to make loose ends be good ends - they included old Sarah.
I don't know if they tell the whole story in the rest of the movie why there managed to prevent skynet, or how another net came to be, how every net decided to use time travel (and fail) - I don't care honestly. My guess is producers left it unanswered cause they were sinking in their bs as it was.So to sum it up:

However, since Terminator 2: Judgement Day was the best film in the franchise and by the looks of the other sequels after, it is incredibly difficult to make the sequels as good or even better.Starting with the good parts of the film was the CGI, fight scenes, and cinematography. I really loved the set design overall.But the visuals can't carry the film itself.From the beginning, the first few minutes was a huge shocker but not in a good way. Sarah Connor's personality seemed a little grouchy and sarcastic. I also had difficulty connecting with Grace's personality too. Dani wasn't bad of a character, but the cliches that come from the previous Terminator films made it difficult to see her as an original characters. You'll know what I mean when you see or if you've seen the film. ""Carl"" is entertaining once again. It's weird that my favorite character in the film is the antagonist itself, REV-9.

The concept here was fine - the events of the franchises original two films have set an alternative future where The Connors are not so critical to humankind's survival. A new threat to the machines has popped up and they do a T2 and send someone back to stop it, thoroughly enjoyable, quite fast paced, I didn't feel like the film dragged at all. Ironically a successful T800 had completed the mission, and become a domesticated pensioner. Some of the themes of the original two films are present and respected.One gripe would be how the timing, to make a film like this now, takes something away from having all the strong female characters kicking ass... it's not trend setting to do this, more just following every other franchise.

That was also one among very few cases where a sequel became a larger phenomenon than the original version itself. Attempts were made by the franchise to recreate the magic through a series of films (T3, Salvation, Genesys) after that but none really stood the test.Realizing the immortality of T2, the team has once again come up with a plot that is very similar - a bad Terminator trying to eliminate a human who is a future threat to the machines and a good Terminator protecting that human. Also to bring in the
connect with T2, the important cast - Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) and the Skynet Terminator (Arnold) are brought back in this version. The movie begins with the elimination of John Connor by another Terminator T-800(Arnold). With the changes that happend, the future takes a different course where the machines are resisted by humans once again. Hence an advanced Rev-9 Terminator is sent to eliminate Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) and in the other end there is a cyborg human, Grace (Mackenzie Davis) being sent to protect Dani. Sarah Connor also joins the resistance against the machine along with T-800. Who won at the end of the battle is the plot.The team had tried hard to outsmart the T2 version and keep this film as racy as possible. The shape shifting and mitosis-like Rev-9 had certainly brought in the fear factor that T-1000 in T2 did, to some extent. Yet, the audience cant help but only appreciate the T2 version more and more , since the template for every sequence in this film is drawn from it. While this version can be rated as the better off the other versions that came post T2, the team should really consider putting this to rest.",Terminator - Dark Fate

But that industry should go have not exploited the value and goodwill generated by the first two movies.

Even though I already knew nothing good was to be expected looking at the trailers and the fact Arnie is past 70 and Hamilton is over 60. So I went in with very low expectations, expecting it to suck. And it sucked indeed. Political correctness, female power, immigrant power, it was all annoying the hell out of me. Sarah Connor was also annoying and Arnold's character was a joke. Not a funny one either I might add. The good old days of T2 are definitely long gone. Still, it was kind of nice to see the T800 in action again in upgraded CGI. I liked the action scenes when Arnie got included again in the second half of the movie. I didn't care much for the first part though, as I didn't care or relate to any of the other characters, including Sarah Connor. I didn't care at all if that Dani or Grace character got hurt or threatened, as I couldn't take them seriously. I'll treat this movie as all the other ones after T2: a one time watch, never to be watched again and non-existent going forward.",Terminator - Dark Fate

1149,badreligionfan,Wrong genre. R.O.T.M is still the real T3 for me.,6,5 November 2019,"Like salvation and genesys, the makers of Dark Fate don't get what makes the original Terminator so good. It was a horror sci-fi drama where a normal waitress all of a sudden finds out about a horrible future. The first terminator is scary and almost invincible, but is able to be damaged by humans. All the action scenes are believable in a discotheque or the police station. Lucky for us it was low budget and there was no CGI. Arnold repairing his arm or eye was scary.
T2 was good and the new bad terminator was scary. The action scenes are great and they were a mix of crazy big action scenes and small stuff like copying the guard in the mental hospital or opening an elevator with scary sword hands. Also a good sci-fi story. T3 was nowhere near as good as the first two films, but it had a new story to tell about the birth of skynet and the ending was great, because it completes the paradox of the birth of John Connor. Judgement day has to happen because otherwise T1 won't happen.Then came Salvation and the crazy unrealistic action scenes happened. Wtf a giant robot spider playing air tennis with a motorcycle or something. It's ridiculous. Genesys was just as bad with a lame Kyle Reese and an unstoppable virtual nano tech evil terminator. Dark fate also has these unrealistic CGI nonsense fights in the sky or in the water. Linda is unlikable, Dani is boring. The rev 9 is too good and you just know he has to die in a factory or lava . All the fighting in the meantime is senseless. This could have been a good movie if the action scenes were believable and the story continued to be about Grace and John Connor. No new or old Linda and no liquid indestructible rev 9. So don't make a CGI Action movie, but make a scary horror sci-fi with a good story and some believable action scenes.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Terminator Dark Fate for me is for sure one of the best movie of 2019, and no doubt the best Terminator movie after 1,2.I know that so many people didnt like Terminator 3,4 , but I like them ;].Dont listen people that say , this new terminator is like Terminator 1,2 copy and paste.Its bsssss.The story is really good and something different and fresh.
Linda Hamilton,Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mackenzie Davis were great in this movie , so great that I could say just for them you should go to the Cinema Theatre and watch it.The special effects are great and much better compare to all these bad trailers we all remember.All action scenes were great , especially the ending of the movie ;].WoooW just wow.IMAX experience for sure.

I can see the team is in a dilemma that they want to bring back good memories (and they succeeded in some) but tried to avoid repeating themselves. This is probably impossible and not wise. The paradox regarding the original terminator is unsolvable but who is here trying to solve a science equation?The dilemma can be completely avoided if you just watch it as a fresh si-fi action piece.

Was the audience supposed to laugh about that, too? Because it is completely ridiculous! A 4'11"" Mexican woman is sooo important to the fate of the world! The whole time, we are lead to believe that she is the mother of the future savior, but then, it is revealed that she will lead an army! Ha! Ha! Ha! Too funny! Then, the way, they braided her hair like a UFC fighter about to enter the octagon! I couldn't stop laughing! Plus, the actress portraying Dani is actually Colombian!

One entertaining aspect of the movie is it severely triggers those people that think movies with females as the main characters is feminist, woke propaganda. It's almost like those people think they're being oppressed and victimized by a crappy blockbuster with women in it lol. It just boggles my mind.Now to the movie. I didn't watch the movie all the way through because it was boring and cliche. The first 10 minutes undoes Terminator and Terminator 2. Those two movies have been rendered pointless by this. The movie is such hot garbage that it copied stuff from Terminator: Genesys. Mainly Arnold's character is similar to his character in Genesys. They should just stop making these movies. If they insist on continuing to make these movies, they should make one about John Connor as an 45 year old and how life has treated him since T2.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1159,arkrandomkindness,Spoiler Warning: Linda and Arnold back made it better (Ending could of been better),8,3 November 2019,"So to sum up without to many spoilers the movie plot is basically the exact same as Terminator 1. In the start John Connor is no longer alive, and His Mother Sara Connor lives on hunting Terminators from a future that had been destroyed. Turns out Skynet was destroyed and instead a new AI from further in the future decides to copy Skynet by sending Rev's to the past to destroy the new leader Danni.Now I am not much for the story as its completely the same, but I love how it connects to the Terminator 1 & 2 so much better, and we do get some new little twists. The Rev's are pretty much indestructible, the survivors get cyborg upgrades to battle the Rev's, and Linda is back as a badass Grandmother looking lady fighting Rev's. Arny is as good as ever and a Terminator film is not a Terminator film without Arny.With both of them back it is great to see as it was these 2 characters we started with. I was a bit disappointed with the ending however as it left it wide open for what can only be assumed for another sequel, as Sara says to the new leader to protect ""Get ready for the war"". I did not like it as much because it feels like the film series has not closed.Terminator 2 closes the 2 films by stating that Skynet is gone and the future war never happens. Which is the kind of ending I prefer.",Terminator - Dark Fate

This would have to be one of the most blatant virtue signalling movies going around at the moment.

The characters revived for this installment are so far irrelevant to the originals, that you would be excused for thinking that Marvel produced and directed it!
Even Netflix & Amazon come up with better ideas than this.
Don't take my word for it...the Universe has spoken and another nail is in the coffin of the 'Hollywood woke movie brigade'....this Terminator is a financial failure.

So an augmented human can take out terminators? There is so much of this completely stupid movie to pick a part. Other than some cool action, this movie is straight hot garbage.

Was it the best movie I've ever seen? No. Was it the worst? No, not by a long shot.Terminator: Dark Fate necessarily brought together all of the (original) elements of the franchise and closed it out (presumably), some 35-years after the release of the original film.

1168,dtcwee,Global Terminator,8,15 February 2020,"This movie attracts a lot of hate because a main character is a) Mexican b) female. Good.The movie Dark Fate was intended to succeed, Terminator 2, was set among Los Angeles' underclass. Disadvantaged, yes, and as Caucasian as Edward Furlong.That Chinese producers would open this movie in Mexico marks the expansion of Terminator's scope, in the best way: familiar, yet challenging. Mexico is gritty, but with a more colorful palette as 1990's L.A. While most of the film is English, Spanish unashamedly dominates the first half. You hear 'No se' a lot. Anglophone viewers may feel disoriented ... but no more than our protagonist does as their life is thrown into a whirlwind of violence.This translation never steps into parody. The iconic Terminator theme actually sounds good as a mariachi cover, but you will miss it if you aren't paying attention.The leads don't have much chemistry but they're great fun to watch, and the second half of the movie doesn't match the pace of the first.As far as opening up the Terminator franchise and reminding us that Skynet ... sorry, Legion ... took over the world and not just the U.S., Dark Fate does the job, while also being a decent watch. This film symbolizes more inclusive action movies. Be excited for the timeline it's opened up. Time for another film to take it further.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1169,jcurtis-27126,Watched it for the action,6,15 February 2021,"I love the first two terminator movie. I have held back from watching this cause everyone said it takes a dump 💩 on the first two. Yes that's true. Thankfully there weren't really a ton of slow moments. Otherwise this would have really sucked. Imagine taking the 2nd movie and making it all about women, and now it's their turn to shine. That's what made this suck. Arnold didn't really feel like a terminator. He felt more human. The boyish looking girl grace has an unnecessary hate for Sarah for like 5 minutes. That kinda felt out of place. I skipped parts to get back to the action.So it's like combining 1 and 2, replacing the guys with girls, watered down Arnold, and watering down the epicness the first two had. And that's where this is at. Because they pooped on john Conner, I give the plot a 1/10. But I did like the action so that's why it's a 6.The script was fine, it just wasn't anything memorable. I felt dani's character had some corny ""we can do this guy's! Follow me I have a plan! Let's make our last stand right here!"" And then everyone just gives up running and are like ""okay"".

\\ Spoiler end//Action overall was okay, especially the final fight, I really enjoyed that.Arnie was amazing imo, his character was my favourite, he was funny when the situation fit it, epic when he was fighting.I tipically have no problem with woman leads, but here the main conversation between the main characters were crying over who is the leader in the group and then crying if they weren't, which made the guardian kinda shit as she was just a physically strong character, but she was like a 14yo girl mentally.That said Linda Hamilton's character was perfect, as it was a future version of T2 Sarah.",Terminator - Dark Fate

1174,thewoodmeister,Out with the old and in with the new,8,2 November 2019,"My first ever movie review (yes I created an account just to post this), as I've read some dubious (and largely unhelpful) reviews on here and wanted to try and give a genuine balanced view of my experience.Like many that have left reviews I'm a fan of the franchise, mesmerised by the original when I watched it on VHS in my youth, thrilled by T2 which I watched twice at my local fleapit cinema the weekend of release.I too have hoped big and been disappointed by the sequels and attempts at rebooting something of the original magic. So I've been watching the hype and lead up to this movie intently, knowing most of the spoilers before my bum even hit the cinema seat.So my thoughts a few hours after seeing it. Yes, better than expected, and I'm hopeful at where this could now go. My overriding thought being that inorder to do something new you really have to cut those ties to the past and the narrative we're familiar with. It is fast and brutal how John Connor was dispatched so early on (some people were still taking their seats), but I'd soon forgotten about this and got on board with the new characters after 30 minutes or so.The stand out by a mile of these is Grace. She is the augmented protector sent back to protect the new ""John Connor"" from a new threat from the new and altered future. Every scene she was in was better for it, and with how this potential new trilogy could pan out, we may see more of her.Having Sarah Connor back is definitely the anchor that the other sequels have lacked. She's old, she's miserable but credible, and could well have a part to play in the franchise yet. Watching her and Arnie back together in their iconic roles is worth the ticket price alone. Yes Arnie doesn't appear until halfway through and he's different that what you might expect, but I found this twist and humour mostly welcome.The story is familiar of course but this is a Terminator film, and it was always going to be a massive job to please everyone, but there's plenty of nice nods to the past films here and enough new ideas and character arcs to keep it feeling just fresh enough. The set pieces are stunning and the cgi used to give us the new Terminator threat the ""Rev9"" is as you would expect... top notch.I would agree that the jury is out on the new ""John Connor"" Dani. Can this character take the weight of a new franchise? She reminded me of the new Sarah Connor in Genisys...just not 100% convinced. Time will tell.So, should you go and see this movie? Yes definitely. There's enough in there to make it worth your time and I found that the time flew by without me really noticing (the mark of a good film). A great entertaining sci fi action film which takes you firmly back into the Terminator franchise we know and love. Go and enjoy and hopefully forget Genisys ever happened!",Terminator - Dark Fate

1179,ricemuscle,I enjoyed it,7,4 November 2019,"Def wasn't on the level of the 2 but it was far better than any other sequel. It may have been a bit repetitive but I think it's definitely worth seeing. Personally I think the series should have just ended after the second movie but I really enjoyed the technology they have these days to make older characters look young again. Here's my problem with people giving movies like this a 1 out of 10. When I see straight to TV sci-fi movies like Lake Placid 4, that are absolutely atrocious CGI and horrendous acting, that in my eyes is a one. Even if you hated this movie and you thought it was terrible, there is zero justification whatsoever in putting that on the same level. You cannot compare a straight to TV sci-fi movie this made on a million-dollar budget to a movie like this. I can understand giving it a five or something in that area because it wasn't good, but if I give something on one it has to be one of the worst movies on the face of the Earth. Even Jaws the revenge isn't a 1. A 3? Sure. But even that is better than some of these straight to Syfy movies. But I'm also not going to give this a 10. Now there are some movies that I think are unfairly judged and I will over rate just to average that out, but I will easily give this a six and a half to seven. It was fun it was action-packed it was cool seeing some of the old characters, they brought a decent storyline and while it's not anywhere near the quality of the first two, I think it was a worthwhile sequel. And 1 out of 10 is pathetic and there is zero justification whatsoever of putting it on that type of level.",Terminator - Dark Fate

It's seldom a sequel is better than it's predecessor and since it happened once in the franchise, it was unlikely to happen again.That said, this movie had a refreshing take on the storyline. It kept me interested with the way the timeline has been affected by the actions of the first movies. The new protagonist called Grace was excellent, and the formidable enemy was superb aswell. It features an interesting set of new abilities for the terminator machine, and for the time fighting hero Grace. Sarah Connor was superb, and Arnie packs his usual punch.I get why some people might feel frustrated by the unfolding of events for John Connor but there's not much else they could have done to give a fresh take.

Even more so, they were done with such seriousness and mostly realistic action. DARK FATE totally dumps on the story and characters that those movies built. I'm sure you've read about the spoilers, so I won't cover them.As for the other TERMINATOR movies, I enjoyed them, even if they couldn't measure up to 1 & 2. I actually liked how part 3 put John Connor in the Presidential bunker. I liked seeing the future in SALVATION, where Connor becomes the leader.GENYSIS was enjoyable, except for the fact that the story kills John Connor and turns him into an A.I. villain. Still, I would have actually liked to see where that trilogy was going, but it wasn't to be. I think it had more potential than the possible new trilogy that DARK FATE is proposing.Like a lot of you, I watched the Tim Miller interviews, where he rants about how the other sequels sucked and that he was making a TERMINATOR movie worthy of following the first two. Funny thing is that DARK FATE is worse than any of them, and steals from all of them.There is no romance story and very little realism. I'm tired of seeing characters jumping around, falling from planes, etc. because CGI allows cartoony actions to happen. The lead character, Dani, was not written in a way where you would actually care for her.At the most shallow level, I can enjoy the chases and fights in DARK FATE.

In the first minute it destroys all T2's legacy and replaces it with a crappier version - Legion instead of Skynet. The movie wants to do some social commentary but it's so clumsy there's really nothing worth discussing.The characters are dull. Linda Hamilton is the only one really looking bad-ass. The new terminator is more of a nuisance than a menace. Arnold's character is laughable. And the new girl, Daniela and her protector are simply disposable. I never came to care one bit for them.Special effects are surprisingly mediocre and, again, unimaginative. The ""old"" Terminator had that shiny metal look, including the mirror-like liquid metal that's iconic. Everyone knows what I'm talking about and that's the point. Remember the moment we see T1000 going through the grated door? Or the way it morphed in the helicopter? Of course you do. There's nothing, nothing similar. Nothing jaw-dropping or even mildly shocking.I can't say for sure it's the worst Terminator in the series because I couldn't be bothered to see all of them, but it's definitely worse than T3.",Terminator - Dark Fate

OK, so John is dead now what? Don't worry there's a new savior of humanity. Who? Is it John's sister? No, some random girl named Dani so who cares what happens to her maybe they'll kill her in the beginning of next movie and call it ""Darker Fate"".But don't worry there's plenty of interesting stuff:
There's a re-branded Skynet named Legion
There's a re-branded terminator sent by the machines named Rev-9 (have ""T"" series unmet expectations?)

The overall plot is very similar to the first two films - super robot sent back in time to kill the leader of the future human resistance (this time a young woman) and a saviour sent back to protect her. Nothing new here.The usual 'woke' themes which currently dominate Hollywood are in evidence, but not as obnoxiously so as in other recent films (yes, I'm looking at you Star Wars).Linda Hamilton is clearly past the peak of her acting prowess but does a credible job, and her inclusion does provide some nice continuity and a nod to nostalgia for the heyday of the franchise. Arnie still looks bad-ass which is impressive at his age, and the other main characters do a decent job, particularly Mackenzie Davis.The new super terminator is somewhat weak - he lacks the menacing presence of Arnie in T1 or Robert Patrick in T2 - and is remarkably ineffectual despite a new ability to split himself in two.The action sequences are something of a mixed bag. Some are great, but others are simply preposterous. The special effects are as good as one would expect of the modern generation of films, but excellent CGI is so commonplace now. I remember the astonishment of seeing T2 for the first time with the liquid metal terminator, but that era is long gone.While this film isn't going to please die-hard fans of the first two, I'd say it's certainly better than the intervening films in the franchise. Overall I'll give it a (perhaps slightly generous) 6/10.",Terminator - Dark Fate

They all want to return and fiddle around with legendary movies that made the 80s great and worth while being part of. And the heroes of yesteryear become pathetic old cronies trying to stay in the spot light instead of sitting on their laurels and enjoying their apotheosis.This instalment has had the LQBTQ make over, with feminised spray can graffiti all over it, AND IT DOESN'T WORK!! So we've seen Arnie going from the muscle bound macho lead in the 80s, to the shrivelled monkey dancing to the tune of the feminist organ grinder in 2019. It's the sign of the times, gender role confusion, men becoming women, women becoming men and no one able to hold down a relationship for more than five minutes partly due to the irresponsible messages that are being sent out in these ever decaying revamps!!

Mainly, it was just too heavy-handed in its effort to make a classic action series into something Hallmark movie lovers might also watch. The theory here seems to be to elevate the motif of empowering women, but it ended up being a pathetic display of improbable leaps. (And yes, that's saying something for a Terminator movie.). The augmented Grace character (Mackenzie Davis) was excellent, and I so wish that the movie had revolved around what she brought, and pushed the Terminator narrative arc forward. The Dani character though was just silly, they tried to make her angry and then propose that bc she's angry she can now do everything. Please, let's never see her here again. Sarah Conner, goodness, what a mess. Again, anger = ability seems to be the principle, although she pulled off anger the way Arnie pulled off dexterity. As with most of these movies, the budget carries it a little bit, but thin, over-wrought plot lines, and weird pacing make it something to laugh at more than be thrilled by.",Terminator - Dark Fate

All the way down to the campy ""I'll be back...."" line. They also resurrected AARP member Sarah Connor and her ridiculously old Jeep. Let's not forget the Terminator himself who was killed in first two movies himself. Yet, here he his somehow this Terminator model was able to learn a new skill selling drapes, yes I said drapes. He also was able age and grow facial hair. Not bad for a Terminator who's only objective is killing. I sat through ridiculously long and terrible movie because I had nothing else to do. The acting is horrible. The lines are campy. Hollywood basically can't help themselves in resurrecting old movies and mashing up the same storylines.

Watched it on a huge screen at my local cinema and this is exactly the kind of films these were made for. As for how does it sit with the other Terminator movies then all I can say is it feels like a natural addition to the Cameron T1 and T2 movies. Unlike the other sequels / reboots that we have been told to ignore, the tone is just about right. Obviously Cameron has influenced this massively. As with most films nowadays there is a little too much unnecessary CGI. Linda Hamilton plays her character well and looks great on the screen. Arnie plays his as only he can do. Proves that there is no better action star than him and it was a joy to see him on the big screen again. The new additions to the franchise were welcome and their characters were well thought out and interesting. All in all, well worth the admission price into the cinema. Well done to all involved.",Terminator - Dark Fate

The rest is boring to mildly entertaining stuff.From a certain point of view I can understand the decision to kill John Connor, because the events of T2 prevented the construction of Skynet - and what a great mysterious master mind in the dark it was - no pun intended. And therefore John Connor isn't needed.But with John's death several problems and questions arise:1) Where does the T800 that kills John come from?
2) Why not send another T1000?
3) What is the point in killing your McGuffins and replacing them with a random teenage girl and an out of the blue AI?
4) Why is Arnolds dog not barking? (As a placeholder question for any other nitpicking question.)
5) Why does this movie exist?Ad 1: The appearance of the 1998 killer T800 make you think how exactly the time travel logic in this universe is supposed to work. If skynet was prevented, then why does John even exist? No skynet, no Kyle Reece, no John...but then no prevention of skynet... Arg. Damn bootstrap paradoxes. Of course skynet could have implemented a fail safe plan and send random Terminators back to several years.
In T1 and T2 you just rolled with it and didn't think about this, because there were other themes in the movie which had more impact.In retrospective the story of the 3rd terminator movie was very good, because sky net was constructed anyway, by a different company/agency and judgment day just happend, closing the loop.Ad 2: this remains a mystery. But why not make Arnie a T1000 instead?Ad 3: There is no point. John Connor in T1 and Skynet in T2 both were responsible for driving the plot forward and both were perfect.Ad 4: it was well established dogs are THE Terminator detectors. Dogs were frightend and hence they barked. What did Carl do to make his dog stop barking at him?Ad 5: This movie just retells the story of T1 with elements of T2 in it. And by killing John they alienated old fans.

1236,droze01,What is with all of the haters?,8,2 November 2019,"This was an excellent addition to the franchise. I appreciate the idea of wiping out everything post T2. The first was excellent. T2 was amazing. While I didn't hate T3, the rest went off the rails a bit -- with the worst being Genesis.
While some may have expected too much from the movie, the rankings of ones and twos are silly. After reading the reviews, I almost didn't go. That would have been a big mistake. While this lacked some of the magic of Terminator 2, it was an excellent movie in its own right, and it was the best sci fi movie I have seen in quite some time.
This movie had a lot going for it. It had an excellent bad guy (I loved the new terminator model), some some excellent protagonists, and well crafted CGI -- I don't get why anyone would claim this had bad CGI. What was bad? Not much.
I eagerly awaited the return of Linda Hamilton's character; Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed by this aspect of the movie -- I really liked her character when she first emerged, but the excitement waned. Was this a re-hash of the plot of T2? I guess, but who cares. When you are following up on a monster of a film, I think it would be difficult to come up with any great plot twists.
I suggest don't go with the expectation of seeing the best Terminator movie yet. Go to see a good action/sci fi movie. If you are like me, you will not be disappointed. Clearly, this movie was not as good as T2, but that movie was a 10. However, this movie is still excellent.

So, they strike the idea that the most successful movie is T2 so let's remake it but this time take all the white and black faces and make them Latino instead, lets kill John Connor because, why not eh?
We can get Arnies character back because the fans insist he shows his face but it would be great if we made him woke and he's eradicated his toxic masculinity.
Sarah Connor has gone from badass to embittered old lady
The antagonist is unrealistic and annoying as is the indestructible super soldier character.
The chases we've seen before, the story we've seen before, the script we've heard before, change a few names around so Skynet is now Legion all very familiar and meh and unoriginal. No effort to create anything new. Genesys wasn't great but at least it was trying something new.

We have just returned home after watching this movie and to put it bluntly I am seriously annoyed about the state of movies being produced in Hollywood these days.Where do I begin? So correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't Linda Hamilton the heroine in Terminator? Wasn't she also a heroine in Judgment Day? Why are all movie these days having to be so PC? Now we have 2 more Linda Hamilton's in a movie which includes the lady herself.Avengers Endgame had those ""enpowerment"" moments too but come on!!!!!! If you're gonna do it be more subtle and unique! The latest 3 Star Wars movies are the same as the originals with a female Luke for goodness sake. Oceans 8, Ghostbusters to name a couple more. Come on guys. We get it. There is some serious ""making up"" to do for the negligence surrounding that Harvey and I'm certain other scumbags but what's next?There's all this garbage about not having enough badass female role models but do we forget Ripley, Buffy and of course Sarah Conner?This movie shouldn't have bothered.

1243,nik_kas,The Final Nail On The Coffin,1,15 January 2020,"When Arnold came on Facebook and told everyone that Dark Fate would be a direct sequel to Judgement Day people were thrilled, not me however. I love both T1 and T2 but from T3 the saga died for me so even though i was hoping i was dead wrong i just couldn't believe that in our day and age a studio could make something that could even resemble the first 2 movies.Unfortunately however, i wasn't wrong. You see i could ""ignore"" the fact that we live in PC (Political Correct) times and that's why instead of a Kyle we now have a Grace (and a strong one at that who only beats white men left and right - she's also made it clear in interviews that she's against white men) and instead of a John (who we were all led to believe that he would be back - and not for 5 seconds) we now have a Daniela but the movie was bad, in general.Take the actress who plays Daniela for example, she's one of the worst actresses i've seen in the last 2 decades (she even laughs during the first chase scene - happens for like a milisecond but it's clear), i don't know if she's young or not but the actor who played John in T2 was also young BUT HE COULD ACT.And then we have Arnold who not only dated women, drove fast cars (those pictures were probably Arnold's real life ones), grew a conscience and even had a family but also acts like a regular human, sells drapes (yes, drapes) and even pets a dog with his legs crossed.Fight scenes are also bad, we have an piss-poor excuse of a Terminator (looking at you Rev-9) who is not only not scary at all but gets his @ss handed to him by both Grace (an augmented human) even though she says in the movie ""you don't fight an Rev-9, you run"".I guess in a PC led era this is just about the best Terminator movie a Hollywood studio can make, still that means it can't begin to compare to the first 2 and perhaps not even the third one or Salvation.PS: Only 1 star to counter all the marketing people and Mckenzie fans out there rating this extremely high.",Terminator - Dark Fate

1247,artistinbackofclass,What about Genisys?,5,23 July 2020,"So I didn't watch the last two terminator movies until yesterday. This one was available but Genisys wasn't for a long time and I need to watch movies in order. So, I was very happy to see both movies were available from my cable provider at the same time. Immediately I watched Genisys. I watched it knowing there was another one to follow. So I was eager to see how a cooler Arnold Schwarzenegger terminator character would do in the following movie.At the end of Genisys, the original terminator, now named ""pops"" by a young Sarah Conner Almost dies. I'm thinking he's can't die because I know he's in the next one. He ends up getting an upgrade. He falls into a vat that gives him liquid metal abilities. He used it only once in the movie when he broke open the door To the room John's parents we're trapped in. Thinking that they stopped the apocalypse from happening by destroying the company that will harber skynet and garner in the human existence. Great. So did something happen that was unexpected? What's the new threat? I mean there is another movie so...why?So now it's dark fate time. I hate the name. Starts off with a pretty Mexican girl being hunted by a terminator. By far the coolest one as it can use it's metal skeletal frame independent of the liquid metal body. Oh no wait. That's not how it starts. Young Arnold comes out of the water like aquaman and kills a young John Conner in front of his mother. Where was the terminator we know and love from like 6 previous movies? Hmm. So we find that he has been sending texts to Sarah for some time of terminator sites with the tag ""for John"". When the door opens at the cabin and she sees him she tried to blow his head off. I'm thinking that she was mad because he said he'd always be there for her and allowed her son to die. But why would they come after John anyway if there was no skynet? Therefore, no need for a leader of the resistance? Also, side note, it wasn't revealed who sent him in the first place to protect Sarah in the last movie. But it turns out this was not ""pops"". This was the terminator that killed John in the beginning of the movie. So no cooler Schwarzenegger terminator, no follow up to Genisys, no mention of where Reese (John's father) was. And Arnold does at the end? ""I won't be back"". He actually said that.The girl is the new leader to a new resistance to a new Robot threat. Ok. So we just can't be original anymore? We saw this with John. We saw this with in some way with Sarah. They could've given the girl so many reasons to be terminated and they go with the same story. Unoriginal. They could've made her a low key technical genius that develops a way to take down the AI onslaught with a key stroke or any other possibilities.After I wrote this review, I changed my rating from a 6 to a 5. Do better Hollywood. Do better.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1248,wildcard97,"There are needles in this haystack, but the hay is too thick to try.",3,27 October 2020,"Terminator sequels after T2 have their flaws but I've enjoyed them for one reason or another and have found myself rewatching them sometimes. But I don't get anything at all from this installment.For starters, they've jumped on the bandwagon of soft reboot/sequel by ignoring past failed installments and picking up after the last good one.The film begins in 1998, after the events of T2 (which took place in 1997 for those who are confused due to that coming out in 1991), and the CGI de-aging of John Conner, Sarah Conner, and the T-800 look fantastic. We've came a long way from reviving Peter Cushing in Rogue One. But the rest of the effects, especially during the fight scenes, are lackluster at best. I know using CGI to de-age people is really hard and was likely worked on the most out of the rest. But we see de-aged Sarah, John, and T-800 for 5 minutes at most in the very beginning, compared to the remaining 124 minutes mostly filled with special effects in some form.Before you even hit minute 4 out of this 129-minute movie, they kill John Conner.And if you're a Terminator fan in any aspect, you've tuned out for the rest of the movie. Even though they made John the villain and killed him in Genisys, he was at least a main part of the story. This was four minutes in and part of a flashback before jumping to 2020, the present time for the rest of the movie.The rest of the movie is like a mix of Terminator 1 & 3, with just a dash of Salvation.We learn John and Sarah were successful in destroying Skynet in the end of T2, which makes it confusing how Skynet sent terminators back to try and kill John and became successful, but try not to think about it too much. Sarah has spent the next 22 years after John's death getting drunk and killing new terminators that have traveled back in time.A mexican girl, Dani, is the new John Conner of this movie as a new A.I., called Legion, sends a terminator back, called Rev-9, to kill her as she leads the resistance against it. The resistance send back their own machine, an augmented human (as the movie puts it) named Grace. Just remember Marcus from Salvation except she needs a recharge every 15 minutes or so.I'm sure you can figure out the rest if you haven't seen it as all Terminator movies basically go the same way: combination of road movies and sci-fi action.Like I said, it's Terminator 1 except they want to kill the target, not the mother of the target. The T3 parallels are weird since that's considered as probably the most embarrassing installment. You have the judgment day is inevitable plot, the T-800 that killed John helps the protagonists against the evil terminator, and the evil terminator is killed by shoving a power cell in its face while the T-800 keeps it from escaping while also sacrificing itself. The fact that Linda Hamilton said no to T3 and yes to this, I don't think that's a coincidence.It's ideas with the new terminators introduced were cool but I don't understand what Rev means when it comes to these new machines and shouldn't need to be looked up in some expanded universe-type medium. At least we knew T in T-800 and other models meant terminator. What does Rev mean?But the ideas were cool and are believable if it were Skynet just evolving their machines. Which makes sense as Judgment Day has been delayed. I believe the amount of human influence on technology would help Skynet/Legion make more advanced machines. Like in the original timeline where Judgment Day happens in 1997. The tech then doesn't come close today, thus by the 2020s or beyond, Skynet were up to the T-800 models. Salvation did this as it acted as T4 when Judgment Day happened in 2003 and were able to have T-800s made by 2018. So, in this movie, with Judgment Day happening in the 2020s, when they got to 2042 when Grace went back in time, they got terminators which can split apart with their metal skeleton and liquid metal. Having that in a 22-year time frame, compared to 15 from T3 to T4, had to be because of human influence of tech.
But that doesn't excuse Grace from needing a recharge of medications constantly. Again, look at Marcus in Salvation. He's just a T-600 or 800 with a human heart and brain, and his consciousness is still intact. Even though Skynet made Marcus and the resistance augmented Grace, I don't that cuts it. Again because of the human influence of tech making their future technology in 2042 more advanced than Salvation's 2018.The story is a rehash, the characters are dull and forgettable, Sarah and the T-800 should be the highlights but they're not, and they sprinkle in some woke politics as well. They especially get heavy on the immigration side of it.Lastly, just because your three main leads are females doesn't mean you're breaking new ground. The first two movies, which are regarded as the best and where this movie takes place after, had a great female lead that everybody rooted for. Another one on the piles of Get Woke, Go Broke and franchises ruined by woke politics with Ghostbusters, Ocean's, and Charlie's Angels.",Terminator - Dark Fate

1251,tiberijegrozni,It's the worst Terminator movie and that is not small achievement,5,14 January 2021,"After first two Terminators we got number of sequels that failed to live up to incredible high standards set up by James Cameron. Considering that we didn't really have strong entry in the series since Terminator 2, making worst Terminator movie in such a strong competition is not small achievement at all.Biggest problem with this movie is really bad casting. Main female character looks like front runner of one of Disney TV shows and making us believe that she is leader of future resistance is harder then believing that Klaus Kinski is kind and god fearing man.
Other female Cyborg character is another poor casting decision and any chemistry and attachment to these two characters from the viewer is non existent.
Third bad casting decision is bad Terminator, just compare the menace of Arnie in T1 and evil persistence of bad Terminator in T2 and you will see that this one is just bland baddie wannabe .So 3 bad casting decisions leaves you only with Arnie and Linda to root for and there is not much to it, to be honest.

Maybe it's the nostalgia and faithful homage scenes, maybe it's the quality action and slight twist on the time-travel congruence necessary to make sequels that keep changing the future, but I enjoyed this installment better than Genysis.There's the issue of time and culture to be considered.
TDF had the unfortunate timing to be released during mid-apocalytic times during the California fires, at the beginning of an awful US political campaign, and weeks before the pandemic made cynics of us all.We see an unexpected evolution in the original Terminator killing machine in a ""where are they now"" vignette that is almost too cheesy for the screen, but a necessary element for this part of this story. That part was my favorite and most cringe-inducing at the same time.If you're just in it for the action and can ignore the less than great storytelling, you'll have moments and sequences worth your attention, with scattered bits of WTF moments as well.It's another movie that's hard to recommend for others.

1267,Sweaterized,"Below Expectations, Above the Vitriole",7,5 November 2019,"Like many other people, I was a bit underwhelmed by this latest Terminator movie, but not to an extreme. It's a well-made movie that keeps better to the tone of Terminator 2 than the intervening three movies did, but does not offer much new material at the same time. In other words, it holds its own but provides nothing new.I could spend more time reviewing the actual movie, but instead I'd like to do kind of a review of reviews. That is, to look at the movie in light of some common gut reactions I've seen. There is no way that this movie deserves a ""1"" or ""2"" or ""3"" rating, or a ""8"" or ""9"" or ""10"" rating either. It's a decent, albeit cliched film. So when a review such as this one:One liners, boring villains and no heart. Please just follow the original 2 and stop trying to appeal to families and the LGBT community..... worry about THE TASK REAL FANS. (adenmartinez)makes huge claims without support, it makes me wonder more about worldview rather than effective critique. Using this particular review as a basis, let me explain.One Liners -- I imagine the full argument is that Dark Fate has too many one-liners and not enough substantive dialog. Have these people seen Terminator 2? That movie is chock-full of one-liners, and I might suggest that they're delivered in a clunkier style than what Dark Fate does. (""Hasta la vista, Baby,"" for example.) Terminator 2 was a fun movie, but let's be real -- it had plenty of flaws and limited storytelling itself, and tended to be some of the ""preachiest"" of all the Terminator movies. Not sure why Dark Fate is singled out to be especially flat in comparison.Boring Villians -- Yes, true, but not any more so than any of the other movies. T1 and T2 were novel experiences, and all the other movies have tried to recapture that mood and failed. Much better here than in Salvation or Genysis, though, right?No Heart -- Have to argue here on this one. Dark Fate has plenty of heart. It's just not as overt as in Terminator 2 or as contrived as in Genysis. The actions of Carl and Grace and Sarah are all full of poignancy and meaning, although perhaps a bit too subtle for some people, and perhaps too dependent on knowledge of the other Terminator movies.Try to Follow the Original Two -- I think it did, although I agree John's character development was an unfortunate decision on the producer's part. Sarah's character fits right in with T1 and T2, and undoes the travesty of T3. And the storyline makes coherent sense, although maybe some of the relabeling of T1 and T2 aspects was too distracting.Political Correctness -- The only reason people are complaining about the ""feminist"" Dark Fate is that it has three strong female characters. These characters simply do their job without making social commentary, and don't even have a ""Female Hero"" scene like Avengers Endgame did. If these three characters had been male, there would have been no argument, right? So simply having female characters is now somehow ""liberal""? I just don't understand the logic.I wanted this to be a much better movie, but it just couldn't find the original Terminator atmosphere enough, nor uncover sufficient new territory. It landed in a limbo of concept and timing, and will now be regarded as the biggest Terminator failure. Which is unfortunate because it's not a terrible film, and at least better than #3-5, and brings back the real Sarah Connor. I had fun watching it, but still wish there was a better follow-up to the original two movies.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1268,amirjonis,"Bland, unsurprising and too much CGI!",5,26 October 2019,"There were things I liked with the movie, but unfortunately disliked much more than what Iiked. I will list a few things below.Firstly, I feel like the movie was flat out lazy. John Connor was killed in the first few minutes for practically no reason. Then that terminator turns around and becomes a family man. Wtf is going on?Secondly, abandoning Skynet for ""Legion"" for no reason. It even makes terminators that look similar. Felt forced and unnecessary.
Not once did the Rev 9 wonder why there's a terminator that it doesn't recognize defending the target. Wasted potential.Third, the Terminator was weak. He went 100% and was beaten back again. And again. And again. Felt like the entire movie was about how he was beaten back. Pointless action. But a good excuse to use some CGI I guess.Fourth, overused CGI. An early warning sign was that they couldn't even let the terminator warp in with his time-sphere without having a CGi-scene where he drops to the ground. Every other move was CGI it felt like.I honestly don't understand why everyone making movies loves using CGI for virtually everything. It doesn't look good, period. Let the actors do something for christ's sake.How even did the humans get a hold of a tactical time weapon? This was never explained, nor why so few seem to be sent back.I liked Linda Hamilton and the augmented girl. That's about it.",Terminator - Dark Fate

1270,HorrorMaster-13,Stop making Terminator Movies Hollywood....just stop it!,4,3 November 2019,"Remember when James Cameron complained for decades about Alien 3 for killing Hicks and Newt?
What a hypocrite! With Terminator: Dark Fate he did the same thing with John Connor (I know he didn't directed the film, but he produced it and co-wrote it).
It is even WORSE than the Deaths of Hicks and Newt in Alien 3 because John Connor is a pivotal main character in the Terminator Franchise and not an (amazing) side-character like Hicks and Newt were in Aliens.
Killing him makes T1 and T2 completely pointless!
Kyle Reese sacrificing his own life for Sarah Connor and the unborn John Connor in T1 and Uncle Bob's sacrifice to prevent Skynet's creation and thus Judgement Day in T2 were for NOTHING!
I wouldn't of had a problem with it if they justified this in the story of Terminator: Dark Fate! But they didn't, for some reason the T-800 Terminator felt bad and made a family? Why? He grew his own conscience. How? It isn't explained he just did. It's sloppy, it's lazy and pointless. They killed a beloved character just for shock value. It's really infuriating!
Not to mention that Dark Fate is nothing more than a cheap rehash of T1 and T2 with boring, uninteresting and bland new characters, forgettable action scenes and forgettable villain.
The only character I cared about was Sarah Connor played by Linda Hamilton.
This movie provides nothing new or interesting for this Franchise and has no justification to exist. It's pointless just like the last three Terminator Sequels after T2.
This film gets a 4/10 from me.

I wanted it to be smarter and i wanted something new, something that blew my mind like the others did and no, making the T1000 black does not count.
The weird thing is that im sympatethic with the mexicans and dislike how they are treated. And to some degree how women are depicted in movies.The problem i have with this is that its so obvious and on the nose that it just irritates me instead of the opposite.
I liked Mackenzie Davis. She has the build for a female action hero and i hope to see more of her in the future.

The Rev 9 is an invincible and unstoppable machine that will do anything to get its target as it is a Terminator. It's just the non stop cat and mouse chase that never gets boring.

Then seeing who the character becomes and no cheesy dialog (thank God!) gives this movie back 2 stars. The dialog (and some of the fight scenes) throughout the movie were far too repetitive of the first 2 so another star gone. I give this movie an 8. Far better than any movie past T2. My opinion its equal to T1! I think people that hate this installment only want Arnold's corny lines. That's why salvation received such a low score. Or maybe it's because of the first arnold scene.

And it is this bandwagon mentality that has caused a lot of damage to various franchises across various media platforms. Terminator just happens to be one of those I would consider as victims. This is precisely why I agree with James Cameron's decision to disregard everything that occurred between T2 and this one. And it's for longing for a sensible continuity that prompts me to say this, but that the other titles that got involved with the franchise have been no more but eye candy (i.e., making use of better special effects technology) instead of focusing on the story.
It's not to disparage the other movies/series that are part of the franchise, but all of those would probably work better as side-stories (or stories under the context of ""what if""). If we were to look at a somewhat-coherent continuity, this is actually good.
Forget about the nostalgia of seeing the actors from the original movie, and focus on the story. Had they hired different actors, the story would still have made sense. Linda and Arnold being here is more like the icing on the cake.",Terminator - Dark Fate

What I have problem is the plot and the execution. Why invent this new indestructible Terminator that apparently have no weakness. In T2 you can freeze the T1000 and shattter it to pieces, this one nope. It crosses metal bars despite having metal endoskeleton is unbelievable. The endoskeleton on its own is also indestructible unlike the T800. All you see is our protagonists being chases endlessly by this indestructible Rev9 causing CGI mess on the way, louder that ever before. No logic, no drama, just chase. Some scenes appeared to be copying T2, e.g. the helicopter chase, the truck chase and the setting for the ending itself.The ending was throughly disappointing. They grid this bad boy and yet what comes out is the endoskeleton and not the liquid metal.

1314,tza-drake,A Brave Reboot,7,26 May 2020,"From the get go this film lays down brave and due to the last films in this franchise necessary changes. The casting of Mackenzie Davis is an inspired one, she is androgynous, athletic and beautiful and may have many young men and woman confused to what they feel for her. Action films are made for young men as they are the target demographic and Davis is a great lead to subvert the usual casting that comes with these types of films.
The problem with the last sequels, Genesis being the prime example, is that the makers seem to think there are elements, or better lines that must be included in the film that makes them a Terminator film. EG 'Come with me if you want to live' and 'I'll be back'. Due to this these lines are often put in with such heavy handedness that they are more a annoying part of the film rather than a cleaver nod to the ones that came before it. Dark Fate does not suffer from this however with the lines placed in scenes organically and smoothly.
The action is well paced, well shot and well edited and though the plot is a little contrived and at times a bit confusing it is a refreshing change from the previous films that hurt and hindered rather than inspired and amazed.
Arnie shows his ability for comedic timing and is used well. His characters story could be a film in itself but it doesn't take away from this films story.A needed change from the gash that has come before as the sooner we forget Genesis the better.",Terminator - Dark Fate

It looks good, well done CGI team.Now the bad. This movie is one long chase scene that I'm not interested in. The movie opens with the killing of John Conner. Yeah, that happened. Then we launch into a rehash story of T2, but worse. Before they start yelling sexist, let me just say that I am a fan of female leads, that are good. Ripley in Aliens is one I can think of off the top of my head, in regards to a female lead that I liked. We've seen good female leads and it's fine. But this was not good, it came off as  propaganda film. The dialogue in this film is reminiscent of my high school years, the acting is god-awful, except Arnold, and The Terminator(Arnold) is a family man now, what? There' no peril in this film, because non of the characters are developed sufficiently enough to make me care.All I gotta say is I'm glad I didn't see this in theaters, not that I go to the theaters, but I'm glad I didn't support this film.

1327,adamtheactor-97677,Excellent sequel to Judgement Day,8,25 October 2019,"What were you all expecting?
This is about as good as we can get now.
I went in expecting a low key affair, however, I will be honest, Dark Fate is an enjoyable follow up to Terminator 2 Judgement Day (Stay with me folks); Unfortunately it lacked something, something that I just can't put my finger on.
I think possibly the fact it's been 28 years since 1991, and that 90s feel is well and truly over, robots of the future are less exciting because we have seen them in so many movies since Judgement Day.
I need to say, stop with the expectation that this should or could be as good as the original two movies, it's clearly never going to be, that bar is way too high.
What it does do is deliver on the action, and the story is also well thought out.
It's great to see Linda Hamilton as an aged and still tough as nails Sarah Connor, and yes the interaction between herself and Arnold's T800 is always worth waiting for.
Like I mentioned earlier in my review, this does lack something, Dark Fate ticks a lot of Terminator boxes, but doesn't quite reach a peak.
A lot of people have been very negative about this film, I don't agree with them. It's a positive direction for the film franchise, and I am hoping we get more.",Terminator - Dark Fate

As a whole movie, I can say I enjoyed it for 6*.
But you definitely won't miss anything other than $ by skipping it.Story wise it was just another rinse and repeat junk with different execution.
Execution and effects were ok most of the time.At first glance on protagonists I thought, omg another womanizer movie,
but then it stopped bothering me.
Except the main new ""hero""..through most of the movie she was regular scared chick and suddenly she morphed into ghetto girl..
And I kept imagining Emily Blunt as the ""Grace""BUT there was one loop hole that bothered me quite enough:Since Carl (Arnold) successfuly killed young John Conor, therefore SKYNET future would never exist.
Howcome there were more Terminators sent from SKYNET future afterwards?
And he was sending their coords to Sara so she could destroy them.
lazy writing or lazy QA ?I assume HE knew those dates/coords because he was sent later but to ""deeper"" past.

Well not really.,7,2 November 2019,"There is no way anything is going to beat The Terminator or Judgement Day, i would probably put this on par with The Sarah Connor Chronicles not T3, That boring mess Salvation or the WTF reboot Genisys.2 things that did surprise me was the opening reusing Sarah's psych eval by Doctor Silberman from T2, and how they handle John Connor by killing him in 30 seconds. which to be honest I had no problem with. Just focusing on John Connor and The Terminator itself and taking Sarah out of the picture for T3 and Salvation never really worked for me.for the cast - of course Linda Hamilton will always be Sarah Connor no one can really deny that, Mackenzie Davis was enjoyable as sort of a merge of the T800 and Kyle Reese, i'm sad to say however the weak link is Natalia Reyes, her character Dani Ramos was just bland making her this new prophet in the future now that John's been wiped out was so obviously signposted.Can i really recommend this?

I went into this movie with low expectations; just willing to give it a shot. I gotta say I was pleasantly surprised - Genysys had already thrown out the idea of the timeline getting kinda wonky, so it didn't surprise me that they went in a similar direction here. At the same time, bringing back characters from the original timeline in sort of new ways. I personally don't understand why it got as much hate as it did. The CG can be a little wonky/ floaty feeling, but didn't completely take away from the action. The action is as over the top as you'd expect time traveling murder robots to bring; and the idea behind the new terminator's abilities brought some interesting twists to the fight scenes.

They took T2 and basically re-worked every scene! But imagine The Force Awakens but with Luke dead, yes, that's what we have, they killed John! Just like in Aliens 3 where they completely negate all of Ripley's hard work in Aliens by killing Newt and ""Reese"".I went to see this movie as I love T1 (best movie ever) and T2. I was entertained, some bits were truly edge of the seat, if it was a stand alone movie I would rate it higher. But it isn't, its the next part of the story of my favourite characters and in that respect was lousy. Perhaps (second) worst of all (after killing John) was that the new Terminator was not menacing and there was never any suspense in the movie, the new Terminator just kept popping up again and again ""surprise, me again!"".In the same way that there are only 3 Stat Wars movies and 2 Aliens movies there are now, for me, only 2 Terminator movies.""I won't be back.""

The story is a by the numbers re hash of the traditional Terminator chase format passed through a 2019 lens (women get to kick tail and detention centres suck) with dialogue ranging from amusing to cringeworthy. Lynda Hamilton's grizzled Sarah Conner is great and Arnie is both fun and kind of tragic at the same time as a humanised T800 who has spent years integrating into society but laments the fact he can't love the way a human can. Its a mixed bag for the new comers with Mackenzie Davis bringing great energy as a cybernetically enhanced super soldier and Gabriel Luna doing a passable Robert Patrick as the new model killer machine, while Natalie Reyes struggles as the John Conner replacement.
In reality the plot and any character development are merely filler between some of the best action scenes of recent years with the good guy team dynamic and villains ability to split in two making for some frantic set pieces.

1337,eighteendoorsdown,Finally it's here!,8,24 October 2019,"Before you sit down with your popcorn let's just start by saying that it is impossible to create a film as strong as the first two and you just need to get that in your head. The reason why the first two films were as monumental as they were was due to the fact that at the time of their release it was a new concept but decades later through another three Terminator films not including Dark Fate and countless other films inspired by them released it is impossible to recreate that feeling of the unknown that the first two films produced.With that being said let's look at this film fairly and individually and dare I say it I was pleasantly surprised. Despite some action scenes feeling overwhelming at times and it being another film with a female empowering cast Dark Fate is the first film since Judgement Day that holds up as a Terminator film.With Linda Hamilton brilliantly reprising her role as a scarred Sarah Connor alongside Mackenzie Davis, an augmented super human sent from the future named Grace to protect the new future leader of the human resistance in Dani Ramos portrait by Natalia Reyes, they all give us something different and the dynamic between them is fascinating to watch.The new villinous Terminator Gabriel Luna is relentless and for the first time in decades you feel the cast are truly being hunted by something invincible.The film has the occasional nostalgic nod to the previous two films which are subtle without being cheesy and of course let's talk about the man himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Without saying to much he shows the T-800 in a new light which is interesting and humorous to watch. He physically looks great as an aged Terminator and when it comes down to the action scenes Arnold returns in all his reloading and skin shredding glory.Overall I am so relieved that the Terminator has finally released a film of this magnitude.

The follow ups were kinda terrible, so I had pretty high hopes for this since james cameron and linda hamilton were involved again. Alas, it's another disappointing terminator movie.

That's sad because this movie is much better than many of its reviews.The problems? To me there are 2. First, killing off John Connor right away was an interesting and brave path to take but in general I think it disappointed too many fans. To me it didn't matter.
Second, the first two movies greatness lied in their simplicity. Good vs. evil. One defender (of the target) against one attacker. Arnold went from attacker to defender which was a logical development. Then what?From then on the stories (from T3) had to be much more complex to not repeat themselves too much. This is a perfect example of it. A hybrid human and Sarah Connor are the defenders against a very complex Rev. 9 and eventually getting help from a T800 from a deleted timeline?Get me right, this is a decent movie and a good effort to move this franchise forward. But to me, too much effort is maybe put into explaining the story. T1 was perfect in that way. Very simple and quite frightening.This said, I think that this movie and all the other sequels since T3 are underrated. Ok T1/T2 are classics and maybe not on that level but good actions movies on their own.If you haven't seen it, give it a try. To me it was definitely worth it.",Terminator - Dark Fate

1349,kennbr,"2 parts political commentary, 1 part parody",3,9 November 2019,"I don't mind a movie trying to make political points if there is some level of nuance to it, but this movie seems to have forgotten it's supposed to be a part of the terminator franchise. I'm pretty sure that they allowed the protagonists (one of which being an insanely powerful human/terminator hybrid, and the other a gritty and experienced resistance fighter) to be captured by border patrol just so they could make a statement about the way immigrants are being jailed. They even go so far as to remind us, ""We call them detainees,"" just to make the political commentary unmistakable. I feel like the treatment of immigrants is abhorrent and we need immigration reform, but I wanted to watch a science fiction about machines destroying humanity, not be reminded about the actual machines doing it in real-life. There, I just made a more scathing and political remark than this movie attempts to in 90 mins.If that wasn't bad enough, it very sheepishly tries to force a female-empowerment angle, but fails itself by reinforcing the usual tropes but simply with reversed genders. It's not that the 3 main protagonists are female that forces this empowerment narrative, it's that one of the females is basically the savior of humanity, and the cheesy dialog they choose to make sure the audience ""gets it"". She plays this savior all while failing to make any impression at all, while the other two are needlessly aggressive and cantankerous, respectively. Seriously, the unnecessary rivalry between Grace and Sarah Connor seemed more reminiscent of two macho-male roles trying to assert their dominance as the alpha in a struggle of young vs old, yet it was so unbelievable because neither could play the part worth a damn. It's like Hollywood thought, ""How can we write empowered female leads? Oh, let's just make them needlessly competitive and overtly confrontational."" If you had replaced Grace and Sarah with any two run-of-the-mill meathead male action heroes ( personally I'm imagining Sylvester Stalone and John Cena), they would have been the exact same characters. Meanwhile, Dani seemed to just be caught up in the middle of this, and in the end with all this pomp and posturing trying to make it seem like these women are so badass and empowered, none of them actually get to be the hero in the end. So what was the point of all that insufferable pandering to begin with?Oh, and did I mention that T-101s know how to change diapers? Yeah, I'm sure you'll love that little tidbit. Though I did get a little chuckle out of hearing Arnie's character very seriously warning about the catastrophic color choices you could make with room decor. No, I'm not joking, it happens. Apparently the only way they could think to really make the female characters seem empowered was to completely emasculate the only male role.But, if you can get past all that, and focus on the plot... You still get a kick in the teeth. Remember Skynet? Yeah well that never happened. Mission accomplished, humanity is saved, right? No, because now there's ""Legion""... With no real explanation of how that happened, except some very thin, misanthropic suggestion that it was all because of man making weapons... again. Granted after the last three sequels, there wasn't really any continuity to speak of, but fans hoping for a cogent and meaningful follow-up to events after T2 will basically see through this ""new"" story as a parody of the same story, except NOW, Skynet is Legion
So yeah I give it a 3/10 just because it's got some cool action scenes, but as a fan of the franchise, and a movie-goer trying to action a science-fiction/action film and escape the constant barrage of political commentary in every other part of media these days, I'm pretty sorely disappointed.",Terminator - Dark Fate

It is that way solely to cash in on the past movies. It is not a good movie at all. Not watchable, and one movie I could nitpick all day. It's a lazy remake of T2 but even worse.

Killing off John Connor is totally wrong, especially replacing his role with Dani. What they have done with T-800 (Carl) seemed like a parody to the originals, especially when he starts giving advice for drape choices.
Rev9, the new terminator was a really neat concept, however he fails to be menacing and eventually feels generic. Not to mention that he has the same trait of T-5000 of talking too much.
Sarah Connor.....it was nice to see Linda return to the franchise. I would say that is the only positive aspect of the movie. However, her line that after John's death she has been hunting terminators - it seems like Skynet has sent more terminators to the past than there were in the future.
Pacing is good, but action is over the top, too much cgi and makes you feel you are watching a combination of Fast and furious and Marvel movies. It definately should have stayed more grounded.

Do you honestly believe if we were over run by machine you would care whose saving you?",Terminator - Dark Fate

Sure, it got a little bit cheesy once Arnold appeared but otherwise, I thought it was terrific. It had interesting characters (including our old favourite, Sarah), fantastic effects and some unprecedented fight scenes.

Thank you, James Cameron.I was thoroughly entertained.

1362,danhall86,'The real sequel to T2' they said...,5,25 October 2019,"It's not. Atleast not the one I ever wanted.It's barely any better than the other failed sequels that have come since 1991. I might actually prefer some of the others, as much as I disliked them at the time.Looking at it objectively, it's not an awful movie. But they built it up so much with the return of Cameron and saying it was a 'return to form' etc that I think the disappointment has hit twofold. It is a very, very average film.I'm conscious of some 'gender politics' attached to this movie, or how it's perceived. Please understand that I was fully okay with having three female leads. Terminator has been the tale of 'the mother of the future' all along after all. Let's be clear that it was just a fairly poor film, regardless of gender.There are still only two films as far as I'm concerned - T1 & T2. If you want the real follow up, get hold of copies of the comics 'T2: Cybernetic Dawn' and 'T2: Nuclear Twilight.' (Read them in that order). They wrapped up the story tidily and respectfully. This film achieved neither of those things.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1363,anizar_wiflfag,We will never have the Terminator movie we want.,5,4 November 2019,"SPOILERSWhat's the point of killing John Connor if the movie is going to have the same story as always? Machine sent back to kill the humanity saviour? I do not care about the new actors, or the political agenda they throw, but they just cannot disregard the first 2 movies. It is such a shame that Linda Hamilton agreed to came back and they just did not give the story the fans deserve and need. Haven't they learn? Three terrible movies have flopped since T2 and they have not learnt a thing. It is that hard to figure out that Arnold, Linda, Edward (and even maybe Michael Biehn) must be in a movie where they continue telling the story of how the war machine started? Come on it is not rocket science, it is just common sense.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1364,verkappter,Loved it,9,14 January 2020,"Maybe it's not as dark as T1 and not as much as a thriller as T2, but to me Dark Fate was a fantastic actual part 3 to the trilogy.The action was a bit over the top at times and parts of the story were farfetched (to put it mildly), but the dry humor was spot on, as was the new evil Terminator and yes, this is a Terminator movie after all, so some suspension of disbelief is required to be able to enjoy it.I'm a 37 year old guy from Germany and I can tell you with 100% certainty that I haven't been that on the edge of my seat in a Terminator movie since T2.Now one last thing: I bet this movie would be rated at least 1 point higher with a male hero, just because some people get a pavlovian response to seeing a female kick ass.So if you're a Terminator fan and you don't have a problem with women shooting guns, go watch this.Do it now!!",Terminator - Dark Fate

And let's not star with Arnold, they have put him (the Terminator) in a relationship with a woman helping her raised her child? I don't know what drugs the people who wrote the scrip were doing but this is just f*# mad. The only thing that is salvageable is Mackenzie Davis part, I think she did a good job under the circumstances.Sadly been a fan of this franchise I think this the end, there's no coming back from this.

Engrossing from beginning to end. I find it absolutely strange that it's not a hit - Maybe it's because it does not follow the traditional ""hero"" path. You need to go see this film and make up your mind about it, social media has not been kind to it, but then again social media is now a tool to influence and manipulate, you can no longer find content that is honest and true to how things are.

The scripts use of the recurring theme of fate may be somewhat familiar but it's very cool and works well here. Linda Hamilton nails it in her return, Arnold does what he does but the twist w his terminator here gives him a little more flavor. The new bad terminator played excellently by Luna is intimidating and a worthy addition to the mythology. Our new heroines played by Mackenzie Davis and Natalia Reyes are both terrific and how they carry on themes for the franchise is great. I really don't understand how some very good to great movies (both blade runners, John Carter etc) underperform like this one is, maybe I'm easy to please. I don't know.

Long into the film, they meet up with the Arnold terminator that killed John Connor. After committing the act, the Arnold terminator named himself Carl, settled down and had a family, and started his own drapery business. Arnold joins team girl power to battle the bad terminator.The REV-9 is really two terminators in one. An endoskeleton, and an outer ectoplasm that can break away. This is actually the only thing that I liked about this film.Dark Fate is a checklist of all the things that make modern day Hollywood so fetid. An unnecessary sequel. Excessive CGI. Overlong running time. PC pandering. This is the worst in the series and deserved to flop. Every sequel after T2 has progressively flopped worse than the previous one, yet they continue to make them.

Soooo bad animations and bad effects. Sooo bad scenes (airplane scene above all). I mean, how could they fail on all these levels?

He blasted out of the wall in the truck at the exact perfect moment. The sword hand that can cut metal was cut off by a chain. She became an Olympic shooter because she focused on her dead dad. Carl did weigh 400 pounds and the car and the couch would have given him away to his woman. Honestly Carl should have been a cop. They picked the slowest plane .

Similar story but better, similar characters but better, similar effects but better, similar action but more and better action, even similar humor, but even funnier. Probably all thanks to James Cameron, but still a much needed reboot to the franchise. I guess the only legitimate complaint would be that they played it safe with making it a lot like T2, just on steroids. I get it but still personally I have to still give this 10 stars. I gave T2 9 stars, and this is an improvement on that. Besides being T2X2, it is still the best Terminator movie in a long time. It was fun and worth every penny. I even plan to see it again.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1380,kevinparker100,Worth watching but easily forgettable.,6,24 October 2019,"Naturally any movie that tries to follow the hugely successful and iconic The Terminator and T2 is going to struggle. Matching a storyline and the menace that machines like these would have is going to be very difficult.
To a degree this movies does this but looses its way as it progresses. Huge set pieces, stunts and CGI shove the storyline to one side and the movies decents into a visual assault on the eyes. I am all for the WOW factor, switching off the brain, kicking back and simply enjoying a movies is actually enjoyable.
Loosing the plot, which this movies does, subtracts from this enjoyment and I came away from the cinema feeling they could have done so much better.
Having said this, not a bad movie but not a great movie either (which given talent on display it could and really should have been).",Terminator - Dark Fate
1381,code-morse-599-990226,"Very decent honest effort, pretty good if you can let go of the past",8,9 November 2019,"I'm struggling a bit to write this review, the film itself has flashes of brilliance, it's pretty brutal in places, especially for those who like me found the T2 and particularly T1 a formative and deeply influential film. Truth is, if you're too invested in what came before it's infuriatingly hard to swallow but it's nowhere near as bad as you might be led to believe.In my heart of hearts this one won't hold a candle to the originals because of the nostalgia and reverence I have attached to them; I had to try hard to take the film not only on its own merit but also as a product of its time - a time of BIG STUNTS, BIG EFFECTS and OVEREXPOSITION - the marvel effect of you will which is here to stay; you can't expect it to channel 80s Cold War paranoia or millennium uncertainty in this day and age, it just ain't relevant anymore.The action is mostly bombastic, chaotic fare, well executed but slightly lacking in flair - that said there are some brilliant moments throughout - no it won't reach the suspenseful darkness of T1 or the intense feel of T2 but it stands out among 2919 action flicks. It's bold and balsy in the way TFA and TLJ wasn't, it dares to take a tyre iron to the lore we know and shake things up considerably but it's well though out and certainly pushing some boundaries into the now, quite a few scenes would make spectacular comic book panels in a way Marvel and DC can't hope to match.
The return of Sarah Connor is spectacular and barring the odd overwrought bit here and there, sparks fly. The T800 is brilliantly written and Grace is the closest we've got to Michael Biehn since 1984 which is a major positiveThe tech noir, slasher chase and horror elements are paired back leaning more towards action sci-fi and drama which sometimes works really well others time stumbles. The villain could have been better - you'll not find a Robert Patrick levels of menace here sadly, in fact I think the Rev 9 is the weakest element in the mix, too much physicality not enough maliceAct 1 is solid genius, act 2 slogs a bit then act 3 ramps up a tad too hard, a couple of flash back sequences could have done with a trim and the film could use some tightening. Narratively I felt the film lacked darkness and could have used a bit more peril.
The only thing I would consider a cock up is Junkie XL's soundtrack, much as I appreciate him as a producer I feel he completely missed the mark. The music is either too much or too little. I don't think it's a stretch to say he butchered Brad Fiedel's work and didn't manage to bring anything of his own, Hybrid would have been a better choice if not the return of Brad Fiedel himself.
All in all it's a great film that's 20 years too late, there's life in the old hyperalloy yet and this deserves a watch just don't go in chasing after filmmaking magic from the 80s and 90s and you'll have a ball!",Terminator - Dark Fate
1382,davidhershwitzky,I LOVED THIS movie!,10,7 November 2019,"Okay, let's get the cons out of the way first.Yes, it was a bit tongue in cheek. For the most part, it worked but at other times it felt forced.SPOILER!!!!A major twist happens right off the bat. I'll just say that. But it will divide some people. All I will say is that I wish this scene lasted about 5 minutes longer because the deep fake style FX were awesome and if this technology improves, a lot of passed away actors will be coming back from the dead...Anyways... onto the good. This ""part three"" brings back Linda Hamilton! And I must say... EVERY scene she is in... I had a BIG smile on my face. The convoluted twist was the only way her evolution made sense. Because of this, I can forgive the rapid fire first twist.Grace was an awesome character. There was a metaphorical juxtapose between her millennial style outlook vs Linda Hamilton's Baby Boomer style outlook. As a matter of fact, there is a lot of political subtext in this film.Action, is awesome although admiringly this film was pretty much a piece by piece retread of the second and first film but with more innovative set pieces and increased action.This film may have bombed at the box office but I'm glad it was made.Linda Hamilton helped propel this movie and so did Arnold Schwarzenegger although his role was more of a tongue in cheek parody designed for comic relief.Nevertheless, the film works and is the best sequel. It is by no means in the same category as T1 and T2 but an admirable effort.It's like a choose your own adventure... If you want John to love and follow his story, watch T3. If you want Sarah to love and continue her story, watch this.All in all an 7.5/10 (rates 10 here to counteract the 1 trolls)To put in perspective...Terminator - 8.5/10Terminator 2 - 10/10 (my favorite all time movie)T3: Rose of the Machines - 6/10Terminator Salvation - 1/10 (unwatchable.

The introduction of an augmented human. Yes, it is sort of the retelling of other stories but I would put this above salvation (of course) genysis (the best part of that movie is Emilia Clarke's reincarnation of Sarah Connor) and Rise of the Machines (which had one cool scene at the very end when the film score highlighted an apocalypse with pure beauty).

They broke that rule in t2 straight away and again in this 1 which is unforgivable considering the importance. It's why they come through naked etc. Anyway, the John Conner death effectively changes the timeline completely. It's no longer skynet that became 'aware' but 'legion'. Not important you may say, but if the t800 (arnie) terminator has been sending Sarah Conner details of where all the other terminators sent back by SKYNET appear (also, for what reason ,given that John is dead now. Who would they hunt?) how could he possibly know where the new terminator sent back by a totally different computer with different tech from an alternate timeline would turn up to make sure Sarah Conner turns up to help grace etc?

I watched it as action movie with no expectation of deep character conflicts or something philosophical - it's not a Nietzsche biography or another Woody Allen movie about something damaged in his life. It's an action movie about deadly IA. The first one was original, because at that time IA development wasn't that advanced, computers made first steps and so on. The first one brought attention to possible (probable?) future if our species rely too much on technology ('cause if you program ""eliminate all dangers to life survival"", it will definitely kill off Homo Sapiens Sapiens indiscriminately. Scientifically proven). The second one emerged at the time of fast development of computers, where the Terminator world seemed even more possible. And Sarah Connor was awesomely changed from the screaming waitress of the first one. By the end of the second she was already a developed character, no further development of her could be possible. Unless maybe reverse - her struggles to go back to normal life. The third one (i.e. this one), we saw that she basically didn't have time for that. The loss of John WAS traumatic. So traumatic, that she never managed to go passed it. Until she met Dani that is. Terminator (Karl) puts very nicely in the movie when they meet.I loved the grouping of Sarah, Dani and Grace.

1398,ericwatkinson,The problems with Terminator Dark Fate can be divided into three categories,1,5 February 2020,"Firstly, in order for a science fiction movie to be worthwhile, it needs to have a plausible story line, with characters which are believable. Unfortunately, the overarching story arc of Terminator Dark Fate is so difficult to digest, that the viewer is unable to suspend disbelief to actually enjoy the movie. For example, the character known as Grace is supposedly an augmented super soldier sent back in time by the Resistance. However, in all of the earlier Terminator films the Resistance was always portrayed as a ragtag group of freedom-fighters barely hanging on to survival. Therefore, how in the world did the Resistance gain the ability to replace Grace's entire human skeleton with a titanium cyborg battle chassis? (The scene in which Grace is x-rayed in the migrant detention center.) There are simply far too many implausible scenarios throughout Terminator Dark Fate for the movie to make any sense, and because of this, it is simply not an enjoyable film. Something else needed to happen with the plot of this film, I'm not sure what, but maybe a visit to the place where the first Terminator CPU came from might be nice, but anything would be better than watching yet another film in which Terminators fight with the humans in an industrial facility out in the desert somewhere.Secondly, since the election of Donald Trump, Hollywood studio executives seem to feel the need to go completely overboard when it comes to packing as many Social Justice Warrior themes into a film as possible, and Terminator Dark Fate is no exception. To begin with, the three main female characters are overly portrayed as being heroic, trustworthy, and self-sacrificing, while pretty much all of the male characters are portrayed as being deceitful, dishonest, and or cowardly. Think of the white male supervisor at the auto assembly plant in Mexico who planned on firing Daniella's brother, or Major Dean who is willing to sell classified technology to Sara Connor for mere money. Ironically, Major Dean is killed by the Rev 9 Terminator without even barely defending himself, as are most of the other male characters in this film. One of the main problems with Terminator Dark Fate is that strong female characters don't always equal interesting or worthwhile female characters, and that goes double when the strong female characters are being portrayed by actresses who simply glare into the camera as they growl their lines in a completely unbelievable deadpan fashion. There are other heavy-handed SJW themes woven throughout the film such as illegal immigration, migrant detention centers, and misogyny and when combined with the weak story-line, the film becomes completely unwatchable.Lastly, the once likable character of Sarah Connor is reduced to an unfamiliar shambling old woman who speaks with a smoker's voice, and whose behavior and mannerisms are completely out of step from those in the earlier films. Part of what made Sarah Connor great in those earlier films was the fact that she seemed like someone you might actually meet in real life. Oh a waitress working in a burger restaurant, that seems completely believable. Now she's a survivalist nut who has just escaped from a mental institution. Well, that takes a bit more imagination, but I know that survival nuts actually exist, and I also know that people from mental institutions tend to act in highly eccentric fashion, therefore, the Sarah Connor found in Terminator 2 Judgment Day is still somewhat a very believable character, especially given the manner in which Linda Hamilton seemed to pour her heart and soul into these earlier renditions of Sarah Connor. However, by comparison, the Sarah Connor found in Terminator Dark Fate is a senior citizen with a noticeable osteoporosis hump on her back, yet we are supposed to believe it when she fires a shoulder mounted missile without bracing her feet, or when she stood on the rear ramp of a rapidly ascending C-5 Galaxy without being blown off by the tail wind. In the earlier films Sarah Connor was sometimes happy, such as when she made love to Kyle Reese in Terminator 1, and sometimes she was psychotically enraged such as when she ranted at Miles Bennet Dyson in Terminator 2. However, the Sarah Connor found in Terminator Dark Fate is just a dull lifeless character who recites her lines into the camera in an old lady's cigarette voice. Such a terrible disappointment after so many years for the return of Sarah Connor.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I watched the trailer before going to the movie theater and YESSS I also read all the negative reviews which was a bit of a let down as I had really high hopes for the movie, being a hardcore terminator and Arnold fan, I decided to watch it anyway. So I put up a smile and said to myself, ""Meh, what the heck, at least the CGI looks great in the trailers, we can enjoy that right?"". So here were are (Me, Wife and the Kid), sitting at the top row and munching on popcorn and the movie starts ... The first scene, well according to the so called ""Hardcore Terminator Fans"" was a let down. But I don't think so. It was done for a reason, and that is why not everybody can tell (or write) a story and get paid huge for it. To cut to the chase they decided not to DRAG the same story over (as done in the last 2 sequels) and altered the concept slightly to turn things around. It was risky, but I really think it worked out fine. The plot was OK, acting was OK, effects and fight scenes were simply amazing and combined overall result was a decent and good movie and MUCH MUCH better then the last sequels after the legendary T2. This is not a copy, but yet it captures some of the most greatest moments of T2 and throws them afresh towards the audience. It's like ... Yeah that's what T2 was all about !!!!.In short, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I didnt have high hopes for it, but I was surprised. Wife and the Kid loved it and the audience seems very content and I can tell .. because I am a good face reader :).

It was similar to the new Ghostbusters on how it tried to make women so much smarter and more capable than men. The dialogue was kinda weak.

This movie destroys that.Basically, they tried to recreate T2 with a female John Connor and a female Terminator, having basically the same emotionally bond as the previous incarnations. It felt like they were forcefully pushing strong female characters. I'm all for strong female leads, but we already have Sarah and this feels way too obvious and not at all unique.And the conrinuiting makes no sense what so ever. T2 establishes that in order to gain a conscious you needed to reprogram the terminator chip, this movie ignores that.Full of action scenes which will entertin action lovers but just over the top with shoving as much action as possible instead of developing the story more.",Terminator - Dark Fate

1415,therevanchist-14739,Honest Review from a long time fan,4,5 November 2019,"Terminator Dark fate was to no surprise by now very very disappointing for many reasons but just to start they didn't try to add anything that was unique or fresh to the franchise. This movie was supposed to continue from the amazing first two terminator movies that I was a huge fan of! They decided to use to take everything down that we cared about in the opening scene by killing off John Connor who has been the main focus of the whole series which was like a big middle finger to all the fans just to introduce the new John Connor which is some random girl from Mexico who we never even receive valid reasons to care about. Literally I did not care about anyone besides Sarah because of the history we have been through with her. They use the same old recycled plot just Skynet is called Legion because no matter what some random AI has to take over the future whether skynet is defeated or not. Arnold returns as a terminator but after completing his mission and killing John Connor he decides to grow a conscious and have a family and he a father and husband and I hope you can see where I have problems with this narrative, also if Skynet was destroyed then how do they still send a terminator back in time to kill John!?!? This movie took everything we cared about as fans and threw it away to give us the same thing with different people that we don't care about. From a terminator fan this movie was extremely disappointing to me and I still haven't brought up everything that I hated about it. I only give it 4 stars because of action that's it.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1416,sbrackstone,Very disapointed,1,6 November 2019,"Well most people have already said it all, what a bad film this is. This really is just a money film for a director that does not want to do any work. When they had a good film franchise title and guaranteed box office seats with a good budget to spend you would at least think they could be bothered to write a different story rather then just reproducing the same story with hardly any changes.To top this off we start the film in Mexico so you need to be reading subs for the first part which distracts from the film, why bother we know it in Mexico.Sarah Connor now in her 60's we are suppose to believe she is still killing of terminators and getting thrown around and still gets up, at one point I thought she might get her zimmer frame out and throw it at the terminator. Even nicking the one liners which the first Terminator used was a joke, ""I'll be back"", I wont. Really this was so unbelievable it was cringing to watch.Then comes Arnold's script a terminator which has now grown a consonance and want to setting down with a family haha, I thought this was an action film not a comedy.Really with this franchise in hand the director needs to be sacked and stop producing films in the future. They have ruined this franchise and this really is the end to the terminator",Terminator - Dark Fate

I can't believe what they did with his character. Whoever wrote that shouldn't write anything again, ever. This is one if the worst science fiction films I've ever seen.

Thankfully it ignores the insult that was Genysis. Seems like it also gets a lot of hate due to the strong female presence. This franchise will built on strong females. Mackenzie Davis was spectacular in this. If you ignore the mess of the franchise continuity this movie holds up well. It is well made, well acted and the visuals were done right. We also got a lot of classic snark remarks which was made famous in T2. I also liked them dropping the John Connor plot line so we can get something fresh and new to move the franchise forward. It's a shame that it seems like the franchise is at another dead end. Nonetheless, I give this a 7.5/10 after subsequent viewings. It will age well.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1422,rebecca_campbell_davila,"Not as bad, still too much intersectional",8,28 January 2020,"Movie is entertaining, specially the first 2/3 until things start to happen with out logic: like the military help.The scenes from Mexico are quite wrong: the ""tamal"" is actually a French bread (bolillo) sandwich, outside Mexico City is a huge forest region all around not desert, car models are American with station wagons never sold there and colors quite impossible south of the border... but the worst part were the accents: some of the people spoke American Spanish, probably from LA and the worst part originally or defendants from Central America, not Chilangos from El DF. This is ridiculous, as if Die Hard 1 was filmed using Chicago and nY locations and landmarks, with British accent by the civilians.The best character is the T101 with its humanity... Grace's character is not bad but the last third is wasted with out of logic script.
Sarah Connor is entirely nonsensical, and the reason why the movie is guilty of misandrist feminism... just too nasty human being, lack of values and pointless.The girl, not a migrant but a refugee (running from that thing!) would be ok... would make sense if Sarah Connor was not around in the movie.I thought the movie was awful, but it isn't.

It doesn't make an effort to be political at all. It's not talking down to men for assuming a man will be the future leader. It's actually a female character who assumed a man would be the leader, and this film expands this narrow worldview of hers.I'm not female, not a minority, and not in any other disadvantaged position, but I just find it sad how angry people get in this day and age projecting their political biases onto films just for existing.

Not making any superlatives here like others.",10,3 November 2019,"It's so sad to live in a continent where so many socially inept will accuse anything of having a political agenda just because it's female-centred. It's like, ""How does it make sense for women to suddenly be important too? It doesn't make sense! The men were the important ones the whole time!"" James Cameron returns to produce a definitive sequel to T2, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton are together again on screen, and it's an R-rating that doesn't dick around trying to be family-friendly, and you can't even appreciate this goldmine because you're distracted by the existence of women. To the straight men who're triggered, I don't even know why you're so mad because these women are stone cold foxes. It's like you're not used to women in general. It's got a solid story and production value, but where it really shines is returning the series to the same intensity of the first two, aided by an all-around great cast as expected. The Rev-9 isn't as groundbreaking on a technical level as the T-800 and T-1000 were in their time, but it's a natural progression for Terminator models and a much bigger threat than before, portrayed with Gabriel Luna's frightening coldness. The fight and stunt choreography are some of the best all year. Schwarzenegger always kept up with his fitness, and Hamilton's torturous workout to reach his level really pays off, yet Davis' physicality is surprisingly the standout by a long shot. As anticipated, many people are angry about the murder of John Connor and accuse the writers of forcing feminism. First off, Cameron was head of the story and killed off his own character because he wanted to. He hated how Alien 3 killed off certain characters he'd created, so he wouldn't have done the same if he thought it was forced. If you think about what makes you so mad that John's dead, it's because he was built up as a saviour, but T2 already established that he wouldn't become the same man and gave him his own journey. It may have been shorter, but it's a complete character arc that doesn't need continuation and that's a testament to T2's writing. Audiences seem to always want a sequel that subverts all expectation while being exactly what they expect, then they get angry when it can't do that: Salvation tried so hard to give John a gritty war film, Genisys turned him into the bad guy, and anything you can come up with is probably just as bland. What he deserved afterwards was to spend time with his mother and get a proper childhood, which is why it's so effectively tragic that he was killed after only getting a taste of what family feels like, but it's not for nothing. Clearly written from a place of love for the character, they devoted a lot to show how much his death affects others. Sarah was always the main character, and her loss gives her a new dimension as she walks a fine line between rage and sorrow. It's an emotional subversion of expectation for John's mother to have to protect his legacy. Dani doesn't just waltz in and steal John's place: her journey begins with incredible loss too, she bonds with Sarah over their grief, and as the weight on her shoulders keeps stacking up, Sarah passes on the same training she gave John to a new pupil and shows her how huge the shoes she has to fill really are. It's not talking down to men; it's actually Sarah and Dani, both women, who assume that the new leader is a man. For god's sake, it's also not a competition which sex gets to lead. The point is that John the person is different from John the hero: anyone who chooses to be a leader is John Connor, and it's hopeful to believe that humanity will always rise to the occasion. Carl's arc is perhaps the most compelling. Unlike the sequential structure of most arcs, his is iterative. Every time a version of the Terminator comes back, he makes it further in human behaviour: the first time, he's only able to imitate what he sees; the next, he's reprogrammed to protect John and befriends him, ultimately sacrificing himself to complete his mission; here, he succeeds in killing John, but seeks purpose afterwards as Skynet never exists in this timeline. He raises a son and understands the gravity of what he's done. It only makes sense that he'd develop some semblance of a conscience after 22 years, and even a personality, which makes for some endearing comedy. He insists that his capacity for emotion isn't the same as a human's, but after sacrificing himself, this time by his own free will, he decides to pay tribute to John with his dying words. After so many  sequels, this brings cuts them off and brings closure to the series with a focused story that isn't a commercial for the next film. I'd hope they never make more, but I know better.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Linda Hamilton was never a great actress, but her performance in this movie is just awful.Chemistry between characters don't work out, the development of the characters is weak to say the least (oh yeah, I can shoot guns like a pro, if just the right motivation is there - was that supposed to be funny?)Ridiculous charakter development on Arnies part.

She kept beating up indecent bystanders which was caused me to want her to lose.
I WANTED THE GOOD GUYS TO LOSE
How do you mess up a storyline like that?
They tried to make it cool with bad catchy phrases throughout the feature which made is look like they're trying to be cool like the first two movies were instead of actually being cool. I think this one ends the franchise.
Thank you, whoever wrote this garbage and goodbye TERMINATOR, forever",Terminator - Dark Fate
1442,sandy_joe-744-236935,Surprised by the subtle humor,7,8 November 2019,This was a good well done sequel. Lots of action of course and some comic moments. Some people are getting their panties in a wad about this being primarily a female lineup but I enjoyed it. I like kick ass women that can handle big guns. Those damn liquid terminators just won't die. Worth seeing for sure.,Terminator - Dark Fate

And what if the guy sent back to save her was the father of that son?T2: Judgment Day - What if the future humans hacked one of those old models and now that human looking robot is the protector? And what if instead of just trying to survive it they went after the people and company that created the AI/machines?Terminator: Dark Fate - What if instead of the son, it's a Mexican woman?That's it. There's nothing added to the story other than making it about saving a Mexican woman who one day in, I guess the very near future, would be leading the resistance.I wasn't a fan of the other sequels in this franchise but at least they tried to make the story bigger.This movie's plot is pointless. I never care about the characters, not even Sarah Connor. By the time we get to the final boss fight, I don't really care if any of the three women or Arnold's terminator make it. So when one has to be sacrificed, it's sure, whatever.In the first two movies having the protector from the future die or realize it needs to be destroyed sucked. You were rooting for them. Here, you won't...",Terminator - Dark Fate
1444,killferd,A really good Terminator movie.,10,26 January 2020,"This movie really follows the footsteps of the terminator one and two, now for many new to the franchise it may not mean much. But for those of us who grew up with the poster of Arnie on our wall's as a Terminator, it was a really good conclusion.
Sure they may bring him back but this is a whole new arc and, in essence this transfer's the baton to next generation.
I know there are plot holes and with any story from the eighties it is kind of a unreal to expect them to cover each and every aspect of it, i for one did not care for it.
its a follow up to a franchise which is living for more than 4 decades among the viewers, it is bound to have a gaps due to different people being the part of it.
Just enjoy it, and cherish Arnie in his element for those are not many and come very far apart.I have grown from a kid to a teenager and a father, with this franchise, for the kids of my generation kick back have a cold one and relive the thrilling experience once again.
thank you for taking the effort and time to make this.
The end score in credits was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!",Terminator - Dark Fate
1445,colbathmark,Another Feminist Makeover,3,15 November 2019,"This chapter was way too predictable. After years of watching Hollywood reboot old movies, replacing men with women, they did they same here. Yes, Terminator 1 and 2 were the best, but I enjoyed Genisys much more than this one.Arnold indicated that this is the last film of the series, and I hope that to be the case. T1 made Arnold's career, very bleeding edge. This film brought nothing new to the table.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1446,ffaf42,Seriously?,3,18 January 2020,Basically all female protagonists with a few weak male side kicks and a male antagonist. The female 'machine' character acts so juvenile and defiant throughout the entire film. It's pretty annoying more than anything. Her character puts way too much feeling and emotion into her lines and actions it's overkill and frankly overdramatic. It's a complete turn off almost cringeworthy. There's a few points throughout the movie where I almost just turned it off. Some of the punch lines were so cheesy and overdone...🙄The movie just sucks. It's like they tried to reboot the terminator franchise just like the ghostbusters and that was a HUGE flop.And as for the reviewers saying that us guys are being misogynistic-get over your freaking selves. Not everything has to have a label. The movie just sucked. It was bad acting and a bad plot. They could've used better lines and more experienced actors. The ONLY good parts were the action and CGI. That's literally it. Everything else felt like a soap opera. Why Arny made an appearance baffles me. He should've let this ship sink on its own.,Terminator - Dark Fate

But as always, when part of a franchise, it has to keep up to more than 'OK"". It has to be awesome and wow the franchise fans. And that's where it goes wrong. Forget the screwed up timelines and other versions. It just didn't keep me interested.As an example, I watched Zombieland 2 with no expectations, but it held up as a sequel as it had the same look and feel, quality and felt part of the same reason I loved the first one. Arguably, better.Dark fate? Nah. Just another money maker without even pretending it's not.",Terminator - Dark Fate

The only two things i would not have done is : 1) Brought back Sara Conner 2) i would have gone with a Asian character rather than Mexican only because a Asian character would concentrate more logically on ways of defeating such a advance formidable terminator instead of the emotional passion and anger generally portrayed by a person of Mexican decent.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Story line is garbage, special effects that are crap and totally unbelievable. It was a struggle to get through the whole movie, I paused it a few times to take a break and side the internet.I was thinking of watching T2, my favorite move of all time, to get the bad taste out of my mouth but I think Dark Fate has ruined the franchise for me for awhile.",Terminator - Dark Fate

1453,theshanny,Another disappointment,1,26 October 2019,As a huge fan I've officially given up hope of ever seeing another terminator film that is as good as T1 and T2. The story was all over the place and the one-liners were awful. Another movie with political messages which tries too hard to be cool.

The effects were impressive.It's a solid movie to an awesome storyline.,Terminator - Dark Fate
1456,roxy-05118,Great action. Strong female leads,8,8 November 2019,"Must watch for action lovers. The movies 3 heroines definitely kick some a**! The acting of the cast is on point, the action very well done for which I give the high score . As for the story, why my review is 8 out of 10, it is basically a recycled terminator but with at least some twists. The controversy about the actors is definitely just because some people seem incapable of handling a female taking lead action roles. Especially the role of grace is unnecessarily criticised as Mackenzie Davis straight up knocks it out of the park. For me it was 100% enjoyable as an action flick which I definitely will watch again.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1457,sandykemp,Not as bad as I thought it would be...,7,4 November 2019,"I was honestly surprised by Terminator: Dark Fate. I went in not expecting much but I won't lie...I found it pretty enjoyable. Flawed yes. However not as bad as some of the reviews have led me to believe.The opening sequence is visceral and definitely not how you'd expect any Terminator movie to start. However it leaves us with a cleaner slate to start off with than previous sequels.I'm not going to deny that the plot is a bit formulaic after that but it's an action movie after all and where I feel this movie succeeds is that it doesn't try to be more than just that.Linda Hamilton delivers the goods as an older even more jaded Sarah Conner. She has some of the best lines in the movie and her interactions with Mackenzie Davis' Grace are great.Of course this being Terminator we see the return of good old Arnie...again. ""Carl"", I have to admit, is far more palatable than ""Pops"" was. He still gets in a few quips and jokes here and but he's more of a back to business T-800 (like ""Uncle Bob""). Despite his years he still manages to look and be kick-ass.Speaking of Terminators Gabriel Luna does a pretty decent job as the Rev-9. He's like a greatest hits compilation of T-X and T-1000 rolled into one. I feel they could have made more of his ability to split more in the movie. The T-1000 was used to his full potential in T2 and it just feels the Rev-9 had more to offer but never got the chance to shine as bright as he could have.The story does cherrypick elements from all the other Terminator movies (and the TV series) but it manages to stitch them together reasonably coherently. If you're looking for a revolutionary new take on Terminator then you will be disappointed. However if you're looking for some full throttle, over the top action you could do a lot worse.",Terminator - Dark Fate

If you love the Terminator story, go see the movie.....period!! I was excited that I get to see one of my favorite childhood characters on the big screen again, simple. James Cameron came back, Linda Hamilton and Tim Miller, the action was great, the Rev-9 was scary and the movie was very fun, especially in IMAX.....what else do you want???

1459,giacomolamura,Hell no!,4,15 July 2020,"I don't understand why the hell they keep shooting franchise chapters even though they know they're crap from the beginning.
We have a change of setting for this Terminator since it mostly runs in Latin America and one of the main characters is Latin indeed but this is it. That's as new and fresh as it gets. Sure we have the comeback of Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger but they look like they've been put there just to remember fans that this should still be a part of the Terminator franchise.
What I really didn't like, aside a forgettable directing and editing, and got me thinking this is not a good movie at all is the fact that there is no plot. I mean, the whole movie is just a wild chase in which this ramshackle group runs from a Terminator because, guess what, the poor defenseless Latin girl is the one who's gonna save everyone in the future (wow, they really must've thought it through). And that's really it. There's nothing more, no surprise of sort or something that makes you think you just didn't waste two hours.

This has got to be the worst visual effects ever in any sort of Hollywood movie.The acting is so poor.

I try my best to look past it so that I don't have to give this a 1/10 like the other reviews.To start of there's some parts in this film that undo what was done in the first two movies. There's isn't an actual reason for it but to probably continue the story.I notice after the Rev 9 shows up, the CGI looks like something out of a video game. Not impressive, but I do like his powers which is somewhat similar to T-1000, with a few extra additions to the liquid metal.The casting for this film is one of the reasons, it gets a lot hate. Franchises have been starting to force diversity/equality but there isn't much you can do about it. The character of Dani and Grace are less obnoxious than I thought they would be. The cast has some chemistry though it's strange.
The acting is okay half of the time, but usually dragged down by the dialogue.The best parts of the movie are the action sequences, mostly involving Rev 9 and Grace. It's fast paced and reminds me of some comic book movies but it can look laughable at times. It's great seeing Arnie back as Terminator and Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor. They are the redeeming parts of this film and actually contribute to the story. The third act is a bit too familiar but it works enough to make possibilities for a sequel that might not be god awful.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Terminator CGI and design was terrible. Have they forgotten how to work with models? Chrome or stainless does not do well in CGI. Why has hollywoord forgotten GRIT , everything these days looks to pristine..
The storyline messes up everything. What a stupid idea to veer away from skynet, I mean come on! It did not move the story forward at all. Why can't anyone write a decent sequel to terminator 2? They keep forgetting that the story drives the movie, and it was a dud, as most movies are these days, all cgi and show, but nothing memorable.

The new Star Wars trilogy was a disaster and ultimately completely pointless. The new Rambo movie was again pointless and now Terminator Dark Fate was pointless. The story ended in T2 and this new story was completely stupid with terminators from alternate futures fighting over a female version of John Connor. In terms of action it was good, story was AWOL and you sensed a need to force a strong female narrative on the audience. It was done better than The Last Jedi but nevertheless it wasn't subtle. Nor were the un-subliminal eco messages the film tried to deliver. You expect better from directors like Cameron so these social agendas must be driven by the film studios.

1479,paulmclaren,Review - Terminator Dark Fate,6,6 November 2019,"Whilst Box Office results haven't been great so far I decided to check this out as I'm a Terminator nerd and I've seen all the others.Forget Rise of the Machines, Salvation & Genysis as this one is a direct sequel to probably the best sequel of all time. Terminator 2 Judgement Day (sorry to Aliens). In fact it starts directly after Judgement Day is avoided in 1998 and Ed Furlong even makes an appearance.Plot wise 2 Terminators are sent back from 2042 to 2020, one to protect, one to terminate. New models with cool enhancements. The future is different to what we know from the previous films as the future was changed back in 1997. Confused yet?? This time they are after a young Mexican teenager but I won't spoil why. The film is one long chase not unlike the original 1984 Terminator.Linda Hamilton returns and you can tell she hasn't acted for a while. She's ok and it's cool to have her back. She says ""mother fu#$#er"" alot but hey she's had it rough! Mackenzie Davis steals the show as the protector and she is part of some spectacular fight sequences.Now to my biggest issue. ARNIE. Sorry but the movie suffers badly from the moment he appears. He shouldn't be there and his explanation as to how and why he is, is just plain stupid 😡!! What's he been doing for 22 years will surprise you. If you can get past this then you will enjoy the rest.I did enjoy that they decided to go back to the violence of the original as the last few suffered from being PG rated. Even Arnie admitted that in an interview. The body count is high and no one is amune to getting dead. As a Terminator should it terminates without remorse.So overall, I enjoyed this. The actions good, the story is ok for the most part and it will be interesting to see if they do anymore. The ending was good and certainly leaves the door ajar.6.5/10He said he'd be back. If so, leave Arnie behind....",Terminator - Dark Fate
1480,Emmet_L_Brown,Terminate the terminator,6,6 November 2019,"Let me open this review mentioning that I am a long fan of the Terminator series and still remember when T2 was a huge event, a highly anticipated movie back in the day. The special effects, the narrative, the Guns n' Roses soundtrack, the action, the special effects, make it almost an obligatory view for those invested in sci-fi. Fast forward 28 years and we are presented with what would be the definitive sequel to T2, but it fails in so many aspects.First and foremost the first five minutes of Dark Fate ruin T1, T2 and all other movies contained in this timeline, and keeping in mind I have not been a huge fun of all other installments either, at least they maintained some sort of common sense and continuity. But *spoiler ahead* killing a young John Connor is similar to not killing Bruce Wayne's parents on that rainy night in Gothan City and destroy all Batman timeline afterwards. That alone was utterly ridiculous and a disservice to the fans. What is seen can not be unseen so what we do with all the histories told after T2 until now? Forget them? Assume they were a bad dream? Or maybe they happened on a parallel universe, hun?Then we have all this PC agenda thrown in. No problem at all with a female terminator (we have seen this before) but why replace J.Connor with a female version and on top of that, from South of the border? They could have chosen anyone, from any place, but, the political agenda and the female empowerment angle had to be used. It is really becoming a bad habit of Hollywood recently, unfortunately.The script was lame and almost a rehash of what we have seen in T2, even the main antagonist was pretty similar to the previous one. So in 28 year Skynet, or, Legion as it is called now, only managed such a small technology advance? Really? Just compare the real world computer technology jump we had in this time-frame and it will make no sense.Somehow I managed to give it a six, as, seen as a stand-alone movie, it is has its merits, some good action here and there (sparsely) , a bit o humour and the nostalgia of seeing Linda and Arnold acting together again.For the sake of respecting the legacy of the original films, they should stop here and leave the stage with some respect left.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Although T3 was more like a weird low-budget side-film, it still was more faithful to the original storyline than salvation, genesis, and dark fate. The other films are pure garbage - written and filmed with more attention paid to trends and popularity than actual storywriting. It's a disappointment because the future talked about in Terminator 2 is absolutely fascinating, and fans everywhere have been robbed of something we've waited for a long time.

1489,timothydodson-34504,Let it die,1,2 November 2019,"Went into this trying to be positive but ended up feeling betrayed as the credits rolled. The virus has infected every facet of entertainment and this once awesome franchise has been neutered to make way for bland female characters who nobody cares about. Politics poison a good story and that's exactly what's happened here. All political b.s. aside, the movie still suffers from bad writing and a story that goes nowhere. Arnold and Linda do next to nothing in this except to provide some bad lines. Avoid this bag of cringe and watch Terminator 1 and 2 instead.",Terminator - Dark Fate

1491,erixlennerd,Damn these SJWs! Another movie ruined by unnecessary diversity,5,14 January 2020,"The title pretty much sums it up.
It's called Terminator not Terminatrix and most fans of the movie will agree that this was another unnecessary installment in the franchise for the only reason of appeasing the woke crowds.
I'm all for a strong female lead - Aliens is one of my all-time faves - and we already had Linda Hamilton. So was it really necessary to bring the I'm unsure if it's male or female character and also the latina who's supposed to save the world? Why not some Inuit or Ukrainian chick?
Furthermore, just let Arnie go! He's old, can't make movies like he used to. Let him pass the baton to someone new. The Rock fits the bill. I like him more than Vin Diesel despite Diesel acting like a robot most of the time :-)))Anyways, enough of a rant.
Make a Terminator without worrying about the PC warriors, diversity, SJWs, or the Woke crowd. They can make their own movie... :-P",Terminator - Dark Fate
1492,jjvolturno,Great follow up to T2,10,8 November 2019,"T2 was life changing for me, I was early teens and it epitomised everything cool at the time. Years later I can still enjoy it. This is finally a sequel worthy of T2. I've seen so many people calling it feminist junk, but please don't mistake a strong female ensemble as feminist crap. It simply isn't the case. The acting is brilliant, the story goes in directions some people maybe won't like at first, but give it a chance. The Terminator films were always about Sarah Connor, if you can't handle that go re-watch Salvation or something. This film is full of action, story, character, I even laughed a lot.

The producers and director of this...let's call it movie, should be sued.
What a shameful end of career for Linda and Arnold for accepting to take part of this garbage.
Now, about the movie itself: poor acting, poor story, waste of time. Not even entertaining but rather frustrating thinking this was intended to be part of Terminator franchise.

T3 - Till now I taught this was the worst of them all . Till now ...
T4 - Three really great scenes . The one with T-800 in city ruins is on par with the one from the first movie . Otherwise dreadful movie .

T3 and the rest were a little off, but as James Cameron said this is the sequel to T2, making you forget the others is a good thing. It's basically T1 and T2 combined in a modern setting. Is it original? No, but it's Terminator and still a cool movie.. I feel many people just like to criticize to get heard, but don't troll it for the wrong reasons. Most people expect so much today like with the MCU. Everything is being compared and needs to to be at least 100 times better etc.Linda is back and it works out great! John being replaced had more to do with Furlings personal addictions so they couldn't count on him for a new franchise. Too bad! Arnold as the Terminator is still great to watch. Rev 9 feels less of a threat than the T1000 of T2 because of human emotions, but the concept is well done.Go watch it without any prejudice and enjoy the ride full of action!

It was said that you change your future with every decision that you make, and you can decide right now to change your future. The lesson: trust me when I say that your future is better if you've never seen this movie.""Terminator: Dark Fate"" is a big 'screw you' to everyone who ever enjoyed the original Terminator movie and the first sequel. The movie's plot isn't good enough to the viewer to even use a couple minutes create a parallel universe (ala XMen) where its ok that EVERY SINGLE THING IN THIS MOVIE DEFIES THE ENTIRE PLOT OF THE FIRST DOZEN SEQUELS. OK, I admit that I lost count there of the actual number of sequels, but hopefully you got the point.Hollywood has added 'wokeness' to this movie but that is not what makes it so bad. The movie is just not very good at all. Then, add a dose of really bad wokeness on top of that and it makes it worse. I've marked the spoiler warning so I could go ahead and give it to you straight: how does a girl who just a few minutes ago had never heard of a 'kill box' and knows absolutely nothing about combat tactics suddenly decide that this is where there 'kill box' is and this is where they are going to make their last stand (without a plan or any good weapons, I might add). The plot holes are so large you could drive a Star Wars death star through them.Sadly, they left an opening for another sequel. If you're reading this, I'm warning you that this movie is horrible. I watched it for free on Amazon Prime but am still mourning for my lost future that I could have had if I had never ever seen this movie. If you heed my advice, there is a chance, albeit a small one, that the universe can be spared another sequel.",Terminator - Dark Fate

""This is the real 3rd part and epic conclusion""- they said. You know what ? I want to forget this movie because it is horrible.

I loved seeing Linda Hamilton and Arnold S even though they really emphasized the passage of time. It did keep my interest and the idea that the Sarah Connor stopped an apocalypse only to be replaced by another was clever. Can you truly change fate?I really did not like Grace and Dani. Grace looked more like a she should be working in the marketing department while sipping a pumpkin soy latte. Dani was inept and befuddled as the first sara Connor with none of the charming, self deprecating humor. And the then there's the Terminator. He might have been more frightening if he hadn't looked like the love child of PeeWee Herman and Adam Sandler. When he did his ""aw shucks"" accent, I laughed. There is a lot of scary brawn in Hollywood. Couldn't they have casted one that at least could compete with the first one? Finally, I know the melting exo-skeleton is a great gimic, but its frustrating that its so hard to kill this guy. I liked the slow disintegration of the first Terminator.

Arnie is amazing, with his acting, role, looks and one liners. Mackenzie is fantastic and should be back, in the next sequel.

1515,Jesper2801,Don't listen to the haters! This is an excellent follow-up to T2,9,2 November 2019,"I consider myself a hardcore Terminator fan. I have watched the Terminator and T2 countless times since I was a kid and they remain among my all time favorite movies. Needless to say, I've found myself disappointed with the following installments in the franchise. Until now!Before watching this movie, I went through a lot of reviews in here. The many 1 star reviews brought my hopes down: ""Oh, here we go again. Genisys 2.0"". Thankfully, I could not at all recognize what these reviews were complaining about. I suspect that a lot of these so-called ""fans"" can't handle a female lead. And she's Mexican, too?! Oh my God!  Oh lord, oh God, oh baby Jesus. Really, guys? You consider yourselves fans and this is what you focus on?A lot of the 1-stars in here seem to care so much ""feminism"" and ""diversity"" that these topics are all what they can see in this movie. Maybe they should ask themselves why they see these agendas everywhere. In my opinion, these topics play such a little role in this movie that you need to look very hard to even see them.Well, enough speculation about why so many reviews in here are so negative. Let me try to explain what I like about this movie without spoiling too much.The script is great. Finally, a script where we see some interesting character developments and a captivating plot. Sarah Conner is back, but she has not been on the lazy side. She's has been killing terminators with the help from a mysterious helper, whose motives and identity I won't spoil here. But when she comes across Dani she sees herself as she was back in the first terminator. A helpless, scared ""nobody"" just living her daily life. Sarah is such an interesting character and I always felt that she is what this franchise has always been revolving around. She went from a waitress to the woman who wouldn't just stand back and let the machines win even though it killed off her friends and family. She was not just special because she gave birth to the leader who would save us all - she was special cause she stopped judgment day! She was not just gonna let it all play out, but she wanted to change her fate. Our fate.The acting is excellent. Linda Hamilton is just such a fine actress and in my book she is the only Sarah Connor. It was such a joy seeing her again. Arnie is great and I really like what they did with his character in this one. What happens when a Terminator loses it purpose and grows old? I like that the movie explores this and other questions about the T-800.In first movie, a human soldier was sent back to protect Sarah and in the second, a re-programmed T-800 was selected to be John's protector. Now, an enhanced human is sent back - and I love it! She's extremely bad-ass and you get why she's selected to fight against the Rev-9 who is the newest development in the terminator model line.What else did I like? The list is long. The action is awesome and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The many ""flashbacks"" about the future which reminds me of the ones Kyle had in T1. The many little treats to fans, like the music that plays in the background at some point when the Rev-9 hits the shed, or the thermal vision of the T-800. Pure nostalgia. But I gotta admit that this is not at all the reason for my rating. Without a solid story and interesting characters, the action, CGI and fan-treats become meaningless. So I am thankful that they got their crap together this time and brought us a worthy sequel to T2.I can't wait to watch this again! A solid 9 i my book. My best advice: Forget about the 1-star haters and go watch this movie. It's awesome!",Terminator - Dark Fate

1518,jonathan_crowe12,Very poor,2,31 October 2019,"Within the first 15 minutes you could tell this wasn't going to be good. It starts out well as they show Sarah's interview from T2 and then show Sarah and John at a bar by a beach. The de-aging looked incredible. Then they completely destroyed everything by killing John Connor when yet another Terminator turned up. It's like Alien 3 where the little girl that Ripley protected during the 2nd film dies in hyper sleep. You just think, ""what was the point of the last film"". After that, they just redo Terminator 1 and, as Hollywood does with every film now, John Connor gets replaced as the leader of the Resistance by a woman and Kyle Reese gets replaced by a woman. Executives think this is what people want now but we don't. Sarah says there were other Terminators sent back during T2 which brings up the questions of why they didn't work with the bad guy in T2. So many in fact that she's spend years hunting them all. From there, it's just over the top set pieces with them sitting around spouting exposition and story. The new characters are pretty forgettable as well. Most fans just wanted a war film with scenes similar to the war scenes shown in T1 and T2. If James Cameron had done that with a 3rd film around 1996/1997 then it would have been a perfect trilogy.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1519,darkmenace,Terrible,1,17 January 2020,"I pretty much agree with most the other reviewers here. T1 & T2 were great. They were dark, scary and menacing. Im guessing there was only about 10-15 mins of CGI between the 2 movies which was used to supplement an excellent story line and great acting.This garbage with its over the top feminism and CGI in total absence of a story was terrible. Nobody who ever saw a proper 90s action movie wants to see people falling out of planes and helicopters and simply running off and getting on with their day. Nor do we want to see terminators that can leap 3 storeys high in a single bound.

1523,dan_jentzen,A worthy successor - finally,9,9 September 2020,"T1 and T2 - two of the greatest movies ever in the entire action genre, two of the greatest movies ever in the entire science fiction genre. Finally there's a movie that is made with some love and respect for these awesome characters and the bleak storyline and vision of the future.Dark Fate is incredibly refreshing in 2019 where it seems like all love for filmmaking and all love for the fans has gone out the window. Now it seems more important to just keep churning out lousy remakes, reboots, sequels and prequels to earn a buck than to keep the integrity of the original spirit. This sequel is not like that. This film is the only worthy successor and it finally puts this amazing franchise to rest.There's some young insecure men who wasn't alive to watch T1 or T2 in the theatre. For some reason they seem to dislike the idea of a strong female protagonist. Likely this has to do with them being young enough to identify with adolescent John Connor. For the rest of us, who do not feel threatened by strong women, the protagonists of this movie are amazingly cool. To me this franchise has always been about a woman who grows increasingly competent with all the challenges she faces.This is the only sequel to T1 and T2 i will accept, it is not even close to the greatness of the first two films. On the other hand, it would be impossible to make a film that could compete with the originals.I've been a fan since i saw the first one on a VHS tape waiting for T2 to premiere in theatres and to me the Terminator is not a franchise.

There are infinite outcomes in a film based on altering time lines. Killing off a key character is original and believable.
The action, story line and character dynamics were simply brilliant. I love the humour, the T2 Easter eggs and the the originality of a Cameron written screenplay.
Avoid this film if you have the mental capacity of Donald Trump, but watch at all cost of you have a modicum of intellect and a live of 90s cinema.

I am a big Terminator fan, with T1 and T2 being my favorites, T3 and Salvation are a drop off from the 1st 2 films but are still enjoyable and have some good elements and have replay value. I did not like Genisys that much and is not in my collection.
**Spoilers**
This movie attempts to do what Halloween 2018 did in retconning the sequels, the problem with that is we are not machines and cannot delete those movies from our memory banks. Those sequels were pitched,approved,produced,and released to the public.....they happened so I cannot pretend those movies do not exist. According to dark fate only T1 and T2 happened so this is the true T3....mmmk so the opening scene John Connor is killed by a Arnold t-800 in 1998 when he is 13 years old, it is brutal happens if front of Sarah and it is very hard to watch, I cannot believe they thought this was a good idea, but that ruins the movie for me that is like taking Luke Skywalker out of Return of the Jedi.Dark fate is nothing more than a rehash and re packaging of Terminator 1,2,and 3 (with identity politics inserted)-a terminator is sent back in time to kill the future leader of the resistance and a lone protector is sent back by the resistance to save the future leader. So they kill John Connor off because in their woke minds its not cool or PC to have a white male as the savior of humanity, instead it is imperative to have a mexican girl take that role and the protector is a girl/transgender looking with a boys haircut..They also have the evil terminator at one point dressed up as a border patrol agent down on the USA/Mexican border and the mexican girl new leader say to Sarah and transgender protector "" I wish you was not so white"" Alot of spanish is used so be prepared to real alot of subtitles..... So you see Tim Miller and his cronies had an agenda and its easy to see.Arnold does not show up until an hour into the movie and his character is the most laughable thing in this movie, after killing John he had no further orders so he found a woman with a boy and became a family guy/terminator the last 20 years he goes by Carl and even has a business-Carl's Draperies oh and he grew a conscious he felt bad for killing John so to make up for it for the last 20 years he has been sending text to Sarah with time and location of when other terminators are sent back so she can show up and take them out.....it's like did competent adults come up with this crap? and how did he get Sarah's number?
did he find her on facebook or something? what a joke.Oh and James Cameron flat out lied to us saying Eddie Furlong is back as John, the maybe 10 seconds that John is on screen is a digital likeness of John at age 13
So lets rate this piece of crap
For lying to us about Eddie Furlong reprising his role as John then killing him off in disturbing fashion when he is 13, I am gonna take 5 stars off for that , because that is a devastating blow for me
this movie is nothing but cgi not many pratical effects and 1991 T2 cgi looks better there is another star gone
rehashing but repackaging and saying look its new and different another star gone
inserting your BS politics into a terminator movie- another star off for that
I give this movie 2 stars for some cool action chase scenes and blowing stuff upMy final thought- I will be retconning this movie along with Genisys so my terminator collection is T1,2,3, Salvation",Terminator - Dark Fate
1529,richard_tyas,Another chance to try and prove 2 wrongs make a right,3,20 April 2020,"To be honest it's noticeable that this film has Cameron behind it. It makes up for the 3 poor Terminator outings since T2What ruins it for me is it is yet another Hollywood film that places only women in the strong roles and uses dialogue to belittle men as often as possible within the paramitors of the film.I have 2 girls and a boy, in this day and age I am only concerned that my boy will not grow up with positive, strong role models as all Hollywood is trying to do is prove women can be as strong if not stronger than men while making the male roles either stupid or there for the six pack.Before anyone moans that this is how woman have been treated for centuries let me say I raise my children like I was raised that two wrongs don't make a right. We have to be smarter than that and while I want my daughters to have strong, powerful role models, like their mother is I don't want that to be at the expense of my son. It was wrong that woman were treated as less than men for so long. So make films with men and women in lead roles taking on strong and powerful characters that build the other sex up rather than put them down. My wife is the strongest, most resilient and powerful woman I have ever known and ALL my children are lucky to have her as I am lucky to have her as my wife.. But she has never felt the need to belittle me or make me feel less of a man so she can feel stronger. We build each other up and are better for it.Enough of the New Ghostbusters, Oceans 8, Live action Aladdin and Lion King that are being made or altered to push the female roles forward.Oceans 8 and Ghostbusters seemed to be made as a statement that ""women could do that too""Stop. Just make new films that celebrate the strengths of both sexes. Bad guys be men and women. Stupid people be men and women.

1531,adamkeithmossman,"This franchise is ""terminated""...",2,4 November 2019,"I think it's time to stop with the Terminator franchise. This is yet another failed attempt at trying to recapture the glory days of T1 and T2 by disregarding any characters and legacy that was built in those films.
The writer's first mistake was killing John Conner and the story just went downhill from there. Unoriginal and BLAND.
Linda Hamilton is a welcome return but even that couldn't save it..
The action scenes were okay but that's all this movie had going for it.

1533,nancy240,Keep your expectations low (no spoilers here),6,3 November 2019,"As an avid Terminator fan, and having watched the entire series last weekend, I was intrigued to see what they were going to do with Dark Fate.
I didn't read any reviews, and I am glad they didn't spoil it for me so I watched with an open mind.
First I will say, this was a fun ride! Like the Halloween franchise, the Terminator franchise takes liberties with the story & time sequence. In T#3, they wrote that Sarah Connor died, then T#5 we have a young Sarah Conner played by Emilia Clarke, who did an awesome job in that role.
It was great to see Linda Hamilton back in her role, and of course Arnold.
Overall, if you are a Terminator fan, you will hopefully enjoy the film, just don't set your expectations too high.
There are similarities from T#1&2, which will either annoy you or provide 'a-ha' moments.
That's the best I can reveal without giving away too much!

I finally feel like someone read all of those feminist essays I wrote about Terminators 1 and 2 as an undergrad and made them into a perfect film - a lesbian reading which is also a parable about toxic masculinity while also being decidedly pro immigrant AND featuring all kinds of ass kicking and stupid special effects nonsense, which simultaneously never takes itself seriously but somehow still ruling completely.My only, surprising for me, criticism is that I missed the sleazy Jared Kushner psycho blankness of Robert Patrick, and I never thought I would experience that. It's a weird feeling. It's fine though, I can just go and watch 2 or 3 of the made for tv films he suat out last year to assuage that feeling.It may have not done well in opening week but I bet this film cleans up in the next ten years with streaming rights, dvd, and the universe of action figures , tshirts, lunch boxes and (oh please ladygod) novelizations that I will be buying everyone I know for the rest of my life (starting with a woke Karl doll complete with apron and loving family.)Postscript...

Dark Fate did not start slow and only have action scenes in the last 30 minutes as some idiots on here are posting. It was in fact non stop action. And the effects stood up with time. It was a good movie and the reason I give it a 7 or 8 was because CGI in but a few spots was too CGI. But most 98% was very good. The writing, especially with choices made with Arnold and Linda were reminiscent of the original and it was sad to see Arnold has aged. How fast time flies. I'm 53 now and everything has passed so quickly. Saw it tonight in Dolby Theater and reclining seats. Really not a bad flick. Nothing can replace the experience of seeing the original in 1984. It was a freak of nature film at that time. Today's film has the better effects in spades obviously but a lot of films have upped the game with effects. Those giving it a 1 are fruitlessly and hopelessly curmudgeons who either have an issue with the heroine in this film being south of the border or are just plain trying to bring the film down by dishonest reviews.",Terminator - Dark Fate

1540,asby1156,James Cameron Terminates The Terminator Franchise?,5,6 March 2020,"James Cameron's revival of the terminator franchise was a middling effort at best. The action scenes were very entertaining, but Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger's lack of enthusiasm was painfully obvious to this reviewer. Also, the chemistry between Ms. Hamilton and Michael Biehn; and between Mr. Schwarzenegger and Edward Furlong; that was so effective in helping make Terminator 1 & 2 into sci-fi classics, was definitely missing between Mackenzie Davis and Natalia Reyes. Both actresses had to try much too hard to try to make it work, and that could be blamed on the script's wokeness. I think this story would have been far more appealing if Mr. Cameron had cast Ms. Davis and Gabriel Luna (this movie's terminator) in each other's roles. And the witty, clever dialogue that Mr. Cameron is known for was definitely missing.Technically, the script seemed to suffer on several occasions: For example, why did Sarah Connor have to kill terminators before terminator Gabriel if Dani Ramos is the principal human threat to Legion? Were there multiple human threats to Legion, and Dani was just one of them? If Sarah has all this experience wasting terminators, why didn't she use the significant firepower she previously possessed to immediately terminate this terminator? Why did she need Grace and Carl to help her so significantly this time? Why did this terminator seemingly have to get up close to spear Dani to eliminate her? Could he not have clandestinely taken her out from afar with a high-powered rifle, rocket launcher, armed drone, etc.? Why did this terminator move lightning fast sometimes and not during close-in confrontations with Dani and her protectors? And the amazing coincidences pertaining to the cargo plane and the dam? And Carl becoming more human without being reprogrammed? (Carl's nature miraculously changing is the most ridiculous nonsense I have ever seen in a sci-fi movie.) And so on and so forth.I don't know why the political stuff pertaining to the U.S. southern border was included in a terminator movie. But at least white males were not made to look like incompetent fools. I liked seeing Latino characters as co-leads in a big budget movie. Whites are not the only folks who can entertain people from across the planet.As a big sci-fi fan, I will give just about any new sci-fi movie, tentpole to tiny, a go, hoping it will entertain me. This movie only did in spots. So I hope James Cameron pays attention to the critics and the lack of box-office success of this movie so he doesn't make the same mistakes with his next Avatar effort.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1541,andre-filipe-santos,IT DIDNT PICK WHERE IT LEFT OFF...,7,28 October 2019,"But rating this a 1 or a 2 like so many have been doing, it is way too harsh.
Let us face it, there hasnt been an up to par Terminator movie ever since T2, (although Salvation with the alternative story/timeline was in my opinion not as bad as it has been portrayed).
T2 was an epic movie, with an awesome script, awesome acting, and extremely intense. It would and will be forever hard, if not impossible, to come to close to that pentacle of a movie. However, a fair comparison would be to compare this with every other Terminator movie that followed T2:
namely, T3, and T-Genesys, and where on earth is this movie any worst than those abominations of movies??? This movie deserves at least a 6.5/7.
The future changes radically with the slightest different atitudes people have, in every other time travel movie, let us say from ""back to the future"", to ""butterfly effect"", etc, it is widely accepted that this is how it works, although nobody even knows exactly, SO WHY DOES THIS MOVIE GET SO CRITICIZED for changes in the future?? I honestly dont get people anymore.
The story is nice, the new hybrid Terminator looks awesome, the possible future that we will be facing is dark and tense, the sound track is also decent, there are some plot holes, true, but nobody said it deserves an Oscar, or that the movie is a straight 10 stars on imdb, but certainly isnt deserving 1's and 2's, IF THIS MOVIES RATING EVER DROPS BELOW T3 Rise of the machines....humanity is lost, and we SHOULD BE TERMINATED.",Terminator - Dark Fate

First of all I think both actresses Linda Hamilton and Mackenzie Davis were excellent and their performances along with the Terminator actor Gabriel Luna really made the movie.
In my opinion the part of the movie that I found quite weak was surprisingly Arnold's character and the choice of the other lead character played by Natalia. Although no doubt Natalia is a good actress .. I just really think they made a mistake in choosing her playing that part. Sorry but she wasn't credible enough to be a leader of the resistance. As for Arnold's character wtf were they thinking? As if a T-800 killing machine would settle in within the human race, have a girlfriend and help raise her child?! Lmao...
I also think John Connor getting killed so easily after all that effort in staying alive in T2 wouldn't go down so well with the hardcore fans.
However, I still think this movie is definitely the 3rd best film of the franchise after T2 & T1 and perhaps the right sequel... so I'm going to have agree with what Linda Hamilton said on the Jimmy Kimmel show when asked about the movie... ""it's ok"".
But perhaps a little better than ok Linda :)",Terminator - Dark Fate

I'd say this film isn't quite up to the standard of those but it is still nevertheless a decent action film.I particularly liked Grace who plays the part of an enhanced human from the future and surprisingly I thought Arnie played the slightly more conscious terminator really well.It's not a deeply philosophical film but there was an insightful bit on the nature of our need to have a purpose which I liked. Yes it's more of the same, action, giant machines but thankfully not action all the way. There's some good script writing and character development too.I think you can safely ignore all the extreme low ratings for this film. People rating it a 1 are just being plain dishonest and have never actually seen a 1 rated film. I think if all these dishonest ratings were removed the true rating would probably be somewhere around 7 which is what I give it.If you go with an open mind and don't mind the fact it's not quite as good as the first 3 I think it's really enjoyable film.I saw it at the cinema and I can't wait to watch it again on video in the near future.",Terminator - Dark Fate

While I can understand ratings anywhere between 5 and 7, ratings under 5 I found are very exaggerated and forced.Is Dark Fate better than 1 & 2? No. Is it better than all that followed? Yes. The number one complaint about it destroying the main story line is wrong. At the end of T2 sky-net was pre-destroyed.. all chips gone. Sarah and John saved humanity. Sarah knows when 1997 comes and goes that they won. So.. after 1997 passes John is no longer key.Fast forward now to another possible future and guess what yet another company rises to take Sky-nets place and yet again humanity is almost destroyed. And it's version of Kyle Reese and John Conner plays out.I find it all very plausible that no matter what happens in the terminator universe that humanities demise is always around the corner and that dark fate just keeps getting delayed by some version of Sarah and Co. and her ilks.If your sick of time traveling terminators then this movie isn't for you.

But the script must be good, character must be interesting and well played and the movie must work as a whole.Here, I have a feeling, we are fed with novadays feministic propaganda and they focus on diversity at the cost of quality. They killed John Connor just to make room for completly uninteresting boring female character that lack everything that Sarah had. Or Reese for that matter. Or adult John in later terminator movies. And one of the sentence in the movie says it all ""you are not the mother of some man who saves the future. Your are the future"". So, they killed the main/center character of the franchise in most idiotic circumstances possible and labled him as ""some man"", completly unimprtant. And one of the best female character in the history is now just a mother... of ""some man"". These strong characters are wiped out and now the silly, average girl from mexico is the future of the mankind. This is pathethic. Nobody will beat the performance of Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor in T2... ever.And when it comes to ideas hollywood is bankrupt these days. You can summarize the plot as - there is new skynet, new terminators and they still travel through time to hunt strong resistance members. Its the same problem as with the new star wars films - copy/paste, copy/paste, copy/paste...And all those silly ideas of terminator settling down, grewing conscience and having family.

The fact that she begins to train the next kick ass chick in the franchise is a cool ending. AND NOBODY does Sarah Connor, like Linda Hamilton.The new Terminator wasn't scary enough. Bit of an anti- climax actually; and the concept of the T-800 becoming a married draper after killing the leader of the resistance is more than a little naff.

Mackenzie Davis makes her case as a new generation female action hero, and Natalia Reyes is impressive as the ""new"" Sara, or so we think.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1572,roger-70721,Still Unsure What To Make Of This Movie,6,2 November 2019,I was seriously considering not watching this movie after seeing all of the negative reviews from people who got to preview it before the official release date. I decided what the heck and went and saw the first session when it was released. I didn't find it as bad as people were saying.I do have some gripes though. Why kill John Connor? It meant T1 and T2 were for nothing? If they wanted Dani to be the leader they could have easily made her to be John's daughter. The same actress could have played her. It would make sense that John could end up with a Mexican wife as Sarah and John would have had to flee the USA after blowing up Cyberdine in T2. We could have seen both John and Sarah training Dani to prepare for her upcoming role as leader of the resistance against Legion. Yet this was sadly not to be. There was a lot of hype about Edward Furlong reprising his role but it just seems as if they just used a young actor and CGI-ed John's face from T2 onto him. Maybe Edward did say a few lines which were later pitch altered a couple of semi-tones as he does seem to be mumbling something in Spanish but this is hard to tell.T1 was great. T2 was one of the best movies ever made. T3 was definitely not in the same league as T1 and T2 but still quite enjoyable. T4 I only watched at the theatre and have not bothered to watch it again. T5 I have watched two or three times. Not as good as T3 but still better than T4. T6 could have been so much better. I would watch it again one day hence why I have given it a 6/10.,Terminator - Dark Fate
1573,shell-74334,Sarah Connor is still my hero,8,3 November 2019,"What makes this movie great are the strong, bad ass female leads. There's been too few of them over the years, and we were due for this level of women power in an action movie. They did not disappoint, especially Sarah Connor, who never stops fighting no matter the odds. She's the perfect mentor for the women heroes of the future.I think the weakest part of the movie was the new, but not improved, Terminator. Since T2, the franchise has had a hard time creating the fear and suspense of the first two movies with a genuinely scary killing machine. More advanced does not equal scarier.Still, the action was incredible and there was just the right amount of nostalgia. I'm glad I saw this one in the theater.",Terminator - Dark Fate

No more Skynet, it's Legion now, no more John Connor, it's Daniella Ramos now, no more T-models but Rev-models.This movie reminds me of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The same recipe was used - hire some cast from the first films as a bait for the old fans, let some of their characters die and then create a new storyline so that you can shoot new sequels for the Z-generation.It's an entertaining movie, full of action. But, for me as an old Terminator fan it's not the movie I hoped for. C'mon, does anyone really believe that this 5ft 1 tall girl could actually lead humanity in a war against the machines? And that a terminator robot (T-800) can develop a paternal bond? And that the Rev-9 model can actually be stopped? Plus, the social justice element is so obvious that it's almost annoying (""You're not just a mother of some man who'll save the future, you are the future."").I'll leave out some flaws like the plane scene etc. because nowadays action movies are full of them.All in all, it's a decent movie but if it comes to a sequel I will definitely not go to the cinema to watch it.",Terminator - Dark Fate

In it, the T will be replaced by Justin Bieber and will have mastered the skill of fishing with a line. He'll also help wash dishes and take part in the Presidential elections as a DNC supporter. The attack on the DHS will be in its final stage and the Border Patrol will have been eliminated completely. The President elect will be played by Eva Mendes, the newly introduced ""good"" terminators will be based on Barbara Gittings and Magnus Hirschfeld, solely because they were not available to play the parts themselves. In the final seconds of the movie there will be a sentimental embellishment in the form of a ""thank you note"" dedicated to Ocasio-Cortez who, by this time, have been given the status of the greatest woman ever lived.

1580,almooreuk,This movie is let down within the first 5 minutes,4,2 November 2019,"I have such mixed feelings on this film. On the positive side Terminator Dark Fate is entertaining, fast paced, has great action scenes and features excellent performances from the cast.However, John Connor is murdered (as a young teenager) within the first 5 minutes of the movie. As a result Sarah Connor spends the rest of her life heart broken, alone and getting drunk every night until she passes out. These are much loved characters and I just cannot get past this awful storyline. James Cameron has said that killing John Connor was his idea and I just cannot understand why he thought than fans would like this storyline. More to the point I cannot believe that the movie studio agreed to this and spent 200 million dollars on this movie. They must have known that fans would be very upset by this plot twist. Linda Hamilton has also stated in previous interviews that she turned down Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines because in the original script Sarah Connor dies halfway through and there is no time to morn her. Yet this is exactly what has happened to John Connor in Terminator Dark Fate and she agreed to be in the movie. That has also shocked me.The new villain gets his ass kicked at every opportunity (despite the fact that it can turn into 2 terminators at once) which fails to create much tension at key moments of the film. Dani Ramos was a sweet, likeable character. However, I could not take her seriously at all during the scene when she is revealed to be the future leader of mankind. Sorry but this is girl power gone mad and her character just did not convince me at this point of the story.I think Terminator Dark Fate would have been much better with a few plot changes. First of all John should not have been killed off. Both Sarah and John should have returned to fight the new Terminator. We could have then seen John as the strong here he was always meant to be. Arnie returning was not really needed. Arnie playing the hero has been used already in3 previous sequels and added nothing to the story. I would have preferred a way to bring Robert Patrick back to protect Dani as a plot twist. Also Dani brother was a very likeable character for the short time he was on screen. I personally would have preferred if both Dani and her brother were revealed to be the future leaders and he had survived.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Arnie, with his brilliant acting, again saves the day and almost story of this loving veteran. Ingenious mind of James Cameron was able to recreate brand new x-men-like mash-up of future, that can bring us almost infinity of new films with the same recycled stories and actors, till they wont be able to say that exact three words we heard decades ago....And i am hyped to see where will its potential leads us...In fact, despite all of its flaws this work concluded in decent movie to watch during boring Saturday evenings.

But that the savior of our future should be kill off from very beginning was a surprise. It was bold.
Is just show that nobody is importen, because there will always be a new Savior, so no need to sent people back in time to protect them.
In that matter, Terminater franchise just killed itself.
Rev-9 wasn't scary, T-800 in Terminater 1 and T-1000 in Terminater 2 was much more frightening, cause they didn't talk much.
After 28 years, they can not make better CGI? unbeliable. That really ruin the Robot hype.
And then again we see this modern feminism that have to take over popular franchise, when will they learn that it won't help getting more people into the cinema.
Its not the lady's that take their boyfriend or husband into the the cinema to see action movie, its the men that take their wife or girlfriend to see action movies.
Take for example Ghostbuster and Ocean 8, wonder why they dump the boxoffices? and why did the Starwars Rise of the Skywalker dump 92.6% over 4 weekend on moviegoers?
Because if you Frak with the story context you loss customers.

1605,alfe,"Straight, maybe a little too straight.",7,6 December 2019,"If you expect any plot twists, you'll be disappointed. This whole flic is a close repetition of the second movie: A shape-shifting terminator comes from a gruesome future and tries to kill the former version of the leader of the human resistance in this future right after the humans have won. And a protector for the target is sent back as well by the victorious humans to spoil the terminator's efforts. After a lot of truly marvelous fighting (which isn't always plausible but mostly impressive to watch), the evil terminator is finally destroyed. The going-to-be leader of the resistance will continue to live their life.Differences: In Dark Fate target and protector are women (but that works well and because in previous installments the terminator already was female, this didn't seem to be necessary anymore). The original (T2) added the plot twist of actually changing the future by destroying Skynet's development. There is no such plot twist in Dark Fate. Instead, this incarnation of the resistance leader gets some unexpected help. The first is the Sarah Connor from T2, the second is a T800 Terminator who learned to blend in to the human society after his original mission was accomplished.This gives the movie a different feel than T2 because the target has considerable help and thus doesn't feel so hopelessly overpowered than the targets in T2 and T1. The murderous terminator still is technologically advantageous, so the fight appears to be on a believable level most of the time.The new ideas brought into this film (John Connor actually *was* assassinated after the events of T2, the executing T800 blended in with human society and turned benevolent over the years, and a grievous aged Sarah Connor started a hunt on terminators sent back through time) all fall short in giving the movie a special feel. I think the movie even would have been better without them. It could have been less cluttered. I miss the directness of T1.What made T1 so strong as a film was the in-your-face machine-like brutality which went constantly forwards, against all efforts until the machine was finally worn out. Straight to the core.What made T2 so strong was the idea of T800's role-swap from aggressor to protector, the inherent humor in T800's peaceful interaction with humans (and all the hilariousness this brought along), the novelty of the visual effects of the T1000, and the philosophically loaded plot-twist of obviously changing the future (new in this universe at the point). (It's a pity that Dark Fate now seems to ignore this changing of the future completely.)Dark Fate lacks strengths like these, but it is still a very straight action movie with decent acting, superb visual effects and a mostly plausible story.",Terminator - Dark Fate

It's an entertaining, Terminator-themed, but generic action movie. Action scenes are very well done, but there is no meaning behind them. I myself also liked the acting, but again, there was no thoughtful suspense to support it.I have to highlight the absolutely terrible choice and design for the main antagonist. A ninja-moving Mexican dude full of flashy tricks just doesn't do it as a Terminator. A Mexican Terminator is something you would expect as a low-budget fan-made parody, like that African Terminator video on YouTube.

First of all, this movie is a soft reboot disguised as sequel to T2, NOT an actual sequel.
The Good: The opening flashback w/ Linda Hamilton from the mental hospital in T2 (Chills!!); Arnold is clearly having a blast (once he arrives, halfway thru the movie); Gabriel Luna (Rev 9) was good as the antagonist.
The BAD: CGI!!!!! (I honestly don't remember a scene where the CGI wasn't clearly in your face); Writing/Script was NOWHERE near T1/T2! Cheesy lines (""Future sh**"") and the swearing seemed way too forced, like Tim Miller was just standing there adding more ""f-bombs""; Linda Hamilton...ugh, really disappointing. I don't even think she had faith in this. Her dialogue, again, seemed forced and repetitive. She had the look down, but w/ good writing and story, her character fell flat; CGI...again...it's that bad!; Tim Miller...not a good choice for a project of this magnitude. This felt like a comic book version of Terminator, with added ""f-bombs""; Plot...I knew this was in trouble after the opening scene where a T-800 was apparently also sent back in time (assuming along w/ T-1000 during T2??) to kill John Connor...and succeeds, basically rendering T1/T2 useless.

It makes me think of Star Wars VII where they call the 60+ years old characters back and use them to introduce new heroes, with the exact same recipe than the first movies. In that regard, killing John is just an excuse to tell the same story all over again, and makes the movie pointless.On the plus side, Mackenzie Davis really does a great job and I really liked the enhanced human concept. The direction is ok and Arnold is also doing the job. Hamilton is trying a little too hard but was ok too.It's a decent movie but it definitely doesn't live to the expectations I had when I read James Cameron was involved.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Arnold and Linda's love/hate relationship gets a new twist in an alternate timeline woven around time travel tinkering. Nice tag ups to previous Terminator movies without overkill. Looking forward to watching it again.",Terminator - Dark Fate

People complain about the first 5 minutes, blah blah blah....Well what happens in the beginning needed time happen for this to even take place. Looking forward to the next one, as it most certainly will continue this storyline. (I hope) See it with an open mind....I was hopeful, but was reasonable with my expectations.

1626,bosullivan2-719-143250,Good but not the Cameron sequel we hoped for,7,28 October 2019,"When Cameron announced he was taking back over, there was hope that the fate of the franchise would be saved by what he would make.Unfortunately the movie doesn't really break any new grounds that the first 2 movies were famous for: practical effects and cgi. And only the latter is used in T:DF. A real shame.Positives: The characters are all strong. Performances solid. And exposition dealt with naturally. What T1 & T2 did so famously.The action on the other hand is a mixed bag. Too manic and over the top. Poorly lit. And hard to see sometimes what's happening. Surprising, when T1 & T2 handled night time scenes so well.So by the end you realise it doesn't come close to T1 & T2, and you end up comparing it to Genysis. And you realise what Genysis got terribly wrong (exposition), DF gets right, but what Genysis got right (action - small set pieces done well), DF fails miserably. I understand the pressures studios must be under to compete with Marvel, but DF's action is just so insane, especially the main action set piece, you find yourself imaging what the storyboard session must have been like - not a good sign.Having said that the end set piece is satisfying, lit and choreographed well, so you can see what's going on, and because your invested in the characters, you care and want them to succeed.Oh I didn't even notice there was 3 female leads: assuming that's a good sign.",Terminator - Dark Fate

1645,Neardark1969,Fake,1,2 November 2019,"Look there's a case to be made if you are a casual fan of T1 and T2 and not bothered much about continuity.
Let me say that there is no way this film is anyone's 10 especially the fanboys and I count myself among those.For a start (Spoilers Ahead) John Conner Edward Furlong returns only to be killed 3 minutes in, so the first two movies are literally pointless. No a ""Rogue Ai"" has sent back a terminator to kill a girl who would lead the fight back in that reality.
This all felt to me like let's get rid of any white males and replace them with females or minorities as is the way nowadays.
Enter a super enhanced soldier from the future, who is devoid of seemingly anything standout in terms of acting ability and line delivery, she is both wooden and cold and androgynous a person as you have ever seen, but she ticks a box right.
Arnies back!!!
But wait, didn't he melt himself in T2 so humanity wouldn't be able to recreate his processor, we'll forget any explanation he is just alive ok, and has a family now, yep you read that right!
Sarah Conner tries, but her character seems more like a testosterone fueled male part rather than the strategic badass we know from 2
The plot itself and script is below par and I found myself checking my watch about 40 minutes In.
The effects and fights do have their moments but don't have the same menace as the T2000 from T2
Overall it's probably a 3 or 4 if you don't know the franchise, if you do avoid at all costs, it's a politically correct garbled pièce of crap that should never have been made
My score is to try and combat thé shills",Terminator - Dark Fate

I cannot believe how much hate this movie got from people with obvious political views that can't just relax and enjoy a movie. I'm sure it's the same people that hated Marvel's Black Panther. I have no problem with a ""SJW"" taking the lead role, they just need a good story to carry the movie. In my opinion, this movie had a better story then Terminator 3, 4, and 5.

1651,Bluevettes,"Good action movie, but not a good Terminator one.",8,10 November 2019,"The action was actually pretty amazing and the Terminator that they chose to use was pretty cool, but... Skynet apparently sent multiple terminators back to kill John Connor and he dies in the first two Goddamn minutes of the movie in the most pathetic way possible and he's still a kid when it happens. Not only does this not make sense as this Terminator was from the future where he grew up to be the hero, it makes everything that happened in the first two movies pointless. On top of this, Skynet is no more and the Terminator from this movie is from a different future. So no John Connor or Skynet... the two most fundamental parts of the entire series.Also, all of the characters (including Sarah and Arnold's Character) felt completely empty and forgettable. Due to this, I did not care about them and when they tried to do an emotional moment at the end like they did in Terminator 2, it completely missed the mark.Tl;dr: This is nothing more than a mindless and forgettable action flick that does not respect originals (in fact its a middle finger to them at points), but it is still good for what it is.",Terminator - Dark Fate

James Cameron needs to be retired permanently & banned from touching anything movie related...or simply have him TERMINATED.Movies that cater to women in the lead roles when the franchise has always been male based is beyond stupid. STOP IT!They kept Arnold in here for what reason? He & other men should have been the lead roles. This would have been a far better movie had they used a MUCH better director/producer. There is nothing in this movie worth watching. Total junk garbage.I am not saying women don't have a place in movies, there are millions of top notch powerful women that make movies with awesome scripts/plots.etc. that deserve 10 & higher scores. This one is not one of them.I am not alone in this thinking, as discussed on the various movie forums I frequent that has over 12 million members world-wide. They all agree that this sucking up to the LGBT community & women directed/produced movies needs to cease permanently & go back to normal movie making when we had REAL directors/producers & proper scripts.

I do commend them for taking the risk of going down a dark path and realizing an idea that fans have always wondered about.Linda Hamilton is back as Sarah Connor and although she looks a bit weathered to be playing the hard up badass she is portraying in the movie, she does act her part very well and it does work. The characters of Grace and Dani work well together and with the contrast of Sarah, the focus on this female cast puts in a solid effort. Arnold puts in a decent performance.The story doesn't feel like anything new even though they take some big liberties with the lore. Rev-9 is a great concept and does feel like a very credible threat. His abilities don't feel gimmicky, he has the right mix something new with the relentless stalking we want from a badass Terminator.Its worth a watch and a solid entry into the very messy world of Terminator that's been seemingly haphazardly built over the last few movies. Terminator 2 is never going to happen again and thats a good thing, it did its job. People asked for a direct sequel to that story and now they have it.

To say things like this is a ""Mexican Terminator"" as if that'd be a ""bad"" thing and whine and moan because there are ""Mexican"" characters in this thing is just beyond foolish and troubling and disturbing and shows a need for help. Same about trashing on the GLBTQ+ characters.I wish so bad we were able to send a Terminator back in time to 1992 to completely erase the memory and mind of James Cameron and all Hollywood executives involved in *all* ""terminator films"" after 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' and *Especially* those involved in this vile pseudo-film; so that 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' would forever remain the Last Ever Terminator Film.John Connor -Yes, you read that right; John F****** Connor Himself!- gets murdered at the age of *10* in the first 5 minutes of the film by ""another terminator"" immediately following the events of 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day'. Now, thats some F****** *Epic* way to give both middle fingers to *All* fans of the original Terminator Duology.Of course, how can in 2019 the savior/only hope of *All* Humankind be a male???!!! Gross!!! Sexist!!! Toxic!!! Old Fashioned!!! Oppressive!!! Offensive!!! Misogynistic!!!

This is just a cash grab where of course *All* males are either completely and utterly useless or dispensable or evil or all of the above; so obviously the saviors/last hopes of all humankind are two empowered women (apparently the director and writers -whatever their names might be- didn't get the memo that said what a Great and Unique and Strong, Brave, Tough, Independent, Relentless, Resilient, Hardcore, Impressive, Charismatic, Determinate, Complex, Layered, Intelligent, Smart, Resourceful, Iconoclastic, Powerful, No-Nonsense, Kick-A** female character Sarah Connor was in 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day', but, whatever...).All I can say is, if you are a fan of or just like at all 'The Terminator' and especially 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' you'll be truly much, much better off staying away from this execrable garbage.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Surely skynet/legion should just send one back to tudor times where tech and weapons were non existent to kill the connor/ramos timeline(maybe thats the next film with a cameo from will shakespeare or francis drake! So after putting that 3 minutes to 1 side and seeing where the film went it just turned into a copy and paste of the previous films(at least salvation TRIED something different) the dani ramos character was poor, because she gave a motivational speech all of a sudden shes a leader all the other thickos just followed her! Lame writing there. They have just change the lead character to a female but re hashed the same story badly. Its not the lead character that needed changing, more the story direction or just not bother. The action scenes were uninspiring and have been either seen or done better before, tim millers direction just felt like a marvel inspired film, too much poor cgi, junkie xls score was very underwhelming with no tension to it at all. The arnold character kills john then has no purpose so develops human emotions (no real explanation how(t2 sarah and john removed his chip) so now he has a drapery business and is in a relationship with a son, REALLY!! Thats the best james cameron could do?! The rev 9 has no menace to him whatsoever and became quite tedious being honest. Bad miscasting there! Linda was good as the broken drunk woman still recovering from her sons death whilst as good as grace was, she a rehash of marcus wright! Overall very very disappointed and didnt think it could get worse than rise of the machines but they managed it. Save your time and money, if you like it then fair play but as i say i wanted to enjoy it but fought it poorly scripted and rather boring.

Tim Miller did it, he made Terminator 3 a great if not superb movie. Just leave it alone and let it die",Terminator - Dark Fate

1676,duracell777,Terminator - Politically Correct Fate,6,23 January 2020,"As many other movies these days, Terminator did not escape this. This is just an observation.
I have nothing against female lead roles, genders or ethnicity or whatever is called but every movie is starting to adopt it. Specially if is a sequel, prequel....or any other ""quels"".Now, back to the movie. I am a fan of action movies and robots. Specially robots but this one is a one time movie. I will not watch it again, ever.
Previous Terminator movies I've watched them several times simply because they are more entertaining. More...""lore"" to the robot uprising.I was happy to see Sarah Connor in this one. Seeing her after she survived T1 and T2. She is pretty badass but I was expecting more.Legion name, seems that is thrown in there just to sound....dangerous.
There is no real story in this one. New terminators, death everywhere, human creation as in all movies but with no real story to it.If you pay close attention to details, not to mention you could see them miles away, there are some scenes where they simply....""borrowed"" from other Terminator movies. How Grace found clothes, How Rev-9 gets immobilized for a brief moment at the end and also the ending. Reminds me a little of Terminator 2 ending.
I was happy to se Daniel Ortiz ( the pharmacist ) from Vis a Vis in this one.Long story short, If you are a fan o Terminator franchise, see it. If you are a fan of robots, see it. You will not get bored as it has enough action.P.S. Seems that Judgement Day is inevitable. Wonder what will be the next name for the AI uprising.",Terminator - Dark Fate

This is not modern, poor cgi, you can tell when the machine change face, it is so fake. Story is the worst. Repeating the old story modify a bit. Nothing new. Sarah Connor still look cool at her damn age.What is the purpose for saving John? Went through all the sacrifices to save John at the end kill him after saved him?

1679,hejhurmadu,Terminator Genisys was a much better movie.,3,24 October 2019,"Saw this last night and the only redeeming factor of the evening was my overly expensive popcorn and my lovely wife beside me.
The second I saw the high frame rate on the first scenes I realised that this was not a movie I was going to like. It reminds me too much of 1980s American soap operas.
If you can't shoot a movie in 24fps then do not bother.
The only reason that High Frame rates are in movies to blend in 3d and digital effects. Sadly this movie had a lot of that and were not well executed, jarring to say the least, especially when physics and certainly gravity seems to not be a factor the Producer James Cameron or the director Tim (one hit wonder) Miller?? cared much about.
Maybe they were saving money for the scene Linda Hamilton was in early on?Basically everything looked plastic and unrealistic.The dialog and story was vague and seemingly overly empathetic and ridiculous.
To give it a modicum of credit (I mean minute) there is one line in movie which made me laugh.It just looked and felt and sounded like a 1980s tv show which had been extended for the movie theatre just because they can and not because they should.I love the Terminator franchise but this was a pile of dogs poo and not worthy of the producers name. If anything I feel like I was conned into it has they kept promoting the movie with JC's name. Maybe this was a bit of extra cash for him to go diving for more Titanic artefacts?My wife on the other hand seemed to enjoy it and did not notice the high frame rate.
Her comment was,"" it was OK but I will not be going to see it again anytime soon. The others were much better.""",Terminator - Dark Fate

1681,rj456,Hard to believe this movie has positive reviews,1,19 January 2020,"It's really hard for me to believe that this movie has positive reviews, for those of y'all that are gonna depend on these positive reviews i would suggest to be aware! It's well known that nowadays many of the film studios pay and use companies that specialize in writing and rating movies positively.
Beyond that i presume that there are folks that maybe haven't watched any of the previous four films? Cause it's hard for me to understand how come a movie that makes you feel you are experiencing an ongoing ""deja vu"" for almost two hours receive high scores from various reviewers.
Throughout the entire movie i felt like, ""haven't we seen this scene in one of the previous movies?"" Same old chases, same cliches sentences, same theme of the previous movie of how a certain person is going to be the leader in the future and therefore needs to be protected, and mostly similar methods throughout the entire movie of trying to terminate the terminator.
Well this movie isn't a complete flop, Schwarzenegger had a top notch performance as a supporting actor, and Hamilton and Davis also gave solid performances.
The folks that need to be blamed the most for this debacle are the folks that wrote the script and whomever approved this fiasco, beyond the stuff i wrote above, i really cannot figure out which crack head said that it's necessary to kill ""John Connor"" as a kid at the first scene of the movie, when we've already seen him as an older teenager and as an adult in the previous movies!! (they could have just said he's living underground or something of that sort now that the future has changed), well It's one of those blunders that could have easily been avoided.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Later, we're told that more than one of the original Terminators was sent back to do the job, and eventually one succeeded.Doesn't that mean that the first movie, as cannon, has just been undone? We were told that, yes, John Connor DOES live on, trained to fight by his mother, and will eventually form the resistance. But no. Basically Skynet succeeded in the first Terminator story, just after the credits rolled.I kinda enjoyed this movie when taken as a stanadalone, but only 6/10. I actually really liked Arnold's role, and the way his robot had learned humanity, although couldn't quite be human.But Linda Hamilton's acting was a shock to me. Was she always this bad? It was jarring. Everyone else acted their roles well, but when I heard her, it seemed to me I was seeing an actor try hard, but not seeing the character.I took a point off the movie for that alone.

I'm also looking at your Force Awakens. Do they really think people want to pay money see this trash? I have no idea how James Cameron thought this movie is a good idea, but then again he seems to be obsessed with CGI in all his latest projects, so I'm not that surprised.

The second is that a major character for this story line dies. Who wants to see that? And maybe there is a third reason for not liking this movie so much in who kills him.

1700,theodoredeschris,"Original Terminator Trilogy is completed with the best possible way ever, And it was quite unexpected.",8,20 January 2020,"Hello there ...My Score per Category from 1 ( not good at all ) to 5 ( Masterpiece)(Story = 2), (Scenario = 4), (Characters = 4), (Directing- Editing = 4), (Acting = 5) (Production Design = 5), (Soundtrack = 2),Every time I saw a new Terminator installment that had to do with bringing back the old cast (except the awesome Terminator Salvation with Christian Bale and Sam Worthington), and in an attempt to complete the original storyline of the first 2 movies surrounding the Connor family and their legacy I was disappointed and furious because not only they have failed to deliver, but the movies were awful and deleted from my mind the moment I stepped off the theater,But not this time ...For me movies above all are about storytelling, and they made it, I was thrilled, full of suspense, curious, surprised and enthusiastic throughout the film.They thrived in 3 Factors that every other great franchise (e.g. Star Wars) tried to do and failed,1st Factor, giving the audience the original storyline with a makeover for new generation of fans, personally I disagree with this logic that runs in an emphatic way the last decades in Hollywood, I'm also against remakes, there are a few exceptions of course like Scarface and Cape Fear, but it's quite different bringing back to life a masterpiece of the past that lost its touch, than messing with one that everybody loves in order to sell it again ... if you must do it, then you must do it perfect, there is no space for errors, every detail matters.The ""Terminator Dark Fate"" storyline is the same with the first 2 movies we all loved, there is a villain terminator and a protector and both are coming from the future to face off each other for the salvation or termination of mankind's future leader, the terminator looks unstoppable and frightening, there is no place you can hide, there is no place you can run, it will find you, and it can't be stopped unless there is a great sacrifice, David S. Goyer, Justin Rhodes and Billy Ray respected the legacy of the first 2 movies and added many twists in the plot, gave depth to the characters, they managed to combine everything without leaving plot holes of any significance at least, the flashback sequences served the storytelling and they weren't there just to fill time gap in the movie, and they also leave us with a beautiful message.The new villain terminator REV 9 is absolutely great, menacing, it's evolved beyond any other we've seen in the past, besides the high-end technology that it brings from the future it can replicate feelings, and that is the most frightening thing about it, it's portrayed brilliant by Gabriel Luna, giving us the best villain since Robert Patrick's T-1000,2nd Factor, the Nostalgia card, the Terminator Franchise has tried many times in the past to sell us a movie by playing this card especially with Arnold's T-800, finally they did it right, they wrote a great storyline for Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton, they gave them depth and purpose in the movie and not just a cameo appearance, as a result we've enjoyed brilliant acting by both actors reprising their iconic roles,3rd Factor , Political Correctness, in recent years studios try to make movies that apply in every race, gender, class etc, most of them achieve to disappoint fans and viewers, especially when they revisit classic films that the majority loves, take the Ghostbusters reboot for example with female main characters unlike the original movie, This is also something the Terminator franchise tried to do in the past with 2003 ""Rise of the Machines"" , having Kristanna Loken in the role of Arnold's antagonist, she gave her best, she was ok, but I didn't enjoyed it , it felt wrong,in ""Dark Fate"" Mackenzie Davis is an apocalypse, she gave us a sentimental, tough, ingenuitive, focused, determined and loyal character, she is beautiful, she is charismatic and she is perfect for the role, her character ""Grace"" convinced me that she was the best one for the job, Same thing goes for Natalia Reyes, her character ""Dani"" has to walk on a different path, slowly she manages to overcome her fear and surprise of what is going on around her and rise to the challenge she must face , her dark fate, both women are great and worthy successors of Linda Hamilton's legacy in the franchise.Special praise must go to Tim Miller and his team, his direction is on the spot, he tells a great story and gives us the conclusion to the original movies we've been waiting for since 1991 ""Judgment Day"", He kept me on edge throughout the film wondering what comes next, perfect editing by Julian Clarke, Ken Seng's cinematography is dark and majestic, the score of the film is a bit indifferent, music works as carpet for the action but in no way it reminds me the magic of the original one, last but not least the Visual effects team should go for the Oscar especially for the brilliant CGI sequence (definitely the best one we have seen until now) of younger versions of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton and Edward Furlong.Finally the original Terminator story is completed erasing the mistakes of the past, the Fate of the Franchise is saved leaving us a never-ending universe of many possibilities to explore in the future.Thank you,With Respect,

1703,The_Crow18,How to ruin a franchise in 2 minutes.,1,28 August 2021,"Terminator - ""Dark Fate"" - Truly lives up to its name.It is a film that represents everything that is wrong with Hollywood these days, to a point that makes you wanna walk away from the cinema experience altogether. Ever again.A miserable, lazy, woke attempt, that classifieds itself be the ""true"" sequel to the timeless classics that were the first two, that doesn't only ruin their legacy, but lowering the bar to a new low by being (by faaaaar) the worst Terminator film.The film is so lazy in trying to push the feminist message so bad, that it makes little sense to why it do what it does, and gives no explanation about it whatsoever other than promoting its woke message and casting. Either of its lazy women empowerment, (Sarah Connor was already one of the badass female characters in history and this film does not do her any good), to the illegal boarding immigration crisis, gender identities and pro life-choice, while trying to focus on promoting the minorities message. I kid you not!To call the movie ""bad"", is understatement, that takes away from the definition of the word.With all its impressive budget, the film feels cheap, poorly shot, boring, badly edited, with bleak dark atmosphere, to a point it's hard to see what's going on that doesn't do the movie any favors.The film betrays everything that makes the original films great, and destroys them by the very opening scene. Which was both the best within this film (solely based by its beautiful visuals), but worst in terms of the outcome, that makes you think they were drunk while writing, and shooting this film.It copies every one of the elements, and subplots of the sequels its trying to ""erase"", and brings nothing new other than the constant loop formula this series has been using from the very first film.Arnold, which is the face of this franchise, is just shoved in to a performance that feels more like a comical cameo, than an actual role.Avoid at all costs, to a point of erasing this film from your memory's existence. It is ignorantly woke that cares to promote the message criteria than be an actual good film and worthy sequel to the franchise. Yes. Even the other sequels are far more entertaining and true to the source material, unlike this travesty.",Terminator - Dark Fate

""You are not the mother of some man who saves the future, you are the future.""Oh this was so bad. Really. So... I don't know, forced? It felt like giving an otherwise tough girl a boyish harcut and making her an augmented cyberpunk protector is supposed to change our perspective of women. Proving that they are strong.
It was absolutely pointless. You already got Linda Hamilton, the toughest sob, apologies daughter of b. of the past thirty years in the movie. No matter how hard the ladies tried, they can never be as tough as she is. I felt like the movie wasted a lot of effort and screentime on proving a point that has already been proven in T2, thirty years ago. And that left a sour taste in my mouth.Other than that, Arnie was brilliant, the story was logical, I really liked the story arc that - and I know a lot of people had problems with this aspect - no matter what, humanity is destined to fail due to our own hubris; and the action scenes were quite good on the small ('54) screen. with the digital release.
Sarah Connor was effing fantastic, Linda Hamilton is our new Carrie Fisher, she is brilliant in all aspects, Arnie was great and grim and funny, loved to see him again, oh god, twice my age and still, twice my masculinity, but somehow the new characters were just... not interesting enough.Would have been a much better movie if it focused on Arnie and Linda, there was tension, drama and feelings there, feels like a missed opportunity. Would definitely watch a Netflix series featuring them.Lots of explosions. A real eye-candy with the airplane, I was hoping/begging for something like this.
As some of those kind reviewer folks mentioned, not realistic at all.

Two T-Zero-Brains are sent back to 2019, where they kill and take the place of producer/director/writer James Cameron and director Tim Miller.The T-Zero-Brains produce a movie postulating that Skynet has been removed from the fluctuating future timelines, and that the future of mankind no longer depends upon the life of John Connor.In order to further weaken mankind mentally and bring about a timeline where Skynet may come into existence and take over sooner, the movie heavily supports globalist and woke ideas where independent and critical thought is banned, and also postulates that Terminators without a specific mission are not programmed to kill any humans in sight.Since the T-Zero-Brains are machines without creative or independent thought, their movie ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" is a pure repetition of the original Terminator, and even uses obvious Skynet designs and even designations to postulate an entirely new enemy.Despite these obvious errors, their mission is largely successful. A large number of people are fooled, and the less gullible mostly turn away from the entire franchise in disgust.Aware of Skynet's scheme, the human resistance sends back a number of programmers to 2019. Their mission is to create a computer game warning people that the real threat is still Skynet, that Terminators aren't actually good guys, and that John Connor is still crucial to the survival of the human species.The computer game must be good enough to gather a following, but despite this being an huge challenge for movie-based games, the programmers from the resistance are successful: They manage to create ""Terminator: Resistance"" which becomes widely praised as the best and possibly only good Terminator computer game. This game strongly emphasizes that the original Terminator universe is still in effect.The future of mankind now depends on enough people playing the ""Resistance"" game, enough people rejecting the false ""Dark Fate"" movie, and enough people avoiding further propaganda from the hostile T-Zero-Brains posing as James Cameron and Tim Miller.",Terminator - Dark Fate

This definitely is not the standard in the movie world as we all now. Earned 7 / 10 from me.

1725,philipp-620-836082,from the past,3,23 June 2020,"There is nothing much creative about the story. They missed the chance to give the saga a new turn. Instead, the script is a boring copy-paste from past glory with lots of senseless one-liners. Instead of telling the story when they have the chance to, for example, by explaining the future and the past of the characters you'll find them swearing and just piece by piece the story gets slowly told. Why this stalling for sensation? What a pity. This movie would deserve a 1. I'm rating it a 3 because there are solid moments. There are some quite good action sequences and some funny one-liners.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1726,kdstemmer,Just another Terminator,7,26 January 2021,"The fact is that there should never have been any sequels. T1 & T2 are a closed loop story. It is impossible to create a satisfying continuation of that story. So as a continuation of the story, Dark Fate fails abysmally, just like the others. However, if you ignore that T1 & T2 exist, it is actually quite an entertaining movie with good action, hence my rating of 7.I think the only possible story that could be told in a movie that doesn't violate the brilliance of T1 & T2, would be the backstory of the resistance in the future to the point where the two Terminators in T2 are sent back. But I guess too much damage has been done to ever see that one....",Terminator - Dark Fate

1728,TheRothOfKhan,"Powerful, Visually Impressive and a Worthy Successor to T2",9,29 October 2019,"Terminator: Dark Fate is a worthy and exciting sequel to Terminator 2. Linda Hamilton is the star and takes Sarah Connor to new heights with the same ferocity and energy as she did in the first two films.The new characters, Grace and Dani, are excellent and you really care for them. The new adversary, the Rev-9, harks back to the T-1000 and feels just as dangerous, if not more. You really do not want the Rev-9 to get close to the human characters and the threat he poses is very believable. You just know that if you came face to face with him, you are dead.There are moments in the film when the main characters stop and find time to reflect and get to know and trust each other, something the previous three films seemed to overlook in favour of action sequences. This is where the film excels itself. Linda Hamilton is fascinating to watch and steals every scene, even when Arnold Schwarzenegger makes his entry. Arnold's character is taken in a new direction, something which I felt uneasy with when reading the early spoilers, but on film it is both plausible and touching. What we have here is a conflicted warrior, very much like Sarah, who wants to have a purpose.If this is to be the last Terminator film, then Tim Miller and the storywriters have done a fine job.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I expected MUCH better from James Cameron.,Terminator - Dark Fate
1730,rpcarnell,It Terminated the franchise,4,27 October 2019,"Hello,First of all, be aware of the spoilers. That being said, here we go:The new Terminator is great. It can turn into two Terminators, which is a good thing, and also a very bad thing, since any of the two Terminators could've terminated Dani, but chose not to because just like the Terminator in Salvation facing John Connor, his job was not to terminate, but to push and throw the opponent around just for kicks. Two Terminator, one Terminator, but he was not doing his job properly.The action is great at times, specially the sequence where the Terminator crashes a plane against another plane in mid-air, and also the numerous fight sequences between Grace and the Terminator. But sometimes they moved way too fast. It kind of makes sense because Grace was a cyborg, enhanced to defend Dani.Everything else in this movie stinks. Dark Fate makes you think that no matter what happens, AIs which turn against humanity. It is no longer Skynet. Now it is Legion. And just like Skynet, it has killer robots, killer androids, time-machines, and the desire to wipe out humanity. Grace knows nothing about Skynet or Sarah Connor, but Legion seems to behave exactly like its predecessor, Skynet. The movie sends a simple message: artificial intelligence is doomed to turn against humanity.Spoilers! John Connor dies in the beginning. He gets killed by a Terminator that popped out of nowhere. How stupid is this? Remember how the little girl from Aliens died in Aliens 3? It is that bad. That alone marks the end of the franchise. That alone makes it obvious that the other Terminator movies never happened. In Genisys, John Connors turned into Genisys/Skynet ally. Obviously they were trying to reboot the franchise with an alternate timeline. Obviously they failed Now, by killing John Connor in a very stupid, cynical way, they simply got rid of all the other Terminator movies, after T2, and they are, once again, attempting another reboot. This time, the reboot is horrible because it makes Sarah Connor's struggles to save her son meaningless.At this point, the people behind this franchise are insulting the intelligence of people who pay to see Terminator movies. For example, why is Legion interested in killing Dani? They got rid of John Connor, and Dani became the new savior of mankind. If the Terminator succeeds, another savior will show up. John Connor was American. Dani is Mexican. Perhaps they should reboot the franchise again by killing Dani while she is honeymooning with her husband or something, and the next savior of mankind will be from Haiti.It is supposedly a reboot, just like Genisys. But we get a lot of the same. Spoilers! The Terminator is killed by an exploding battery taken from Grace's enhanced human body? Sounds familiar? They took the idea from Terminator 3. After killing John Connor, the Terminator wonders around and settles down, enjoys a quiet life in Texas, with a woman and her child. Rings a bell? The Terminator in Genisys raised Sarah Connor and even loved her. It seems to me that these machines so determined to destroy mankind should stop making T-800 models, since they are destined to become tender human fathers.Not a reboot. Just recycled ideas.At the end of the day, this is a waste of money. The nail in the franchise's coffin.",Terminator - Dark Fate

McKenzie is excellent as is Hamilton. Arnie felt like he was there to sell the movie hes basically a 3rd supporting character just in the background end becomes an after thought.Some of the action was very good, the plot similar to the first 2.

1737,sam-183-288322,A true successor to Terminator 2,8,6 February 2020,"Mild spoiler below
---This film pleasantly surprised me. I was not planning on seeing it after the mediocre reviews.First off, the action scenes are good, diverse and inventive. They fight on the freeway, on a plane and I liked the end fight as well. The film does its job in this respect. The new model Terminator is pretty cool. Someone remarked that Terminators these days have become pretty bad at killing (at least the intended target, 'cause this one's pretty darn lethal), but then that's what ""The Terminator"" is all about; the suspense of an unstoppable killing machine that's after you, as you try to get away. And it will not stop.As you may have guessed, Sarah Conner's son, John, gets killed at the beginning of the film. Someone critiqued that this makes the previous two films pointless (Terminator 1 & 2, not the stuff in between), as the whole mission there was to keep him, the leader of the future resistance, alive. But actually this opens up the whole new story development of both the old Terminato (Schwarzenegger) and Sarah Conner, John's mother, finding new purpose in life. It was nice to see both actors reappear, as they carry old age, weight and wisdom into this film. Meanwile a new, similar branch of the future opens up, suggesting no matter what, the threat (or inherent danger) of AI is something humanity will have to deal with. Makes sense.The new actors do a good job too, though nothing overly memorable. I did like the Mackenzie Davis's performance who defends the protaganist against the terminator. The new terminator guy does a decent job as well. And as for the protaganist, there's a nice emancipatory message there; her role turns out to be not quite the same as Sarah Connor's.Lastly, I liked how contemporary societal developments are included in the film, namely the refugee crisis and ever pervasive big data tracking our every move. The sci-fi genre after all originated in the industrial revolution in Britain in the 1800's (the first ever film dubbed science fiction being 'Frankenstein' *). Critiqueing society and progress, and envisioning future scenarios based on societal trends, have been at the genre's core since its inception.I do think the 'refugee part' (crossing the border) is a bit short and perhaps does not sufficiently convey the very real dangers and the desperation involved in such an endeavour, but at least it gives a general sense of the peril and precariousness of the many people finding themselves in this situation. This is important in an age where the 'West', the first world nations of this world, dehumanize the other and treat them as a threat, a plague, and in the process, lose their own humanity. We have to acknowledge our common humanity for the sake of life, compassion, the many lives at stake, and the survival of our planet. Only together will we be able to overcome the massive challenges lying ahead.Terminator Dark Fate may not be a cinematic masterpiece, but I'm certainly glad I watched it, and maybe you will be too. Come for the action, stay for the deeply human themes woven within.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1738,Expresso_Mick,Why so many repeat negative reviews?,10,22 September 2021,Not just with this film. Do people dislike movies so much they need to review them several times? The same headline. The same wording. Are these people real or roBOTS? Soon this place will be like Rotten Tomatoes if it's not careful!This is a solid film. Great action. The return of Linda Hamilton. Mackenzie Davis is great. I love it.,Terminator - Dark Fate
1739,rossmccarthy1990,The best since T2? That's not saying much.,4,23 October 2019,"It's not good. It's a complete rethread of previous films, and not only T1 and T2. It also rethreads the other dibacles, like Salvation.It's almost like they worked off a check list.
*Chase scene with a truck...check
*Self sacrificing hero...check
*Completely ignores the awesome future war scenes frim T1 and T2...check
*Jobs out John Connor...checkIt's not a terrible film, it's a regular old mainstream action flick with more cgi than a Pixar movie. It's takes a remarkable person to make practical effects look good. An absolute genious to make CGI look good. But it takes an astonishingly unbelievable person to make supposedly real stunts look like cgi. Either that or they used cgi in some completely pointless places.It's amazing how this film managed to be too much and too little at the same time. The actions scenes were so convoluted, I legitametly got bored. The non action scenes were better, but not much really came of them.Also, this is the only Terminator film to date where the odds are stacked AGAINST the bad guy. He barely had a chance. I found myself routing for bad guy.And of course we have Dani, one more in the long line of heroines written into films who cannot for the life of them even begin to duplicate the success of previous great characters such as Sarah Connor or Ellen Ripley from the Alien franchise.Anyways, once again the cannon of a beloved film franchise has been reworked, and important points altered, just to fit in nostalgia pleasing older actors, and of course bland new characters to issue in a brand new trilogy, which will never happen.It didn't work for Salvation, it didn't work Genesys, it doesnt work here.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1740,silverstormtrix-1,Could have been better,6,25 October 2019,"For me, a Terminator movie should always be the awesome and stylish Terminator T800 like in T1-T3 as protector with Sunglasses. They should de aged Arnold for this.
The plot would be more watchable if:-
1. Sarah have stop the other T800 from killing his son on 1998 and somehow plug off the T800 CPU chip. They keep T800 body in a secret place, hope to reprogram him as protector if some unknown force come from future to kill them again.
2. In future, Skynet is eventually stop but somehow change to other artificial general intelligence system, this I'm quite agree..Sarah Conner and his son help Grace to stop Rev-9 from killing Daniinthe beginning chasing scene. After figure out the story from Grace, they decided to insert the chip and reprogram T800 to protect them. We can once again have our true swesome muscular T800 with Sunglasess to have great fight v Rev 9 alongside Grace..T800 and John Conner sacrifice themselves to protect Dani at the end.. Grace and Sarah will survive and set up the sequels.
I'll be pleased if the story can go this way.. Anyway this just what I think, what I'm hope for...",Terminator - Dark Fate

But I took a shot.This is a pathetic attempt to rehash the original Terminator and make it a feminist movie. Without any idea of the plot, I knew Dani was ""the future leader"". In a feminist hero plot, it's only obvious. And Grace as a savior was really bad, especially when she had to be medicated after every encounter.They should have called this Terminator: Geriatrics with Arnie and Linda Hamilton. The whole ""For John"" was ridiculous. The only thing in the movie worth seeing was a computer generated Edward Furlong getting blasted.

1747,maiderekk,Misogyny is alive and well,7,13 November 2019,"I cannot believe the amount of chauvinist, misogynistic, reviews in this thread. The fact that dozens of reviewers are completely dismissing this movie just because it has 3 female protagonists is nothing short of sexist. No I am not a woman. Just another loyal Terminator fan. I'm not here to glorify this film either since it is far from perfect and the reason I gave it a 7 out of 10. But at what point did we have to stop enjoying movies for what they are and start politicizing everything?Bottom line, if a film containing a strong female cast gets you in a twist because your an insecure little manchild who never gets laid, then don't watch the movie. People are literally calling this movie a feminist film and say its all about girl power. These chauvinistic keyboard Warriors seriously need to get a life. It's like none of them are satisfied unless the cast consists of shirtless, buff, sweaty, dudes running around blowing crap up.As for the movie itself I was pleasantly surprised and had gone in with very low expectations. I could see how some people might not like the direction of the story or the fact that they killed John Connor within the first 5 minutes. But all things considered it is a solid sequel to Terminator 2: Judgement day and a good redeeming film after Genisys, which, by the way, was garbage. I loved the new Rev-9 Terminator! He was like a mutant offspring of a T-1000 and a T-800. The overall pacing and action is good and there's hardly a dull moment. It was great to see Linda Hamilton back in the role of Sarah Connor and Arnold Schwarzenegger is always a treat to watch. They left it open for a sequel but honestly I think they just need to end on a good note and stop there. But more than likely we'll probably see another sequel in the near future. Even though I think a sequel is unnecessary I'm actually excited to see what's in store for the future of the Terminator series and its all thanks to this movie. If only we had got this instead of Terminator 3 and all the crap that came after it.I understand everyone is entitled to their own opinion but all I ask as a reviewer is for you to enjoy the movie for what it is and please don't jump on the right-wing, feminist bandwagon. Again, if you're going to hate on a movie just because it has a predominant female cast then I suggest you seek professional help and figure out why you despise women so much. Or go out and get yourself laid. One or the other.",Terminator - Dark Fate

From the first scene this movie grabs you and doesn't let go.
It could've worked as a stand alone in many respects, but it uses the mythology of the first two movies (and a few ideas from the others) to create a thoroughly entertaining movie.
There are a few things that make you go 'why did she not say anything?' but this happens in many movies to build tension.

It's all about the women now, you can't have a man as the leader of the resistance, so he's shot and killed off at the start, which in the time frame appears to be just when T2 finished.
This film is so woke, for example it uses terms like humankind which never would be used in the first 2 films, but that's just the tip of the iceberg! It constantly man bashes, with every male character either irrelevant or an imbecile. It also uses the ""you're so white"" reference to try and tick the PC agenda, a Latino female (tick) has now taken Johns place in the series and this pint sized fragile damsel suddenly becomes one hell of a badass overnight, much better than John could ever have been! I could go on. I wish they'd stop making these woke films which cater for about 1% of the population.

After watching dark fate I can't understand the negativity.
Killing John Connor in the first couple of minutes did multiple things. Firstly it wiped all the rubbish terminator movies made, from Rise of the machines to Genysis. Secondly it got rid of that whiny little connor and thirdly it set up a new saviour and enemy.
The story was believable, the action was intense and the homage made to the original 2 movies was needed, to keep fans happy.
It started with a bang and just kept going with an intense climax at the end. I believe that this has set itself up for a sequel Hopefully with Dani and Sarah taking on the new sky net, Legion",Terminator - Dark Fate

You are suppose to forget T3, Salvation and Genysis ever occurred and then watch this movie as the follow up to T2 (which can never be topped a la Star Wars episode V) The third in a trilogy is never as good as the 2nd nor original in most cases (LoR, Matrix, Robocop, Ninja Turtles, Terminator). It's a good movie with a lots of shout outs to ""Mexico"" it takes place in Mexico, the Bad guy is Mexican and the Hero is Mexican and there is more Spanish being spoken than myself and perhaps the audience thought there would be (hope that is not a spoiler). But the action scenes where nice, but nothing unexpected because the Trailers did spoil most of them, but not all. There's fan service and all, but I wanted more Arnold. The story wasn't the greatest, but sufficient for B- movie. Sadly, this Terminator movie needed more action and on a grander scale. Too much unnecessary talking and not enough Terminator vs Terminator action. That's probably it. It's not bad, just leaves you wanting more and that's just my opinion. B- is fair.

He said that he really liked it too , so i assumed he had good taste. But then he recommended me a movie that was supossed to be even better, a movie starring steven seagal in which he beats the s__t out of everyone. I'm pretty sure that guy made this movie. I mean, if Terminator 1&2 were good, this one is even better cause it has more explosions and shootings and fights.

1769,stalingradsniperz,It´s truly the T2 sequel that fans were waiting for. Jhon Connor explained SPOILERS,5,31 October 2019,"Why 5 stars?
The 5 star rating stands just for the action & SFX and some nostalgic humor for avid fans.The movie?:
Terrible story
Terrible script
Terrible acting
Great action
Great SFX
Nice humorSadly the movie is a mix of Star Wars Force Awakens, Logan, The last Rambo movie/The Book of Eli and Captain Marvel.I went to the movies to see this only because the name of James Cameron was attached to it.Warning Warning SPOILERS ahead Jhon Connor explained in detail:
After so many debate about the time travel controversy and how it applies to The TERMINATOR and TERMINATOR series, including TV shows, comics and video games in this movie the writers and producers made a remarkable effort to explain to their fan base and franchise newcomers the question about John Connor, Skynet, Cyberdine, Judgment Day, Kyle Reese vs. the objective to make us understand why T3, Salvation (my favorite next to T1) and Genysis were just like a bad dream it never happened, but be warned, try to be early on the movies and get your PopCorn ASAP, because, he´s death in the first 3 minutes of the movie and that is just all; then is not Skynet anymore, now is Legion (is not the Empire is The First Order) and Logan´s daughter will walk the earth like the stunt of Mila Kunis in The Book of Eli with Captain Marvel from the future to save the day with Arnold doing the same of T2 at the end.Let´s not waste time talking about why every 2 years a new TERMINATOR travels to the past.Cheers.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1770,colo118,"What couldve been a competent action movie is dragged down by horrendous writing ,political agenda.and too much cgi.",5,6 November 2019,"Let start with the goods,Grace is a good character that is bit underdeveloped, some facts about her are not explained.Dani has an interesting arc that isn't fleshed out. It a mix of Sarah and John Connor but more rushed and soulless.The first couple of action scenes are actually decent with a nice mix of practical and CGI effects.Always nice to see Arnold in his iconic role even if it doesn't make sense at all.Tim Miller direction is good. Despite the overuse of CGI, some of the action set pieces were well thought. The future war scenes are great while short and some emotional scenes are well done.A solid soundtrack from Junkie XL.Mixed feeling,Rev 9 is actually what the T-X that should've been in T3. The idea of mixing liquid and solid skeleton is neat but underexploited. While the actor did what he could he is nowhere near as menacing and cold as Robert Patrick T-1000.And now the bad,The inclusion of Sarah Connor and Arnold T-800 doesn't make sense at all and are only present the give fan service and force a questionable narrative. Sarah Connor arc was completed in T2 and even Linda admitted at some point that she didn't reprise her role earlier for such reason.The opening was written for many wrong reasons. John Connor is Dead, Sarah Connor is now driven by vengeance and the T-800 will suddenly gain a conscience to have a purpose. John is soon replaced by a new savior which is Dani and a new future is happening with a new AI just out the blue.So in others words they just created a new universe so they can push more political agenda and use fan service in hope to sell more tickets to create a new trilogy that totally disregard and disrespect the legacy of Terminator. That sounds quite familiar.They make no good use of Sarah Connor. She has one badass moment and then she suddenly take a step back to become some kind of comic relief and she occasionally bring drama. She doesn't contribute much to the plot. There's no growth or character development.All that screen time could've used to develop the new characters but it reduced to a minimum. It a shame because Linda Hamilton still give a good performance.The last couple of action scenes are boring. They're too ridiculous and overly use CGI when things get chaotic. And were not talking about good looking crispy CGI but the blurry undercook ones that seems to have been made in a week in Blender.What the hell happened to simple stories about relationships and values between interesting characters while having great thrilling action scenes with great attention to details using a good mix CGI and practical effects to make a great rollercoaster of emotion and entertainment ?",Terminator - Dark Fate

(tht we liked) This portrayal and demise of our beloved hero gunned down just like that, is not art, is not a filler, is not a foundation for a new franchise..

As the story goes, you managed somehow to F up everything we loved, and just to be on the understanding level I like Grace character, but you somehow manage to make me bitter n force me to hate her, which I won't stoop to, She was Grace You are Disgrace. Don't get me started on CGI, Jim Cameron in my opinion should remove/erase himself from this atrocity..

1779,pxchange,Dark Fate indeed... for the whole franchise,4,14 January 2020,"Saw Terminator 1 when I was about 12yo and now I'm seeing Terminator: Dark Fate being 39 yo. Saw every Terminator movie in between and let me tell you something: this food is way overcooked.Sci-Fi's got always a grasp of some reality, somehow or another. Science fiction's concept aims into the realms of the *possible*, not matter how unlikely it could be from today's tech standards. Otherwise it's a fantasy film. Well, this is NOT a sci-fi movie, this is a fantasy/comic-sort film, much like Avengers and all the movies you see today who are shot in a room with a green wall. T:DF wasn't shot in a room with a green wall, but hey, they should've done it that way.The public this movie is aimed to wouldn't have noticed or cared. Story line is not aimed at people with an enthusiastic and critic approach, there are no subjects that could be discussed with fellow sci-fi movie goers, least to say, a true Terminator fan. This movie was made for the opportunistic and casual viewer, for the ""dumb masses"".The technology subject in the film goes beyond the limtis of physics and anything and everything that's possible to believe. There are things that happen that just couldn't, not now, not in a 100 years, least to say in about 22 into the future (SPOILER ALERT: this movie's Terminator comes from the year 2042).I'm not a purist expecting to see a movie as good as T1 or T2, I do understand director's and time's change, but this movie explains why Netflix beat Hollywood: the movie is simply boring. Full -and I mean FULL- of cliches, racists remarks, bad acting in general (Linda and Arnold were absolutely TERRIBLE). You just don't buy it. Visual effects are good, but that's something we've seen before too many times already.I don't want to get into the story not to ruin your experience as a viewer so you can judge yourself; just expect several minutes of anything but a Terminator or even a sci-fi movie.In my own case, I couldn't finish watching the movie. I push STOP right about the middle and came here to write this down. That's the bottom line of my review.",Terminator - Dark Fate

The first 15 minutes looked promising but the rest was a never-ending torture. A movie should have a story, right? Well, this one doesn't have any. It doesn't deserve a score over 4/10.

I went into the theatre knowing it could go wrong but then again it was James, Arnold and Linda. Thank you Jesus because I was blown away. There were a few minutes where I looked at my son and said breathe ha because we were both on edge. Thank you Arnold, Linda and James for giving me chills and taking game back to 1991 when the only gift I asked for Christmas was a T2 VHS.

1789,michael-48656,"Heartless CGI Spectacle Not ""Made in China,"" but ""Made for China""",1,29 October 2019,"There have been a lot of reviews pointing out the over abundance of cartoonish CGI effects, the ""girl power"" theme so common nowadays in superhero action films, the utter betrayal of the first two Terminator films, etc. All of this is true and sadly predictable. American viewers need to remember that this film, like so many other action packed, CGI monstrosities, is not really made for them. Domestic box office is not entirely irrelevant, but it is less important considerably than revenue from the overseas market. The box office return in China is most especially important given the huge fan base there for American entertainment. So long as the characters and the storyline do not inflame the Chinese censors, mediocre movies here can be blockbusters over there. Most overseas fans have never seen the first two Terminator films. Therefore, they have no particular fidelity to the canon storyline, the original character arcs, etc. Hollywood producers are very aware of this overseas cultural detachment from the earlier films. There is little profit motive then for them to remain faithful to the canon. Now that may explain their willingness to jettison the first two Terminator films, but why all the ""girl power"" and the political correctness? In part, we can attribute this to the ideological bias of most Hollywood writers and producers. More so, the powers that be in Hollywood believe that the ""girl power"" and the SJW themes will appeal to the Millennials and, therefore, keep the film in their good graces over the long term. Over the long term the domestic revenue stream comes increasingly from monetizing the film's social media impact. As Millennials are much more a factor in social media than the middle aged types like myself who loved the first two films way back in the day, the studio is much more focused on placating them than on appealing to the older hardcore fans. It all comes down to dollars and cents, and the result is yet another franchise film that pays lip service to its own legacy while provide a generic action packed spectacle to overseas and younger viewers who frankly do not care about what has been lost.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1790,tariqonweb,we don't want it... back.,5,3 November 2019,"Enough of Terminators, if these people don't know how to take story forward.

1791,liajames,One of perhaps five film I have walked out on before the end.,1,30 October 2019,"What happened? That's the first thing that comes to mind.I'm not bothering with spoiler tags. I don't care. You have been warned, though spoilers will be minimal.John Connor is killed within the first five minutes, apparently just a couple of years after Sarah and Co. stopped judgement day. Sorry, but to put a mother through all of that and then to have to watch her only child gunned down right in front of her is so excessive and vicious as to be sadistic.From that point on, this film is basically the exact same plot of Terminator 2. Nothing lands. The set pieces are complex, but completely uninteresting. The characters are uninteresting. It's just chase, followed by a highly choreographed CGI battle, followed by chase, followed by battle etc., and then, well, I just left. Nothing to see.Oh yeah, and James... Terminator 2 is emblazoned in the mind's of pretty much every single Millennial (yes, I hate that term too, it's stupid to put such a massively diverse group of people under a single generational banner). But we remember the lore of T2. In that film, a key inflection point of the plot was that Sarah and John decided to switch the Terminator's CPU to a different mode, so that he could learn and become something more than Skynet intended. If they hadn't done that, they would have lost the war.That key point is never mentioned in this film. The T-800 (or whatever, who's counting at this point?) in this film relays his history and never says anything about it, yet somehow acquires something akin to a 'conscience'. How is that possible if there was nobody there to switch the CPU?Linda Hamilton is the only reason worth watching; she turns in a fantastic, sardonic performance, but watching her as a grieving mother and seeing the story turn in that direction was quite possibly the worst thing this franchise has ever done.I'm usually reticent to leave negative reviews because I know the enormity of the work that goes into making these expensive projects. But I just cannot hold my tongue on this one.I say we take off and nuke the franchise from orbit. It's the only way to be sure.",Terminator - Dark Fate

OK, it has flaws: it is predictable, and mirrors T2 in a lot of places, but I think that it is the best Terminator film since T2. Just like T2, it keeps you guessing about who the baddie is for quite a while. The action was dialled-up a lot more than T2.

Watched it just now and the movie does not even come close to being comparable to the first two. Grandpa Schwarzenegger and Grandma Hamilton are there as glorified cameos to up the ratings. They could easily have been written out of the script otherwise.I gave the movie a 1star. That is for effort. Effort to rehash the memories of diehard fans like me and get them to the theatre. Effort to be politically correct. Effort to enhance the wow factor of the new Terminator.....and the list goes on. Sadly all efforts were in vain.

They were absolute state of the art. Cameron said he ll create a continue to T2, thats what it was in my opinion.When the movie stats I was not that sure about the actors. They took a while to evolve themself. The propotion of Mackenzie Davis to Natalia Reyes looks weird in some scenes, because of her tall body. In the end even that fits into the rolls.In the first half I had some deja vous to T2. It felt like the new Terminator has to remember how the old one felt - until it gets on his own feet.
I dont want to spoil anything, so I do not explain this further. For me, this movie grow up until the end.I hope for a continue, but I think thats uncertain.

So don't expect too much",Terminator - Dark Fate
1809,chpribb,Repetitive plot that falls short,6,8 November 2019,"Just saw Dark Fate immediately after watching the first two earlier today. I certainly don't like how abruptly they kill off John Conner. Too easy and sudden for such a key figure! I am also disappointed that the movie is pretty much repeating the plot of the first two movies with some random woman (Dani) being hunted by a Terminator from the future while protected by someone else sent back to protect her. I mean, really? They couldn't think of a more creative and more complex plot? The plot of this movie really fell short of expectations and I like the storyline of Terminator 3 much, much better as a sequel of the first two movies. T3 did better of showing Skynet's development and setting the tone for the next movies to follow, no matter how bad Salvation was.However, the antagonist Terminator and Sarah Conner were both pretty badass in this movie and the special effects action scenes were fun. They have come a long way since 1984!",Terminator - Dark Fate
1810,spidermonkeynr,We know the story but its still amazing,9,27 January 2020,First of all yes we know its almost the same story from part 1 and 2 but its done very very good.The actors do a greatjob. The special effects are great. The story well you kniw how it goes no suprise there well maybe some here and there.It feels like a rwboot for new generations but also as a part 3 after the first 2 for the older generations. I see it as a win win.To bad there so many haters because its just a great film to watch. So go and see it and enjoy the movie. I know i did. Im 42 and i loved the first 2 alot and i got the same vibe from this movie aswell,Terminator - Dark Fate
1811,davidaffleck-35343,I actually enjoyed this.,7,27 October 2019,"I am a big terminator 1 and 2 fan, and whilst I do get some of the critics blasting this movie, I also really enjoyed some aspects of it. Sure it is not T1 or T2, and nothing will ever come close to recreating the horror, suspense and entertainment of those 2 movies. But having low expectations because of the low reviews on here, I went into this movie thinking it would be terrible. And it wasn't. Maybe some of the action scenes are too cgi and forced, but other than that there was never really a dull moment. I'd give this a solid 7 out of 10. A huge improvement on the other movies that followed T2.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1812,mrjeffreygoymer,Excellent edition to the franchise,10,24 October 2019,This is a great edition to the franchise and probably best that the other movies after 2 are disregarded and replaced with this one. The story is what you'd expect from a Terminator movie and is well executed. The action sequences are amazing with brilliant acting. I recommend you do to watch this movie. I went to see it at a 4DX cinema which I'd recommend if you can.,Terminator - Dark Fate
1813,radelitegaming,Worth watching but worth criticism,7,20 January 2020,Not the best terminator but its overall a solid film. Not a complete train wreck like rise of skywalker was to star wars. Watch it with a grain of salt but don't avoid it because of reviews that trash it.,Terminator - Dark Fate
1814,robertrichmondwatts,It just isn't very enjoyable.,2,26 October 2019,"Just another generic modern Hollywood blockbuster, and it ticks all the generic modern Hollywood blockbuster boxes.Not a shred of originality: Tick
You've seen it all done better before: Tick
Predictable action completely devoid of suspense: Tick
Charisma free new cast : Tick
Underwritten characters: Tick
Insertion of contemporary politics: TickI could go on, we all know the drill by now.
The most annoying thing about this is the filmmakers complete and utter lack of understanding of not only what the appeal of the franchise is, but a basic failure in how storytelling works;
Rule 1: You have to care about the characters, it's that simple.
If you feel nothing for the people you're supposed to be rooting for then you may as well be watching Ikea wardrobes being randomly pushed into a chipper.The plucky tough girl who randomly murders scores of innocent people without a second thought. I couldn't care less
The plucky young innocent girl who's as relatable to as a hemorrhoid and twice as irritating.
The plucky returning older lady who's sleepwalking her paycheck to the bank.
The plucky old Terminator dude who after killing a child embarks on a redemption arc that sees him adopt a kid??? wtf? they could of at least made him a kindergarten teacher or something.
The plucky new and improved bad guy terminator who can do literally anything except when he can't.If you think you might want to go see this, trust me you don't.
My advice, find an alternative means of entertainment, some of the things I've found more enjoyable than watching this film.
Super-gluing myself to things.
Poking things with a stick.
Trying to make things move with my mind
Seeing how long I can go without having a poo.
And many more.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1815,law-93354,Wow a great terminator film,9,23 October 2019,"At last a great terminator movie, t2 is one of my favourite film and after the last few terminators film I was hugely disappointed. Great to see linda Hamilton back . Worth a watch",Terminator - Dark Fate
1816,andybarber-78794,As I feared,2,3 November 2019,"Ok I kinda guessed from the trailer that this was going to pander to the current political stance that is leading all new movies.
And my fears were met and some, it already had a strong female lead in Sarah but that was not enough they had to kill John and have the future leader and protector be new shoe horned female characters.
I want to make something clear I have no problem with females in movies what I am getting really annoyed with is the current trend of endless re makes or sequels of well established franchises being used to promote strong women. These franchises have a big fan base Male and female the reason people love them is because of the characters and stories . If you want strong female characters then give them their own movies and characters instead of hijacking long established movies.
When these movies flop it is never reported that it is because of bad plot and bad characters no it's always because of we wont accept women in strong leads. I'm getting tired of the endless movies that have been ruined by scoring points on correctness rather than quality I fear this is the end of any hope of a real terminator movie in the future and the end of many great franchises that will fall the same way.",Terminator - Dark Fate

1818,baratamatheus,Are you kidding me?,10,17 April 2020,"A lot of people are saying this is the worst film in the franchise. Guys, please, you need to understand, it's not perfect, but it's not the worst thing you are watching. If you like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton, you're going to love this film, but if you prefer the third, fourth and fifth film, you're going to hate this. In my opinion, Terminator: Dark Fate (2019) is the best installment in the franchise. I loved the performances, Miller's direction, musical score, action sequences and more. For me, it is the real sequel to The Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)...",Terminator - Dark Fate

1822,ny-99056,"Not a bad film, but lacked in its delivery.",7,15 November 2019,"I would recommend seeing it as a fan or a new comer. Arnold looked great, did his thing. Linda Hamilton was marginalized, sadly....the trailers made her bigger. The flashback (at the begining) was awesome, but took it in the wrong direction in my opinion due to a bad script, which should have given us fans what we have all wanted...a sequel to T2. The new terminator carries this film or the rest of it would have fallen apart. I won't be back either",Terminator - Dark Fate
1823,sarahpalmer-26759,"A solid six out of ten, doesn't deserve all the hate.",6,31 October 2019,"I was reluctant to pay to see this movie in the cinema, but after my partner insisted I went along. I re-watched Terminator 2 before doing so, and knew that it would be a shadow of the ultimate super film T2.But I was entertained throughout, it had enough AI, and dark future components to it to give it some sort of depth. The CGI was fine. and yes it isn't the best movie, with some poor dialogue and multiple small mistakes, and a lot of ""why would you do that!"", however I was satisfied, and I am glad they made it.T2 is dated, and could do with a remake, and Dark Fate does just that. If T2 had never been made, this movie would have groundbreaking reviews and would be hailed as the best Terminator.Worth a watch, but don't expect miracles, and don't attach it too strongly to the previous movies....",Terminator - Dark Fate
1824,cainysunuke,More leftard garbage,1,21 November 2019,I didnt even bother with this one because I knew it was going to suck just by watching the trailer. Then I read the reviews here and I confirmed it. So unless you are a leftard avoid this garbage at any cost.,Terminator - Dark Fate
1825,roywang-26869,The first terminator movie made for women,5,26 October 2019,If you looking for different feel of terminator you watch Terminator Dark Fate where women heroes are so dominant throughout the movie....and I still dont understand the inclusion for Arnold role in this movie....I think John Connor should be the major character in the movie but I was wrong.... They need to make a fresh start terminator movie.,Terminator - Dark Fate
1826,djurivoje,Not convinced,6,30 October 2019,"Solid action, average movie and below average terminator sequel. The best part about Dark Fate is that I watched T2 once more. I had way more drama whatching almost 30 years old movie again, than this one for the first time. Is this really everything you can do? Cameron said once he did not want to participate in T2 sequel, because the story is over and there is nothing more to be said. So far he is right. However, there is one thing that I like. Grace is amazing, both character and cast.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1827,jeffthebarbarian,Boring rehash that only takes away from the original two films.,1,5 November 2019,"My biggest complaint for the movie is not the opening scene, but how it's action sequences never truly riveting.
The action went too fast, and the shots were too close up to really give the film an epic feel. The characters never felt like they were really in any danger.
There was no build up of any emotion for any of the characters. Honestly, the T800 showed more humanity than I feel like any of the main characters.
I didn't care about any of the characters. Didn't care for the movie.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1828,NCC1705,Magnificent,10,5 November 2019,"A worthy successor of the Terminator series - and a glimpse into how amazing the old series would look updated to the current technology. The first scenes were breathtaking. Also, not one of those movies where 20% is worth watching, and the rest is flashback from kindergarten filmed in a fast food parking lot - something to fill the rest of the time. Action packed, perfect, gives you the sensation that not 1$ from the budget went to waste. Such a pity how things went. So many brilliant movies flopped lately, that it's not even an indication of anything. Ignore what you heard and go see it, you will not be disappointed for 1 second.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1829,callmelum,There's a reason why Jim Cameron endorsed this one,9,2 November 2019,"I was very underwhelmed by the trailers. I will admit I also got swept up by this new PC culture Hollywood has with feminising everything but boy was I wrong?I get very nervous when 80% of the cast is so called 'good looking' but this works. The new future soldier's gender takes nothing away from the story. The new villain does a good understated job. Arnie is funny and Sarah Connor is BACK!!!!The action is edge of your seat stuff, the fight scenes are spectacular and the vfx are really breath taking. Oh and remember that ominous sound they played whenever the T1000 appeared? Well they've updated it with horns and a really grand epic score. Even with your eyes closed, you could tell he's probably on screen, just like in T2. A nice homage.The only thing I didn't really care for was how adorable and hopeful the Dani character was especially in one future scene but that's Hollywood forcing their happy go narrative.Don't listen to the reviews. Same people who didn't like this are the same ones who keep giving those awful Fast Furious movies 9/10.Watch this movie. You're going to be blown away!",Terminator - Dark Fate
1830,BigFancher,"FAR Better Than Expected: Hokey, Explosive, and Fun.",7,1 November 2019,"I went into this action flick with unbearably low expectations but was overwhelmed by the epic action, surprising humor, and total badassery of it all. With tented aviators and gun in-hand, Hamilton returns with a vengeance as Sarah Connor. Meanwhile, Schwarzenegger plays an old robot living a sedentary life. The cult-favorites are back, delivering pure nostalgia through familiar verbiage and apparel.

1833,eonian-85028,Way better than expected.,8,1 November 2019,"Solid story , a few funny reminders to the original one, action pack with barely no moment to catch your breath.
I was expected a copy cat from terminator 1 or 2 after watching the trailer but I was nicely surprised by an original story surfing on the previous one but creating its own story at the same time.
All the characters are interesting and complement each other as a team.
Arnold and Lindsay performance are great and not caricatural. They both provide a nice bridge between the original characters and the new one.
On top of that the FX really support the movie instead of being the movie.
Very entertaining, Great job!",Terminator - Dark Fate

I saw it and I found it quite entertaining and not boring! Ok people it is what it is! It's not suppose to be Citizen Kane! Lots of great action and decent CGI!

1836,blakeboege-09558,Hot Trash!,1,4 November 2019,I want my money back!!! I had high expectations for this movie since it had Tim Miller directing it and Jim Cameron producing but no it was terrible. The story was completely in realistic and the acting was so bad! The movie sucked hard!,Terminator - Dark Fate
1837,Skippy rocks,So close...,4,18 October 2020,"To get started, I loved the action. I loved the way they incorporated new ideas like Carl (T-800) and his backstory. I loved how terrifying the new terminator was and how there were a few new ideas thrown into the mix. All in all, I'm not really sure what people were hoping for when they say it didn't tread any new ground...
That said, I absolutely hated the politicising of the film. I mean to throw in a whole stack of man-hating comments, having several women taking on serious hero roles at the expense of any main male characters. Having a woman (of colour) who had to cross the US border (illegally) basically become the saviour of the human race was a little too much given the current social/ political landscape. I am so frustrated by Hollywood's current obsession with political correctness and man-hating that I'm considering avoiding most films for the next few years. I have lost count of the films I've seen recently that had the male heroes shrink into supporting roles (even when their names are in the film title) and a whole lot of man-hating/ mocking follows!
If this is what gender equality is all about, I'm out. So disappointed. It could have been so good.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I was aware of the previous terminator movie but do not follow the series enough to remember where one left off and where the other begins. The movie stood on its own merit; whether you follow or remember the previous one. This movie was sheer good, heart-pumping excitement!Linda was the type of badass veteran fighter you hope to know if ever fighting a tenacious killing machine! Arnold came in at just the right time with a lot to lose and an appreciation for life-which was easy to believe. I see no reason for Arnold to be ashamed or Linda to have no value simply because she is older- as some have suggested. Badass, is still Badass if that is what you got. This movie has it, so butter up the popcorn and let the excitement begin!!",Terminator - Dark Fate
1845,woofinstien-43254,Good movie or bad movie?,6,3 November 2019,"This movie is getting a loooot of mixed reviews. First I'll say that it's not a bad movie but it's not a really good movie either. The action in this movie is some of the best action I've seen in a while, Gabriel Luna as the Rev 9 is terrifying and badass. I thought that with the R rating and how the trailers were it will show the Rev 9 be really brutal to humans and soldiers but it wasn't that brutal to be honest. Like him fighting the others was really sick but otherwise when he's fighting the soldiers at the border patrol its not that brutal, but still sick and I was expecting lots of brutality as it was Tim Miller who had done Deadpool. The plot is decent, not going to lie I thought it was kinda dumb. It's kinda stupid to know that it was James Cameron's idea to kill off John Connor from the story. It's like killing Batman in the first 5 minutes of his own movie like what the heck. Then I didn't think it was necessary to rename skynet to legion and the actress who portrayed Dani wasn't even that good. The rest of the cast was great in the movie, Arnold, Linda, Gabriel and Mackenzie Davis. I thought maybe they could have done something else with Dani, like maybe she was going to be another major part of leading the resistance to demolishing skynet and skynet released a brand new terminator to terminate her. And John is living in hiding, his whereabouts unknown or something. Killing him was a bad move, and if you were going to kill him off, maybe kill the hero of a 5 movie franchise in a better and memorable way.
I would watch this movie again for Arnold and Linda and Gabriel and the intense action, otherwise the story is meh, it's decent and but a bit dumb.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I am not the biggest fan of the new age of blockbuster movies because of the lack of creativity but I felt the story of this movie was not that bad. It wasn't anything to blow you away, they didn't really humanize the people in the movie, you did not really feel for them. But there was constant action and I enjoyed myself.

It had action, cool set pieces and very menacing Terminator. Add in to the mix the way the handle Arnies T-101 and you have the best film in the franchise since T2.It's not fair to hate a movie just because they put strong female characters in it. Yes the Ghostbusters reboot sucked and the world would be a better place if it had never existed - but now every movie that has a female lead seems to be getting bad reviews.Do you think the Mexico element was political? Or do you think maybe it's because we all watched Sicario and thought it was cool? I'm going for the later.Sarah Connor was a badass in T2 and we all thought that was ok 28 years ago so why not now? Because there isn't a male lead? Get over it - Graces character made sense.And as for John Connor....Edward Furlong sucked in T2 so I don't know why we all suddenly think this movie is bad because he's not in it. They handled the fate of his character really well.If you like action movies this is a good one to watch.Turn of your brain off for 2 hours and enjoy it.

1850,s-81911,Worst James Cameron Film Ever,5,1 November 2019,I was excited after they announced that james Cameron will be back but no this is literally the worst james Cameron movie. This movie is bad not because of weak story or bad acting but because it just makes the first two movie pointless and the storyline is pretty much same. So my suggestion is if you haven't watch the first two movies go watch it but if you have then don't waste your time.,Terminator - Dark Fate
1851,usedcarcowboy,Huge disappointment.,1,5 November 2019,"Im a big T1/T2 fan and was excited to see this since James Cameron endorsed it and claimed to be involved with the story. What a disappointment! Lazy/poorly thought out writing, riddled with plot holes and characters not really having realistic consequences for their actions.Killing off John Connor 5 minutes in with the ridiculous idea that Skynet simply sent back multiple Terminators at different points in time completely undermines the whole concept of rooting for anyone fighting a terminator. Its a no-win situation. Having another random person with no computer or military background inexplicably lead an army to victory over a far superior AI is beyond stupid. How could you become invested in a story like that? There are no real stakes. Another terminator will just come back. If they kill their target, another leader will rise up for no believable reason. Another terminator will target them and so on and so on...The way they brought Schwarzenegger back was so contrived and silly. A TERMINATOR felt guilty about killing John Connor?! Started a family?! Opened his own small business?! WOW!!! ""Carl"" would be the subject of the biggest manhunt in history. His face would be all over the news. Identical terminators wouldve been witnessed murdering 30 cops in 1984, blowing up Cyberdyne and injuring dozens of cops in 1991, and murdering John Connor in 1998 while disappearing without a trace in between. Like I said, no consequences.Sarah Connor and Dani are directly involved in: 1. destroying a border facility 2. Murdering dozens of border guards 3. Trespassing on a military base then stealing/crashing several military aircraft 4. Destroying the Hoover Dam. HOWEVER, no authorities show up at the Hoover Dam during the climax and the two of them are freely roaming around in public afterwards, like nothing happened. Theyd be in huge trouble and unable to prove anything. Sarah said she was already wanted in all 50 states! No consequences=terrible/lazy writing.The action is too frequent. Too over the top. Too CGI.Mackenzie Davis is an excellent actress, but is slumming in this dumb action schlock. Natalia Reyes is serviceable, but forgettable/bland/un-compelling.Save your money and only watch at home if you're an absolute diehard fan.

(Or was it Demi Moore's G.I. Jane?)
Some literally took it seriously and movies like Dark Fate are the end result. (Cue the ovation.)
Terminator's dark fate, I mean, Terminator: Dark Fate has fallen victim to the modern day wave of equality where women can be projected as Commando or He-Man all guilt free. (Try picturing Minnie Mouse as a UFC fighter in your mind.)
Long gone are the days of Calamity Jane when a lady was referred to as ma'am and who also had to be assisted from a horse-drawn carriage by gentleman such as The Duke or Jesse Lee.
Think about it - the man who shot Liberty Valance went on to marry the prom queen because she was all feminine like, you know? Unlike Sharon Stone who dueled men with six-shooters in The Quick and the Dead. (How's that feminine?)
Now jump forward - look what we've got today in the modern era!
Herminators!
Powerpuff Girls!
LGBT-1000's and a liquid gender fluid Revlon-9 baddie who likes to negotiate in verbal exchanges as an option.
That's my interpretation of it from a P.O.V.
This agenda-driven hooey is being force-fed down our throats that it's so transparent they're not even trying to hide it anymore.
The public's not buying it now either.
To digress for a second if I may - a fair few conservative countries voted in favor of this gay marriage & whatnot only recently.
Was this also a green light to approve every other Left-Wing intention in the package to foist down our throats? (What did we actually sign up to here?)
We're not all hippies; tree huggers or free spirits, you know?
I'm sorry Hollywood but you're sacrificing the majority at the expense of a minority with this today as usual.

Grace was a legit bada**, and the actress that played her part absolutely nailed it. The writing, directing, acting were all on-point. The Terminator that was hunting them did talk more than previous Terminators, but there was always a feeling of anxiety when he was present (which is the point) and he even had a funny line.

1858,joesmarch-40368,I tried to like the film,2,5 February 2020,"I love the franchise. However they screwed this film up. If you market the film as a direct sequel, and know that's your key to success i.e. promoting Linda Hamilton.... then why would you not continue the story with John Connor? Yes you kill the character in the first 10 minutes which is a slap in the face to all the fans. You create a mythology and then throw it down the toilet and expect the fans to just accept your rewriting everything they love. They can't even keep Skynet in the mythology and change that ! You'd think they'd learn their lesson after the last fiasco, and they screw this film up too.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1859,nshelu,"Forgettable, lazy, uninspired",2,1 April 2020,"James Cameron, the man who's directed some of the most well known sifi movies in history is responsible for this.He movies have never really told the most dynamic and thought provoking stories, but they've almost always been done so well it's absolutely lovable. He's shown he can direct amazing works. And yet, there's this.Dark Fate takes any semblance of respectable and lovable characters and turns them into generic ""shoot first, talk later"" action nobodies we've seen thousands of times before.Sarah Conner is a travesty, I'm not sure it's her or Cameron who managed to screw this role so hard, but Sarah is annoyingly crude. Her personality consists of being a bad*** and knowing what to do. She even downs on the woman she's supposed to be protecting, occasionally. It's jarring how apathetic she is. Sarah had emotions, come on, she had emotions guys.The main character (I can't remember her name) is just a ""nobody"" who happens to be special, and that's it. Her whole ark is she's special and she's the key character to make it all right, because she's special. Remember that, she's special and that's why she makes it all right.Arnold's character is just... ugh. He's there because he has to be, not because he has any valid reason to progress the story, They just had to find a reason to stick this absolutely absurd character in just because ""haha dats Arnold Schwarzenegger"", I mean seriously, it's laughable how downright backwards his character is. I'd explain why, but that's spoilers, if you watch it you'll see what I mean.There's the android that Sarah companions with, he's just more of the same action hero schlock that's supposed to be inspiring and interesting, but really portrays no genuinely interesting traits.I don't remember much beyond how goofy these characters are, and how cliche the story is. There's no suspense, it's just action hero mumbo jumbo until the day is saved. I mean if you like explosions and shooting, you might get a kick out of it, but if that's really what you want I'd recommend Mad Max. At least that movie doesn't try to pretend it's some intense and deep story. Also, it does manage to tell a decent and mostly satisfying plot anyway.",Terminator - Dark Fate

If the filmmakers are about to create a new part in the saga (Terminator: Damnation?), they should refresh the plot, adding something new. Maybe even distancing away from ""the chase plot"".

I was very happy that Linda is back. But unfortunately the characters are all very superficial. Sarah Connor's ""coolness"" looks very set. The development of the Dani goes way too fast from ""shy girl"" to badass leader girl.
Arni is too ""human"". - Dogs are Terminator detectors, but his dog is not?The scene on the plane is far too exaggerated and unrealisticThe scene with the Humvee and the dam is far too exaggerated and unrealisticWhere did the Terminators that Sarah Connor kill regularly when there is no Skynet come from? It kills all terminators in a regular way, without anyone noticing?Why did the evil Terminator suddenly become good?Where does the new AI come from?etc.This movie had a lot of potential, but was messed up by exaggerated and flat dialogues.

1888,dr-hronis,Don't be sheep!,8,2 November 2019,"Don't let the cinema critics and corporate interests decide for you, think for yourself!!
What's the purpose of any movie? To have fun, get excited and enjoy the ride.
What's the purpose of any rebooted series, to pay tribute to its origins, emulate the past feelings in modern day time-frame, advance the story and as being the first forge new characters and bring closure to others.
Yes its political correct but these are our times. You may hate it, but this is how it is, feel free to change it and the next movie may reflect upon that. It's stupid to be angry at a movie for following times.
The 80's + 90s are over, there is a new generation out there who can't understand it, they need a modern approach. Don't be selfish, think about them too.
John was the hero till the very beginning, but he always was a symbol, more than a messiah. It was a man the led, the one that happened to be at the right place. At there time. The assumption that without him there wouldn't be any resistance was flawed. Someone else would step up, because because ultimately it's humanity that strikes back and not a chosen one. Even a random Mexican girl could be that savior. It's adorable that that the series made you love Connor so much, that you can't get over his death. But they needed to surprise us.maybe even shock us. We would all know how everything will end up if it was again all about John vs Skynet.
They had to move on, to bring closure to Carl. We loved T2 because of the road chases, the unstoppable hunt+kill machine, because the stakes were high.
The stakes are higher than ever, it's humanity VS its dark fate. Remember what Carl said, even without Skynet, humanities nature has a 75% propability to make those weapons needed, the robot-guy ultimately got the message most of the reviewers here missed...
Humanity's ultimate victory, even if this movie fails hard and won't born another, is that we even won Carl over, we humanized him?
Arnie was well worthy of such closure, also my generation too.
For me it's a win win situation most of the films I watch, I can easily predict what will happen. They managed to shock me, excite me, thrill me even, loved every minute, even the Latin vibes, the character development and the deeper meaning. The end was masterful, it could be the final end, or the beginning of smth wonderful!
The series could only shock us once with unveiling a cyborg skeleton, under a man's skill, this was the second best moment for me!",Terminator - Dark Fate

T2 set the bar nothing will match in the franchise ever. So move on from that. Heat is my favourite movie...I had low expectations actually as I did not like the trailer. I thought it was a typical show you everything and too much enforced from the studios. I was going because of Cameron and Hamilton.First up...  moans...? Don't be silly.James Cameron has always had strong female characters in his movies. From Aliens to Titanic. This is nothing new and Hamilton set the bar along with Vasquez in Aliens. This whole thing of being is silly. It does nothing bad for the movie and we have Arnie and the enemy terminator as males.  Don't be silly.The story albeit not perfect is a good reboot and anyone giving this low scores must not have watched T3 and Genisys. Let's be relative here. They were awful.Keeping with those movies I hear people say there is nothing new here in Dark Fate. No there is just a good solid foundation of story built upon unlike the previous sorry offerings which are just 'let's chuck awful new stuff in for no reason' because it looks shiny even if on terminator terms it's completely unrealistic. Then throw in the awful acting.Will T2 be surpassed? No. But let's consider T3 and Genisys did not exist and Dark Fate would be better accepted.This movie has well thought out and made action scenes. A nice balance of unreal and believable, between CGI and live execution, that in a time of manure in form of Fast & Furious, Transformers for example, it is a breathe of fresh air to have an aging artist involved in such a franchise again. James Cameron has nice touches that you don't get from other movies that just come across as clumsy and mass produced mashups.Why is it that everything has to be always new? It's a myth. It does not. The T101 was from the future, scary as hell and is still the star terminator. Cameron gets that and explored about about the machine and its progression through life. Yes a new iteration came with a slightly interesting concept just enough 'new'. We don't need stupid gimics everywhere to be entertained. Are our attention spans now really that low?But again why does there need to be a demand for so much new when the story has advanced just with the war for the future raging on.Don't let the trolls put you off.Hamilton is a meanie, Arnie comes in at the right time of the movie and pulls off the Terminator as it should be as a machine personality.I expect many to see this out of cinema and think this is actually alright.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Moviegoers and fans of the franchise, who cannot accept that this is not just adding to the time line of the previous films but just gets a new (much better) approach at a sequel, should become writers or filmmakers instead of criticising a well made action film.It was perfectly well communicated before the movie went to the cinemas that this one would directly follow up on part 2 and have nothing to do with the other sequels. Why can people not accept that premise and enjoy the movie for what it is: a very well made action flick with good old Arnie. Man, I enjoyed it.,Of course is not as good as T2, it could not be. T2 was a perfect 10, in my opinion. It was one of only very very few films I would rate a 10 (along with Matrix, The Dark Knight, Fight Club, Mission Impossible 4...). Still it has a compelling story line, is consistent in its own logic (if you manage to ignore all the Terminator movies that came after T2), is well acted, well directed and has non-stop action that keeps you at the edge of your seat for most of the film.So, I strongly encourage you to watch it.

We demanded a movie that captured the energy and emotions of the first two, and that's what we got with Dark Fate.

He took from some of the coolest scenes of the first movie like when that semi truck is chasing motorcycles down the Los Angeles culverts, he does something similar in this movie. there's a number of references to the first and second movies with the cameo from the kid from the second movie three CGI. The story was absolutely fantastic, Linda Hamilton although looking incredibly old was able to somewhat pull of her part just a bitter angry woman in the movie but I get it.

I don't know what his name is but he is it Mexican-American and Cameron and the director do an awesome job of making him indestructible.7 stars is a lot for a movie but I rated it that because I thought it was such a wonderful progression in the Terminator series. I absolutely hated everything after the second so this one really restored my faith. I see more on the horizon. Keep them coming Mr Cameron.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1909,Envasahans,Em... It's actually pretty damn good!,8,3 November 2019,"I don't get the negative reviews...I just saw the movie and I really lowered my expectations after several reviews but I enjoyed every minute of the movie. It's from start to end a wild adrenaline ride which actually captures the heart and spirit of a genuine Terminator movie.You can say it lacks a bit of originality storywise but it's definitely not a full rehash of T1 and T2.Also never did I have the feeling that I was watching some forced Hollywood overpowered feminist movie. Linda Hamilton and Mackenzie Davis truly kick ass without it being forced.Gabriel Luna really kills it as the rev-9 and is definitely on par with Robert Patricks T-1000. At times he is even more terrifying.The whole Carl storyline, which I was really anxious about manages to sell itself. I liked it! It even manages to pack some emotional punch.And the action is really really good. Sometimes, especially the airplane bit the action is a bit dark but nevertheless I enjoyed it.I know the other sequels after T2 were terrible but Dark Fate truly is worthy successor. So if you're still up for a genuine brutal Terminator movie, go see this one! I promise you, you will not regret it,",Terminator - Dark Fate
1910,theewarlord,Best Terminator in awhile,8,4 November 2019,"I enjoyed this movie. In my opinion top 3, with T1,T2, and this one. Great action scenes, solid acting, great CGI effects. Yes the franchise been done to death , but its a solid movie.
The complaints of inconsistencies, from T1 and T2, and the rest. Well, when you have this many sequels, and reboots, the story lines are going to blur. As for the complaints of political correctness, good grief, it's a Sci-Fi action film, just watch and enjoy.

Don't get me wring though,honestly it's a good sequel to T2.It had a great surprise i did'nt see coming. It made me feel alot of emotions like sadness,happiness and conflicted.

1915,janssen86,"Almost, but not quite, as awful as Terminator Genesis",1,31 October 2019,"The story starts off with a slap in the faces of the previous Terminator movies, of the fans and of general logic. It proceeds to gender-swap the protagonists, but somehow not the main antagonist, of the saga in order to basically retell T2.The explanation given to pull this, the movie's premise off will make you not only cringe - it will contradict several events and and the appearance of a notable character later on. This character now has a story that, again, slaps the previous Terminator movies in the face. Several plotholes later, the events stumble to a finale that is basically and as mentioned a retell of T2.I cannot imagine why both Linda Hamilton as well as Arnold Schwarzenegger decided to spoil their legacies with this movie. Nor were they really needed for its story. As if they had belatedly realised their mistake, they unhappily rattle off the platitudes handed to them by the script-writers.The only interesting role is surprisingly in the one that ended up being played by Mackenzie Davis. Or it would have been, if the actress had perceived the tragedy of her character and made something of it. But I already knew Davis as being either unable or just unwilling to act from the Martian, and I gather the producers just cast her for her looks this time, too.The supposed main protagonist comes across as an object as animated as a pinball. Why Natalia Reyes was cast in that role is a question that can only be answered with: Nobody cared. So I didn't, either.Add to that the largely uninspired cinematography and editing as we arrive at the conclusion: a sad end to the Terminator franchise. The best that can be said about it: It's almost, but not quite, as awful as Terminator Genesis. And it deserves as much time and attention.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I would prefer Salvation part 2, at least it was a bit gritty and didn't have time travel.I would watch it just so you have a valid opinion on it.

1920,bhamnida,Had to bring the average up,10,15 November 2019,"This is the best Terminator since T2, but yes, it wasn't that good. Really it should get around a 7.The gender issues are not real. There is no agenda pushed on the viewer, they just went with women. No big deal.The plot is actually decent in the present, but it's the future that they keep getting wrong. How does our technology get so advanced in a few short years when we are fighting guerrilla warfare against machines keeping us in rubble? How does our medicine become so futuristic but we are starving to death after judgement day? They need to keep the terminator simple, and keep the future humans living realistically like T1. Struggling in the ruins underground, but with a will and determination that will hold out and win the war.I thought the Mackenzie Davis was amazing and a great choice. Really she IS this movie. Without her it wouldn't really be anything. Natalia Reyes while good in the present, was not portrayed well in the future as the leader of humanity. Forget physical combat, she would be smart and cunning and lead others to victory, not risk her life to show off her moves. At least not once she had a following. If they had chosen to have trained physically threatening people at her side acting for her and showing their awe and loyalty toward her, acting as extensions of herself, that would have been a great scene. (You'll know the one).Definitely great action and a fun time, kind of a T1 all over again, but yeah, maybe don't expect it to last for ever as canonical ""Terminator 3"".It will always and forever only be just T1 and T2 for this fan.",Terminator - Dark Fate

But no, you gave us some feminist bull crap and this is coming from a female. Nothing wrong with needing a man sometimes ladies. A CGI of child Edward Furlong does NOT count as him returning to the series. Just bad bad bad. The original will always remain as my favorite movie.

Lack of money is not the issue anyways. The atrocious and overused CGI must have taken a good chunk of the budget. And yet the CGI in T2 was million times better, cooler and thought of.This latest and hopefully last instalment has the general vibe so very wrong from what it should be that it hurts my brain.One can only wonder how did the storyline and script got past any quality control in the Hollywood dreamland.The general vibe has no menace (or that cool edge-of-your-seat threat) that made T1 & T2 so magical. Someone also has gotten the humor (that was so wisely used in T2) totally wrong.The score is also so bland and generic that it brings the movie down quite a bit. There's not one bit of music or sound in this that you notice or that enhances the action on the screen. Just no.It's so awful that it's hard to even write down how bad it is compared to the timeless classics as T1 & T2. Shame on you who made this mess! Bad bad movie making!

1932,d_moura,I had to write,7,1 November 2019,"I just had to write my thoughts after all the nonsensical garbage I was reading here. People keep complaining about this movie and how much better T2 was. Don't do me wrong, I also like T1 and T2, but many of the critics I see here are plain stupid. I see people complaining about how ""emotionless"" Dani was after she knew the deaths of her family, but what about how John reacted after he learned the people he was loving with were dead?
People simply can't see a movie without being biased towards it. They can't enjoy what they're watching. People just aren't able to get over the fact that most of the main characters in this movie are women, they just can't, they start immediately labeling it as a gender manifestation. Stupid.There are some things that aren't needed, the hole crossing the border isn't necessary, but if you think logically how would they get to the USA? Yes there was too many resemblances with the previous movies, even the ones this one discarded, but if you remember the T800 was already the one who killed John too.People are even complaining that Sarah has no motive to be this bitter person she is in the movie... REALLY? This is why I say people just hate this movie because they want to. In T2 they were able to stop judgment day, like she said, they were able to save billions of lives, and yet she couldn't save the one thing she hold the dearest, can you imagine how she's feeling? In here she is at her lowest and she has every right to be that way. SHE FAILED protecting John.I really enjoyed this movie, and for me I took a few sublime messages from it (even if they weren't ment to).
One is that if we aren't cautious, humanity will walk rewards their own demise, the teams the machines uprising is inevitable. Other is that any one can be a saviour. And it maintains the same ""pathos"" that we make our own choices, the future is not set.Another thing, people compliment the ""connection"" between John and the T800 in T2? He was programed to protect him. In here we saw the T800 CHOOSE to protect someone, emphasising even more that we alone are the masters of our own fate, we aren't bonded to one certain future.I'm really glad I dint pay any attention to what people wrote here before going to see the movie.",Terminator - Dark Fate

No. It's a decent entry in the franchise, easily better than any of the other post-T2 sequels. (Other than the Sarah Connor Chronicles show, which was a much better sequel to 2 in my opinion).Mackenzie Davis is basically a suped-up Kyle Reese, I even think the main girl calls her Reese once. I was a fan of hers from Halt & Catch Fire, and I'm glad she is still killing it after being cast in Geostorm.Sarah Connor is back and is one tough senior citizen this time around.

All that work, all that money, all those years... shrugged off with a few unenthusiastic lines. The only halfway decent sequel of worth was Terminator Salvation and for some reason that installment was tossed aside for the travesty that is Terminator Genisys.

1939,catraven-73610,"Story, timeline... mistakes galore...",3,28 June 2021,"T2 is one of my fave movies of all time.This movie offers an alternatte timeline to sequel T2.Now T2 is horriblly riddled with movie and timeline mistakes, however; the execution of the movie, and the underlying message of it, is beautifully presented.I wont get into all of that here, but let's pick on just this one thing...
In T2 the Cyberdyne model 101, that protects John Connor, is destroyed at the end.If Skynet would not become aware, due to the actions of our protagonists in T2, then this destruction, should not be necessary.Model 101 should simply have disappeared at the end, when all was safe, since the future he came from would never be....
Right??However: the chosen T2 ending allowed for T3 to be made and subsequently Salvation and Genisys.Since the Terminator did not disappear in T2, a Skynet- incident can still happen.In Dark Fate, Skynet never happened. Legion happened.So how did Cyberdyne model 101 come to exist at all, in this rendition of a T2 sequel?Cyberdyne created Skynet, but in Dark Fate it is hinted that someone else created Legion...
As kong as a model 101 is presented, it would mean that some AI had the exact same idea as Skynet. And the exact same data etc...I didn't mind exploring a different timeline, but I'd have liked it to be more consistent and convincing.This story was a bit anemic, and as mentioned, felt non- conformed within it's time continuum...
I enjoyed all the action scenes and the special effects, especially the young Sarah and John Connor and a young Arnie- Terminator.Really well done.I saw someone commenting that it was copying the T2 storyline, like SW: TFA did.I agree.But I don't object.Someone commented on the Rev-Terminator as being to expressive, giving funny quips or being to talkative/ argumentative.I don't mind.All Terminators are made to be able to imitate and infiltrate, so it can get close to its target.He was one of the more advanced, so that would not be too out there, for me.(In T3 the T-X is visibly, and audibly (she draws her breath) stunned when it realises it has found the blood of John Connor, its primary target, while hunting Kate Brewster, a secondary target atm.A machine of that calibre should not be capable of a human emotion like getting stunned or even drawing a sharp breath to illustrate its «thoughts».However, this does add to its possibilities for imitating a human well.)I do hope James Cameron will get back to writing another story about the Terminators, to correct mistakes in the previous ones.They are possible to correct, so get crackin', JC!!I give this one a three star rating, cause it's so far my least fave, of the Terminator franchise that I really love.I'll re-watch just to see what I might have missed.Figuring out the makers of Legion will be a priority.",Terminator - Dark Fate

1953,jinx20001,solid movie if you unplug a little. (spoilers),7,23 October 2019,"So yeh... its not better than the first 2 but the issue isnt that it wasnt exciting to watch. for me it was entertaining to watch, had some moments of warmth and humour, action was big and the fight was compelling and thats what i think a lot of us really want from a terminator movie, the enemy has to be feared, it has to be frighteningly powerful and appear unstoppable and they get that right here with the REV 9, its a dangerous machine our ''hero'' characters must run from.anyway, the issue is it still lacked some of the horror we were hoping for, especially as it attempted to take a darker route it simply isnt dark enough, it is absolutely still aimed at the slightly younger than adult audience, it only really earns its R (15) rating from a bit of bad language and a little blood, nothing comes close to the brutality of arnold ripping out a heart at the start of T1 or even the punching through the chest scene in T3. as a fan of the franchise this was an issue for me because there has to be an element of brutality to the ''evil'' terminator. gabriel luna did a great job, i think he played it spot on but given a bit more freedom to really do some visual damage would have gone a long way.my other couple of issues are - the CGI is a little weak at times, and absolutely fantastic at other times, (spoiler - already spoiled) theres a scene at the start of the movie of john conner as a child and sarah conner in her younger years and well sarah looks pretty spot on but john is wayyy off, its not close at all, also arnold is here blasting him away and well, he looks like an actual artificial robot, he wouldnt pass as human very long looking like that for sure. At other times in the movie the CGI is just mind blowing, theres a scene near the end of the movie when arnold is pretty shredded up, metal all exposed and the lighting and reflection off the metal work is the best in the series by far, its really unbalanced like that and kind of offputting.one last complaint, its a bit of a biggy (and a spoiler again), the REV 9 gets its hands around the neck our new savious of mankind and well.... this is a huge no no, never put the enemy terminator and most fragile hero character in contact like that unless the hero is going to die, she survives and that just should not happen, i said this to the wife when leaving the movie and she said ''well the rev 9 was pretty banged up and clearly weaker at that point''.... this is a fair statement but we are talking about a machine here with hydraulic pressure in its mechanisms enough to crush human bones in one squeeze, it just does not sit right with me she can survive that encounter and simply makes the rev 9 less believable as an unstoppable killing machine.despite all the negatives i really quite enjoyed it, i think the performances were solid, the action was relentless if a little CG heavy and i didnt feel too let down, part of the issue i feel is we are moving into 2020 and CGI is getting so good its the natural thing to use these days but we are also too smart as humans and can pretty easily spot it and that breaks immersion.i think some of the hardcore terminator fans are going to curse on this film because it breaks away from the traditional lore of the franchise but it worked out ok i feel, unplug from your feelings towards the first 2 movies and its a fun flick, but they could have made it a lot stronger and hard hitting with that R.",Terminator - Dark Fate

If you are new to the Terminator films then I advice the first two masterpieces and then don't watch anymore.,Terminator - Dark Fate
1955,antigorod,Absolutely terrible,1,4 November 2019,"A huge set of cliche, marketing trends and epic stupidity. So sad that Arny agreed to take a part in this caricature. Some said this is just an action movie, but this is absolutely terrible even for action movie.We need to runaway on Hummer from this falling plane.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1956,PaulKarlJones,Give it a chance.,8,26 October 2019,"After many an attempt to revitalise this beloved franchise, you'd be forgiven for just letting this pass you by with apathy.
Setting my expectations to low but with an open mind I went to see it at the local Imax.
Goddamn was I entertained.
I don't have a lot to gripe about honestly. Great cast all around, with Hamilton, Schwarzenegger and Davis being the standouts.
The original 2 James Cameron films hold a very special place in my heart from my youth and I found this ultimately a worthy successor to those installments.
It's exciting stuff.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1957,donnelcyan,Loved it.,7,2 June 2020,"Loved the action. It kept me on the edge of my sit. Story was a bit lacking or one would say ""seen that before"" but overall it is worth watching.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1958,krinja,Downgrade after Genisys,6,24 October 2019,"I always say if after each failed James Bond episode they would run a reboot it would have been a crap.They continued even if some were weak. The reboot or the new ""we ignore the previous episode and we make a true sequel"" did not work by the Highlander nor by Superman Returns and the same goes to Terminator: funny thing is that Cameron said by each previous episode that it is going to be awesome he gives his blessing blabla, but after fans gave negative reviews he distanced from each sequel .Wonder what he will do this time? This is not a bad movie but not good either. This is the brazil soap opera version of Terminator. I think they messed it up to kill John Connor and gave a very weak woman in the lead, even if they tried to make her look cool, it was just a comedy in the future scenes where she tries to play a tough woman - it only fits to Linda Hamilton or to Sigourney- these young wannabe actresses just dont have the tough look or charisma- it does not work.The mexican terminator does not work either.Robert Patrick is still scary in the second part but this new bad guy is boring.Joseph Gordon Levitt could have been a better choice- and btw he looks like Robert Patrick in young version!!! I think Genisys was better and had more potential.I hope someone will cut the last 3 sequels into one movie and than we get a good ending of this story.Or they should hire Edward Furlong in front of green screen and reshoot the lines/ scenes of Nick Stahl from rise of the machines and maybe take some fight scenes where he leads the last troops against Skynet and humanity wins for once and for all. Why can't they just close the story with dignity with a monumental war? hope there wont be more so the story can be Terminated",Terminator - Dark Fate
1959,Cheesenips89,Dark Cheese directed by Walt Disney - awful,4,24 October 2019,"First off id like to say how gutted i am with this movie. Im a big Terminator fan and waiting a whole year watching every trailer, actor interview and reading anything i could in relation to the release of the movie. All destroyed within a couple of hours.Dark Fate - This is a movie you will of all seen before. nothing knew here expect some new types of Terminators which actually resemble things from Alien movies more than they do Terminators. The action scenes are way over the top in comparison the the first 2 movies. Explosions left right and center with more cars blown up than a fast and furious movie.The action took to the skies in which all major characters ended up falling out the back of a airplane in a car falling to the ground from a few thousand feet. All of which survived including 60 year old Linda.The part of the film which really actually made me start laughing uncontrollably was the fact the T800 (Arnold) had its own house. Its own house with its own family, pet dog, tools, car, shoes and beers.... Beers which he dished out to the visitors with a slice of lime. Oh it has a business called Carls Drapes, so im guessing it has its own bank account and everything else that comes with that.
Maybe even a passport for those special family holidays to Benidorm.Before anyone shoots me down and says its a learning T800 that is trying to adapt to human life and nature, please just read the above paragraph again over and over until you are ready to continue.
My head is still a mess from the film right now i remember shaking my head and laughing for the most part.'The best since the original 2' How dare you even suggest that.I guess ill wait another 4-5 years before someone else takes over the whole thing and starts again? Walt Disney next maybe?",Terminator - Dark Fate
1960,El-Andy,Nothing new here,5,19 January 2020,"Although they basically threw out everything they've been ""building"" in the past, the creators of Terminator Dark Fate did not manage to give us a new reason why.It's unbelievably predictable and somewhat hard to enjoy if you are a diehard Terminator fan. It's basically the same story only empowering women to repeat what you've already seen before. Arnie sits on the back seat of this one and you will be very disappointed on how little he actually adds to the film, even though he is a ""hero"" in the film.They missed a great opportunity in partnering the Terminator and Sarah Connor in a badass comeback.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1961,d_gholt,Unoriginal and contrived,4,7 March 2020,"I wanted to like this, it entertained in a way that average action films do these days..
But this is terminator... supposedly the terminator 3 that should have been.
But I just didn't find it any better than any since number 2.
The first one was dark, brutal and gripping ... the second was built on the fist with its own originality and fx that honestly look way better than 2019 version.
Since then, it seems to be about money, this is terminator 2 but a lot worse... no originality, contrived cast and debunks the amazing first 2.. that's fine if you're guna make a film that is great... like they did with T2.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1962,mrsunnyman,Much better than the previous,9,25 October 2019,"I am not sure why so many of you felt abit disappointed. Action PACKED movie. Story line is slightly average. But the action alone attracts me. IF you go for handsome or pretty girls aka actor or actress, might as well don't waste time watching a movie. Might as well watch models...lol. Seriously this dark fate is much more better than the previous part and if the story line could improve abit that would be fantastic ! Well anyway worth my time and money to watch !",Terminator - Dark Fate
1963,dskelecaster,Linda Hamilton because,8,19 October 2020,T2 blew the minds of humans worldwide. I watched it 2x on opening night!

1964,Flabulous,"Magic-less, but helps crack the magic code of T1 & T2",5,1 November 2019,"The key was in the first action sequence. By the end of it, I realised I was in for a painful 2 hour limp toward the finish line. How had it got off to such a bad start, as compared to the utterly thrilling and intriguing starts of the originals? The first action sequence. The 'rules' of it were unclear and complicated, and it was essentially meaningless to the story. I realised that the 'rules' of the original action sequences were clear and simple, and they were meaningful to the story. With these in mind, it made me realise that nothing interesting had been done with the developed terminator idea, whereas the originals revealed first the core concept of a terminator, followed by a superior liquid version now being protected by a benevolent terminator who symbolically acted as a father figure. Next, the cast of the originals were distinctive and memorable, as compared to the blurred and forgettable cast of DF. Next, the script and score. Great originals scripts that conveyed emotion plus a score that worked to further bring out that emotion. And finally, the direction, which was curious and well-paced, instead of the blurry and uninteresting mess. My final revelation was in remembering one of the crew saying that James Cameron knew most of their roles better than they did ... his vision was realised by making all the parts support each other as one long integrated whole. He loves the terminator series, and my guess is that he hasn't made another for a lack of trying but for a lack of finding a satisfactory way to develop the original concepts into a new, integrated, magical experience.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1965,moumalidis,And justice for all.,7,31 October 2019,"I am going to be fair.And believe me I am a big fan.It's a really good action movie. With explosions, slow motion and Arnold kicking ass .it's a nice movie. It has a big, very big negative. The script. Yes the script. It's the same with the original, the first one terminator, with diffrent names.
If you want to see a good action movie, with Arnold, and(a very good bad terminator),you are on.
A few movies can go toe to toe with T2.is one of the best movies EVER. Sorry get over it.",Terminator - Dark Fate

1971,andybmac,Really?!,3,12 November 2019,"Why Really. Obviously we don't have killing machines that have moved backwards in time to assassinate a woman who didn't know she was going to lead a resistance and save what remains of mankind.
No the really, is to do with a whacky plot line ( in particular the airplane sequence) and dialogue that does have the occasional light touch but overall was heavy handed and at times excruciating.
You can read more from other contributors on the plot, such as it is. Thinking back to the first two films in the series, yes the plot was far fetched but it, ( especially in the second film) was engaging and drew you in, this film does not.
This week I've been twice to the cinema. I've been privileged to watch a dark but fantastic film with an Oscar winning performance from Joaquin Phoenix ( you know the one!) and this mis match of an affair. Go if you must, keep expectations low!",Terminator - Dark Fate
1972,terecmaione,I liked it a lot!,10,11 November 2019,I really loved this movie. I think the only reason there are bad reviews is because it has very strong female lead characters and sometimes men just really hate that. I really enjoyed the fight scenes and I think the acting was awesome. I love that the women were so strong and it made me feel good seeing that on screen. It makes me feel like I could view myself as strong instead of being the weak female that always needs saving. I would rather see this stuff than movies where women are being beaten or degraded. I think we need more strong female leads and this was just great and I would definitely watch it over again!,Terminator - Dark Fate
1973,yourimagery,What's up with ya?,7,31 October 2019,"The reviews on here for this are ridiculous. This was not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination. Granted for those of us who grew up on T1 & 2 it doesn't feel original and it does throw dirt in the face of those movies to an extent, but at least it does that in a somewhat clever way. Go watch the film, don't expect to relive the first time you saw the first 2 films and you'll have a good time. This is not a 1 or 2 star movie, Rambo Last Blood it ain't.",Terminator - Dark Fate

1975,aidanbacon,By far the best since T2,6,23 October 2019,"I was very surprised at how good this film actually was. Arnie and Linda Hamilton reprise their roles and do it perfectly. Linda Hamilton portrays a ghost of her character from T2 but not straying too far for at the point were it's a different character. The new characters, Dani and Grace were also interesting and welcome additions to the Terminator franchise, though Grace being a Terminator human hybrid I think they should've got into more depth than what they did. The new Terminator the Rev-9 is a genuinely intimidating villain and very menacing. The movie sticks quite close to the story of T2 but that isn't too much of a problem. Finally it has some of the best action sequences of the franchise and they really grip your eyes and are very entertaining. So in conclusion a very entertaining movie with great new and old characters and a very surprising moment despite sticking quite close to the story of T2 it's a worthy sequel to the two classics.",Terminator - Dark Fate

The good ones are Conan the Barbarian, T1 & T2. Maybe because they have really good story-telling and helped by effects and CGI. Arnold's accent, the -ve side of the character was replaced with minimal dialogues, one liners, and focused on telling the stories either through a narrator or by other characters. Body languange, lightings, mise-en-scene! John Millius and former James Cameron knew how to use Arnold as characters, shaped the stories with few lines in-between and came up with GREAT movies.",Terminator - Dark Fate
1977,alanintalan,Unimpressed,4,20 July 2020,"Have to say that this latest installment of the Terminator movies has sorely missed the mark. The storyline is a mess & the special effects look like it should've been in a B-movie. Overall, this movie is such a downer",Terminator - Dark Fate
1978,ampertox,Why I love Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles,5,10 November 2019,"From my point of view, Dark Fate fail to shine because, as George Lucas before him with its The Phantom Menace (not incidentally both movies are enjoying same kind of reviews and ratings on IMDB/Metascore), James Cameron is drowning the story in shiny CGI. Combine this with the director of Deadpool and you get a Terminator in Marvel Universe. Maybe's a trend - or a curse - of big-budget movies today (and I'm saying this as one who watched and enjoyed original Start Wars and Terminators in 80's-'90s) to move the CGI and ""green screen"" in front and let the story and acting somewhere in the background.The 2008 Sarah Connor Chronicles (TSCC - which I've discovered barely in 2018) didn't had enough budget to buy the rights use the word ""Terminator""; they don't had enough budget to buy the rights for Brad Fiedel's soundtrack. But they had a story. They had dark, classy humour. They had directors (Band Of Brothers, The Pacific, Game of Thrones, CSI, the Sopranos, Millennium, X-Files) They had a true, strong connection with T2: they had Sarah Connor, John Connor, Kyle Reese, dr Silberman, Pescadero hospital, Tarissa & Danny Dyson, they had Enrique, they had endoskeleton and had liquid-metal terminator, they had the silver-painted ""mannequin"", they had the energy bubble and the time travel machine, they had Robert Patrick's sunglasses and police motorcycle, they had the ""Come with me if you wanna live"". They had only one basement and a construction site for their post-Judgement Day scenes, didn't have a lot of CGI but special effects (""make-ups"") were brilliant. And they had Cameron.Of course, it's a matter of each of us personal's taste but, for me, the one and only true successor of the T1-T2 is not Dark Fate, but TSCC.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Not how its going to be destroyed and one person unites humans to ultimately fail again. Why couldn't this movie go into who, why, and how Legion was created and it being destroyed, though with resistance, by future and current soliders. We as humans are The Terminators and the resistance will do everything in there will to eliminate the fall out of humanity. They just get help from future tech who want to join the resistance because they see their inevitable end once humans are out of the picture.

I'm not some basement-dwelling, misogynistic, little, overweight, Caucasian, Heterosexual, Homophobic INCEl as some may think of me as. The death of John Conner in the opening credits was just disrespectful, as this was the whole purpose of T2.

1990,sunmoon-05478,Linda Hamilton owns it,7,25 October 2019,"As a huge fan of T2, being the favorite film of my childhood, and later T1, of course I disliked what came after. Arnie was in for the cash and didn't care for any quality nor legacy of the 1st 2 films. Unlike Ms Hamilton.PROS. I can't point finger at it so I don't really know what Linda as Sarah Connor has, but man she can deliver and that's the end of it. I can only say thank you for your wonderful work. Overall cast did a great job and I see no issues there.
Even if my rating 7 is maybe high, I do acknowledge that nostalgia is major factor here.
They did amazing job de-aging Linda, Eddie and Arnie in an opening scene and for those few seconds I was overwhelmed with joy, but still heavily disagree with what's happening on the screen. Music was good too.CONS. The writing, or the lack of. Creativity is nowhere to be found. What made Terminator what it is (was) is progression from T1 to T2. Build up of the story, amazing James Cameron work on many levels, Arnold, Linda, Edward, and Robert giving life to these iconic characters, ground-breaking effects and action scenes. Major studios just can not make a film today that I would love. Last 10 times I went to see a blockbuster, I wanted my money back 20 minutes in. Even this I saw a crappy copy online; I have a firm stand not to give my hard earned cash to Hollywood. Only exceptions last 5 years being Arrival and Mad Max Fury Road. Story of Dark Fate is a slap in the face for true fans.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Thankfully I hadn't followed all the hype before the film that I read in other reviews, that probably created those high unfulfilled expectations. I just saw a very nice action film and that's it. I am not stuck in the past nor do I think that ""good Star War movies cannot be made again"" (just to make my point here). Enjoy it, don't wait to be WOWed and you'll find it a good movie.

The new protector Mackenzie Davis could use a different hair style but she gave the best performance in the film. She's also sexy as hell in a Joan of Arc kind of way. Arnold was as wooden as ever repeating his role as an original Terminator on the first movie. The new hero of the resistance has the acting chops of a 2 year old and was hopelessly miscast. The new liquid terminator has new powers that are cool AF but the actor lacked the steely sinister presence of Robert Patrick who still scares me. The special effects were dazzling and the action sequences were fairly believable. I saw it in IMAX which also lent itself to the experience.

This ""not- terminator"" is augmented meaning she's mostly human, and has to be brought to life multiple times. A chilled out T-800 (Arnold) eventually joins them on their quest, agreeing to help Dani too. Lost interest big time from the very beginning.

2000,mjmitchell-86670,He Said He Would Be Back,9,4 November 2019,"Terminator Dark Fate was the best movie since Terminator 2. It had a really good story and a huge plot twist that I didn't see coming.
To start this off, the first three scenes felt familiar from T2, it had similar action and in both T2 and this one the bad guy was driving a truck pursuing the heros. The action in this was non stop, from the very first scene to the last there was no break in the pursuit for Dani. The heros in Dark Fate are Grace, a mechanically modified human, Sarah Conner, and Dani Ramos and T-800 (Arnold). The plot was extremely good, which was to save Dani and save all of humanity yet again. The story telling of this movie was as good as T1 and T2. Tim Miller did an awesome job at directing this movie because he brought back the grit and an R rated title into the saga. I had some doubts about this movie, such as I didn't know if Arnold was going to be as good as he was in the older ones because of his age but he didn't disappoint, he was great in this movie and he expanded the plot in many points. Linda Hamilton played an angry and revengeful Sarah Conner There were a lot more laughs in this Terminator than any others thanks to Tim Miller. This was a great movie I would rate it 5/5. The plot was straight forward and it put a pretty bow on the saga, wrapping up the franchise. Gabriel Luna was disturbingly outstanding, from start to finish he wasn't stoping till he would get to his mission which was Dani. The adrenaline rush that I experienced was similar to the rush that I felt when watching the first two Terminators for the very first time. I would recommend this movie to anyone that likes action movies with a good plot or just robot movies. Thank you for this, it was amazing an film!

2001,bornthespian-08995,"Finally, a REAL Terminator Movie!",7,6 February 2020,"It's like this, if you're a fan of the original and T2, you need to watch this. Put the other Terminator flicks out of your mind. In fact, pretend they never existed. Dark Fate is fun and it brings those old feelings back. Watching Sara Connor be an older version of herself is pretty damn cool, Grace is so badass, mankind's savior (Dani) grows on you, but best of all, the new Terminator Rev-9, is a PROBLEM! Oh and...Arnold. Good to see him again. I tell ya..old feelings. Enjoy..",Terminator - Dark Fate
2002,strzyz,if you liked Original T1 and T2 you will like Terminator Dark Fate!,10,1 November 2019,"If you want to know what happen after terminator 2, this movie is a must! It is a good sci-fi film, which i liked. This film is not a 1/10 film, the movie is actually very good in my eyes, so forget the trolls who gave it 1/10.It have a nice flow and very nice action scenes, so you will like it if you like action and sci fi:)All the actors are familiar and you will like Arnie again:)
Again if you are a fan you will like it, and if you like i want to know what happen after T2, you will like this movie.Great movie again Arnie:)",Terminator - Dark Fate
2003,pottierkurt,Sy fy?,4,17 January 2020,"I was so excited for the continuation of the Cameron timeline. But boy was I disappointed.. 1st scene shattered that all.
How would I describe this movie?
""Mexican SyFy movie, great CGI, bland acting. Great if you want to read subtitles all the time"" That's about the most exciting part of this movie.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2004,DarkSandSand,Good action film but not Terminator film,5,3 November 2019,"It's good action film and the first 20mins was really good, but after that it went downhill for me. It feels much more action film than being a Terminator movie.
Terminator films need:
James Cameron directing
Brad Fiedel music
Good story and script.
Showing purpose for chracters that make you care for them and understand their emotions
Needs to have a continuous pace.I don't really care about new Dani character, they should show why/how she is saviour
Too much talking instead of story being shown
Terminators should be scary for audience that something that needs to be stopped otherwise it will win
Terminator movies need Brad Fiedel music, it helps bring it all together
Linda Hamilton acting felt too far off from what was done before
CGI was well below standards for 2019, CGI from 1991 looks better and realistic.
Script was very poor and when will Dani and Grace ever have a proper talk about why Terminator wants her. Why?At least with John, he taught the soldiers how to fight back, turn the Terminators into junk. He turned it around and brought everyone back from the brink of no hope.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2005,iancam-25496,Lazy Storytelling,5,5 November 2019,"It's amazing that they can't come up with an interesting story instead of just repeating previous stuff.
Usually Arnie is at least good but they ruined him here, it was nonsense what they did with the character, he was nothing like a Terminator.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2006,estevanvalladares,Another movie that overstay its name recognition,5,12 November 2019,"It is a trend for old franchises to completely change what made them what they were to cater to another demographic, and this one piles up.Linda and Arnold, and the name Terminator are in this movie to say ""hey, we are here"".Right at the signature arrival of someone from the future we are presented with some changes to the overall rules from the previous movies. It is said that flesh is what ensure the travel to happen, and anything not encased in flesh will be like ""tin foil on a microwave times 1000"". Our terminator this time is not encased in flesh. A small detail, but everything else from there follows similar pattern: The overall terminator common sense is there, but nothing of the terminator universe pillars is present as it was meant to be.Like other reviewers, but a little less ""aggressive"", I agree that they should start new franchises and stop rebooting old ones as nothing like they were.Later on the movie is very predictable, not because we have seen terminator before, but because it follows the same literal skeleton story most movies are following today: Weak character is put in a position of importance, and must step up to the task. Along the way strong characters are somehow dependent on a moment of strength from said character, and at the end, the weak character finds out that the strength comes from something that was generally thought to be a weakness. And the strong and almost unstoppable foe is defeated by means that are ""deus ex machina ish"" at best.A very non expressive addition to the Terminator franchise that seem to be produced based mone along the lines of ""we gotta do a terminator movie"", and not ""we have an idea for a terminator movie"".As many sequels, prequels and reboots from lately: If this movie was a stand alone movie, it would be a somewhat good movie, but it is a bad sequel in the Terminator franchise.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2007,hahnmarkdesigns,I want my $0.50 back,4,11 November 2019,"The story is boring and cliche. The writing is pretty generic as well, with all of the humor being the like the worse reference humor from Deadpool. The acting is generic. No one acts like they want to be a part of this, well except for Arnold but to be fair, the actors are given nothing to work with. I'm really split about how they handled Arnold's character. They tried to make him a funny family man and pretty much destroyed any previous development Arnold had in the other films. A lot of the initial scenes involving him are kind of awkward and try a little too hard to be funny. However, there were a few lines that made me chuckle a little. Now the new terminator on the other hand.... Eh. At least he's hard to kill, he is definitely a threat to the main characters. It takes them the entire movie to kill this terminator.But that's the only positive I have. The actor is eh. He's probably a good actor but he's an awful terminator. What takes me out of it most is the effects. The old terminators were so scary because they used many practical effects to make it look real. In this one, he looks like he belongs in Venom or something. What else is there to say the cinematography is bland, sound design is passable, score is free stock that can be found on youtube, color grading is flat, editing is flat, it's all just a mush of plain oatmeal with no brown sugar.In conclusion, it's a waste of time. It's a 4/10 movie for me. It's below average. It's a bummer when I see great film franchises devolve into products",Terminator - Dark Fate

Do you just push yourself, are you paid or don't you like too much strong female main characters? Or do you have to buy positive reviews in these days because there is too much hate out there?
I enjoyed the whole movie! In my opinion it is the second best Terminator so far and I really got the good old Terminator 2 feeling. It was exiting, full of good action scenes, an nearly undefeatable bad guy and it was funny as well. Come on guys, you can't be serious!?",Terminator - Dark Fate

2010,mfilby-96979,Rehash of T2,8,17 January 2020,"Sort of like a watchable reimagining of the classic T2 with a sort of all girl cast, recycled staff used primarily for nostalgia, mostly worked but the modern CGI robs modern iterations of Terminator of it's classic grain and grit, in a way too smooth and polished, it may have done badly and made a loss, but I enjoyed it but really might not say much as I've liked the entire series of films.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2011,wizzyliz,Not bad for a sequel,8,10 November 2019,"Maybe my expectations were low but I did enjoy this movie. Having seen the first too many many times, and the third one once which was enough the return of Sarah Connor and Arnold was a welcome attraction. Having three women in the lead roles showed me how far we've come since the first Terminator installment. I particularly appreciate it Sarah's anger, attitude and animosity towards everyone. Thatta girl!",Terminator - Dark Fate
2012,StormZone,Ok movie,6,16 January 2020,"This really isn't as bad as all that. It's a decent movie entertainment wise, and more of an offspring of the originals.It's better than T3 and the previous one with ""bad connor"", and whatever happened there.. Doesn't really tread on anything or outright erase actions, as it's just one possible future, or just the next step in preventing an AI-dominated future, determinism wise.It's not a great movie, but nor is it bad.
The acting was solid, and i didn't feel it was ""feminized"", like the Ghost Busters atrocity. Didn't connect with Reyes' Danielle on any level though, and already forgotten her. Also there was some unknown latin guy chasing someone?
But i see a bright future for McKenzie Davis, although one without Skynet or Legion.T2 and Salvation remain my favorites, because of the ruggedness of them, and the pure futility in the face of unstoppable scary machines.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Firstly, they deny the backstory and the prequels. this goes against the narrative so far.
Secondly, the women are shorthaired and have masculine hair. What's up with that? I watch movies to be entertained and be transported to a better place. I don't want something as bad as the worse aspects of our society. If I want to see masculine short hair on a woman I will visit my grandmother.

This one has Arnold and Linda and so there is some hope, right? Wrong.Look, I am fine with the political message. Children should not be in cages and should not be separated from their parents. The trump administration was cruel. Got it. No doubt. But why do we need the rest of it? I am a man. I pay to watch movies. I spend time. I like to fantasize. That is why we have movies!

2023,wayne55,Not so great...,5,12 November 2019,"Let's start off with the good:
Action sequences are pretty good. Aside from some underwhelming cgi in spots, it doesn't disappoint. Let's be honest. We go see Terminator movies for action, not dialogue. Which brings us to the bad:
The dialogue is just awful. I'm not sure if the writing, acting, or direction is to blame, but it's cringe worthy at times. Try to ignore it and appreciate the explosions and car crashes. Also, try to ignore the left wing political (not so) subtle digs against the right, and you might not wish you would have gone to see Joker instead...but you should have.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Good call, since the action was really good.It's fast, it's fun, well played (Linda Hamilton has clearly helped a lot) and it doesn't take itself too serious. Well ... at least for the first half of the two hour movie.Then the American flag and the pathos found it's way into the movie ... and ruined the fun. Plus the so far well executed action sequences become so unreal that even a strong alcoholic beverage couldn't make the whole thing better.So a couple of one liners and Arnie made me giggle a bit but they didn't save the movie.Sometimes I really wish the filmmakers had the guts to let things end badly and devastating ... but well ...Let's hope the franchise doesn't make more mediocre movies and actually won't be back.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2027,hbasaran,Termination is complete!,5,18 January 2020,"No one can denies, it has been done the best in 1991 with T2: Judgment Day because they had the ideal karma (according to that time) on almost every department. You can't easily put a new brick on that awesome product if you've chosen to use same or lower production values and / or qualities after all these years. In the other hand; we, the fans of The Terminator and T2: Judgment day, have always wanted to see a satisfactory installment including especially the ""badass"" Arnie figure. With every new Terminator experience, we were getting frustrated more and more and now we're totally exhausted thanks to James Cameron! I believe if this movie (with a better story of course) could have been made before 2K, it would be far better and we could have been pleased much more. But, unfortunately, after T2: Judgment Day, it seems they've dramatically failed to deliver even a mediocre movie to their highly faithful audience.

2028,bzhpzq,Another Missed Opportunity,6,2 May 2021,"Again, as with T3, TS and TG, they have failed to build on the success and superb, thought provoking back story of the first two films.Basically the first two scenes are the peak of this film, after that it's, ok. The first 30 minutes have plenty of action, Linda Hamilton's arrival definitely gives things a boost, and digging in to her story after the second film is endearing. Much the same happens when the man himself appears, again, the film gets a shot in the arm and I really liked his character development, it's just a shame they didn't introduce him earlier, going about his daily life as a fully integrated infiltrator. As for the two female leads, with all due respect, the Dani character is in no way convincing as a contrived version of a female John Connor, Grace has her moments but there is no sadness at all when she departs proceedings. The Rev-9, this fearful, unstoppable, killing machine that is meant to strike the fear of god in to them, just doesn't, there is never any sense of peril, this is a far cry from the relentless horror of the original T-800, or even the sophisticated subtlety of the T-1000, I mean, in the end he politely asked for Dani!

2036,gregorpatterson,"Good action, but a pointless addition to the Terminator Franchise",10,15 August 2020,"See I'm a little torn on this. The action is good, at times excellent (but also often too CG heavy and ludicrous), but it commits an even bigger sin than Genesys making John Connor evil, they *if you haven't seen this by now you probably never will* murder him, as a kid, right in the beginning, setting up someone else as the ""savior"" of humanity. Add on that this is like the sixth timeline (counting The Sarah Connor Chronicles) and its too much. Not only was that not needed but it exposes the franchise for what it is...not needed. It's been reworked, and rebooted so many times it's just unnecessary. And maybe with the world in its current state, Dark Fates need to take a rest for awhile. I do really like Linda Hamilton and the character of Grace in this (though Grace feels a bit ripped off of Worthington's character from Salvation).Best One Liner:

The story is so simple and cheap to an extreme level. Also what worst than that are the scenes, the majority of scenes were just a pure ripoff the first two movies.
Most of the actors were pretty bad and did not fit in except Arnold and Linda.
There were three questions that came up on my mind while watching this. Is this a remake, a follow up or a joke? Because it was non of that. This movies should not have existed.One more thing do I dare say that ""woman power"" was the focus in this movie. It was more obvious than sun in the sky. But its been the focus of 90% of Hollywood movies for the last couple of years. I was not surprised at all by this one.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2038,MrFilmJunkie,"A small step forward, but still miles away from a satisfying continuation of the Terminator franchise",4,30 October 2019,"'Dark Fate' sets off to replace 'Rise of the Machines' as the franchise's new third movie and direct sequel to James Cameron's masterpiece 'T2: Judgement Day'. It avoids some of the mistakes of the previous three installments, most notably by sticking to the original cast for the established characters, including Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor. It also returns to a darker, more serious tone than the previous movie. But that's where the good aspects end. It's an uninspired, poorly written film that mostly recycles ideas from all the other terminator movies.
First of all, you never really feel emotionally invested in the characters, as they don't get much depth or personality. All characters in this movie are just plot tools: There's Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) who's your typical damsel in distress. Her brother Diego (Boneta), who's just cannon fodder for the antagonist. Dani's protector from the future, Grace (Mackenzie Davis), is basically Kyle Reese from the first Terminator film, but without the tragic expressiveness and devotion of Micheal Biehn's character. And now that we already have a protector for Dani, you might wonder why we need two more protectors in the form of Sarah Connor and Arnold's character. Well, they act as nothing more than fan service, providing pithy one liners and comic relief. Even though it's always fun to watch Arnold and Linda on screen - ultimately, they're irrelevant to this story. Diego Luna as the antagonist robot model Rev-9 is worlds apart from the menacing aura of Robert Patrick's T-1000 in T2. Even Kristanna Loken as TX in 'Rise of the Machines' had a more threatening appearance. The Rev-9's ""super power"" is that in can split into two. But instead of splitting into two liquid metal terminators, it splits into a liquid metal figure and a solid metal endoskeleton for some reason (probably just because endoskeletons look cool in the trailers).
Narratively, the movie goes along a predictable path, leaving a lot of dramatic potential unused. It hardly creates any thrilling or suspenseful moments. Just like the previous three sequels, Tim Miller and his team of writers seem to have forgotten that the original Terminator movies were not just mere action flicks, but essentially also horror thrillers.
'Dark Fate' doesn't satisfy in the sci-fi department either. As the plot moves on, it becomes clear that the time travel ""logic"" in this movie is a complete mess and doesn't even try to make any sense. Also be warned about what hilariocity the writers came up with to justify the role of Arnold's character.
So is it at least a good action flick? Not really. The action sequences lack the craftmanship not only of James Cameron's works, as a matter of fact, nothing in 'Dark Fate' even comes close to the crane chase sequence in 'Rise of the Machines'. Miller's action is choreographed and edited mostly too fast and confusing (and furthermore suffers from the picture's murkiness, especially in the third act, which is set at night). With the exception of a truly stunning de-aging fx scene in the beginning of the movie, the VFX are poorly executed - some of the CGI can't even withstand today's TV standards. There are no surprising visual moments apart from what you've already seen in the trailers. Junkie XL's score is unobtrusive and serviceable, but also a bit generic, relying too much on conventional orchestra sounds, thus leaving you lingering after the intensity and gritty sound textures of Brad Fiedel's masterful score for T2.
In the end, 'Dark Fate' also tries hard to push a gender equality message (Zeitgeist, you know?), but the way it is presented here, feels so forced and unbelievable that even feminists may raise their eyebrows.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2039,gjcomics1,The Main character takes a backseat to the white saviors,6,26 October 2019,"I cant believe it but they really went hard political with this movie, pushing the anti-immigration topic super hard into your face. The first ten minutes of the movie are all in spanish. It really makes you think The mexican girl will be important. But shes not. She basically takes a back seat while the white characters do all the thinking and talking for her.
The rules of this new mexican terminator are never really explained. He apparently has a skeleton with detachable skin, and both can fight separately. Is he more vulnerable when the skin separates from the skeleton. Are both the skeleton and the skin autonomous? Is there a ""Brain"" inside the skeleton, and a ""brain"" inside the skin, acting independently? Its never explained.
Grace, the white lady, is really only there for eye candy. And the obligatory self sacrifice that has become a hallmark of every terminator ending after T2.
Arnie was the best thing about this movie, though the movie mishandles him a bit too. They want arnie to be both the comedic relief and the emotional heart of the movie all in one, but Its pretty much impossible to be both simultaneously. John Connor helped bring emotional heart to T2, but his character is murdered inexplicably in the first few moments of this new terminator flick, so there goes that.
Linda Hamilton's character seems exactly the same as the last time we saw her; victory in T2, and the passage of time has done nothing to change her. Kind of sad, really. You would hope she'd finally settle down and get a husband or something, open a Terminator Themed Miniature Golf course and retire or something.
The final outcome is really never unexpected. Its almost identical to the ending of T2. I think the only reason Arnie didnt throw up a thumbs-up this time was because his arm got ripped off.

Its not a terrible movie, the action sequences are well shot, well edited, the concept fpr the villain terminator being a dual entity its kind of cool and all.

Sure, the earlier movies used this trope but there was always a well handled plot device and good actor performance to trick us in bellieving this is not a traditional boogey man, Robert Patrick was scary and cunning as the t-1000 in T2, Luna is a bland, generic nobody with a lumberjack shirt who wants to kill, If we remember the plot from T2, The T-1000 motivations are hidden for a good 20 minutes as we think he is our savior and Arnold is reprising the baddie like in the first film, here we know instantly who is good and who is bad, so. bad direction and storytelling here!The heroes and their motivations come foward as paper thin, the script is rushed and all over the place, there are a few characters only in the movie to get the characters from A to B. The loss of a central character in the terminator franchise is a gratuitous device just to try and ""subvert our expectations"", yet feeding us the same junk all over again.,,
The diabetic augmented human is a cool character but like the others its diluted and in the overall plot lacks development or charisma to handle the role, and why not sending a regular human to protect our character instead of a augmented human cyborg who can only handle intense fighting for brief moments before collapsing and becoming a risk for the mission?Linda Hamilton and Arnold have a good chemistry but this is not their story, they are relegated to side characters like in those new Star Wars movies just so you see those relatable faces in the posters. Are you telling me the terminator had a wife and an adoptive kid for 20 plus years and the family never noticed he is a machine? I guess this was the movie i never knew i wanted to see, not Dark fate, who is a 5th generation copy of a classic movie.Its just that, another remake of T2, where all the tropes are in place, you might replace JC with DR, Skynet with Legion, you might even give as a different gender on the protector from the future, but this is the same tired movie over, and over, and over, and over again. Now, greenlight the movie about Carl the terminator and his marriage and i will rethink this Dark Fate on the Terminator franchise. Just ditch the franchise, i can´t believe James Cameron is producing this trash, at least Genisys was so bad it became entertaining, this one is just a Dark Fate in a beaten dead horse.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2046,hansi555,Why are people really SO disappointed? It is a GREAT movie,8,3 November 2019,"You could argue that the plot is something we have seen before: One terminator emerges and soon a guardian angel does so too - and the chase/fighting is on.But there is a little more to this story this time and the sorroundings have changed to Mexico for the first half or so of the movie. After the initial fighting and presenting of the characters the story and great action scenes unfold and we finally meet Arnold who adds a very good performance and twist to the story.From here on the action speeds up towards the big final. The scenes inside a crashing C5 Galaxy and on to a water power station are really well made.Some viewers are not so happy with 3 female leads at the same time, but I think it adds a new touch to the franchise and btw these females are bad-ass anyway - there are NO love scenes etc.The plot is simple - as it normally will be i Terminator movie - but there is just a little more spice in this one: Arnold is still around doing what? Sarah Connor also still there doing what? And the guardian angel is a new hybrid.And both my daugthers (17 and 14) cried at the ending so it is not just their Terminator loving, stupid dad who ""forced"" them to see this movie.DONT TRUST THE HATERS",Terminator - Dark Fate

I found myself shaking my head on a number of occasions as I've seen and heard it all before.Like the Skynet computer was changed to AI computer called Legion. Gabriel Luna as the Terminator reminded me so much of Robert Patrick as the Terminator.There are plot holes everywhere which were never explained like how can you have an ageing Terminator.In the age we now live in I wasn't surprised by the story of a young female girl who save humanity from the dreaded AI computer, and basically two female protectors(one sent back from the future) to stop her from being killed(all that sounds very familiar) and they both seem to spend most of the movie either beating up men in uniform or the male terminator.I really hope this is the last Terminator they make as for me I'm done with the franchise as any other movies will basically be a money grab by the studios.It's certainly not in the League of the first two Terminator movies but better then the 3 that followed it.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2055,gotcha_013,"I liked it. A bit of nonsense, far from boring.",7,6 November 2019,"I don't see the point in complaining. These movies haven't really been original since after the second movie. Like what more can you do? First movie they sent a robot and a human. Second movie they sent 2 robots, one good one bad. From there nothing is new. I see a lot of people mentioning John, as if he is a well developed character. He is important sure, because he's ""supposed"" to be, but the audience doesn't know him. In the first movie didn't exist (no development ) second movie he's a kid, he doesn't do anything... he's just a kid. You learn a bit about him, but there is never that moment of ""oh! John Connor is the hero of the story"". Even by the 3rd film you still know nothing, John has been in hiding, not even running, just hiding. He remains undeveloped. By terminator salvation, the world already went to hell, but are still never shown how is got there. So John, a character with no experience fighting, or evening interacting with other people, is supposed to be the person that I am to believe is going to lead humanities survival...? I don't buy it.!!!Spoilers!!!!Yeah John dies at the start of ""dark fate"". So what?... it's a time travel movie, which means all of the events are in constant state of possible change. The first two movies work well because of Sarah, not John. You relate to her struggle. Trying to survive the first movie to protect a son she has no plans of having, and changing from a weak scared person to eventually saving her own life against something that was ""unstoppable"". By the second movie it's still about Sarah and her fear of loosing her son while she can't be physically there to keep him safe and eventually facing the very thing that tried to kill her 13 years prior. Its intense, it's sad, and terrifying. There is no logical way to question it, just on the basis of time travel isn't a real thing. They can tell a million stories that all overlap or seem to not be affected by the events of previous movies. Some may have connection, small plot threads and characters, but none of them are anything you didn't already know or could have reasonably assumed. Terminator couldn't stop John being born, so it sets up the second movie with the still looming threat of judgment day. The terminator fails again to kill john, which stops ""judgement day"" but doesn't change the world from being over run by machines. All that changes is when it happens, not that it happens. I liked the newest movie. It was well cast, MacKenzie Davis and Gabriel Luna are believably bad ass. Having Sarah involved stilled should only show you how f*ed up the flow of time is. Her and ""Carl"" remember a future that no longer comes to pass. Watch this form the action. You already know the story, it's been the same since T2.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2057,thachnam_nguyen,Lackluster story and acting,2,3 April 2020,"I will not spoil the storyline, but if you see the past 5 films, you can see it offers nothing original. However, this is the least of my concerns.
Here is what the movie did good:
1. CGI for Sarah and John Connor for the first 15 second
2. Having Sarah Connor back- you can still see the spark in her eyes, despite of her age.. she is still in pretty good shape.
3. Arnold is the one and only terminator- that is his role to keep.
This all accounts for only 5% of the movie- but I gave it 2 star because of respect for the (2) actors.The rest range from lackluster to awful:
1. Storyline ( first 5mn) : awful
2. Storyline after that: lackluster
3. Danni: aweful.... her acting is cringe worthy at best, with an exception of few rare... rare occasions
4. All the political messages... all missing is an endorsement and a running campaignAnyway, you will not loose anything not watching this movie. If you adore the old cast, support them by watching the old versions.",Terminator - Dark Fate

This is definetly not a 1/10 movie, I would rate it a 7/10, while T1 is 9/10 and t2 is a 9.5/10 for me :)
I really liked the first half of it, it's intense and action packed. but later on the action scenes are becoming too ridiculous and too much CGI, it almost looks like a video game at points.
The plot is nothing original, same old same old, but the new terminator looks cool, and also Grace is a very interesting character.
The score could have been much better IMO, Brad Fidel did a much better job with T1 and T2.
So like I said in the beginning, don't trust all the haters, you could go and see the movie for yourself.",Terminator - Dark Fate

However going into this, knowing it was gonna do an alternative timeline from T2 and be it's own thing disconnected from T3-5. I was both perplexed at the start and satisfied at the end by where they went. Felt like I could see the influences from the other 5 movies here. It's a Terminator movie people. Future AI goes bad, humans fight back, time travel to stop humans fighting back. Didn't mind them going through that basic setup of T2 again. Really enjoyed all of the characters, their interactions and the threat still felt challenging enough. Didn't have a problem with the actions or CGI and I hope they make a T7 (alt timeline T4) I'd definitely add this to my collection and want to watch it again, unlike T4 & T5.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2063,jonnyboy676,What did I just watch.,1,14 January 2020,If you want to destroy a franchise then they have certainly done that. This was toothache to watch. An absolute mess of a plot & the acting was worse than a daytime soap. Don't waist your time with this & stick with the good memories of the 1st 2..

2064,ikelclan,A solid return of the T series,8,1 November 2019,"It's too bad the people that are posting negative reviews are also putting so many spoilers in their reviews because I thought there were some good surprises in this movie. This was actually a good continuation of the story that reopens the questions: How much of our fate can be changed and how much is predetermined?For the haters saying this movie makes T1 and T2 pointless...no it doesn't. It takes the story in a new direction, and for me it was a welcome one because the other storyline was fully played out. And it also is still valid in another timeline.It's obvious though that most (maybe all) of the negative reviews are being posted by people with a certain very traditional and old fashioned political viewpoint. Whatever.If you're not happy with women being given lead roles in action movies, you won't like this movie. If you just want a solidly entertaining action movie along the lines of T1 and T2, this is a worthy entry.It's ironic that so many he-man woman haters are posting bad reviews here, since James Cameron has been very consistent in creating strong female characters.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2065,eabartel,unexpectedly loved it,10,11 November 2019,"We watched the first two films to prepare and then saw Dark Fate the next day. It was brilliant! After the shock twist intro, the movie moves into an amazing chase/fight sequence that shows off the new terminator and Grace, an augmented human. It's a great reminder of the most exciting elements of cinema and the franchise, right up there with the best of T2. The movie is solidly acted from an excellent script that a) actually makes sense, and b) was surprisingly charming and funny.

Where it lacks is story and continuity. It is not a sequel to T2 we all wanted, but yet another re-telling of the same story.
Bringing back Linda and Arnold helps soften the coldness every other Terminator sequel since the T2 had, but, unfortunately, they don't feel like the same characters from T2, at least I didn't see Sarah Connor (and I love Linda Hamilton).

I think Mackenzie and Natalia did a great job, but I was REALLY hoping someone would put a bullet in Linda Hamilton's brain and early on. I am SOO sick of her whimpering, ""But I'm Sarah Connor and saved 14 billion people"", to which everyone seems to reply. ""WHO?""
In a series that runs for awhile, story line and plot take a backseat to explosions, mayhem and any kind of action that the Wunderkinds can come up with. I hope they they will quietly let the series die while people still have a fond memory of how good it was.",Terminator - Dark Fate

No Spoilers!It was a good movie, full of action and CGI. Yep they still did not learn the lesson of crap CGI.1. The reason T2 and Interstellar were good movies, had to do in part with the amount of props that they used. Why so much CGI?2. In T2 they panned more on the terminator itself, this caused the audience to have a sense of fear . In Dark Fate they rushed on these shots since everything was CGI. They focused on the story and action and not on the elements as they should have. This was the biggest fail that has happen in all the other terminator movies3. The music was not on par with the movie. Maybe use Hans Zimmer next time. The music did not flow with the movie at all, the music makes a huge impact.4. Maybe it is time to use Christopher Nolan as a director on the next one. He seems to know what he is doing.In any case I have to say that it was better than most, but far from where it should have been.Here is my scale and trust me I put a lot of thought into it.Best - 100%

Dark Fate - 65%
T1 - 60% (Do to limitation of the time)

2075,jsmith-marvelous,Doesn't understand what made Terminator an iconic franchise.,5,9 February 2020,"Like the other ""third Terminator movie"" sequels before it (including Rise of the Machines, Salvation, and Genisys), this movie sets out to be ""the real sequel to Terminator 2: Judgment Day"". But also like those other sequels, this movie fails to understand what made the first two films special.The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day had their share of pulse-pounding action sequences, but they were (mostly) grounded in reality and had longer moments of ""quiet time"" to establish character motivations and to build an arc for those characters to give them some growth. Characters also had to find ways to take down their futuristic foes using the technology available to them in the time period they're confined to - especially with limited resources and a society that's never heard of the Terminators, Skynet, or anything that put our heroes in peril, making everyday citizens part of the problem when trying to face down an unstoppable machine with only one goal in mind.In the case of the Terminator sequels that came afterward, the more realistic action sequences went straight out the window, along with those character growth moments. With ""Terminator: Dark Fate"" especially, it seems as if the producers and director only aim to keep audiences from getting bored, shoving action setpieces in your face one-after-another in a bid to always have action happening on-screen. In one particular sequence, the Terminator shows up at a military base to chase the heroes, who escape in a plane - but in the same sequence, abandon the plane once it's discovered that the Terminator is onboard. They abandon the plane by driving an SUV out of the cargo bay of the plane, parachuting the vehicle into the waters of a dam on the ground. They then fight their way out of the water into the dam, where they fight the Terminator once again. There are scant moments of things happening that aren't action during this long sequence of events, making the parts of the movie which should be anticipated the main course of the movie itself, which is exhausting. On top of that, the action sequences seem silly and cartoonish, compared to the first two entries' encounters with the Terminators.Dark Fate also makes an attempt to move away from the Connors' storyline within the franchise - not by any meaningful storytelling devices, but by pulling an ""Alien 3"" and unceremoniously killing off John Connor in the opening five minutes, establishing a new character as the leader of the resistance outright.While this movie is better than the other sequels that came before it, it's still a laughably bad attempt at putting together a competent story. The story of the Terminator should be less about big-budget action and more about the humans at the heart of the conflict: what does it mean to be human, and what makes us different from the artificial entities we create?",Terminator - Dark Fate
2076,mgyukeri,"Starts out fun and entertaining, then, uh...",6,20 October 2020,"Watching the first act I was ready to call this the most enjoyable film in the franchise since T2 - a breath of fresh air considering the mess that was Genisys and the deluge of dark and gritty digital set pieces of Salvation - but each half hour gets progressively worse and increasingly nonsensical, crescendoing into an absolute mess.Reminds me of the Blumhouse Halloween reboot as far as the reintroduction of Sarah Connor is concerned, but it really didn't have the same understanding of what made its source material so compelling.Despite the lead human character being a bit of a paint by numbers girlboss, and the fact that her motivations in the film depend on the two dimensional family characters the film parades around for all of five seconds before quickly becoming terminator fodder, Mackenzie Davis was fantastic in a supporting role. Best ""good terminator"" since Summer Glau and Shirley Manson in TSCC.

2079,TheDude83,Should never have been made,1,27 October 2019,"Well. I think apologies have to be made towards Rise of the Machines. Compared to this it's an absolute gem of a movie. I actually had to re watch it to cleanse myself of Dark Fate. And boy, after a few years away from it I would be happy to pay to see it in the cinema again!Some may laugh but look back at it; it actually ages really well! The story holds up, action is spot on with great practical and cgi effects (when needed). The score itself is great throughout and helps build tension at times. I think people focused on a couple of silly things like the Elton John glasses and ""talk to the hand"". But that's nothing when compared to him being a god damn curtain salesman named Carl. Ugh!The dynamic between Catherine Brewster and John is nice and Arnie is his T800 self again. Arnie even paid a million bucks towards part of the crane sequence because he knew himself it'd be awesome on screen. And he was right. Plus the revelation of the terminator killing John then being sent back to save him...to almost kill him again...is brilliant and could've lead in to a great follow up in the future war with the bleak ending.Everything about T3 is what a terminator film should be in comparison to the unoriginal, PC and gender agenda pushing mess that Dark Fate turned out to be. The story, score and action are quite easily forgettable. And don't get me started on the first few minutes of the film, truly a kick in the teeth for the first two films and I fully judge Arnie and Linda for accepting this rubbish. They musta got paid mega bucks to entertain this script.Overall I gave it a 1/10 for sheer insult to intelligence.

2083,agapahava,Unfairly Underrated,8,25 February 2020,"As a fan of the original two films, I rented this with low expectations. The user reviews made it sound like an absolute disaster, beginning with the death of John. I disagree. It's still not anywhere near the level of T1 or T2, but it's vastly superior to the other films and is the first since the originals that really feels like a Terminator film. While it would've been cool to see Edward Furlong reprising his role, his death gives Sarah an appropriate arc and ultimately was the correct choice, especially considering Furlong has retired from acting and isn't exactly a ""movie star"" these days.
The action is high paced and exciting, the characters are well developed and we care about them. Linda Hamilton is pitch perfect and steals her scenes. At first it was jarring to see Arnold as a regular guy, but he's actually hilarious and there's something really touching about his attempts at humanity. Some complained about that but it's a reasonable arc considering we saw a T101 show humanity towards John in T2 as well.
Other complaints I've read were about it being ""woke"" and ""feminist"", but T2 already established Sarah as the baddest b*tch of the 90s so that's an unfair criticism in my opinion.
This is the first film since the originals that had me grinning and pumping my fists at the nostalgic moments. Definitely worth a watch if you're a fan of the originals--it's not perfect (it's not directed by James Cameron so we should've expected that), but it's definitely close to the Terminator sequel we've all been hoping for.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2088,p-m_music,An honest review,7,6 November 2019,"Terminator: Dark Fate review
Nov 6, 2019What a ride! That was pure joy, nostalgia and a worthy sequel to the highly anticipated film of all time. I watched it and until the last second it held me on my seat. Of course, as everyone hated or disliked the film for many points, I endorse the bravery and creative team behind it and I will discuss every single of them separately, ensuring that my review covers the film properly.1. The Story
Allow me to start this with a little story:
Every movie has a ground (or if you prefer, universe) that has certain rules. With the first Terminator, that ground was built and it was solid enough for story, action and certain elements that trademarked the Terminator.
So the sequel followed the same rules and under the same elements; that's why it was a solid and proper sequel because it has a ground.
Third installment didn't had any grounds or rules. In fact, if you look at the film and forget any Terminator films exist, it will be fun but without any proper story and rules.
Salvation tried to make a new world in the future world but the problem is...well, you have no rules or grounds to build upon it and that makes the entire film collapse; no matter how good you make it.
On the Genysis, things was a bit better. With a nod to the nostalgia and a good look back at beginning it was a good promise, which was half baked and the good idea was destroyed fast...why? Because even nostalgia needs grounds, rules and elements to follow.
And now, Dark Fate:
With a very nostalgic logos and an amazing and awesome opening scene, from the first moment I was captured and my breath was took away. I was encountered with an element and a ground to the film which was set on a rule: start with maschines and future, Sarah connor and Terminator, a mission... Here you can say you're in a solid world which follows the structures properly.
Here's my take:
After T2, every film has a good idea that contributtes to the story of Dark Fate. T3 dropped the idea that Terminator killed John Connor ""I killed you"". Salvation brought the ""human cyborg"" and Genysis proposed the idea of ""No John Connor"" and ""Father Figure Terminator"".
Combining these ideas and adding them to the ground of James Cameron makes sense. Each of these ideas contributed to the story.
And I must say, the first scene was absolutely gorgeous and well rendered, while shocking. This moment everyone gasped and couldn't blink...
Then followed by a fast paced action and amazing adrenaline rush, plus the common elements of Terminator series (car chase and truck, ""come to live"", etc).
The great twists and a well balanced story was at the core of this film and apart from a couple of moments (which were funny) I didn't see anything wrong.
Speaking of which, funny is the word that never worked in Terminator world. This ia a very violent and dark film and jokes, small talks and humor takes away the sense of danger and destruction. I assume maybe Tim Miller's Deadpool style has to be showed, but I think this was unnecessary. Take them away and it's well balanced.2. Characters
The best part of seeing the trailer was the return of the amazing Linda Hamilton to the film and Arnold to the mix. This is the proper formula of Terminator and that drags me to the theater.
New characters are good at their task and apparently, the villain talks more than any other villain which in a way is good, and it's bad in another.
First, we can see that advanced machine learning and finally seeing a villain can talk. But it's a cliche and (again) Deadpool way of enemy talks to the targets and hero to surrender is just funny and not necessary.
What I enjoyed was the clash of two generations: Sarah Connor is the past and T800 from her future, and now Danielle is the present and Grace is the future. Symbolically I love the idea.
One thing to say, yes this movie is strongly feminine and it finally breaks the barrier of ""just men"" in the series.
As Blade Runner 2049 introduced the theme of ""future is women"" and Terminator is following. (#metoo movement?)3. Action
This is what isn't missing but it's comicly shown: we have a ton of action scenes but all of them (except the first fight scene in the factory) seemed out of place. We are seeing fights like Deadpool (again) and Marvel type of action. It's fun but it's predictable and seems fake. One iteration which I didn't lime was the airplane fight.
But the big elephant in the screen was the extendes use of visual effects.
I mean I am a fan of it but doing it all the time with no brains makes no sense to me. T2 has a good amount of practical effect and followed my minimal and sophisticated VFX that was balanced. This film rarely relies on practical effects and even the explosions seem like VFX which makes it dull and meaningless.Conclusion
Terminator: Dark Fate is a successful storytelling film and a fun film to watch when doing a marathon after Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. It easily blends in with a good story continuity and fine casting. But where it hurts lies in the comic-based action sequences and overused VFX that takes away the excitement.
I enjoyed the film as a Tuesday night out. It certainly got my attention and my curiosity.7/10",Terminator - Dark Fate
2089,clint-poelmans-577-69005,No... just no. Last time they fool me with a Terminator branded product.,1,13 April 2020,"I should have read some reviews on here before spending money on renting this.

What a mess...",Terminator - Dark Fate
2090,michele-casamassa,After I was watching reviews. Go watch for yourself!,8,11 November 2019,Been watching a lot of reviews for this and when I heard it. I was angry and nodding in agreement with them. But I still had to watch it to confirm for myself if the decisions they made really did ruin t1-2 lore. Yea they could have just done the safe bet and done what the hardcore purist fans wanted. I myself think am one of them. But after watching I think it's still a great movie. And one logical step of taking the franchise. Hopefully they do complete this new trilogy but with the bad sales and reviews I'd doubt it. So many possabilities. Like hopefully seeing the future war. And even do what a comic did where the humans and terminators join forces to take out a weapon skynet made and ending in a cold war between the races. But in this case legion instead. Yea they could have kept the character alive and cut a scene. But overall it was. Good. But also was just another same old terminator movie of protecting someone. Which I can understand the fatigue. Overall though 8/10 from me!,Terminator - Dark Fate
2091,Max_du_Nord,Another remake of T1/T2 that nobody wants or asked for,2,1 November 2019,"Another remake of T1/T2 that nobody wants or asked for. It lacks creativity and imagination. Its plot is dull and full of nonsense. This franchise should have ended with T2 followed perhaps by a kind of prequel/sequel leading to T1.
But the worst thing in this is Cameron's hypocrisy. Do you remember him bragging around about how Fincher killed his beloved characters in Alien 3. Well be ready for the same in the Dark Fate and now it's done and approved by king of the world himself.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2093,gafjonesy-637-36384,Some perspective,6,18 October 2020,"I have been a movie fan all my life so I have seen good, bad, amazing and atrocious. People ""reviewing"" films like this giving it 1 star have no business being on this site. You are not film fans you are petty childish idiots who can barely string together coherent sentences. I have been to the cinema to see each of the terminators(apart from the first one I was too young). Do they all vary in quality? Absolutely. Do any of them deserve a 1 star review? Absolutely not. I get if you are a high brow art house film lover how these type of films shouldn't appeal to you. They aren't meant to. They are cheesy action driven movies. End of. So called fans complaining about changing time lines, running the first two incoherent plots blah blah blah(the first has plenty of that on its own). They tried to take it in a new direction. It is far grittier than the 3rd, 4th and 5th instalments. It makes each of those films redundant to be fair. Did we really need another movie about machines trying to kill John Connor? I don't think so. So I have no major issue with that. They took a swing at a new direction and a new ""future"" (much the same as star trek did). This triggered some so called fans to call it all kinds of names and give it 1 star reviews. Childish and pathetic. Bottom line is the film is OK. Its not brilliant. It does have some good action sequences and I quite like the constant hunting element which was very reminiscent of the first two. If you are a fan of the franchise you can be aghast and say you will never watch another terminator film ever again.....but let's face it you probably will. Will they ever make another one as good as t2? No. Most definitely not. Watch it with appropriate expectations and you will see its not all bad. Its not Shakespeare in the park either.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2094,the_real_phantom,"Either bring back ""Sarah Connor Chronicles"" in movie form or just kill it off...",2,4 November 2019,"I used to be a HUGE fan of this franchise being T1 -T3...but for me it died with the cancellation of Sarah Connor Chronicles.SCC was a great show with interesting characters that ended with the ultimate time travel cliff hanger....so they could dish up ""Salvation"" which did its best to ruin the franchise by getting rid of time travel (an essential ingredient) and adding the half human/cyborg Sam Worthington character (yawn).Then we got ""Genisys"". Surely it couldn't get much worse after not only killing Jon Connor the saviour of mankind but making him a baddie complete with really poor CGI. Altho it did have some novelty value, such as the recreation of the opening scenes of T1, and the likeable addition of Daenerys as the new Sarah Connor.What we get with Dark Fate just seems to be a cobbled together mash of the worse bits of Salvation (cyborg/human that no one really cares about) & Genisys (the aged Arnie Terminator hokum).
The movie also seemed to want to allude to some very vague anti Trump/wall/immigration theme but got too scared and then forgot what it wanted to say.
The action scenes are very poor, the CGI worse and the new Terminator had stupid future tech that didn't really make sense.
Arnie and Linda no doubt were just happy to get paid, the latter looking like a dead ringer for Lee Lin Chin these days. Both characters were bland, boring and bordering on pointless.
I thought MacKenzie Davis did OK but her character was just really uninteresting. Gabriel Luna was good. I really liked Natalie Reyes' performance an actress I haven't seen before. She seems very talented and is the highlight of the film.
Finally as if any more proof was needed - James Cameron is just a washed up hack and this effort was about as entertaining and thought through as his pseudo historical documentaries about Atlantis and (fake) biblical archaeology.Just how many times are they going to try and reboot this franchise?Tip: Either resurrect Sarah Connor Chronicles in movie form NOW while all the actors are young enough to reprise their roles....or just let it go, as each successive sequel just devalues the whole Terminator legacy.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2096,john-693-570559,Great brainless entertainment,7,3 November 2019,I've read and appreciate all the critique. Maybe it helped a lot that I went in with very very low expectations. I have seen the previous movies but the legacy of them has not stuck with me so once things they changed from the legacy movies did not bother me that much. If you don't care that much about the past legacy of the old terminator and you just want a extremely enjoyable over the top action movie you are in for a fun ridiculous ride. So ridiculous that it is entertaining. I think it's worthy of a 6.5 for brainless stupid entertainment value. And sometimes that's just what you want.,Terminator - Dark Fate

I really enjoyed the call back to T2, I think if they found a way to bring back Eddy Furlong into a true meaty role this movie could have been so much better, having Linda Hamilton back for the ride brought some nostalgia to the series.

2101,Bsandergaard,Leave THe First Five Minutes of This Film!,7,2 November 2019,"This is definitely the best sequel since T2, but it has many issues. The film has a nice pace and the action scenes are well choreographed. Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger are the best parts in terms of characters. Mackenzie Davis is pretty good and the evil terminator is menacing in his role. The hope of the future ""Dani"" is super fricking annoying and probably is the worst character in the film. The writing of the film isn't as sharp as Tim Miller's other films, a lot of the jokes feel forced or overdone. The cinematography and directing isn't too bad. The CGI is good at some points and bad at other points. The de-aging of characters in the first scene is good at points and bad at points. The film is definitely the best sequel since Judgement Day, but it has many flaws.I recommend any fans of the franchise to watch this film.

2107,timmons00,T1 and T2 reimagined,7,19 October 2020,"Judged on its own merits, this is a pretty good action movie. Judged in the context of the Terminator franchise, it's still above average. Terminator: Dark Fate is more of a re-imagining of the first two movies than an actual sequel. The pacing is good and the action sequences are bombastic enough. Dialogue and acting are forgettable but what were you expecting? The movie's main weakness is, of course, that we have seen so much of it before. There are almost no surprises to be had, just some minor changes to the lore which probably won't survive into the next iteration of the franchise. The villain is also somehow less terrifying than either of the Terminators in the first two movies. Despite that, it's still a fine over-the-top sci-fi action movie if that's what you're in the mood for.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2108,hotlinekick,Girl Power!...?,4,3 November 2019,"This film isn't terrible but it isn't good either. The main problem is that it caters to the politically correct ilk, especially the rabid feminists:Job 1 is to kill off John Connor because we can't have a white male savior of humanity, no way! Not in today's twisted, woke, perpetually-offended clown world. Young John is remorselessly sacked and unpersoned just like offenders of the state in Orwell's 1984.Job 2 is to bring in a new savior of humanity; a minority female of course. But unlike Sarah Connor, she isn't to be the mother of the savior, hell no, SHE is the savior! Not through a future son but all by herself! By becoming such a strong female role model that without her the human survivors would never even think to form a cohesive resistance! This is not a joke - who wrote this garbage...Job 3 is to bring in a new protector from the future; an androgynous enhanced female soldier named Grace, who after materializing naked opts to steal the clothes from a passerby MALE instead of a female. Score some points for making the male look stupid...Job 4 is to bring back Linda Hamilton so they can promptly kill off the protagonist's brother and get on with a female-only cast for the next bulk portion of the movie.This movie had some great effects and lots of engrossing action sequences, and the new terminator can split apart to become two menacing entities, which is pretty cool. It also had some laughs with Arnie's character so I'm giving it a 4 out of 10 for these reasons, but it could have been MUCH better if it had focused on great storytelling rather than intersectional brow-beating.I read through at least a hundred of the reviews here and page after page details complaints about woke politics being jammed down our throats in our movies nowadays. Not one reviewer had a problem with a strong female lead - Sarah Connor - in the original two Terminator movies. These reviews are not misogynistic, they're just trying to send an honest message to Hollywood: shove your woke, man-hating political-correctness and stop brow-beating us with these movies and GIVE US GOOD STORIES INSTEAD",Terminator - Dark Fate

2110,poveyb,Some stories are better left alone,1,1 November 2019,"Sadly, the only good thing in this film was the performance of Gabriel Luna.
I especially enjoyed when they didn't tell Dani, that she is the leader of the resistance, just so that the viewer don't know it. Maybe they hoped that this wil magically create suspense in a hollow story without a beginning or an end.
It didn't work!
When you write the next one, please watch Terminator 2: Judgement day. There we knew who John is right from the start, and it's still one of the best movies of all time.

2113,lucalanzingher,Good action movie,7,10 November 2019,"I watched it with low expectations, because of the really bad reviews.. in i liked it.
The cgi is good, the actions scenes quite good.
Hamilton and Schwarzenegger believable in the actions scenes even if old. Old but really fit! Arnie was believable as an old t800.
The enemy -ok an updated copy and paste of the already seen t-x- quite menacing.
Grace was really a good idea: in a future war against machines it's believable humans get upgraded to fight the cyborgs. And the actress is good, i already liked her in that wonderful black mirror episode, San Junipero. Nice to see her herr so strong!
The story: criticized by everybody, i liked it: not too complicated or involuted like Genysis, it's quite linear and coherent: once the menace of skynet is archiviated, the menace of something similar (Legion) is believable: after all mankind ist still evolving the technology, if Cyberdine doesn't develop an AI like skynet anymore because the company exploded in the 2nd movie, it's anyway probable that an opponent company does something similar, realizing another self-conscious AI in another future.. it would be strange the contrary!! So the new storylime with Legion, Grace and the rev 9 is believable. And not too complicated to understand.
What i didn't like: t800 with a family?!? C'mon... But also this element is the coherent continuation of t800 saying, at the end of t2, that he could understand why they cry after few days with the humans... Also a t800 after many years could develop such a desire to get a family.. but pretending that a cyborg has a wife and a son not realizing that he is jot human.. absurd! As i said: the movie isa good chase movie, not very original but well done and not too complicated.
And: they have now created the premisses of a storyline for new movies, with the purpose of avoiding the future war against Legion.. with this, they could make new terminator movies without Arnie.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I probably wouldn't have bothered seeing this if he wasn't in it so I left wishing he had more time in this movie. Adding in another guy for balance would have helped as well not to mention the other problems people have pointed out.I'm not feeling sorry for Hollywood losing money over movies.

Jason Clarke and the awful laughs as John Conner wtf?
The whole movie copy from T1 and just worse.Now Dark fate I really had hopes they fixed everything because of James Cameron.So right away they Kill John Conner???
How?
Of course another Terminator was sent so T2 was complete waste...
Wtf?
To be replaced by a political correct Mexican Female with 0 character development wtf?Sarah Conner is very good throughout the whole movie a positive thing at least.
Arnold is good what he had to work with.
But he started to create a conscientious after he just killed John Conner?
No explanation how this could happen?
No reset of his CPU or anything?
So all terminators after they complete their mission and kill the target they start develop a continence?
Really poor scripting.
The next he was living in a family with a wife that had a child?
So the mom lived with a man without sex or knowing he was a robot wtf?
There was a dog also that did not bark? again a wtf to t1 t2The bad terminator was ok at least.Then the good guy they send back Mackenzie Davis or is it a woman?

Gabriel Luna as the deadly Rev-9 terminator was just as chilling as Robert Patrick's T-1000 although Patrick was more fluid in his transitions. And Linda Hamilton, wow. I found her utterly annoying in The Terminator, more believable in T2, but here I could not help but cheer when she appeared. From the first shot of her foot, the whole energy was about to change, stuff was about to go down. Mackenzie played up well as a younger, badder, less sensitive, version of Sarah Connor but the original was a knockout punch. Arnold had his funny moments but I'm glad that he was not the focus of this movie. His character stepped aside for the new generation graciously. Anyhow, as all movies I ignore the critics picking apart ridiculous meaningless item, forget the naysayers trying to knock this down, and just enjoyed seeing one of my favorite franchises revived.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2122,MegaChaosGelee,Decent but derivative continuation,6,24 October 2019,"A solid flick. Way better than Genisys (which wasn't hard to accomplish), but still miles away from the class of the first two movies. Mainly because many things in it felt so derivative, since we've seen similar characters, environments, and situations multiple times before.They are changing up the backstory with a big twist that happens right in the first few minutes. I'm still not sure how to feel about this, because on the one hand, it broadens the universe up a bit and leaves the door open for more, but on the other hand, it's definitively leaving behind some well developed previous lore and accomplishments of the other movies. This new Terminator future is at least requiring getting used to.However, I loved a couple of things they did with the characters. Mackenzie Davis was awesome as super soldier Grace, and Linda Hamilton as grumpy old Sarah was much more fun and bad-assery than I expected. Albeit short on screentime, the surprising standout for me though was what they did with Arnold's character. Best use of him since T2 for sure, complete with a little arc. Natalia Reyes was okay, but I wished she left more of an impression acting-wise.The streamlined storyline - one big chase again from start to finish - works well for the most part. I just hoped the movie would offer more fresh ideas than just a couple of new characters and changes in the background. It isn't adding much to the franchise overall, not enough to make it relevant again. Dark Fate was entertaining though, including some nice action scenes and heartfelt moments.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Let's be fair it has the almost impossible task of being as good as T2. It was never gonna do that as T2 was a very tough act to follow but I feel it do a a decent job all considered.Anyone who under rates this film expect to much. Considering T2 was best part of 30 years old when this film was released it does a very good job of making the Terminator story fresh and good. The idea of a new AI menace called Legion which replaces Skynet is all perfectly plausible considering the events of T2.The film is a good sequel to T2 and I enjoyed it very much",Terminator - Dark Fate

2130,gert-23874,Very Big Dissapointment,2,15 November 2019,"I'm a huge Terminator fan. Watched T2 when I was a child and it looked so scary, so well made with characters who you can relate to. Read the books and comics, fantasized of being part of the universe myself and so on. When time passed I watched both T1 & T2 pretty much every year, for nostalgia. Such classics, amazing universe, the philosophical questions (I'm a software developer / architect myself, working with several AI related projects now), characters, darkness etc.
I had such high hopes with Dark Fate because Cameron was linked to it. T3 was pretty much a joke with horrible casting and a lazy story, Salvation was in my opinion the 3rd best movie of the franchise, it had its flaws (NO ARNOLD for first) but it was dark, with good acting and effects. Genysis was a meh with strange casting again and the same goes for Dark Fate. By trying to make it politically super correct it looses every good part of a Terminator movie. Feminism and diversity are the keywords. If you add a very weak story, bad CGI and vanilla characters you get a generic action movie that should go straight to DVD not cinema. Feel bad for Arnold and Linda for being part of such a hack.
If you like Terminator franchise you should just avoid this movie, it sucks on every level.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Went to the theater this afternoon expecting nothing better than Genisys, and now I gotta say it really is the third best Terminator film (considering how bad T3, Salvation, and Genisys were). The last fight is what really did the movie for me. I think the movie successfully portrayed the frightening unstoppable force that is the new generation of Terminator, while also did well in keeping the unshaken power and determination of T-800. Besides the action, Linda Hamilton's performance as a broken woman who knows nothing other than killing machines is excellent in my opinion. Along with that, the ""Carl"" story is also a nice little touch that Cameron put in for this story.

No. But it is a movie that from the beginning to the end holds you to your seat trying to figure out whats next.
Some classic quotes here and there from Arnie, thats it you have a movie. On a time that most movies try to over explain everything and have minimum action. This movie has simple plot and gives you what you like the most. Terminators and action.
How I translate this movie is that the war between machines and humans is unavoidable and the resistance to have a leader, either this is John or whatever the name is , it is going to happen as well.
If it was a little bit more raw like the predecessors and had more blood and gore it would be a 10/10.",Terminator - Dark Fate

But just base on this plot, I think.they have not fully utilize the potential.. I really cannot see the connection between these characters. They do not look like a team. I cannot tell the character of Dani. Sarah Connor just shows up. If Dani told Grace you must also save Sarah Connor because she trained me up to be a future leader. It will be very different. Sarah Connor becomes a critical character in the plot. The emotions between T 800 and Sarah Connor is not strong enough for her to forgive him. All characters descriptions are not deepened. The top grade action scenes do save it a bit but the magic of James Cameron's script and high tension story telling are not there anymore.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Not so ""grounded"" mr Miller huh? Lack of horror and suspense for an R-Rated film and needless funny moments like it was supposed to be a comedy. I guess that's the trend nowdays.

2145,stan-alexandru,A long time fan's review,9,1 November 2019,"I didn't want to write a review for T3 initially, since I really don't believe in the objectivity of this system. But after seeing a lot of unusual and, to be honest, hateful reviews by people who don't seem to know very much about the franchise, I decided to write my opinion, maybe it will be useful for some people.So, I went to see the movie and I didn't worry about it not being good, because, well, it's Cameron, it's Linda, it's Arnie. At the very least, I thought it would be much better than the T2 sequels. And it WAS. The problem with this movie is just that, that it comes after those failed sequels, so people go to see it without keeping an open mind, they think of it as T6, not the direct sequel to T3 as it's ment to be. When Cameron said they would ignore all the stories in the sequels, I was extremely happy. People say that it's the same thing, a rehash of T2, but think about it: how would you spin the story in a way that a) continues the T2 story while keeping a close relation with it, b) leaves some way for potential sequels at some point, if wanted, c) does a good closure for Arnie's character (and maybe Linda's too), d) it addresses to both nostalgic fans and potential new ones. Cameron's and Miller's mission was a really hard one with this movie, it was a gamble from the start because of all the bad past of this franchise after T2. Keeping all these things in mind, like any objective person should do, I think they did the best they could and I am thankful that I got to see a GOOD sequel to T2, at last.Now, about the stuff in the movie. I loved Grace, badass character but a bit stiff, it was like she was a terminator instead of a regular (well, enhanced) human. The Rev 9 was awesome, however I don't know how I feel about the black colour, I liked the liquid metal thing in T2 better. Oh well, matters of personal taste. Arnie's character, as always, GREAT. How can he be at this age and STILL look so badass in his character is beyond me. Grace has a lot of moments when she shows her strenght, but Arnie's hits seem much more powerful and I love that. He's like a damn rock with arms, while Grace is more agile. The CGI was good overall, but I can't say I liked the scene with the terminator and John Connor, you could clearly see that the characters were not real. Other than this scene, good stuff.
The ending was a damn flashback from T2 when the terminator was lowered into the liquid metal and destroyed. Very emotional, it was Arnie's goodbye from his most iconic character and it was a good one.For people that didn't see the movie yet, just go and see it without thinking about how bad the sequels were or how good T2 was at that time.

2161,firkin-37713,Read this before rating it yourself.,8,18 March 2020,"I don't normally write reviews on here but felt I should due to the amount of negative ones.
I feel some people didn't understand it properly. I'll try and explain.
Firstly a lot of reviewers are upset that they killed John Connor within the first 5 minutes of this film. John's story was done. We knew his back story from T1 and T2. And his future story from both films. But he became irrelevant to the story at the end of T2 as he and Sarah defeated the T1000 and stopped Skynet ever happening. Therefore he never became the leader of the resistance because there wasn't any need for one. Also explained in this film, is that Skynet sent multiple Terminators back through time, to different points in time, at the same point from the future to kill John (or a young Sarah). Its one of these T800s that kill him.
But you could get in to a time travel paradox about Skynet never existing after the events of T2 and then the terminators never existing either, but we'll gloss over that.
Also some reviews were complaining that the story in this film is virtually the same as ""John Conner becoming the leader of the resistance"" story in T1/T2. Yes it is. But that's because the only human that knows about Judgement Day and Skynet, left alive is Sarah, because she changed the future, no one else knows anything about that timeline because it never happened for the rest of the world.
Therefore humans didn't learn about the dangers of advanced AI (Skynet) so just went on to build another advanced AI and set the wheels in motion to the destruction of the human race, again.
And then comes ""Carl"". Although its not mentioned in this film he must've had his CPU changed from ""read only"" as seen being done to the T800 in T2 on the extended cut. Therefore he learns and tries to become more human. Also he sells curtains (drapes). That's purely for comedic value, nothing more.The action scenes in this film amazing, also the CGI is virtually unnoticeable. And it's great to see Linda and Arnie on screen together again. If you see this on bluray/DVD, watch the extras, and see just how much work went in to the effects/stunts.
Alas because this made a loss I doubt they'll make anymore. But I enjoyed it for what it was, a great action film.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2162,damien-78519,Next best terminator since t2? maybe an epic terminator film? Maybe not,7,24 October 2019,"This is my first ever IMDb review and I just had to do one for this film
I was so excited for this and was hoping it would be back to t2 routes.
So there are some points of this film that I really did like
But it certainly took me a while to Get into the film
And this is why spoilers ahead from now.
They killed John Connor in the first few minutes and not only did they do that but the promise of Edward furlong being in it was basically a lie.
We get one shot of his face looking just like he did in terminator 2 and then he is gone.
I have no problem killing off John but it was poorly executed and hurt a lot of the movie.
It took me right out of the movie for quite a while and the action pretty much started 5 minutes in and only 15 minutes in till we get our first epic chase.
It took me up until the midway point to even start to enjoy this film but once it gets to that midway point it is in fact a pretty good terminator movie.
And the last few action prices are pretty spectacular.

It's a shame the franchise is now dead as this film set up a compelling segue into a potential new film after Dark fate. It was great seeing the classic characters of Sarah Conner and Arnies terminator. There were a few really good action scenes though the film lacked the horror and innovation of T1 and some of the aesthetics and clinical brutality of T2.
It was a decent film and an ideal way forward to continue the franchise but so called terminator fans could stop moaning unreasonably because it isn't a masterpiece (it didn't have to be and was never going to be) and couldn't be bothered to go an actually watch it to support the series..

Even though the character of John Conner was not even born yet, the importance of this future freedom fighter residing in Sarah Connor's womb was stated from the beginning. This kid MUST be born, protected, and cultivated to save humanity.But no... just kill him off because they're clearly out of ideas, so let's start from scratch. Perhaps they should have just left the great Terminator franchise alone and come up with a new time-travel-to-save-the-world-storyline, title, and cast.If someone thought this would actually work, they should not be making movies. Can you imagine Tim Miller directing Jaws 2? Just kill off the shark in the beginning and make the rest of the movie about people's feelings about it.Kill off Luke Skywalker? Why not? Just write off he character and make a new one. No problem....Clearly, the Rocky franchise didn't really need a character named ""Rocky."" They should have killed him off in the beginning of Rocky III and let someone else fight Clubber.Yes, I'm being silly, but can you see the stupidity behind the concept? Edward Furlong was apparently more than happy to reprise his character and make a whole movie, which the real fans of the Terminator franchise would have loved. But no... get him back for a single day's worth of shooting.... and then shoot him... dead.MIller didn't kill John Connor.

""Rise Of The Machines"" was a rock-solid rampage, a kind of playful popcorn-version of the second part, with a grim twist. ""Salvation"" was totally okay in its darkness, its consequence, its exploration of the hopeless future. Some pictures and the intense atmosphere of it still stucks in my brain and soul. To put it in musical terms: If the original ""Terminator"" was dark industrial music, ""Judgement Day"" was Hardrock and ""Rise Of The Machines"" was NuMetal, then ""Salvation"" was nasty Sludgerock. ""Genisys"" was a strange reboot and opened the gates upwards, but it had at least one very good and important idea: Introducing Skynet as at first ""just"" being a ""comfortable"" all-in-one-app on every smartphone and device of the world. This is exactly how it would begin if it would begin for real. But now - this! A fifth part ignoring three of its predecessors (plus the interesting tv-series ""The Sarah Connor Chronicles"") and destroying everything that matters in this narration. Literally - everything! John Connor. The rest of any logic. The rest of any dignity. The rest of any attempt or love for the myth. They try to tell an new one, but they don't care about it. Some single shots oder dialog parts just throw short references in - from which on a real fan of the stuff wants to know more! Especially - what exactly is Legion and who came up with it, when and why and with what kind of lies and justifications torwards the public? The idea of a cyborg building himself a life after having no instructor anymore is ridiculous, but at least it's a try of thinking out of the box. One could've made an eight-episode-show for Netflix out of this new material, exploring it, building up a new world on the ground of the old one they have unnecessarily destroyed. But all they give us is well-arranged action cinema, polished by the marketers and the advisors of current Zeitgeist. Finding Machine Head or Trivium writing a cheesy country-pop-album with some current rappers on it, couldn't be even worse.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2173,markjunk-66850,Had to watch T1 just to cleanse myself,2,28 May 2020,"I can't believe I watched the whole thing. Undoubtedly the worst movie of the whole franchise. Way too much PC that was WAY too obvious.It's hard to imagine who thought a 4 foot nothing second-coming of John Connor would be a good idea. But that's Hollywood these days. Make the story fit your agenda no matter how illogical.About the only part I found interesting was the twist of an ""Augmented"" human as the protector instead of a machine. That the role was a female didn't bother me. However, I would have liked seeing a bit more of that strength in outward appearance. For instance, in the early movies, the robot (Arnie) didn't really need muscles to be strong. The metal frame under the skin provided that. However, it looked impressive and made you feel the power.The CGI in this movie didn't hold a candle to the effects of T2 from almost 30 years ago. How do you screw up that massively with all of the technology available today? Once again, the focus was on the agenda, the statement, not the betterment of a franchise.Arnie looked good and gave us a few laughs. But the situation with his ""Family""... good grief. Please find some writers in Hollywood who actually KNOW the franchise and can weave this story into it.They completely wasted a chance to bring these actors together for a ""reunion"" of sorts with a good story behind it. Instead, I constantly felt like I was being brow-beaten by a message instead of being entertained. (Don't lecture the viewer who is paying good money to watch your movie!)Somebody else mentioned this... if we keep watching and buying this awful stuff, they will keep making it. Time to stop.I'm going to watch T1 & T2 now to purge the bad taste I have from this horrendous attempt at entertainment.",Terminator - Dark Fate

However I was severely disappointed with the lazy script, 'throw money at it' set pieces and lame comedy (ug)But film in my opinion this film rights a lot of those wrongs, the script is solid it doesn't give everything away but enough, action set pieces I found were excellent and the characters interesting, especially Sarah Connor tough but bitter and Arnie playing a character akin to his T2 counterpart had he survived.Give it a chance it might surprise you.",Terminator - Dark Fate

One that stuck out the most was that the woman that came back from the future who was a little girl, came back to save her protector who looked THE SAME AGE NOW AS SHE LOOKED IN THE FUTURE 50 YEARS AHEAD! That young woman who was a leader later in life, 40 or 50 years ahead, was still a young woman at the exact same age as she was when the woman from the future found her in the present time.
Either mexican people never get old in the future, or this was a terrible miss by the director. Or they just couldn't find an older mexican woman to play as the leader in the future.
Besides that I counted several situations where the whole team could have been dead because the chances of survival was almost imposible. But who is counting, it's an action movie and I'm taking it lightly.
A part from that major flaw, the movie was much better action wise than the previous movies and I'm OK with it.
And whoever makes the next movie with Terminators should at least give the Terminators one movie where they actually win. That is why Star Wars was so great back then.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I think all the negative reviews are from people that are upset that it's not another T1, and it doesn't need to be.

CGI: 9.5 (the times are affecting the CGI engine from year to year. Moreover, the scene of Sarah and John's face appearance when he was young was all CGI)
The plot is interesting. my opinion should dark fate be Terminator 3.
The problem is if you see it from the beginning, connect it to Terminator 1 then 2 (judgement day) and then go straight to dark fate. So the rise of the machines, salvation, genisys just consider the future made for or the side story.

Instead she (the human cyborg combo) reminds you of your friend when you were 12, you know the one, your ""tomboy"" neighbor girl that only hug out with the boys. She was not believable whatsoever. The only good part of this movie is a 20 second scene during the beginning of the movie. In that scene some fantastic ""deep fake"" work on the young John Conner, Sara Conner and a young terminator modeled - modeled after the irreplaceable (in this series) Arnold Schwarzenegger.

This was nothing but a Netflix movie. I am really disappointed. I think it's time for us to say Goodbye to Sarah Connor,John Connor & T-800... we should leave terminator 1 & 2 as it is.

2199,leetonreed,potential squandered by aggressive agenda.,4,19 January 2020,"I wanted to like this movie, bringing back Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) was a good idea as she was a central strength in the original 2 movies but she is squandered here.
To begin killing John Connor, first off that kills the entire franchise right there John and Sarah Connor were central threads that created the story. I think what would of been more valuable would of been having john turn up with Sarah showing that their original timeline was no longer in effect. This would of been more compelling, he could of even died later in the movie if that was so desired therefore passing the torch as it were.
The aggressive feminist agenda summed up with ""You are not the mother of some man"" was an example of hate I found distasteful. I think what I find worst is that the original movies were pushing a feminist agenda but in a better way, the original had a bit of the damsel in distress style but you see Sarah grow in the story and in terminator 2 you had a very strong, very skilled, very smart Sarah Connor, John in this case being the in distress.
More female characters fine but it still needs to make sense.
Now augmented soldiers I fail to see how making cyborgs to fight cyborgs isn't going to fail especially considering that LEGION managed to shut down the world and terminators can hack anything how is it supposed to be viable.
It also seemed that the new judgment day should of happened during the movie they made no moves to stop it so it should of just happened.
Just so many flaws that with patching could of made the movie so much more and so much better.
In conclusion a shame.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Eddie Furlong is not the actor he use to be. They needed to move forward without him. They've tried this with different actors already with different actors playing John so I can understand the new direction they went in.I was blown away by the opening scene.

Although I did enjoy this film, it still doesnt compare to the first two Terminator films.
The first 5 minutes left a bad taste in my mouth, we see John Connor getting terminated. This should have never been written into the script, it seemed very unnecessary and basically a big middle finger to T2 and its fans.
Another problem I had, I didnt feel scared or threatened by the new terminator, there was just something missing. The story wasnt anything new, it follows the same narrative as all the other films which was disappointing. This being said, I did enjoy myself watching the film, the action, set pieces are very good as is the music and the return of Linda Hamilton.
In conclusion Dark Fate was unnecessary and didnt need to be made. Terminator 1 and 2 were all that was needed for this franchise, the story was complete. We can see why James Cameron didnt direct another movie after these two because he knew the story was done.

I would have liked to have seen a young John evolve into a adult and show him in the future in all out war with Skynet.

Cons:
The big disappointment is they should kill my favorite John Connor and T800 in the movie. The story repeated the same old apocalypse theme again, reminds me of Xmen Dark of Future Past yet not even close. There is lack of depth in story wise and new character, which I am aware as this action movie but still, and substance. And while I'm a woman myself, I realize there are too many political correctness and toxic femininity in the movie that makes uncomfortable to watch. I'm always with women empowerment and strength but it goes beyond that.Pros:
As I'm disappointed in too many aspect, I praise the action pack of this movie, it's great and intense. And of course I give this a bit high rating to the nostalgic feeling because of Arnold and Linda.

The atmosphere in movies from that era is obviously, completely different to the atmosphere in movies made nowadays. Also the actors (Arnold, Sarah) were at the peak of their career back then.
I thought it was a fun, entertaining movie and it brought back some of the nostalgia of the old classics. I thought the story wasn't very good but not very bad either.
I would like to give the movie a 7 star rating. Because I think the reviews are far too negative and I actually think they did a pretty good job.

Don't waste your time and money.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2229,pulp71,Best since T1 and T2,9,5 November 2019,"Wow..You cannot say this movie has a slow start, the action scenes from the start were thrilling to watch. As a Terminator 1 and 2 fan I had found the other sequels pretty average, so when I read the negative reviews for this one I wasn't sure what to expect, but decided to keep and open mind and go see it for myself. So glad I did as I really enjoyed this! Don't let the negative reviews put you off and go see it and make up your own mind. I wanted to be entertained and I was, the action just kept ticking along. I loved all the new and old characters and felt that I cared about them, something I found lacking in the sequels after T1 and T2. Especially loved the character Grace who is just so kickass and doesn't mess around yet also has depth and hope fullness. I would probably see the movie again just to see the action/fight scenes that Grace is in as I found these that good and for me made the movie. The new Rev 9 terminator is perfect for his role too and having Sara Conner back with Arnie was a treat. The movie was not overly complicated and had more of a realness to it .Glad it had an R rating as this is what a Terminator movie needs to be in my opinion. Loved it , I wanted an action sci fi adventure and I got it, please keep the action coming!",Terminator - Dark Fate

This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever watched, this is like a hollywood version of the Incredible Bulk.The story sucks, the characters are very unmemorable, John Connor gets killed off by a rando T-1000 and the same T-1000 apparently starts to ""gain a conscience"" when the thing hitches with a woman and starts a family. The graphics are memorable to an Asylum mockbuster movie. Anyone that says that this movie is the ""true"" sequel to T2 does not know what a good movie is. This movie also has a very woke immigrant take on what they try to portray as a RE movie, I rather watch all of those than this movie.This movie never existed, I rather watch Genisys because at least that was appropriately linked to Terminator 1 and 2. I will never watch this film again and I hope it stays in bargain bins.Thanks for ruining the series for us James Cameron fanboys, you got what you asked for... Good day.",Terminator - Dark Fate

There's definitely some manipulation reviews being posted by fake accounts or people; it not sure if I'll pay any attention to IMDB reviews any more.

2244,dylanpemberton,James Cameron High Fived His Ego With This Mess,2,21 January 2020,"Ok so here it is. Terminator Genisys was actually far superior and infinitely more enjoyable than this over hyped abomination. In short the pacing is poor, casting is truly woeful, acting is frequently strained and tired, the script, plot holes and the suspension of disbelief are just b movie level and all its got going for it was a self congratulatory and green eyed endorsement from Cameron. I love T1 and T2. I agree T3 was worthy of discarding from the cannon. Salvation had some good concepts but fell way way short. Can appreciate the value in just rebooting this as a T3 makeover but guys this just ain't it. Effects are decent, cinematography mostly good, all you'd expect with the budget but it's just so underwhelming and formulaic. This film is the very argument for stopping at T2. I genuinely got more enjoyment out of watching the very flawed Genisys than this, that at least entertained me. This was an arduous endurance test. To call this a true sequel is such a lie, I was so bitterly disappointed as I had such high, high hopes. Cameron really does think he's something a lot more special than he is or he was with this effort. Even the little things - the humour, the score, the future glimpses, the backstory builds - they just all failed. Devastated, this probably puts the nail in the franchises coffin.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2253,shaunpearson-15947,Terminator: Dark Fate left me feeling somewhat under whelmed,3,6 June 2020,"It pains me, it drains me, to have to type these words. The fact remains, Terminator: Dark Fate left me feeling somewhat under whelmed, and ultimately disappointed. The Terminator (1994) remains king!
What did I liked about Terminator: Dark Fate ?There is one scene that stood all above all others. The scene in question depicts Sarah Connor sitting at a table outside a beach bar. The reason it stood out, is because Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) looked like she did in Terminator 2. How did they do that? The Blu-ray extras revealed CGI was used to re create Linda Hamilton's facial features as they appear in 1991. I was left gob smacked. For the first time ever, CGI had fooled me, as it did not look like CGI. The film makers had managed to create a slow lingering shot of Sarah Connor as she looked in 1991. This brief moment is the only reason to go see Terminator: Dark FateLinda Hamilton. I felt sorry for Linda Hamilton. She is after all a good actress. She is not getting any younger, and I read that she put in a ton of work preparing for Dark Fate, and it shows. Too bad many of those around her lacked the same level of talent.Special FX. Credit where credit is due, Dark Fate is Special FX heavy, and most of the time the CGI looks convincing.
What did I dislike about Terminator: Dark Fate ?
The list is extensive. Where to begin? I am not going to run through all of it, just some of the dislikes.The intro. The viewer is treated to a close up of sand. Waves roll over the sand. A skull is slowly uncovered. The camera pulls back, there are more skulls dotted uniformly on the beach, as if place down by someone with OCD or an arty flair. It gets worse. A small army of CGI Terminators appear, marching out of the ocean, with wishy-washy results. None of it matches the might of the original's opening complete with full screen height letters scrolling across the screen while the theme music delights the eardrums with its metal drum beats.REV-9. REV-9 is the name given to the new Terminator. It's ability to divide into two separate being's is a step too far. Sci-fi requires the viewer to suspend their levels of belief, but REV-9 amounts to ridiculous. By divide, picture a human walking, picture a human walking next to a dark grey skeleton they have just ejected out of their own body. I failed to buy into the two for the price of one design. It begs the question, what is supporting the skin shell, now that the skeleton has been ejected? It amount to a rubbish idea. Gone is the chrome skeleton, replace by a dull grey skeleton.Natalia Reyes. I don't know. Who is to blame? the director for lack of direction or Natalia Reyes for being out of her depth? I am not familiar with the actress Natalia Reyes, thus cannot compare here Dark Fate performance with previous performances. Given the gravity of the situation, when the REV-9 first appears in Dani Ramos (played by Natalia Reyes) place of work (a factory) on a mission to terminate, her response amounts to detached. Maybe lacks the ability Natalia Reyes to picture something that isn't there in front of here, i.e. a CGI REV-9The Story. To some degree, Dark Fate amounts to same old, same old, a Terminator on a mission to hunt down and kill. There is nothing wrong with the concept, as the 1994 original proved. One of the main problems with Dark Fate goes back to basics - the film lacks the basics of what make for a good film. When Dani Ramos (played by Natalia Reyes) is introduced, we as a viewer know nothing about her? There is no character development. The REV-9 Terminator out to hunt down Dani Ramos fails to have any meaning as a result. The makers of Dark Fate appeared to apply their focus, and massive budget on big set pieces, which is all fair and good, but they should have atleast included the basics of what makes for a good story. They failed.Arnold Schwarzenegger. There is only one Arnold Schwarzenegger. Attaching his name to the movie is always going to help. The 1994 movie matched Schwarzenegger's skill set to perfection. He looked the part, he said little, he was directed well, and played the part of a relentless killing machine to perfection. Obviously Schwarzenegger looks older in Dark Fate, because he is. It wasn't his age that bothered me. As with Terminator 3, Arnold has lost the ability to act the part as convincingly was he did during the 1994 original. I get the impression over the years he has grown to comfortable with the routine of turning up on set, sitting in the make up chair, walking on set, speaking a few lines, and leaving the rest to the editors. Maybe the director of Dark Fate should have stepped in, and directed.

2256,nicholasmurtha,Why? Just why?,3,9 August 2020,"''Dark Fate'' is exactly what this movie was. The franchise has really terminated itself with this latest film.
Action there is. But many ideas and plot lines seemed regurgitated, i.e.: Person sent from past to protect the savior of humanity (The Terminator), or the chase scene was reminiscent of the chase scene in Terminator II, or comparisons of the detention center scene and the police station scene from The Terminator (lots of cops killed).
The last half hour was filled with death, and reality, defying situations for the main protagonist. For a film that's supposed to be based on the realities of this world, the main protagonist has luck and human stamina that is not from this world.

Storyline 0/10
Time travel understandment -T800
Overall 2/10Back in the 80s and 90s I was totally amazed by the Terminator movies, it was something brutal, new and had an awesome story if you liked sci-fi and action. But also the character build up was fantastic in both T1/T2.Please advise my warning before wasting 2 hours of your life. This review will is honest and as a fan of the franchise. Ill start explaining the ""plot"" in a few minutes.Conclusion: You,ve seen this plot in all other Terminator movies....Car chase with truck checkDestroying a terminator with a explosive energy cell checkIll be back meme checkArnold checkBad sequel checkSo John Connor in cgi gets killed by a T-800 in the first minutes in the movie, from a future that didnt happen. This T-800 programmed by Skynet that doesnt exist in the future, starting to grew a conscience.
Since it's out of purpose it doesnt terminate but starting to salvage guns for judgement day and starting to text Sarah Connor ""for John"" about Terminators sent back in time... to do what ? Dont know, since John is killed so why send back terminators?However we get a glimpse of another judgement day happened. A new A.I called ""legion"" started judgement day. Skynet is dead, doesnt exist. Thats about it, one sentance in the movie. A name token from a wizards hat it seems,This ""legion"" A.I from the future sends back a REV 9 ( a new terminator modell) almost indestructible. It falls from planes, takes huge amount of punishment, But it's stupid as a cow. Target is ofcourse to hunt the future female resistance leader. To protect this teenager the alternate future sends back an enhanced genderfluid soldier.The woke fate begins, there is more focus on what kind of ""model"" this female soldier is. like a ""steganos"" message not even hidden for the young audiance to see. The focus that the female teenager is the future is just cringe on a new level. Basically the story erasing what Kyle, Sarah and John fought for in the first movies.I must admit that Mackenzie Davis was the second best actor in this movie after the dead skeletons in the start.Hollywood managed to destroy thie franchise with politically correct treatment, and feminism. There is more focus on genderfluid and the mexican border than a story. With so much money in production I had higher hopes.

Her rasping elder statesman act is reminiscent of Joan Crawford.Mackenzie Davis exhibits delectably toned bare shoulders and arms throughout.The plot device to reintroduce Arnie is ingenious if improbable, and there is enough new stuff to retain the interest through the 135 minutes of the show.Highly enjoyable/",Terminator - Dark Fate

Don't listen to the man babies cry about feminism, they apparently never watched the first movies that revolves around a strong female lead so that's their own problem.Is the action repetitive, sure, but what action flick isn't? Mackenzie Davis SHINES and my role model growing up (along Samus and Carrie Fisher) Linda Hamilton is back in a big way and I couldn't be happier. And anytime Arnie is available for viewing I'm all in.I cried through the majority of this film. It still hangs somber with the ""Shakespearean Tragedy"" theme that has plagued Sarah Connor's entire road through these movies.What the fanboys never understood is that John was never the protagonist of these stories. He was a motivation, a grail, a symbol. Sarah was. And this is her story unfolding and torch passing. I was taken a back by the opening but that's GOOD. They tried making movies about John Connor but he was never our hero. Thank you for making this movie. And I would like to take a second to thank the FX team, holy crap the facial effects for Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, and Edward Furlong at the beginning of the flick were UNBELIEVABLE.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2280,Bedsit_Cinema,Perfect Popcorn Cinema,7,29 October 2019,"Terminator: Dark Fate was not a film I went into with any expectations for. I might have been disappointed (I was fully braced for that, in fact), I hoped to be entertained. I certainly did not expect it to match either of the first two films, if it was better than the three between it and T2, that would be nice.At first it follows very much T2's blueprint, but that's no bad thing, the Terminator films work best as a game of cat and mouse, and there is real thill in the Dark Fate's chase. The new model machines and their subsidiaries are nice additions, I particularly enjoyed the ""Rev-9"" future killer. The ""enhanced"" human was a nice idea, and did add something to the film, but as yet I haven't decided quite what.Dark Fate's 15 certificate definitely was a good decision- and I'm not just being a gore hound here- it helps add to the fear and believability. Dark Fate is nasty in places and it not feeling sanitised like the last three films helped me buy into the fear more than if it was the same film but cleaned up. The action escalates to the point of ridiculousness, but I was able to suspend belief. Also although there clearly are lots (hundreds) of effects shots the CGI is very convincing.Some critics have moaned about ham fisted efforts for cultural relevance and efforts to insert the Holy Grail of a ""strong female character"" (or three). Frankly none of that crap crossed my mind, I was in the cinema to watch death, destruction and explosions as humans run from futuristic robot killers. That should be what you go to see Dark Fate for, too, or you'll be disappointed.Overall a welcome return to the series, some new ideas and clever twists, as well as a few very obvious ones. Somewhere nearer to T2 than the last three Terminator films, Dark Fate was never going to break any ground, but it does cover plenty of it pleasingly. I was entertained the whole way through.

2281,samuel_faict,"Turdinator: Dark Faeces, also known as Black Stools, a worrisome symptom that can mean the end of a franchise.",1,3 November 2019,"There is no hope anymore for old franchises to recapture the magic they once did. Let the corpse rest in peace, it had a beautiful funeral. Now we have a soulless corpse revived for one last job, eventually to be killed in the end in the most disrespectful way possible. We saw the same case with Disney Star Wars, Predator, Indiana Jones, Ghost Busters, Robocop, Alien, Jurassic Park... My younger self is dying little by little inside.About the John Connor case:
Quite disturbing to see a beloved character, with whom I grew up, being shot in cold blood in the opening scene. I still do not feel well. It's like seeing your little brother or your younger self being killed. I feel empty. All my heroes are dying, all my memories are smeared. Welcome to the cemetery of franchises... There goes all Kyle's, Sarah's, John's, Myles's and Uncle Bob's effort to save the future... All of this for what? To introduce very diluted clones of the former main characters in a beat for beat retread of T2's plot. Another dead franchise flushed down the toilet by their own creators. I hang James Cameron's picture right next to Ridley Scott's and George Lucas's in the Hall of Shame.If only they had done something interesting with John's death, then I would say, OK, lets see where they take the story. But there is nothing at all.First I thought, narratively speaking, that this was a subtle way of how the future/universe was resetting itself for having prevented Judgment Day, to undo a time-loop. If Judgment Day doesn't occur, John Connor (J.C. - Jesus Christ) has no reason to exist.The most interesting thing about the movie could have been the dynamism between Sarah Connor and the T-800, but it's that underdeveloped I just wanted to cry. I would have loved to see a movie based solely on Sarah and the T-800, the murderer of her son:""Two vestiges, one of a vivid traumatized past, and one of a forgotten future that never happened, fight each other over an ideology that has no longer any meaning.""At least, we are getting closer to a philosophical idea worthy of a science fiction film. The T-800, being the last remnant of Skynet, would offer itself to scientists so that Skynet could still be build. If Skynet is created this time, there would be no John Connor. This would really mean the end of Mankind. Sarah would have to stop it at all costs.The T-800, killer of John, would have been a third Terminator send to 1995 by Skynet as a failsafe mechanism in standby mode in the case the T-1000 would fail his mission. Virtually all advanced technology has some form of failsafe.John in T2: ""One thing about my mom... she always plans ahead.""
Why wouldn't a machine, an A.I., be capable of doing the same?And to put it all together, we could have included a young Kyle Reese who metaphorically could have taken John's place as Sarah's adoptive surrogate son. The lover of the woman takes the place of the son. We fall into the complex mythology of Elektra. There, at least, it becomes interesting. The story becomes an emotional headache. To quote John in T2 when he talks about his father while the T-800 repairs the car: ""It messes with your head!""You can come up with a dozen of interesting ideas if only you take your time and put your mind to it.""If you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything."" - Marty McFly.The problem with contemporary big corporate-mentality, is that they now know everything about making big money, but they lost the precious art of making time.

It is action film, but not a mindless one. The fight scenes, the blasts, the chase, and the crashes are part of the story line, they are moving the story forward. I can't remember any recent film in which action was so cohesively put together as part of the story.
Even the drama in the film relies on subtleties of expressions rather than long-winded dialogues and slapstick humour. The characters are not forced to utter dialogues where none is needed, and neither do they make speeches where a simple grunt suffices.

But this one is just a cheap take at the concept with an agenda of feminism at a place it doesn't belong. It was amazing to see Linda Hamilton again and she looks fantastic even after all these years, but it was a missed opportunity and incredibly boring. I miss the scenes where two hunks Arnie and Robert bang each other into walls. You could feel the force in the living room , instead Davis looks more like an Olympic 100m sprinter rather than a terminator slayer and Reyes is just a bad actor.

I disagree with what many fans complained about. Forget the fans. It's fiction anyway, and Cameron et al created this story, they can do what they want with it.Story, pace, action, sets, all great. Most of the actors are great and focused, except for Schwarzenegger (seems lazy when trying to be serious and un-funny what trying to be funny).If you were young in 1991, liked Terminator and T2, and are sick of all the franchises built around big movie hits like these, I'm almost certain you will like Dark Fate.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2292,darkalo84,Hasta la vista baby!!,3,2 November 2019,"This is 'The Force Awakens' of the Terminator Saga. Not very discerning people will find plenty of fun here for sure but for us the true fans and connoisseurs of the saga this stinker will largely be panned for being the monumental rehash/remake of all previous five movies it is plus the added adjustments to modern day political correctness.
I am not surprised to see a 73 year-old Schwarzennegger in this one despite his character 'Carl' (oh gosh) being an utterly ridiculous and senseless joke. I understand his motivations ($$$) as well as those of 63 year-old Linda's ($$$).
But good old James..... Well, if he could openly endorse Terminator Genysis and remake Pocahontas + Dances with Wolves into a space fantasy extravaganza then... I gues that I shouldn't be surprised.On the other hand, I am not scared by strong female leads (my kitty's named Ripley and not precisely after John Malkovich's character). We already loved the likes of Leia Organa, Ellen Ripley, Sarah Connor, Dizzy Flores (Starship Troopers), Sarah Harding (The Lost World), Jolie's Lara Croft, Selene (Underworld), etc, etc. So a female trio of protagonists is not an issue. Don't make a world out this please. We are living in 2019 not 1959.
The real issue here is  all over Terminator 1 and 2 in the first 5 min. for the sake of a particular political agenda (and making piles of money). And bad CGI (look at the Rev9 face for God's sake!) and impossible action sequences don't make up for a shoddy mix-up of recycled ideas, locations, characters and ideas from all previous movies.
So lame that after all these years they could only come up with the very same storyline. They chose the easy path of rehasing everything into a modern-day mess with more plot holes than a Swiss chesse. Just like the producers of the new Star Wars films fid with The Force Awakens.

2293,Batfan1988,Tries Too Hard,4,18 April 2020,"This movies tries way too hard to be politically correct and to recreate the first two movies while attempting to fit the superhero genre. Schwarzenegger's T-101 has been the staple of the franchise, yet it is under-used in an attempt to push social-political commentary throughout the movie. Instead of creating a film that adds to the lore, they created several plot holes and couldn't be bothered to avoid paradoxical story elements. The first two movies had a sense of terror as the Connors were being pursued by truly intimidating killing machines, but there are moments in this film were the villain almost asks the heroes to let him win and shows kindness to civilians in lieu of the ruthless assassin we are used to seeing. As the first real attempt at a sequel since Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, this is a real let down.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2295,rezajohnvedadi,This film has definitely made its fate look bad.,3,10 July 2020,"Terminator: Dark Fate has diffidently made its fate look bad.There are occasions when a film critic has genuine high expectations of a film for various reasons, and goes into a movie with a sense of hope and excitement. But then they leave the cinema disappointed, cheated, and annoyed.The story is about a Mexican girl called Dani Ramos who is being hunted (by a more advanced Terminator than the first two films) from the future. She is being assisted in her escape by Grace, a soldier from the future and Sarah Conner, who was from the first two films.If I say much more about the plot, there may be spoilers, and no matter how mean I maybe, I don't want to ruin this film's twists for the audience. Before I explain what parts of the film flop, I will mention the parts of the film which I was excited about and the parts that work.The Good
The return of Linda Hamilton playing Sarah Connor, the mother to the future resistance leader, is welcome. She brings charisma and continuity that is missed in the other sequels since Terminator 2; I will not go into those films as they are skipped through, and this film continues from where Terminator 2 left off.Even though she is one of the best characters in the film, it seems she is trying to help prop up the movie along with Arnold Schwarzenegger as the rest of the plot and story is weak.The return of Arnold Schwarzenegger in this film is a big welcome because he has come to play his repeated role so well, it's almost as if Arnold and Terminator are Tweedledum and Tweedledee, you never know where the Terminator stops and Schwarzenegger's real personality starts. In any case he also brings a sense of continuation and charisma to his role.The action set pieces are pretty spectacular, even though some of them are repeats of the previous films, and the special effects, production value, and editing don't let down.The Bad
The film is a let-down in the story, script, and some actor choices that are made. For example, Natalie Reyes playing as Dani Ramos, or Gabriel Luna as the new Rev-9 Terminator is not believable and does not bring anything extra to the roles, and are very bland. It may have to do with the script they were given or that they are just not suited to the characters they are meant to play. The movie soundtrack by Junkie XL (Tom Holkenborg) is nothing special; again his style wasn't suitable for this film and nowhere near the original Brad Fiedel iconic musical score.A lot more was expected from James Cameron coming on board as producer and coming up with the story. His role as director in the first two films helped guarantee a unique style that fans will always love. He has dismissed the three sequels that came after Terminator 2, so when he agreed to help produce this film and come up with the story, fans were excited to see his magic touch.We wanted the darkness and strength of story we got from part one and two, and yet it's like Cameron has just put his name on the film but hardly contributed much to the overall direction of the whole movie. Perhaps he has, but I didn't see his fingerprints on this film, as his films usually share common styles. He is currently busy producing four sequels for his new Avatar (2009) franchise; you know that movie with the blue aliens that was the biggest film of all time until Endgame (2019) came along.The Ugly
So this is the hardest part to talk about as the film was a real let down with these points. The way John Connor's character is dealt with in this film, was an insult to the fans of the Terminator franchise. Once you see it, you will understand, but it was a terrible way of dealing with one of the central characters of the Terminator universe, and it will pretty much annoy you until the end of the movie and long after. It is one of the reasons why I disregard this film from the franchise in my mind and will not be interested in any more Terminator films, if they are to be made. The more I think about it, the more it distracts and annoys me.The movie has a strong female cast and character set up, shifting the direction of the saviour of humanity towards a more female-lead set up. This is fine and is not a problem, but the character Dani seems to have been thrust upon the audience, and her importance was forcefully pushed forward without much consideration and development, which is where the film fails.Even the way Schwarzenegger's Terminator character is introduced is hilarious for all the wrong reasons. I cannot say more, other than I have not seen this much lazy character development and introduction in a big-budget film for a while, and Dark Fate fails miserably at introducing the reasons behind how Schwarzenegger's character comes back. Don't get me wrong, it is always good to see him play his iconic role, but the way he is returned for this film is mind-bogglingly lame and silly.Overall, if you are not a diehard Terminator fan, and you will not be offended with significant changes to the whole Terminator franchise universe and if you don't care about John Connor in the series, then you will enjoy the set pieces, and you can turn your brain off for 2 hours of entertainment. But if you are a true Terminator fan, you will leave the cinema cheated and angry at this new film, and how it completely discredits the primary reason why you rooted and cheered for Sarah Connor in the first place.The film also makes a big deal about the idea of our fate being in our hands, trying to explore a philosophical concept, but that has been one of the messages of the previous two films anyway. This film has definitely made its fate look bad.",Terminator - Dark Fate

While not a bad movie T3 lost the heart of the first two and like many early 2000 movies had too much bad cgi and cheesy humour, salvation whilst having an interesting premise on paper didnt translate well as it was dull, no likable charecters and was nothing like the future we saw in the cameron movies, genysis however was the worst from awful story, cheap effects, and some unforgettable miscast in kyle reese. Dark fate unlike sequels just metioned had heart! Really good action scenes, good cgi, charecters and action. Sarah conner was a much needed return played stunningly by Hamilton, arnie was also fantastic.

2303,Flightman02,Entertaining but has some annoying bits which drag my rating down,4,16 January 2020,"Overall an entertaining movie if you can turn off your brain and just enjoy the action sequences. Those action sequences are very much the same style and feel as the old terminator movies. The augmented human story line I also thought was pretty cool.The negatives... The ease with which they just kill off John Connor I found to be laughable. An Arnie Terminator just time travels in close by, walks up to him and shoots him and then walks off? Really? Why does previously said terminator then suddenly grow a conscience and of all things start a family (who somehow never found out he is a terminator)? Ridiculous.The other negative is how this movie dedicates so much effort to the subject of gender, yet it plays favorites with one and discards the other. I get it, old action movies were hyper masculine and often at the expense of women. So the solution is to simply reverse that and all is right with the world? Why can't movies be made where one gender is not promoted at the expense of the other? I'd would like to point out that every male that spoke and was on screen for more than a few seconds either died or was humiliated. Countless more males died as guards, policemen, workers, etc. No females died or were humiliated. On top of that the movie is rife with degrading social stabs at men throughout. How about Humanism not Feminism?",Terminator - Dark Fate
2304,FilmFun19,Better Than Expected,6,15 January 2020,"Did . . . did I just see a halfway decent ""Terminator"" sequel?Yes, much like an actual Terminator, this franchise just doesn't want to die. While the first two remain sci-fi classics, the subsequent films proved increasingly bad - culminating, of course, in the absolute travesty that was ""Genisys"". So you can imagine I was not holding my breath for this one.But, to my surprise, ""Dark Fate"" actually succeeds in being something of a proper sequel to ""T2"" - and almost all of the credit goes to Linda Hamilton's return as Sarah Connor. Wisely ignoring its three predecessors, ""Terminator 6"" (God, there's SIX of these now?) is set after the events of ""T2"", where Judgment Day never happened and Skynet was never created . . . . of course, this is a Terminator flick, so that just means the same future awaits humanity at a later date, this time courtesy of a brand new computer system called Legion. While the relentless inevitability of this future has been a well-worn cliche in this franchise, it's handled a bit better this time around due to the returning role of Sarah Connor and the arc she's given in this film. Her presence and performance lend ""Dark Fate"" a sense of authenticity the previous movies desperately lacked . . . you feel here the echoes of the weighty themes so deftly handled in ""T2"", and while the movie isn't smart enough to explore these themes very much, they still feel explored due to the subtleties in Hamilton's performance. You can feel what she's thinking and going through, and she alone elevates the movie above what's expected . . . . a feat made more impressive given the film's opening twist that almost ruins it right from the start. Hell, even Arnold's better in this than he was the last few times around.The film certainly isn't without its weaknesses, however. While the story and tone is better, it clashes somewhat with the action scenes, which range from kinda decent (an early chase scene reminiscent of ""T2"") to absolutely ridiculous (we're flying planes into each other now?). And while Hamilton and Schwarzenegger are interesting here, our other protagonists - including the girl they're protecting - are decidedly more boring and generic. The special effects are also very hit-and-miss . . . sometimes you're watching a de-aged Hamilton so convincing that it takes you a moment to realize she's not that young anymore, but a lot of the time it's just bad CGI Terminators jumping and punching about.Overall, I can't say ""Dark Fate"" is exactly a good Terminator movie . . . but it IS better, and that's a lot more than I expected. Linda Hamilton is the main reason to give this one a chance, and although it introduces a few strange ideas, she carries things well enough that you can mostly take them in stride. It makes you think about as often as it makes you roll your eyes, and that's 100% more thinking that went into ""Genisys"". I suppose whether you like this installment or not depends on exactly how fatalist you're comfortable with your Terminator flicks being at the end of the day . . . but as for myself, I'm glad I saw it. It's certainly no ""Judgment Day"", but it was kinda fun.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I've been driven by the movie story and had a good time, The main leads done good job except for the girl who played dani ramos. the few hints of the original was smart and reminds me of some good memories of my childhood.However as the legacy of the terminator is heavy so I have to relate to the original 2 films, the movie have some major negative points:1- CGI was overused, they could avoid using CGI in many scenes and just shoot on camera. yes the originals used CGI but the mechanical and real action wins, most of the unforgettable and unique action scenes was done on camera with a little help of computer effects , and that one of 1000 reasons makes the originals so great and what makes the other squeals so bad and forgettable.2- The story was a bit distracting and some unnecessary details was stuffed in.3- The terminator here (REV-9) could have done a better job, although I don't feel its all the actor's fault.4- The actress who played Dani Ramos was unsuccessful choice, she is the weakest between the cast and couldn't carry her character.5- Arnold's background story was the worst idea in this movie, REALLY!! T800 have a wife and a kid. why don't he just lives and wait for the 3 ladies to come, he knew this would come. it was just stupid idea.finally this is a good and enjoyably action movie and tried its best to follow the originals. and I still hope that day may comes the one sequel brings this series alive again.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2311,matthewfielding-94-712985,I enjoyed the film even if it didn't really bring anything new to the table.,8,29 October 2019,"I thought that this film in and of itself was good. It only really become lacking if you've seen any other movie ever.
Firstly, killing John Connor in the first 5 minutes was jarring and immediately put me off watching the rest of the film. It made me feel like the past 2 films were now pointless. However in hindsight John only needed to be saved to start the rebellion after judgement day. If judgement day didn't happen then John doesn't really need to live. So even though it's not a decision I would make or want, I'm fine with his death.
But then skynet just with a different name rises up and starts the war anyway so the past two films were pointless in the end. This does bother me but it's purely set up and the film here on after is enjoyable.
One big criticism of the film that I had and clearly so do a lot of other people is that this film adds nothing and rehashes a lot from the other films. Despite having nothing new however, I enjoyed it. Being different from other films is not the mark of a good film, it's definitely something that can improve the experience but I don't believe a film should be classed as not good purely because you've seen the plot points before; especially in 2019 where it's practically impossible to be original. Personally I'm fine with seeing plot points I've already seen as long as everything around the plot is enjoyable and/or makes me feel. For me, terminator dark fate achieved this.
I liked the characters. Dani has heart and and I enjoyed her screen presence, even if she did get over the death of her family rather quickly.
Sarah Connor, amazing. Might have even enjoyed old veteran Sarah over T2 Sarah. Her struggle to be a soldier even in the face of her sons killer was one of the more interesting aspects of the film.
Grace the augmented human was also enjoyable to watch although her relationship to dani in the future was definitely one of the more flatter bits of the story. Still she was badass and passionate and I liked how she was flawed when it came to tactics and survival outside of a fight, which made her and Sarah a perfect match.
T-800 was very interestingly done with how he had got himself a family and developed somewhat of a personality. I really enjoyed this aspect of the film and he continued to be great throughout.
The rev-9 terminator I also really enjoyed. The gimmick of splitting in two was fun and used well. The fight scenes were badass and I felt real threat from this guy. I really liked the idea of a terminator with charisma. I thought it made him even more terrifying that he could charm his way through a situation to get what he wanted.
The action was fun and exciting. The characters were enjoyable and I cared what happened to them, and I felt there was a real threat they might die. The cgi was honestly kind of lacking in some areas but again this isn't something that dilutes my experience of a film, impeccable cgi definitely improves the experience but I don't believe it's necessary for a film to be good, I find it quite easy to ignore. The story and set pieces weren't really anything new but again this doesn't dilute my experience of a film and in the context of itself and just itself, the story and action was enjoyable.
I definitely had a good time with this film. I liked all the characters and was invested in their survival and their story. This film definitely has flaws but they're nowhere near big enough to ruin my experience of the movie.
In the end I think people would have enjoyed this film a lot more if they had never seen any other terminator movie before hand. I can understand how people might not enjoy this film having seen the other terminator films however for me personally it doesn't stop me liking it. I had a good time and cared about who was on the screen, if this was what the film was trying to achieve then for me it worked and I give terminator dark fate an 8/10.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Just horrible for this role. I'm like shaking my head, feeling I wasted my money. Enter Arnold. And his role was pretty interesting from a character stand point. Him and Hamilton saved this show. The new baddie is interesting, in concept. It's similar to all Terminator Movies but the chemistry between Arnold and Linda is alot of fun.

But still I'm disappointed.Dark Fate as an action movie is very, very good. The pace is great, fight scenes are probably best from the whole Terminator Franchise. REV-9 is really focused on killing his target and do everything to achieve it. For example in T1 T-800 was realoading his gun instead of killing Sarah with bare hands in Tech Noir club. T-1000 walks after John in T2 instead of running after him etc. REV-9 deosn't make these type failures. Which is really enyoable. However REV-9 is not as scary as T-800 and T-1000 were. Maybe REV-9 was to human or Gabriel Luna was not the best pick for the role.Linda Hamilton was great in her role. I'm glad she's back. Also Mackenzie Davis did great job and I liked here character.What failed in Dark Fate?
Icon - the classic terminator. T-800 as a father?
FACEPALM, FACEPALM, FACEPALM.
That idea ruined this movie. It's so irrational it's even hard to write about it.
T-800 kills John Connor and having nothing better to do he tries to socialize with humans and becomes one of us.
Screenplay writers idea was that T-800 had only one mission (kill John), and after achieving it he could do whatever he want as there were no further ordres. I'm sorry guys, but this is dumb as hell.
Skynet was smart. He would for sure order to killing Sarah after killing John. Also he would order all terminators send to past to ensure that Skynet will be created.
Also as we know from Terminator 2 (extended edition, but I think everyone wached it) terminators are send with read only AI because Skynet didn't want them to think and change their characters. As we remember T-800 in T2 achieve his mission. And he didn't stay to become John's father... So terminator learning being human is a huge misunderstanding.I also didn't liked idea of Legion. Maybe I'm old fashioned but Skynet should stay as the evil behind human extermination. It's another dumb thing in this movie. If the future was changed and Skynet never rised why Legion was so similar? He created terminators, he named hes robots as terminators. I doesn't make any sense.Dani Ramos, third female character, resistance lider, new John Connor was least interesting character in this movie which really didn't help it.So in the end Rise of the Machines is still best continuation of Judgment Day.",Terminator - Dark Fate

He managed to look like total bad ass even at 72!!! This man deserves a stand up ovation.

Now, the Protector is a augmented woman, the old Protector is a old woman and the protected is another woman whom is just protecting herself, not her unborn baby, either a boy or a girl. But of course, the bad terminator is still a man. Even the good terminator has been an evil one, by completing the initial mission. But he redeemed himself by living with a single mother with a single child(a boy..) and with whom he had no real intercourse, being a terminator, but just being a ""support"" for them ...
Even the later self sacrifice of the good terminator was looking like a normal act, nothing out of the ordinary. It is like a man should only do that while the women's stand a side, watch and judge the intensity of the sacrifice. There is no action of trying to save the good terminator, hopefully for being a machine, but the idea of being a male character receiving what he deserves transcends in to the thin air.

If you are a Terminator fan who loved one and two, found some promise but we're disappointed in three and four and utterly hated five.... Then STAY AWAY... They did the ONE thing and ""terminated"" ie erased THE ONE CHARACTER/PLOT THREAD that was most important to the whole franchise, making you feel like an utter buffoon for investing so much time, money and interest in the franchise up to now. It is such a kick in the teeth of fans, that it almost feels like these people have disdain for you (which they probably do).As a stand alone film, there are some interesting things and has moments from the original films, reattempted... Except without men... And with people of Mexican heritage as a replacement. So if you are someone in the year 2500 who didn't know a Terminator film series existed, you could watch it and think ""forgettable acting...pretty bad lazy writing... Even worse directing... Unmemorable... But it was ok overall"".The one plus was Linda Hamilton. She was pretty damn terrific. THAT IS IT. I am guessing this will be the last major film for the director Miller, as well as for the writers...My advice. Spend the money of two tickets on a Blu-Ray of Terminator and T2, (I actually like much of T3, the ending is magnificent... The Bale film has promise...

And for all those haters? Good news for you all... Frozen II will come out soon. Go and see that one!,Terminator - Dark Fate
2363,jayfrenchstudios,Very strange hatred towards this one.,7,18 January 2020,"I'll start by saying the obvious: Art is subjective. My rating and review is just my personal opinion, nothing more. However, I mostly want to address all the negativity about the film and the flaws in those arguments.
The most common complaint is that it's ""overly feminist"" and ""PC"". I'll admit I consider myself a Feminist (as in wanting to see true equality in the genders), and I am a Liberal. That said, I've seen movies that DO push it. Movies where it's obviously forced and incongruous with the film. I don't see this as one of them. Some have even claimed that the Terminator franchise was a ""Man's film series"" which this installment ""ruins"" by filling it with women. Perhaps these commenters didn't see or didn't pay attention, but Sarah was the one who killed the first Terminator in the first film. Reese was dead. SHE was the main protagonist. This STARTED as a woman's franchise. T2 made John the main character, with Sarah still being prominent. Of course, it IS called the ""Terminator"" franchise, so the REAL main character is the machine. Just as the ""Alien"" franchise is about the antagonists, not the protagonists, primarily. But I digress...
Other flawed critiques have claimed it was an all-female cast (it wasn't, not only was Schwarzenegger in it, there were several other male characters, including the villain), that the female lead was ""androgynous"" (she looked pretty feminine to me) and the complete mislabeling of Grace's character as ""the girl terminator"". I don't know how many times she clearly stated she was human, but augmented, but it was a lot. Pretty amateur mistake, there. Many also complained that the movie was ""anti-American"" and ""pro-illegal immigration"". I think these comments are coming from true racists, because the illegal immigration that takes place is only one of countless laws the protagonists break. Not only that, but I saw no evidence of the border security system being shown in ANY bad light. The worst we got was one rather bored civil servant who, quite sanely, didn't believe Dani's story. In my opinion, it actually shows the border security system as FAR more humane and functional than it really is. One particular critic even claimed that films were great until the mid-90s. Obviously this person has never seen ""Roller Gator""... or the hundreds upon hundreds of other painfully horrid films that existed before '95 (for some good examples, watch some or all of Mystery Science Theater 3000. You'll be amazed at how bad films can get).
So, all in all, this is hardly a case of angry feminist PC virtue signaling... it's just a cast of MOSTLY female leads. To me, this kind of goes back to the first film.
Now, back to art being subjective, I would personally call this the 4th best Terminator film. T1 and T2 are still the best, but T3 was laughable (somewhat intentionally) and confusing, and Terminator: Genesys turned the savior into a villain, which I found horribly distasteful and contrived. I did, however, find Terminator: Salvation pretty good.
Is the film flawed? Certainly. The fact that it was Dani herself who was the savior of the future wasn't that much of a surprise (again, in my humble opinion). The reuse of Dani being someone who saves mankind in the exact same way John Connor did is also a bit lazy. It seems to me they could have come up with some other ""fate"" for her that at least made it different. I also think the replacement of Skynet by Legion was fairly lazy. Again, it seems the writers could have come up with some way to have Skynet have survived in some way, especially if they're ignoring all but T1 and T2. I will agree with the critics one one point, I didn't find the casting of the villain all that great. Like the T-1000 in T2, he had a face he would ""return"" to, which I think is clever for a shapeshifter, because it gives the audience a point of connection. The actor himself seemed decently capable, he just didn't seem to fit and didn't have the menace the Schwarzenegger or Robert Patrick had. Even the T3 Terminator was more frightening (let us not forget that this franchise began as sci-fi horror). It didn't even make sense that his first form was Latino, unless he knew where he was going first, I suppose. I can't see a defense system AI thinking of that, though.Just my two cents. I say it was a pretty good movie. I've seen better, but I've definitely seen a LOT worse.",Terminator - Dark Fate

This is certainly the 3rd best terminator movie after the first 2, if it had come out a few years after T2 judgement day it would have been a bright continuation for the franchise and we wouldn't be complaining about the other movies so much. It is enjoyable, it has some great action scenes, the new protagonist terminator is actually pretty good and so is grace. Arnie is just Arnie and I really liked his contribution to the movie. The winner for me though is Linda Hamilton as Sarah Connor, she is the reason this film has more heart than the 3 films after T2. She just elevates the film. It's not and never will be as good as the first 2 films, buts it's definitely an enjoyable movie. In my opinion.",Terminator - Dark Fate

But it kills T1 and 2 in the first 5 minutes and the rest is basically the same story we have seen before, with the only difference that its ""politically correct"" and that the bad guy can split into two Terminators.
John Connor is dead, Sarah Connor is an alcoholic and the Terminator decided to have a family, wadafug right???
On a more positive note the effects, music and the action are great overall, but at the end of the day nothing to really remember.
I dont understand why they didnt just do a whole movie out of T2-3D? That would be the sequel id love to see!

Probably it can be considered a reboot but......even if Cameron says how it has not relation with T3, T4 or T5, if something we learn in the previous films, it was how the Judgement Day could not be avoided and it could happen from different ways. This is what you go to watch in this film.Now, I do not understand what the people complaining about the film are waiting. A Terminator film as Joker? it is an action film and clearly you should wait enjoy your time with good action and some jokes, not too much because it is not a Mission Impossible film full of jokes.

Terminator 1 and 2 had a STRONG FEMALE LEAD. Do you feel inferior because John Connor is no longer the saviour of humanity?!This film is the best Terminator film since T2. If you enjoy action and mindless, indulgent explosions you will like this film.If you're a narrow-minded individual who decides to hate on films because women are in them, avoid this.I'm disappointed we won't be seeing where the intended reboot would have taken us. Skynet, John Connor, etc, have all been done to death over the years. I felt this film was a fitting end to the 'trilogy' of T1 and T2. For those saying it retcons everything; I disagree.

Just like salvation it moves the focus from John Connor. The hybrid man/machine returns. The aged Arnold returns, with the exact same excuse we had in Genisys.There's nothing original in this and the writing is woeful. The believability of T1 and T2 is long gone. Over exaggerated fight scenes. Mind numbingly boring, over convoluted cgi. And characters with no depth, warmth or connection to the audience.This is a cash grab. No other words for it.Fans want a well written story. Practical effects. Terminator should be dark, moody, intense. The T600s used to be slow, but unstoppable. This is just more cgi throwing each other through walls.The first 5 mins gave me hope. The de-aging, was spectacularly well done. It felt like watching 1991 Linda Hamilton.

If the post T2 timeline was changed such that Skynet never existed then the Terminator that killed John in Dark Fate should have blinked out of existence before it killed John. Even if my take on the physics of time travel is wrong, the rest of Dark Fate was filled with just plain bad. Bad acting, bad plot, bad theory. There was zero build up or backstory that explained how Dani becomes the Resistance Commander and unfortunately Natalia Reyes' acting fell incredibly short of filling in the story gaps. Linda Hamilton looked great but played Sarah entirely without appeal and came across purely one dimensional (which was one of the most disappointing elements considering her great performances in T1 and T2.) Davis was fine as Grace but also lacking in appeal. None of the leading ladies, character or actors, made me ""care"" as a viewer. Gabriel Luna was fine, but his showing up everywhere causing mass destruction and no trace of suspicion was tough to believe and I see no logic behind the ""how"" of the Rev9 physical split. Visually interesting, but it seemed like a plot choice purely done for the visual impact. Throughout the movie, at least a half dozen lines meant to be dramatic instead made me literally laugh out loud they were delivered so poorly, and the final scenes? Shake my head silly. Carl was a cool idea and allowed for some genuine humor which helped sell the idea that it developed self awareness and a modicum of human conscience. (Carl alone almost earned all 4 of the stars I gave the rating.) Until the end. Stupid, worthless, and laughable.

Breaking down why to my opinion there's such lame Rating on imdb , and why I gave it 9 (Balancing because of my theory)Terminator Dark Fate is an Action packed film with thrilling scenes and with a good story to tell . Which by itself , isn't trevial these days at all .shocking images that flash back to terminator 2 (will not spoil it) and Sarah Conor and T101 terminator play the magic part required for brain wires to re connect with terminator 2 vibes.
The dialogs give a nice gentle notion of the future and how it is formed with present choices . But they don't dig too much there , which is pretty OK.For old timers like me born in 82 , it's hard not to compare to t2 which was an epic movie , but pips , please understand that if we saw it again today it will be much less exciting , this is why old timers may dislike it , the look for a repetition of something they don't know that is no longer exciting for them or fun .The young watchers can't get it , most of them did not watch terminator 2 , asking around and hearing comments at the beginning of the film proved it . they have the focus ability of a 5 years old , peeking at their phone in the movie theater , so the movie even tries to get some y generation light headed mambo jambo in, keeping it shallow enough for them to hold on , while James Cameron does show his ability to go deeper , he may have been a bit torn there , to keep them tuned (which sucks, but hey let the young gen enjoy it too).

WHAT DO YOU WANT? yeah, John is dead, asume he is no longer needed as the leader of resistance, so what's the point of criticising his dead so much?",Terminator - Dark Fate
2387,jeugene19,Upsetting. A Dark Fate for a once flawless franchise,1,29 November 2019,"I feel like I'm Dr. Soberman, telling the studio they are delusional for these absurd ideas.
If your reading this, you've probably heard all the same complaints about what has happened, as I have. The first two terminator films were very important to me growing up, as well as to so many others. They just did everything right on every level, and it's really hard to keep attempting to replicate what you can't. The worst part is, it truly feels as if they didn't even try or care to.
At the beginning of the film, John Connor is dead. I thought wow, that's a huge risk, ok they must have a great reason for it. No they didn't. Unless you think that Arnold's terminator that kills JC, grows a conscience, feels bad about it, settles down, has a family? And installes drapes? makes sense? (Again, Dr. Soberman moment). This character ""shift"" is the reason that all the work and all the emotional attachment we had to these characters from the first two are gone and mean nothing. Because someone we know nothing about, and don't care about (because the movie doesn't make you), is now a better idea to take the place of John Connor. This somehow was sufficient for the writers and the studio. I mean there is literally nothing inspiring nor interesting about her becoming the leader of the resistance.
I'm not going to try and explain the film, because you can't. It's not even that Dark Fate doesn't fully make sense narratively. It's more of ""why oh why would you do that or write that??""
As for any positives, there are some. It was great to watch Linda and Arnold on screen again. And I thought MacKenzie Davis was really good and brought a lot of dedicated physicality to her role. The action scenes are faced paced and frenetic and there are many of them. There's certainly a lot of eye candy and it is entertaining to watch.
But, most of it just doesn't feel real. The first two feel real because everything is real. The CGI used in Dark Fate just makes the action feel a bit like an over the top R rated X-Men film, where the originals made it more grounded, more real, more terrifying. And that's the biggest difference when it comes to a lot of modern action films.
Lastly, what bugs me the most is that it's clear they want to pave the way for a new generation of audiences. I get that, but at least do justice for what is a direct sequel to T2. They get Linda and Arnold, Cameron writing and producing to rope in the fanservice, and then attempt to rope in newbies for a new story/direction that won't make sense at all. And tell us that women need to be leading these stories, because it's 2019. But you already did, you had the most badass female action character in history, and decided that wasn't enough. It's just recycled deja vu storytelling for a new audience.

I am sorry for the ones that were not able to do so. Of course,it is not as good as Terminator 2. But not even remotely as bad as so many reviews are suggesting.
The key to enjoy it is a zen approach. Are you expecting a new Judgement Day? Well, you set up yourself for a disappointment. Give up your attachments and expectations and you got yourself a very solid action movie.
And the fact that the action is happening in alternative future is actually ending ""John Conner curse"" and doing justice to John Connor. There is no John Connor but Edward Furlong, anyway.

2396,sebastian2283,A wasted opportunity to revitalize the franchise...again,4,15 January 2020,"This is my first review on IMDB. It is sad to start with a negative post, but well..maybe someone in Hollywood read this and with some luck I will illuminate his/her mind for the next installment of Terminator (oohh...you think with Dark Fate it is over?, not a chance amigo!).As usual with the Terminator movies (after T2) the plot is very predictable, no surprises or twist whatsoever. They did the same mistakes as we saw in Terminator Genysis and they still think that the fans are humans without a brain.Here are my opinion about certain aspects: (Spoiler Alert!)CGI/Special FX: Too much bad CGI and very ugly compared to Terminator II. It seems that the more power computing technology we have at our disposal, the more lazy directors we have.You won't be surprised by any of the fight or escape scenes, since most of them don't make any sense or are very unreal. For example, when the airplane starting to take off, and the REV-9 are chasing them, it does not seem that the wind or the airplane movement affects any of the protagonists at all..so you can stand completely still while an airplane gains height without any problem!. Other bad CGI effects are related to the Terminator REV-9...compared to T-1000 this new Terminator looks like a plastic robot all the time.Dani Ramos character: I do not understand why they create this character and put Natalia Reyes in the rol. For me this was the worst choice. I do not know other works of this actress, but here is not her best perfomance. It does not look like a future leader of humanity, or the plot doesn´t help to convince us that she will be one day a great leader. In my opinion they did a poor casting, if they needed to have a mexican actress as a main character. Bear in mind that we have better and more convincing examples in other series/movies, like ""Martha Higareda"" in Altered Carbon (She did an excellent work as a badass police officer).Boring political issues: We ALL know the big problem that have all the inmigrants in the US/Mexican frontier. There is no need to put that on this movie. If you want to show us the drama of the mexican inmigrants, just do a documentary or something else. Terminator is about the future and technology, it´s that simple.Music: Bad..nothing special here.REV-9 / Gabriel Luna: Ugh...why?? It seems that Skynet have better Terminators than ""Legion"".In summary: Regular movie with bad casting (with the exception of Linda Hamilton, Arnold and Mackenzie Davis), that shows a good idea (maybe) combined with a bad execution. The Sarah Connor Chronicles has a better plot and characters with less budget and without Arnold....so the money and the actors is not a big deal..is the director the problem, i think.We will need some time to forget this ""political and multiracial movie"", and see a new version that ignore all the plot on this ""Dark Fate"".",Terminator - Dark Fate
2397,hi5467,Worth watching for sure,8,3 November 2019,"I went to this movie tonight and it ended up being a really great movie. Heres why I say this.. the plot was on point and it made up for the last movies from the 3rd one and anything after that pretty much. All I can say is I like how this movie takes place after the 2nd movie in the series and how it picks up. I also like that it did kinda gave you that same feeling as the 2nd movie. The reason I'm giving it an 8 though is even though the movie was great in my own opinion I personally can see why people wouldnt like it that much since there were scenes that it felt like the character didnt really get a break and everything was explain but it felt so short how they explain it. Another reason is depending the type of person you are, this movie can easily make you predict and know what's going to happen next or if you're someone who ends up being suprise haha which I ended up knowing what was going to happen next base off the vibe but still got shock if that makes sense.

This was by no means ground-breaking in the way T2 was, but that isnt a fair comparison for most films and certainly not for its sequels.In a world of cinema where directors and writers try too hard to make their movies ultra compelling filled with plot-twists and bad endings, this movie delivers a smooth and balanced cinematic experience that neither blows you way or disappoints you. It never tried to be something it wasn't.

I'll admit that the story was average, and that it was nothing but a novelty having Linda and Arnie together again, however I absolutely loved it.

Positive: I loved seeing the old actors come back.
Couple of old school nods were in there also.
When the action kicked in it was a digital masterpiece. I cheered & ""oooo ahhhed"" at a lot of the violence.

Such has been the case for franchises like Star Wars, Ghostbusters, and Men In Black. But Terminator is the latest to join this ever growing list. I like that some action took it's time, the scenes with Linda are good and Arnold steals the show, as he always does. The new female Terminator isn't terrible either; on par with Marcus Wright. Nothing else works. The newcomer actress the story centers around is hilariously weak. The villain feels useless despite having obvious advantages over everybody it's fighting. Overall terrible treatment of the Terminator legacy to retell the same story, but inject toxic doses of political narration: Awkward portrayals around illegal immigration, feminism, and global warming.

All of the Actors, legacy and new, knocked it out of the park. The sound mix and art design for the film are superb. The musical score by Tom Holkenborg a.k.a Junkie XL is amazing.

There is no Fate, but what we make for ourselves.""",Terminator - Dark Fate
2412,eonimisi,I actually quite liked it!,8,28 October 2019,"Now, hear me out, it wasn't the best thing since sliced bread, and a lot of its cons have been talked about everywhere else. But I believe it works within the universe the Terminator films set up and as such is a worthy sequel, and here's why:First, it brought something new to the table.First, consequences. In T2 Cyberdyne was destroyed, but the possibilities Skynet still being out there was teased. One of the arc phrases of this franchise is ""the only fate is what we make of it"" or something.
I too was shocked when John was killed in the very beginning. But to say this is an insult to fans is an overreacuon. I mean, come on, how many variations of John's story have we seen? I mean, after what Genisys did to him, I believe this was the most merciful thing the franchise could do to John.
So maybe with John's death we lost the heart of the franchise, maybe, by it set a new tone. A dark tone, or dark fate if you will, on par with Thanos killing Loki and half of the Asgardians at the very beginning of Infinity War. Killing John elevated the Terminator as a threat, since even the human savior was not immune. No matter how the timestream is altered, it bounces back with a vengeance.
So John died, and the Terminator universe as we know it is not the same again.
(I should add here that the TV series, Terminator The Sarah Connor Chronicles developed this idea much better because it had the luxury of time for us to see the character growth and story development. In the end, saving John had altered the timeline so much that it resulted in a future where no one knew John Connor. And it made so much sense, fans are still hoping the series continues someday)But then there's hope. There will always be someone who will be a beacon of hope for humanity, to lead the fight against the machines. In this new timeline it's Dani.
The fact that Dani is a female is inconsequential to the story. If we judge just based on her gender, and not on her character, then that says a lot about us not her. In my opinion she goes from scared and scarred to becoming reckless with her life in order to save those around her, even her protectors. She showed me over and over why she deserves to lead the Resistance.
Does the movie pander to a feminist agenda as some have said? My advice, judge it for yourself. If you enter with that perspective then that's what you'll see.
For me, the movie gave us good characters in the timeframe we were given.
Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor was the star for me. She was the relic of the former timeline, our audience surrogate glaring at these newbies who have no idea what they are in for, as she does. She carries the worldweary ruggedness well.
Grace gave us some of the best and brutal fight scenes. You see her fight te Rev9 and realise that she's experienced, she's not sparring but fighting to kill. She realise you are in a movie that's R rated for a good reason.
The development for Arnie's Carl was actually very intelligent. He, like Sarah, is a connector to the era we know. Arnie plays him well. Linda and Arnie made me realise I'd missed these too as characters.
Gabriel Luna's Terminator was scary in his quiet demeanor. If you've seen his turn as Ghost Rider in Marvel's Agents of SHIELD then you will appreciate the way he personified quiet strength and robotic method beneath a lethally calm demeanor.
The direction is exceptional for an action movie. The CGI had its moments.But as continuation of the saga, I believe I works better than the previous movies, it respects the legacy of T and T2, acknowledges the changes in the world of today, and sets the franchise up for a new, darker and hopefully better future.PS: If you love the Terminator lore, you really really need to check out Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.

As a film, its probably worth 4 stars, but as they spent soooo much to produce this poor offering thinking they could cash in, I just had to drop it to 2. The action scenes are just too over the top, the acting is at best mediocre, and the one liners might of worked thirty years ago but not now.

I grew up with these movies, as T2 is my all time favorite. I kind of (maybe?) Understand the direction this wanted to go, I guess? Maybe its because I love Arnold so much, that my rating is higher than it might be without him in this movie, but Mackenzie Davis was really badass though. I liked her character. Linda Hamilton was very strong too and Arnold got me right in the feels. The new Terminator was innovative and dangerous, liked it. But, omg, Dani? Now, don't get me wrong, but when there is a Model 101 T800, one badass modified elite Soldier and THE Sarah Connor who tells you what needs to be done, don't act like you know what you're doing in your sweet 16ish and then everybody says ""ok, lets do it your way"", like wtf?

2420,newt_husain1994,Goddammit! The Spammers!!!,7,1 November 2019,"DON'T BELIEVE A WORD OF ALL THESE SPAMMERS REVIEWING THE MOVIE! I doubt they've even seen it.
So I'll start by saying that it's a PRETTY DAMN GOOD movie. Tim Miller y'all!
The story is the same as the rest of the franchise (what else do you expect?) - still they've managed to tweak the plot a bit (which has obviously infuriated the fans of the canon, I won't get into all that because I don't mind it much unless the film is worthless - case in point: Genisys)
The CGI is great but it falters in some places (not much of an issue). But that is expected from Miller who's firstly a VFX artist.
Junkie XL's soundtrack tries to emulate the aura of the original. I'll have to listen to the OST to decide if it's actually good or if it's just good enough for the cinematic experience.
MACKENZIE DAVIS is great, considering how much I hated her in the very first look. A proper action heroine.
Gabriel Luna as Rev 9 is a worthy successor to the T1000. Miller and James Cameron try to recreate the ""horror"" element of the terminator and they manage to do it well. The action is the best selling point and it does remind you of T2 at places especially in the first chase sequence.
I don't understand the hate around the movie, because this is truly a worthy follow up. And if you ask me, it's worth a re-watch (yes! In the theatres!) just for the action.
Hell, it does not even have cheesy humour anywhere (just some dark humour at some points).
There are lots of easter eggs for the true fans (I'm one of the biggest fans of the originals in my opinion and I enjoyed them all in all honesty).
I'd give this movie an 8.5/10
I'd like atleast the true fans to go and watch it and I'd like to read their opinions about it. It might be underwhelming for some surely, but it's definitely worth a watch!!",Terminator - Dark Fate

2423,chrisproft,I'm dumbfounded,9,2 November 2019,"I'm compelled to write a review having yesterday watched the film and being more than pleasantly surprised. Perhaps my expectations were lowered by the tsunami of negative reviews the film is receiving , but I've got to say I was gripped by the film from start to finish.
The claims of political correctness pervading the film and heavy handed use of female protagonists is inaccurate, given that T2, one of the most revered sequels in film history possesses a female hero, in this third installment (as touted by the filmakers) it's more of the same and they do an excellent job.
It really does feel like a true Terminator film, which the previous two attempts couldn't accomplish, with tasty verbal and visual throwbacks to the first and second films which are artfully executed. The comedic reprieves throughout the film, are reminiscent of T2, another aspect missing from T4 and T5, two installments which seemed to take themselves too seriously.
The de aging of the characters in the beginning of the film was absolutely incredible, and such a treat to see new footage of characters who are so indelibly etched into the minds of fans of T2.
I really cannot understand all of the hate for the film , and can only put it down to either some Machiavellian conspiracy to take down the film, or just that thousands of so-called fans of the original film are butthurt that their expectations have been trampled by something new and unexpected.
Considering that T1 was revolutionary and groundbreaking film making, and T2 is widely considered the greatest sequels in film history next to the freaking Godfather 2, and on a scale of 10, they probably both deserve a 15, I think a score of 9 for this film is more than justified. It ticked the boxes for me as fan of the franchise.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2424,theoscarmail,"Hasta la vista, baby.",3,6 November 2019,"The few times 'Terminator: Dark Fate' (TDF) is not utterly predictable, it makes no sense. As an endless re-telling of a familiar story, it does close to nothing to breathe anything new to the franchise. If anything, it cheapens what came before it.From the word ""go"", it is hard to feel compelled by any of the new characters presented by TDF.
On the one hand, the average jo-esque character of Dani, portrayed by Natalia Reyes who does her best to salvage her role, who is forced into action and ""hero-dom"", has a hard time showing why she is particularly special or attention-worthy. For a movie whose theme is mastering your own fate, it feels an awful lot like the character actually stumbled into her messiah role.
On the other hand, the terminator villain in this episode doesn't even come close to bringing a slither of the personality Schwarzenegger and Patrick were able to give there respective killer robot alter-egos. Linda Hamilton is reduced to a shadow of the original badass she portrayed in T2, as result of the way her character is written. She essentially only serves the purpose of saying the 'F-word' whenever a situation gets intense during the entire film. And where to start with the new terminator incarnation of Schwarzenegger? The cold robot turned red-blooded American country-family-man comes across as an utter joke and his redemptive ark is void of any credibility. Add to that a preachy gun-happy narrative that attempts to make gun-ownership endearing and you end up with a movie that provides nothing remotely as exciting or thought-provoking as the originals.To top it off, the CGI doesn't do this film any favours, with characters seeming more like action figures jumping around than actual people with weight and depth. The overall movie doesn't really look that good, whether it be during the cell detention scene or on the dam. And once again, the Schwarzenegger episode in the woods feels completely off-tone in the saga.Ultimately, although the movie does drop a couple hints of female empowerment, they are executed sloppily, serve a very weak narrative and are not enough to save the steaming wreck that is TDF.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Is it him or another T800? Why would Skynet send another obsolete T800 after sending a much improved T1000? And there is no drama, no shocking encounter, no fight...the kill scene takes 30 seconds of T800 poping out of nowhere and shooting JC in the back at a beach bar. How can you destroy 2 great movies in 30 sec? Well just like that. And from there on we have a basic action movie with all the possible cliches and feminist power that we must see these days in hollywood movies. I will not even get into explaining the transformation of Carl from a killing machine that killed JC (and remember, he is not even uncle Bob that JC ordered not to kill humans) into a humanist, because is just below any standard of scriptwriting. Money grab folks, money grab.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Just when I thought that nothing would be worst than T3 or Genesys, well there you go with Dark Fate. It is a joke of a movie, they took everything done and said on T1 and T2 and threw it to the trash, a simple and empty new story without John Connor, leader of the Resistance. A kind of remake of the oldies with poor special effects, my Xbox displays better for God Sake! A T-800 on family life, understanding human feelings at full, changing diapers, preparing micheladas and having one under the shade sitting with a dog next to you, really? James Cameron, that's what came off your head after 28 years along with Tim Miller with a budget of $185 millions! This movie is a huge bad joke.

2446,douglasrbrook,Thrilling with good performances best sequel since the original.,8,9 November 2019,"I really enjoyed it - it was tense and thrilling with inventive action and twists on the usual Terminator story. I don't usually care about action movies but I really cared about the characters and each action scene was a desperate struggle for survival. Loved Linda Hamilton for some reason - she was the soul of the movie. I thought the only flaw was the way Arnold's Terminator was a family man - that was a bit of a stretch in believability and flawed the film however the rest of it was gripping. It was well directed - well judged pace. Loved the feminist angle, Mexican political angle and it was strange that Arnie was a white supremecist survivalist type blended into it. It had some comic book type dialogue but the actors pulled it off. I really thought it was the best Terminator Sequel since the original - T2 was not as thrilling in my opinion. A pity the box office was so poor as it is a good film thumbs up!",Terminator - Dark Fate
2447,hall_philip,💩,4,9 November 2019,Easily the worst Terminator movie made and the worst film I've seen this year. This movie has put the final nail in the Terminator franchise's coffin.

It starts ok but then quickly does an Alien3 by killing off the whole point of the storyline that proceeded it. John Connor ( a great cgi enhanced Young Ed Furlong) gets a cap in his ass from another T900 Arnie. Later on, and this is where the film really falls apart, he comes back into the story line and apparently has been living as Carl, a drapery salesman. Carl's Drapes! Ffs!! I'm not making this up, it really is the plot of the movie!
Oh, and he's really sorry for killing John. James Cameron (If he's responsible for this) should write stories for VIZ magazine. It's exactly the sort of stuff they would love. 😩

I left the theatre with a lower IQ, and now I have to find a therapist to help me understand why I put myself through this nonsense. I did spend time with friends and family.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2453,NisX,Now this is how you make a terminator movie. Dont let the negative nay sayers from seeing this. People are too cynical these days. Go see it and judge for yourself you will 👍,8,1 November 2019,Wow. This movie was amazing. This is how a Terminator movie is done. I was at the edge of the seat the whole movie so was the rest of the theater. Not a peep or phone check in from anyone. I am really suprised of the low ratings so this is my first review ever. See this movie don't let the nay sayers prevent you. I am a huge fan of the original 2 movies. After seeing the trailer I thought the movie was miscast like the last one. But I was wrong. Casting was great. Also I was surprised to read that james Cameron wrote and edited it which I am not suprised because from the beginning I was pleasantly surprised. Tim Miller I think did a great job at directing. I will be seeing this in IMAX again. Only gave this 8/10 because unlike T2 this didn't have any lighter notes. And I miss edward furlong and terminator interaction. Also people say that this is girl power gender swap movie??? You have TWO male leads. I would be the first to call this feminist bull. But the feminism was not being obnoxious or shoving it down your throat. I didnt even notice it until I read it here. This movie is not and I repeat is not about being stronger than guys or women against men.,Terminator - Dark Fate

I almost didn't see this film based on the poor reviews and I am so grateful that my friend almost forced me to see it! One of my favourites this year.

So poor CGI, really? Who taken money for such poor job.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2458,E-Mol,"Fun movie, but how did this get green lit for being original?",6,12 November 2019,"I was very much looking forward to Terminator sequel since it was heavily hyped considering that James Cameron was on-board with the production. Action-wise was entertaining and what you would expect with a terminator film. Getting rid of John Connor in the first 5 mins is something surprising but didn't bother me as much as it did a lot of people, but that's my opinion.Now coming to the things I didn't like. The movie was claimed to be original and came from the vision of how James Cameron expected T3 to be. However, it was anything far from original. In my opinion, Rev. 9 feels like a derivative of the T-X from Terminator 3; liquid metal shell with an endoskeleton. Grace feels like a derivative Marcus from Terminator Salvation; humanoid or terminator hybrid. They claim that Legion is the new AI and Skynet is unheard of. However, it bears the exact same traits. Considering that this is the 21st century and almost everybody is aware of what is AI, IOT, Internet, operating systems, I am thoroughly surprised as to how the writers thought that Legion is something unique and not just a different iteration or revision of Skynet and that the audience can put 2 and 2 together? Also, the whole Carl angle was very far fetched. Living among humans, I am fine with. Raising a family, come on? They could have better used Carl and come up with some creative way to have him redeem himself in my opinion.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Apart of the second ..Guys .. you guys you don't get it, this movie is a direct follower to the second .. Who cares if John Conner dies or not, there is no need for him anymore - they stopped Judgement Day in the second movie life goes on and so does AI ..
The movie is about Sarah Conner og all of this business with the Terminators is personal for her - they killed her son!
If you guys had given this movie a chance maybe we would have seen the future and future fights in the upcoming movies .. This movie is how a Terminator movie should be - I hate T3 T4 T5, Im a fan of the first two and in the second movie we learn that they have been friends with people on the other side of the border so it all makes sense with the characters in the movie and the humor in the movie is ok there was a little bit humor in the second movie too - so they are really sticking to the first two movies ..
This has a dark atmosphere and great action like the way its supposed to be ..
It has never been a movie about John Conner remember that, its a movie about Sarah Conner dealing with the Terminators and a movie with Terminators ..
Go and enjoy this movie for what it is and not for what you expect, your expectations will be fulfilled later if they make more - I hope they do in the same pace as this one .. 😊",Terminator - Dark Fate

But, maybe someone or something survives this. I was disappointed in the ending a bit.I thought the action was really good and loved the fact they didn't use complete CGI during a little highway scene. Even shown from the trailers, there is a scene reminiscent of T2 which I thought looked wicked good. I was surprised how good that scene was during the movie. ""Woah...cool..."" is hard to say when you completely expect what is going to happen, but it definitely was. From all the acting in the movie, the only thing I didn't like was Linda Hamilton's meeting with Arnold. You'll have to see it to see what I mean.From an original perspective, we have kinda seen this before. But like some posts that I have read, this I feel is far better than all those released since T2. If you like action, this is a good film. The CGI is done very well and no expense was held back there. All in all, I left the theatre thinking...""that was pretty good'.It's not a Marvel film, or a Disney film (Star Wars...etc.etc..), nor is it going to win an Oscar.

T2 was an unbelievable film, because amazing effects but mainly because pre 1980/90 nothing of the likes had been seen before.

This latest story requires the audience to root for this machine later in the movie as he helps Sarah Conner defeat a newer time-traveling killer robot, but that is a very hard sell. Human nature makes it difficult for us to root for a reformed child-killer...so my enthusiasm was low as the rest of this plot was just another copy and paste job. Must've had JJ Abrams as consultant.This reminded me of that awful Alien 3, where after the epic battle Ellen Ripley waged in Aliens to save the little orphan girl, Newt, the producers of the sequel decided to open the film with Newt and the last surviving Marine, CPL Hicks, dying in a crash-landing...then killing our heroic Ripley with an inexplicable alien chestburster as it ended? WTF!!Are these unfamiliar Hollywood sequel writers fans at all...or do they secretly mock and resent those that embrace and elevate the mythology of fictional characters?

2486,florentineckert,"At the end of the day, it's OK but pointless",7,26 October 2020,"I don't really know what to say or where to start with this one. This movie does many things right and so much more wrong, but in the end I found myself enjoying it. Even if it requires you overlook a great deal. I guess I'll try to split it up into categories such as acting, characters, story, SFX and action.Acting: the acting seems to be excellent across the board, especially with Mackenzie Davis and Gabriel Luna both playing the characters sent back to the past. MacKenzie Davis plays a battle hardened soldier amazingly well and seemed menacing and dangerous when she needed to. Gabriel luna on the other hand plays the mechanical killer flawlessly. First he will be an unfeeling killer with unnaturally stiff and robotic body mouvements. Then he switches on a dime to a charismatic individual with natural body mouvements when playing the infiltrator to collect intelligence or gain access to something he needs. Both Linda Hamilton and Arnie bring their A game most of the time, but there were definitely moments that felt like both didn't really care and were phoning it in. Natalia Reyes is probably the hardest to judge as her acting seemed excellent at first but, once the action and story picked up, her acting seemed to become bland and uneven. Hard to tell if this was her or due to bad character writing and direction.Characters: They started off strong but then slowly became more and more inconsistent as time went on. Characters would have established character traits that they would then abandon at the drop of a hat. Or their characters would develop suddenly and we are supposed to feel like they've grown when there were no prior hints to these developments. This will make moments feel cheesier than they were probably meant to. Not enough to make a moment bad, but enough to take away from a moment. Instead of being WOWED, you feel confused and just shrug your shoulders and continue watching. The worst character to suffer from these inconsistencies has to be Dani. Instead of being a character, she is more of a mcguffin that acts however the writers needed her to act to steer the story in a certain direction. She's only ever as competent as a situation requires and only ever as brave as the story needs her to be to get to the next set piece. Sarah has a grudge that is handled very poorly and, while not abandoned per say, is only really given lip service instead of actions that that character would have probably taken. There is a character in here that pretty much runs counter to anything we know about them. And no, their explanation for why this character is this way didn't make sense. Grace was probably the most consistent and well written character.SFX: they felt pretty cheap, almost like a really good video game at times. Where this succeeds though is by not lingering on these poor effects to much. The special effects move enough or are kept in dark enough scenes that your attention isn't drawn too much to them. You'll probably notice it but then ignore the mistakes and move on. All in all I would say they were serviceable. They did do some pretty cool things with the terminator though.Story: This is probably the hardest section for me to judge. The story overall is pointless. It resets the stakes to exactly what they were before this movie. They kill or replace characters with other characters that serve the exact same role. Nothing is resolved and I'm pretty sure we won't get a sequel finishing this story. But that doesn't matter cause this story is just the old story and they already tried and failed to finish that one. It deletes all terminator movies except 1 and 2 from canon but still manages to make the events in both those movies pointless. This story feels like the writer didn't know what they wanted to do. Let's reboot the story, but instead let's not cause we have characters from the old movie and reference their events. Let's get rid of characters and go in a new direction, but instead let's not cause we'll replace them with an identical character with a different name and have them mirror the actions of the old characters they are based on. A prime example of this is that they got rid of skynet but now they have legion. They replaced it but it's still an ai that rebels against humanity nearly killing it and sends terminators to the past to ensure a savior never arises. Even the terminator skeleton is nearly identical. Why change it if you are not going to commit. Overall its not a bad story, just one we have seen already.Action: this is probably the best part of the movie and what will make or brake it for you. The action is well choreographed and well shot. The impacts feel weighty and characters that are not the rev9/terminator don't feel immortal. It seems like they can die and they most certainly get hurt. The set pieces are well thought out. It never feels like the action is interrupting the story because the director thinks you're bored and wants to wow you with nonsensical explosions and fights. That said, I don't know that you will come out of this with an action scene that will leave a lasting impression.Conclusion: If you can ignore a storys flaws as long as there is good enough action then you will probably enjoy this movie. If your expectations for the terminator franchise have hit rock bottom and you feel like they can't do worse or will never do better, you will probably enjoy this movie. If to this day you are a die hard terminator 1 and 2 fan and the sequels haven't degraded your love for the franchise, you probably won't like this. If character development and story cohesiveness are mandatory for you, you will probably not enjoy this. If you don't care about the terminator movies one way or another, you might like this. If you have never liked terminator movies, this one won't change your mind. Personally, genisys broke me and my desire to see another terminator movie. I saw the spoilers but had already guessed what was going to happen from everyone's reaction anyway and didn't care since genisys already broke me. With that mind frame I watched this and thought ""at least it's not genisys"". Honestly, I really kinda enjoyed it as a mediocre action flick.",Terminator - Dark Fate

You have to expect that the story is going to be choppy and make no sense. As I'm sitting here watching the movie I know that the story wasn't going to be good, but it wasn't really that bad. Worst part was Killing John Connor that changes the whole story pretty much No terminator without him, so I can see where you can be very mad about it. The CGI in today's movies we have to expect that it's new technology and fans somewhat want that and to be honest it really isn't all that bad. The Rev-9 terminator is dope!

2492,sliminator-25438,"Stop hating this move. IT WAS GREAT!, SPOILERS.",10,5 November 2019,"I am a life long Terminator fan, some may even use the word obsessed. Terminator 2 is my favorite film of all time and Arnold is a hero of mine. First lets start off with previous sequels post T2 so you can get a feel for my taste, T3 was pure garbage, other than getting to see Arnold as the Terminator, Nick Stahl's John Connor is one of the biggest movie travesties of all time and the PG-13 cash grab was shallow, predictable and a bigger let down than my 5th grade report card. Salvation was just OK, the biggest problem for me was the stupidity of the story line, capturing Kyle Reese knowing full well that he is John Connors father in the future, to lure and kill John Connor with one Terminator really makes me question Sky Nets superior intelligence. Salvation was still enjoyable with some great visuals and acting, but man did they miss an opportunity to make a really great film. Genesys, was OK, again another pg-13 cash grab, i loved the fan services and throw backs to the original terminator and Emile Clark was a great young Sarah Connor, The intersecting timelines were cool and seeing the 2 T-800's fight was fantastic. The downfalls for me were Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese, i have seen more charisma and better acting from a Tofu sandwich and the story plot with the infected John Connor is the equivalent of the Crystal Skulls in the Terminator Universe... Which Brings me to my point, now you know my taste and my thoughts. TERMINATOR DARK FATE! As a direct sequel to Terminator 2 i absolutely love this film, its a masterpiece. Seeing Linda Hamilton back as Sarah Connor sharing the screen with the t-800 again was so satisfying i can't even describe it. The return to R rating form was so welcome and necessary, i never questioned the motive of the makes to create a good film and not grab more cash. Killing John Connor at the start was a very bold choice and i personally thought it was incredibly clever and helped to add depth to Carl and draw a line in the sand with how separate the 2 futures are. Carrying out orders from a dead future really added to the hopelessness of a machine doing what it was programmed to do. The narrative from T2 was the Terminator learning the value of human life, what better way to do that than kill a child and reflect with your family and experience guilt and remorse for 22 years. That being said i loved the choice i know alot of people hated it, but for me personally it was perfect and really added to the depth of the terminator. I loved the humor, it happened organically, when Sarah shoots the T-800 in the chest and he is worried about explaining his wounds to his family was hilarious and the fact he is just a normal joe making his living with drapes was clever, organic and none of the humor was forced it just worked. The rev-9's charisma was such a breath of fresh air to the killing machine and he really felt like an undefeatable enemy. The protector Grace did such an incredible job and her story arc was great, i never doubted her commitment and she was written very well. the action, acting, story for me were all top notch. those that jump to quick reactionary hate, probably haven't thought it through, if you really think T3 was better, please re watch it and then fight me.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2493,dankearns-54578,When you try to make everyone happy. Nobody is,7,4 November 2019,"After the 1st 30 minutes my only complaint was how it began. It bothered me and just thought they could've of handle that differently. No spoiler so cant describe it but you'll know. Some ways I could've overlook it if the rest movie was like 1st 30 minutes but than it slows down.
Then the plot holes and more unbelievable barley livable thing happens 1 after another where these scenes loose their tension. Majority of your audience are white males and when you replace their hero with a ""woke one"" it's going turn then off. When you make dumb action scenes it's going turn off females that would fight for this hero. When you destroy the past you should let it go but this movies best part are when it holds on to past. Arnie was awesome. Intro was amazing after the part I cant spoil which brother any terminator fan. I want to say it's best terminator movie since t2 and prob is. It's difficult for me to like, when so many things that put me off or were just dumb. I rewatch 3 and 3 special effects look cartoony by today's standards and was beyond mediocre. Salvation had some cool things and I like bale but bright sunny future that looks nothing like dark skull piles we are used to see was dissapointing. Genysis was fun at the begining but butchard conner legacy. Wasnt fan of new sarah conner even though I love the actress in genesys. Effects were cheap at times during that movie as well.
Dark fate feels better but cant overlook the cheap pandering that falls flat. The augmentation was awesome at 1st until you discover their weakness which is more of crutch than not having a soul. Sarah Conner was great and so was Arnie which is disappointed that this movie tried to be both a reboot and pay homage and didnt learn from genysis that doesnt work. Make the augmented character a complete badass or dont make its weakness be so terrible. Didnt hate concept of the weakness but duration of its strength was the issue. Make sarah conner and Arnie the vocal points if their going be in the movie and make teenage John the goal. If it focus on one of those things rather than trying reboot and make sequal tends to fall flat and put everyone off. 6.5 out of 10. Great action. Good humor. Intersting concepts. Doesnt stick enough landing to be consider a worthy sequal. A fun action movie that insults franchise as much as it pays homage.",Terminator - Dark Fate

The detractors don't realise how their beloved T2 didn't take itself too seriously, it allowed itself the fun of being a blockbuster that gave the audience a reason to laugh and cheer. The sequels to T2 took themselves too seriously and thus over-complicated themselves with time travel nonsense and characters the audience doesn't care for.Dark Fate allows the audience to actually engage with a core group of characters no more numerous than a hand. We care for these people, just as we then care for their modern values. Such as a cyborg telling off a guard for over reaching in her private parts , as we are to that same cyborg telling off Arnold Schwarzenegger for questioning her robotity.This is an intense ride that a fan can indulge and escape from reality. Why hate such a brilliant conclusion to a classic tale. T2 was my childhood. The pinball machine, the empty swing after the nuclear bomb and the guy from cyberdyne systems who holds the switch on the bomb!! Dark Fate follows perfectly! And it allows Linda Hamilton line after line of kickass blockbuster revelry.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2499,hewvandergoes,I paid a ticket and I'm ok with it!,6,24 November 2019,"Not even close to the first two Terminator movies, But it's good to Have the opportunity to watch Linda Hamilton And Arnold Schwarzenegger again. More cgi and over the top scenes that I can live without..but maybe that's part of a racketeering scheme in the industry to inflate the budget..who knows!. Anyway..Some reviewers act as some kind of brat moviegoers, bothered by everything! -- avoid-- **SPOILERS**Linda Hamilton is an older woman, that keeps fighting Endless terminators in locations that she secretly receives, She is affected by his son's death, and do what she can as a fugitive, luckily for us..terminators selected Mexico so she kept fighting(you have to be creative as a writer to fit the story, and to include a newer hero of the future), We get ""two new models"", one really a kind of cyborg(with some battery limitations)..and the villain is kind of a mix between a t-800 and t-1000 model that can separate. This time: a new Artificial Intelligence company leads to the same machine vs human war, kind of makes you think that no matter the changes in time,the result will be similar and we'll get to the same problem with different leaders and villains(kind of a dark fate)..so it makes sense! Then we get Arnold, who was able to have a family, as hard to believe..well, it makes sense also, because the terminator bonded with John in T2 and showed some signs of understanding feelings and human emotions, so this robot later found more troubled humans that suffered, and needed the emotional support ..and this robot adapted and reasoned about what happened. Some people even disliked that the ""bad terminator"" tried to convince people speaking to them..Well, people forgot about ARTIFICIAL intelligence apparently, so it makes sense because is part of his programming, and robot tried to use it as a tool, so not big deal! Some scenes felt like a homage to T2 which ..even though unnecessary, I can understand it. So, I paid a ticket, because I love the first two movies and the idea of the story.. by examples with the other movies..I went with low expectations..and given that actors are older, I can't expect Sarah Connor to be as flexible as in T2, plus you have an alcoholic mom who struggled so much and at the end lost his son,living in a world that still menaced to be doom.. so what can you expect? -- English is not my first language, hope I explained ok some of my points of view about some of the negativity towards the movie.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Linda Hamilton return looked good on paper, but it turned out an unbelievable role, she was just too old by then. Her frail old arms looked like they would break by holding those guns, it was laughable. The tiny female chick was also unbelievable when you discover her true role, so it just destroyed the arc of the only interesting character in the movie, the hot cyborg chick, who did a great job acting, but it was in a poor story. Also, Arnie's jokes fell flat every time. Not a single funny joke this time. Mexican T-1000 was just another failure like always, not an ounce of charisma like every one after Rober Patrick.

I don't understand that issue either, the series is about man vs machine. Every iteration is basically a machine sent back in time to destroy the human whose fate is to save the human race. This time, the storyline no longer involves John Conner. I have to say that when this first hit theaters I couldn't imagine an older Arnold playing his iconic terminator, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at how they incorporated his character into the plot. I really enjoyed his performance and humor. This is an action-packed, breathtaking, sit on the edge of your seat ride.

So funny that they had to keep plopping the 'f' word in almost randomly to get the R rating! Have no fear Arnie is here somewhere.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2527,larsonchristiansen-40645,What could've been,6,30 October 2019,"The first two Terminator film's lore are ingrained into my psyche since growing up with them on repeat alongside other Arnie 80s action classics, Robocop and various other goodies. Full disclosure: I've not particularly enjoyed much in the way of the Terminator sequels since the untouchable first duo of big screen outings, with the quality from T3 onward ranging between painfully average and downright insipid.When it came to Terminator: Dark Fate, I was pleased that they'd finally managed to get both Arnie & Linda back for the main roles, but remained wary. Even with James Cameron back writing the story, I'd remained somewhat hopeful, but sceptical. It turned out my instincts were right. I really longed to love this movie, but - for all it's impressive destruction, engaging fights and car chases, it was the characters I knew like the back of my hand who felt like hollowed shells of their former selves. Word has it, both Linda and Arnie had changed dialogue written as they believed it wouldn't suit the characters, and this smacked of the main issue I had with this movie - the clunky (and majorly cheesy at times) dialogue, characters I knew that now felt off - new characters who I never connected with, and importantly a new 'Sarah/John' type character & her enhanced 'Kyle Reece' styled protector, neither of whom I particularly cared for at all.Of course, giving a 6/10 review - it wasn't ALL bad. For the most part, I enjoyed the action and the movie as a whole flowed very well. One big plus for this movie was the new 'bad' Terminator - aka the Rev-9. Although not as chilling as Arnie from T1, (or the T1000 from T2), he did a good job portraying the unrelenting nature of the single minded Terminator, in a modern setting where CCTV is on every corner and there is nowhere to hide. Also, the explanation of what has been going on with T800/Sarah since T2 (also the reason John isn't around anymore) was convincing enough to carry the movie forward.But for all the entertaining parts, it wasn't a movie saver, let alone a franchise reviver - unfortunately.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2528,rayr-25675,Garbage story,1,2 November 2019,"This is terrible, I was looking forward to it but have been so badly let down. Put it this way Arnie is a Terminator who is married, watches TV, changes nappies and has his own business. Do I need to say more? I mean who wrote this utter rubbish story? The Terminator 1984 is the best for me, Terminator 2 was good but it was the beginning of the cheese story plot that has carried on with these films since.

2532,ruppedl,Really not that bad,8,15 November 2020,"I didn't watch this movie for a year after it came out because of the bad reviews it was getting. But after the youtube algorithm shoved about half a dozen clips in my face, all of which seemed pretty solid, I finally decided to sit down and watch it for myself. And I gotta say, it's really not that bad.I enjoyed the whole film, especially the action sequences. The main antagonist is an absolute joy to watch especially. It is fast and ruthless. It really seems like a machine that is trying find the quickest and most efficient way possible to remove obstacles out of it's way in order to fulfill it's mission. I would say that it also has the best personality of any terminator to date.T2 is one of my favorite films of all time and is among the greatest sequels ever made. So of course if you stand Dark Fate next to T2 then it is going to fall short. But if you imagined for a second that T1 and T2 didn't exist, then you would be taking most of the negative points away from the critics, which mostly involve how the story isn't original.Bottom line is that it is a solid film. Don't be too hasty to judge it entirely on the films that came before it. Give it a shot, especially with some friends or family that aren't die hard critics and you'll probably all have a good time.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2536,jensen_vajee,A must watch for whoever watched Terminator 1 & 2..,10,26 December 2019,This is how the follow up movies should be. Classic Terminator 1 & 2 movie line with modern beat. Love it!!,Terminator - Dark Fate
2537,alexd-02213,Just awful,1,5 November 2019,"The worst movie in Terminator franchise. Even worse then Genysis.
1. CGI effects are poor, color correction is horrible. No realism in the picture your eye sees. You can laugh, but endoskeletons of T-101 (800) are much more realistic in T2. Moreover in Dark Fate, they are not original, but taken from Genysis! WTF? Why Genysis, if Dark Fate is the continuation of T2?! In the scene when Arnold is coming from the house (introductory episode) artists just moved his photo (!) without dynamic shadows... instead of making normal video-shot. It looks so poor, believe me. Almost all the explosions are awful, scenes with car and plane crashes look like a 3D cartoon or some  Marvel crap, not like a movie at all.
2. Rev 9 (new terminator) is a separate story - he is an emotional philosopher and joker, not a killer-machine at all. Robert Patrick as T1000 - is waaaaay better. Gabriel Luna trying to get his victim and not getting it makes an angry face like a teenager in the school fight... Is this reaction of a robot, or an angry boy???
3. The story of old T-101 is just ridiculous and nonsense! After fulfilling its task, it ""learns"" how to be a human. WHAT??? Why? It can just stay in some cave for the rest 119 years in the darkness waiting for his thermo-nuclear battery to go down, it is a machine! Nobody turned its chip into a ""learning mode"", so how can it decide something??? It decides to help, has emotions, tries to be funny. Arnold is acting like a grandpa with lame humor, not like a machine - huge dislike!
4. Natalia Reyes acts like a 10-year old dumb girl, who takes the most stupid decisions ever, absolutely not realistic acting. Linda and Mackenzie are the best performers out there. But sometimes Linda overacting, being a drama-queen.
5. About non-realistic physics, I will skip - there is nothing to comment on even. But when damaged Rev-9 is coming out from destroyed hydro-turbine - Dani starts to shoot him and kick his chin with rifle quite successfully, WTF? And then (!) Rev-9 is trying to strangulate her for 10 (?) seconds, being so strong before, it should be able to break her neck in a matter of milliseconds! Then she takes a power source and (attention) penetrates the eye of Rev-9 - yes, the bulletproof eye that couldn't be damaged before by bullets and explosions! It is TOTAL NONSENSE!
6. Music is poor, no real nerve-tickling metallic-taste music as in T2, just out of nowhere orchestra motifs.
7. If John was killed - the new leader appeared - Dani. So if Dani would be killed - another leader will rise up. There will be always a leader of the resistance, because from the chaotic crowd of people - always leader is elected, maybe even deadlier then John or Dany for AI (Skynet aka Legion). So the idea of sending a machine back in time to eliminate future leaders is losing in advance, and using it again and again in every next Terminator movie - is a dead end.THIS IS not a Terminator movie. It is some Marvel-like cheap superhero fairytale for kids or people with very low IQ, with messed up dates and storylines from T1 and T2. Who expects real atmospheric, dark, a bit depressive noire-movie as Terminator 1 or 2 - you will be completely disappointed.1 star, not more.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2540,f-07010,Witnessing the changes in Hollywood,7,10 November 2019,"It has been over 3 decades since the very first Terminator film created by James Cameron hit the theatre in 1984. I'm both thrilled and a little bit sad to see the old Arnold and Linda appeared on the screen together again in Terminator: Dark Fate. Despite the common plot, it's a good movie with all these spectacular special visual effects and thrilling fighting scenes. Well, I think it is intriguing as we can see some changes in Hollywood by comparing this one to the first Terminator movie.
The first Terminator is mostly about the terminator(who was played by Arnold) making every attempt to kill Sarah Corner(who was played by Linda) and Reese struggling to protect her. Sarah is weak and nearly break down when learning her destiny of giving birth to John who will lead the humankind to fight against the machines. But she has to accept it. However, in Dark Fate, being put in the same situation as Sarah, Dani chose to fight for herself and stood up to face her fate. I think she is a strong-minded lady. And Dark Fate features mostly on the three women who help each other and overcome many obstacles. The movie indicates that women can be strong and don't always need men to save them. Also, it breaks the stereotype that men are the core in a movie. This shows how Hollywood has changed over the past decades. It's the trend that women characters will be of greater importance. Interstingly, Linda's name comes first in the cast after the movie, and then comes the name of Arnold. But in the first Terminator, Arnold's name was the first to appear.
In conclusion, we can see the influence of feminism in Hollywood through Terminator: Dark Fate. On a personal note, I take it as a progress of our society.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2546,karamazovnew,I actually liked it.,7,3 November 2019,"To be honest I wasn't even planning on watching this, I didn't even know it was supposed to come out. But some friends insisted, I went along and... ok... NOT BAD!
I couldn't care less about the ""Terminator Franchise"", yes I've watched 1 and 2 in the 90s, then all of the sequels as they appeared. So why did I like this one?
1. Actors: really well chosen, I believe this is one of the issues with some of the sequels. Acting overall was solid and all characters believable. Linda and Arnie fit extremely well in a supporting role, and Mackenzie Davis quickly turns from ""meh"" to a highlight. Bravo to all involved.
2. Setting: I thought the Mexican flavor would be a nuisance, but it was actually one of the better parts of the movie. Maybe more could've been done with it, but... I'll take what I can.
3. Action: this is what you came for, isn't it? The first part of the movie actually beats T2's first part in terms of quality fights. The last part is a tad too bombastic, but the end is satisfying and very well made. C'mon, what do you expect from an old Arnie? Scene after scene I'd nod to myself ""not bad!"".
Special effects were top notch, the new Terminator has plenty of decent tricks and ""cool"" moments. There's something immediate and on rails about everything that happens. You know, how it should be when you're fighting against a machine.
4. Story: simple, logical, nothing Oscar winning, but it has a decent pacing, very few stupid lines or brainless decisions. Yeah, I could nitpick (like how is a loaded air Tanker supposed to catch an almost empty C4, especially in a climb), but there's nothing insulting overall.
5. Overall feel: I kept thinking to myself, is this a T2 remake? Maybe not, but it's a really good homage, clearly better than anything that came after Cameron's movies. Yes, you can feel the lower budget here and there, yes the story is a checklist (sometimes rushed), but overall it felt like a serious movie, without appearing like it wanted to be one.What didn't I like:
1. Although in the first part, the small scale and legendary lack of police makes sense for the setting, in the last part it doesn't. Not the worst offender in action movies these days, and it's a nuanced flaw, but I'll still detract a star for it.
2. Feels rushed in parts. Yeah, I get what's happening, but maybe one extra scene here and there, one line, one better joke, one better reply and it would've been more memorable.
3. Actually, that was it... Oh yeah, there's a thing about a girl not knowing how to drive that was pretty much useless and took precious seconds off of my life.So why all the hate? From what I gathered, there's some rage about feminist  mumbo jumbo, that I honestly didn't feel in the movie. Some also think that Terminator is a sort of ""Seventh Seal"" of movies. It was not, it never will be. Heck, it's not even ""Matrix"" or ""District 9"" level. But for what it is, Dark Fate was a pretty good watch for me. Actors, fights and special effects were good enough that, if you see any score below 5/10, they're crazy.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Davis, Arnie, and Sarah were great. Other than that this movie is filled with anti-Male heroes. Full of feminism bullcrap and politics. There is no character depth or growth. And of all things the T-800 has a family. It's a freaking Terminator. Sure, he can learn to be more human, possibly develop some form of consciousness. But to have a family. Complete idiots.

It was non stop action with some good comedy thrown in. Yes, The first scene of the movie really sucked and makes the first two movies pretty much pointless but it also opened a door to why a character turned out the way that she did.

And in the TV series he was in high school, and at the end of that he transported to the future, which showed that even if he was not even alive, they still had a resistance without him.

TDF competently follows the original idea and elevates the level of epicism to a new height. Tim Miller did an excellent job of bringing the franchise back on track and telling a story that will satisfy old T1, T2 fans, as well as introducing the franchise to a new audience.The film looks great despite some flaws. A new story makes you worry. The acting is awesome, Grace is awesome, Rev.9 is the perfect hunter and killer, and even Dani Ramos turned out to be a very convincing novice leader (especially in the scene of the future). Sarah and Karl are not inferior to new heroes and give fire, completely satisfying the viewer. A very interesting and worked out topic is the problems of assimilation of terminators and their existence in human society.The film sets the pace from the very beginning and keeps it to the very end, giving the viewer both a place for drama and a place for non-stop action of the highest class. Tim Miller gives us what many fans have been expecting from the franchise for decades.

But this movie was even better then then I expect redd it be given some of the put downs from the media. The clue is in the name the film is well dark the film is intense harrowing and thought provoking in many instances . And whilst Robert Patrick in many ways I will always be the benchmark The rev 9 is one scary adversary in many ways I think the plane Jane look of him makes him more scary as it mirrors Cameron's original idea of having a terminator that blends in.

2571,fieldy-60138,Disappointing follow up,5,24 October 2019,"I'm a huge Terminator fan, I re-watched both 1 & 2 before seeing this. Big mistake.I'm gutted to say that this film has none of what makes Terminator 2 one of the best films of all time. The writing is below par, plot uninteresting and emotional connection between the Terminator and John Connor, none of that either. James Cameron, what is this? Mind, I don't think he's been on form for a good few years now.What makes Terminator 2 an amazing film aside from the brilliant plot, amazing effects, great screen writing and superb acting is the emotional connection between the Terminator and John Connor. This is the life blood of that film and makes the viewer really believe that despite the hopeless future humanity is facing, if this Terminator can protect John then maybe mankind has a chance. The Terminator is a father figure to John and this is what connects the audience with the film so much. The heart wrenching ending cannot be forgotten. The fact that we forget the the Terminator isn't human because of how well the film builds the bond. This is what makes Terminator 2 so great, not the epic action sequences.So I'm sad to say this film has absolutely none of that. CGI, CGI and more CGI. Do away with the depth of character building, emotional connections and just add over the top action. It's a poor follow up and lacks everything of what made 1 & 2 great. The acting is decent, Davis, Hamilton and Schwarzenegger do a good job but they've got very little to work with here. This is what disappointed me the most. Why does it lack substance? This is James Cameron's epic creation and this is what he serves up along with Tim Miller? A total cash in if I've ever seen one. I'm not going to divulge into the plot anymore, there's no need as it can't even be mentioned in the same breath as the first two films.If this film was viewed as a generic action film at the cinema it'd still be mediocre. The fact that this is supposed to follow on from the brilliant Terminator 2 just makes it even more disappointing. This is James Cameron's judgment day.Do yourselves a favour and wait until it hits home release or if you are planning on seeing it, don't bother watching the first two beforehand, you'll be even more disappointed.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2572,jamesevans-83738,"Like a pair of worn, yet comfy slippers",6,24 October 2019,"So... Dark Fate. It's never going to be The Terminator or T2. It treads very familiar territory, there is nothing really original about Dark Fate. But it's like an old pair of slippers, yes they are worn, but they are comfy... however you know eventually you'll have to throw them out.Linda H is and always has been the main part to the story, so she is a welcome return. Arnie is, well Arnie is Arnie - great at what he does - and I am his biggest fan! I was glad this wasn't an Arnie led vehicle this time round and so as a supporting cast member it works so much better - he basically carries on the T2 Terminator feel as he becomes more 'human'... for me though Mackenzie Davis steals the show, she's badass and never looks out of her depth, even when delivering one or two dubious lines!My main gripe with it though was an over reliance on CGI. It's too obvious at times. A bit like Toby Maguire's Spider-Man, the CGI was obvious - so it is concerning that it doesn't seem to have advanced. I am old school though, a real practical effects kind of man. My other gripe is this Hollywood need to have it very female-centric currently - there is nothing wrong with that but they seem to want to labour that point. It is almost a Terminator for the feminist generation.However the action set pieces are brilliant (bar the obvious CGI moments of course). The plane scene I thought was going to be awful when viewing the trailers, was actually pretty good.The issue with every Terminator film since T2 is you are damned if you do and damned if you don't. Studios try and be original, but get called out for it not been very Terminator, so this one has gone back to its roots and cherry picked what did and didn't work in the first two films. I think I have read it somewhere before but it is true, this is very much the Force Awakens of the Terminator franchise.If this is to be the end then it is a more satisfying end than what came before but let's leave those slippers to the bin men now.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2573,kvcl,Not the best but not as bad as some say,7,24 October 2019,"Think some people have vented their frustration with giving this such low scores.
A realistic assessment would be that this 'T3' is not that bad. This isn't a poor movie, but T1 & T2 were so good in their own ways (akin to Alien/Aliens) that it would take something quite amazing to reach those standards.It required a better story-line and more time spent creating new characters that we cared about (lacking in most films nowadays).An enjoyable romp with probably the best part being the first 15 minutes or so, after that it regresses a fair bit. Gabriel Luna was great as the new terminator but not up there with Robert Patrick's portrayal.Enjoyable but you won't be blown away as you probably were with T2 but an entertaining 2 hours of your life.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2576,buzzer-56666,"Catastrophic, please never come back.",2,25 October 2019,"Realisation:
It's rubbish, we never understand anything about where the character are in some action scene. No mood, we can't feel any danger or tension.Music:
It's a Joke in comparison of T2. Brad fiedel was a genius here it's just ok for a budget movie.Scenario: If you are a fan of the Franchise stay away from this. It's so stupid. Basically the same plot points of T2 but without the philosophical issues and emotional charge. James Cameron turned his back from his fans. If you are attached to the lore of the Franchise, forget everything. The t800 is a joke, really, like a real one.
I went there with an open mind but i have the bitter impression that i have seen a political movie. I'am not opposed to that if the movie is good ( i loved Joker and i strongly disagree with its political message). i mean T2 was about a really strong women in the first place, we all love Sarah Connor. But here it's just dumb and this, ultimately does not serve the political message because of the plot inconsistency.Acting:
Linda Hamilton is okay and it's the only thing that save the movie with makenzie ( even if her character is not well written)
Arnold just came to take his paycheck, his performance is hilarious.
Natalia Reyes is transparent.
The rev9, gabriel Luna have no charisma, he scares no one, he is ridiculous.
But i'am all going to forgive them, given the emptyness of the scenario and staging. It's really not their fault.this movie is an absolute middle finger to the fans.
T2 was a masterpiece, this, is unforgivable. This can't be the following of the franchise, because of the inconsistency and basic common sense. Two major charachter have nothing to do with the story now, since after a major plot point in dark fate, Terminator 1 becomes a story about a waitress who got stood up by her boyfriend and go out eat a pizza. Basically a bridget Jones movie.I was complaining with Salvation but it was a far better movie. I was hyped because of James Cameron, i feel betrayed.As far as i 'am concerned, this movie never existed.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2577,commanderdarken,Almost as good as Terminator 2,9,27 October 2019,"Hello,
I've seen Terminator - Dark Fate 2x the first weekend (Friday 10/25 and Sunday 10/27) in Germany (english version of the movie).
All in all the movie has a good story, the actors are playing very well and sfx is very fine (perhaps a bit too much sfx).
The music could be better, but it is still ok.
As most Terminator movies also this has some nice quotes (""My whole body is a weapon"" - ""Save this for the ladies"").
REV-9 is more threatening as the T1000 in Terminator 2 and Luna Gabriel the perfect actor for playing this infiltrating killing machine.
The end battle could be a minute or two longer, but all in all the movie has almost the quality of T2.
Hopefully here will be an extended version of the movie on blu-ray and hopefully the movie makes enough money to make the other two parts of the planned trilogy.
Thanks for reading and much fun in Dark Fate.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2578,picturecellproductions-69423,Far better than I expected it to be.,8,25 October 2019,"As a massive fan of both Terminator & Terminator 2: Judgment day, I went into Dark Fate with fairly low expectations. The first two films (especially the second) mean a great deal to me and I constantly re-watch T2. There's a lot of creativity and heart in those initial entries and I firmly believe the films to be all time cinema classics.In regards to Dark Fate, I was relieved to find it was more on par with the first two films in terms of tone and pace. The acting was superb, especially Hamilton and McKenzie and I thought the villain (Rev-9) was ruthless, unstoppable and actually quite funny at times. I felt the stakes and got invested in the story and characters, something I never had with the other sequels (T3, Salvation, Genesis). Arnold was great and the re-introduction of more practical based set pieces truly elevated the cinematic experience, however like many modern blockbusters there was still an over-reliance on CGI in places and that did take me out of the film at times.However, as enjoyable as Dark Fate is, it still lacks the heart and originality of the first two films. I understand there's only so many places you can go with a story like this, but more risks should have been taken and less time spent on trying to set up a new trilogy. It's not without emotion, the ending definitely got to me more than I thought it would and I'll give the movie credit for that. But further reinvention was needed and more time spent making us care for the characters.In conclusion, I had a great time with this film. I loved the breathless nature of it, seeing Linda and Arnold back was fantastic and both shined in their roles. McKenzie Davis crafted a character I actually cared about and Rev-9 was unstoppable. I'll definitely be back to see it, I just wouldn't proclaim it to be an amazing film, because it isn't. But as a closing chapter in the original saga? I'll take it.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2579,xmightyjokerx,Decent movie,10,26 October 2019,"Very nice movie! The plot is a little bit confusing, and the storyline is not so well written, but there are great special effects! Sarah Connor is very charismatic. It's a pity that Arnold shows up only in the second part of the movie. I don't understand why some people are so furious and why they write such harsh critics! I think it's still better than Salvation and all the previous chapters (after T2: Judgement day). The first part was a little bit boring for me, but then I got really so emotional! Surely, it's not as good as T2 because nothing compares to Judgement day! I think Terminator: Dark fate is amazing!!!",Terminator - Dark Fate
2580,omeierbl,Not as iconic as T2 but still a good and entertaining movie!,8,26 October 2019,"I watched it yesterday in the cinema and I liked it a lot. It feels like a proper T2 sequel, taking T2's impact on the timeline into account in a plausible way (unlike any of the other sequels after T2). The pace of the movie is good, so is the action and effects! There are some great action and fight scenes. The storyline is sometimes a bit predictable, but that's not a bad thing (T1 and T2 were the same). Linda Hamilton rocks as expected, so does Arnold. And Mackenzie Davis is just brilliant! Arnold's T-800 backstory is a bit special, but it worked for the movie's story well, so I am Ok with that. I also liked that the movie managed to close a chapter and at the same time open a new one in a satisfying way. Overall a decent action movie, not as iconic as T2 but still great to watch. I certainly recommend it if you like the Terminator franchise.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2581,glynosmr,Sacrilegious!,1,27 October 2019,"Disgusting! If you're a fan of the terminator franchise, don't go anywhere near this film. I gave it one star because I can't give it zero. I also can't destroy the original copies ensuring that no-one will ever view them but, believe me I would. The first film was a cutting edge cross over of sci-fi and horror. The second was a brilliant encore that we couldn't believe. The others limped along but never repeated the brilliance. This film is the is the last curdled drops of a cow you should have stopped milking decades ago. I'm offended that you feel comfortable asking people who work so hard for the little money they earn to spend it on this garbage. But god forbid you take a loss and actually learn from your mistakes.

2582,joejobosa,Yeah. It's not good.,1,27 October 2019,I recommend getting a bootleg or waiting until it comes on one of the streaming services which should be in a few weeks. Many things wrong with it. I would have to list everything in the movie. I'm a huge fan of T1 and T2. I saw T2 opening night with a packed audience. Watched it a thousand times since and still love it. This is an abomination.

He gets replaced by a small tiny Mexican girl and that alone is enough to give a big finger to all the long time fans of the franchise.Like Ryan Johnson was to The Last Jedi, now Tim Miller of Deadpool fame is to Terminator Dark Fate. Both of these directors were given the opportunity to bring back these two major franchises and they both ruined it by killing of the characters that we wanted to see and replaced them with women, oh and they both publicly stated that they don't give a f#*@k.There has to be an agenda, something fishy is happening in Hollywood. Ghostbusters, Oceans 11, Batwoman, Star Wars, Terminator Dark Fate, and now James freakin Bond!Anyways, here is a brief summary to save your precious money: John Dies in the first five minutes, bad CGI, women arguing, women are mega powerful, Arnie is old and has a rather minor role, cause maybe he is a man, the women must take center stage of course, more bad CGI, bad humor, more fights, everybody dies except the tiny girl and Sarah, THE END.Yes John Connor is no more, Skynet is no more, Arnie is no more, FIN...:(",Terminator - Dark Fate

The storyline isn't what you would expect, however it is action-packed and goes very quickly. The opening scene was cleverly done, and could be considered emotional for those that have seen the prequels.All I would say was the storyline means future films probably won't lead on from this one, for which is found in the last part of the film.Overall, I would say it is certainly worth a watch, even if you haven't seen the prequels, as a brief overview is given in the opening and between characters.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Happy to go along with the time travel chaos and am used to the different films treading on each others toes, i felt the story was well reasoned and leaves enough to the imagination to leave the door wide open for future installments.
I was very pleased to see the playful nods to the old movies as well.
I'm sure a lot of men will feel threatened by the many female leads and quiet frankly they can go cry in a corner, this movie was a breath of fresh air of strong women, making their own destiny and kicking metal ass along the way.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2589,hernangnr-01996,Terminator is terminated.,1,29 October 2019,"Much has been said about this movie. That the return of Tim Miller and James Cameron would renew the franchise and offer us a good product, since all the movies after T2 did not hit the spot as people expected. But everything remained in an illusion: dark fate is as mediocre as the previous genisys. The script does not make any sense, the main story was changed to another that does not contribute anything, characters without charisma, without qualities to act as heroes or villains. The R rating does not correspond either, this movie does not transmit any sensation, fear, or emotion. I wonder what the producers of these films think, it is as if they were completely ignoring the important thing and ignoring the public that 20 years ago asked for a decent movie, in the apocalyptic future of t1 / t2 and with John Connor directing the resistance .",Terminator - Dark Fate
2590,baloobabi,Absolutely marvelous,10,29 October 2019,This movie was definitely one of a kind. A masterpiece. The action was truly amazing and extremely well.

2591,harry_berger,Sad..,1,3 November 2019,"Okay, first of all this Franchise should never become one. The Terminator was a perfect Movie. A brutal SiFi Action Movie/Horror Slasher. Arnold as one of the best Villains ever. And a perfect, sinister Ending. T2 did the impossible, and was the best Sequel we could imagine. After that it was over. No one needed T3. But it had some cool Action, and some funny Moments. But sadly way to much bad Humor. Salvation could have been good, but they screwed it. And Genisys had some cool moments, like young vs. old Arnold, but the second half was Atrocious. And now Dark Fate is Atrocious from start to finish. An insult to T2, and to us Fans. I have lost all my Faith (Dark Faith??) in James Cameron. First he praised Genisys. Then he said it sucked and this is the the new T3 and we should ignore everything from the other Sequels. But he steals all the interesting Ideas from those other Sequels !! A Endoskeleton with liquid Metal over it like TX from part 3. Also the fuel cell kill is from part 3. The Human-Cyborg from Salvation. And Papi Arnold from Genisys. And Cameron was the one who always complained about how they treated Hicks and Newt in Alien 3. And now he does the same thing with John Connor!! Unbelievable. The Rest is a Remake of the first two Movies, with bad CGI Action!! Worst Terminator Movie ever.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I found it's a decent watch.The premise the same as T2, and story ideas are the same. That's the disappointing thing for most people, nothing exciting on the story.

I had high hopes given the involvement of JC but this film does not make a worthy sequel to T2. Hamilton was especially a disappointment. I often use Sarah Conner as an example of a natural and unforced female badass done the right way, her and Ripley stand out in that regard as possibly the best 2 characters of either gender ever.

2601,ryanpreece-30264,"Repeating a great formula, reinvention for a new audience and another case of a 'missed opportunity'",5,1 November 2019,"So... first ever movie review on here, this is what the terminator has driven me to. I'll keep this super short. It's a terminator movie - chase scenes, survival, flash backs 'and forwards', slowly unveiling plot. If you're a fan of the original first 2 movies then you went to the cinema (like me) to support the franchise and see how the story develops - really badly I'm sorry to say without spoilers.I looked around a pretty packed cinema last night and literally couldn't spot anyone under the age of twenty Five - because they don't give a monkeys about movies like this. I get to work with a lot of teenagers in my profession and asked them all about this film - 'dad movie' was the response - and although both myself and my partner (we're 40) are huge terminator fans - we have to agree with that statement. There was no one under 25 in the audience. This is the real issue - it felt like it was intended for them and not original fans. Yes, there's some very obvious nostalgic nods in there to keep us original fans happy, but in short this felt like a reinvention movie for a generation of new fans that need simpler plots and almost gamification style concepts. Therefore - original Movie fans beware!
it reinvents the original movie timeline with an underlying respect to real world equality issues - yep - there's big walls - immigration and empowering women themes right throughout the movie - yawn - like we've not seen enough of this unnecessarily used. Terminator didn't need to do this - it has Linda Hamilton in it! The Ripley of the terminator world. I Personally couldn't help feel as though this movie felt subjected to themes of equality - and for the wrong reasons. Second issue - the new direction (no spoilers other than saying legion) is very very weak.So..what else is noteworthy here. Did I leave the cinema disappointed - No. it's a really decent film. I think people can be really overly critical. It's a really good movie - just sadly - it's not for me. It's not been made for me, the 'Now 40' year old who stole the terminator movie from his friends dad and watched it underaged with a bunch of my friends back in the day (which blew our minds).That's where the issue lies here. It's not for that generation, and everything felt as though it was going to be. Just like the new predator movie (which was diabolical) this is a movie that's sadly not for us and this is where I believe they are getting it wrong.My penny's worthFor the love of God - someone I'm the decision making process of movies please read this next bit. From one man who works in the creative industries to another - do your audience research and pick the option that's not about money - but the option that is about fans. This movie is getting comments like 'terminator is dead' and 'another lame terminator movie' and somewhat rightfully deserved. The story should now focus on Skynet - the terminator story should move towards war films - the story needs to live away from the connors - like Gotham is branding itself beside Batman. There is so much room in this story and it's being shuffled by selling the same formula a bunch of new audiences that simply don't care. This stuff really needs to be better thought about I'm afraid.In short: good movie? Yes, defiantly, if you're not precious about the first two. Good casting? wonderful to see legend actors returning alongside some great new faces who were excellent. Good plot? If you like the other two then you can't really say no - because it's a bit of carbon copy. Good bad guy: sadly no - worse terminator ever (and that's saying something... Helena).Bottom line: this felt like a total reinvention movie to encourage new audiences and do little for fans of the original through its substitution of a great concept for a much weaker one. The story focuses on the wrong aspects of the terminator universe because it's being written for new audiences, therefore I'm excluded.Bravo to everyone who came back together to set a false impression that this movie was going to be 'for the fans', you genuinely did a great job of making this. Personally, I think this couldn't be any less 'for the fans'.Reinvention movie that didn't need reinvention. Shelve it next to the ghostbusters and predator remake - as in - it's clearly not for you who fell in love with it first time around.Watch this movie if you want and great action packed sci-fi movie and you know little about terminator.Don't watch this if (Like me) you love terminator and want to see development in the timeline - you will be very disappointed. Hollywood ride over sci-fi survival horror (which is what made the first two so great).",Terminator - Dark Fate

2605,source-31728,Don't expect too much...,2,1 November 2019,"Ok, I was 8 years old when I saw the first Terminator in the Theater. It was literally one of the top 10 life changing events in my entire life. I went to the Terminator 2 convention in 1991. I saw Terminator 2 in 70MM at the Cinerama Dome, on the first showing on the first day it was released. Needless to say, the newer Terminators, 3, 4 and 5 have been pretty disappointing. I was hoping for more with this one (especially with James Cameron being involved of course) but unfortunately it was a pretty big let down. The intro starts out great, and within a few minutes we are involved in a chase where the bad Terminator is chasing the good guys in a large truck. Since this was reminiscent of the T2 truck chase, I was all about it, until...Mackenzie Davis throws a piece of rebar through the windshield of the truck, and the whole windshield shatters. Now, anyone who knows anything about any type of automobile windshield knows that every windshield is made of laminated safely glass, not tempered glass like side windows are. In fact, in the first Terminator, James Cameron setup an elaborate rig with a hydraulic arm with a fist on the end, that he synchronized with Arnold's movement, so that the Terminator was shown to realistically punch through a real windshield. They even made a fake brick wall which was mounted on a truck that drove by in the background to make it seem like the car was moving as he punched through the windshield. So, within the first few minutes, it was obvious that the James Cameron level of detail and type of filmmaking was not going to be a part of this film. And then the list of writers is like a mile long. Which means the story just got chopped up and rewritten and rewritten. And it shows. The character development and interaction is minimal. Some of the action is good, but everyone has seen thousands of action movies by now, so, so what? The music is forgettable. The only decent performance is Mackenzie Davis. Natalia Reyes felt like horrible casting for the part. It's always fun to see Arnold, but the situation they put him in was a bit ridiculous. And at one point the film gets apologetic about how in the original films, it was such a ""travesty"" that Sarah Conner's only job was to have the male who actually goes on to save the world. For once, I would like to see a movie that is just a good story. I don't need some lesson about climate change shoved down my throat. Or some recap about how some specific group has been under appreciated or mistreated, whether it's women, or some minority group, or whatever. Certain movies do well with these types of messages when they fit organically into the story line, but Terminator is not one of those movies. Until then, if you are a Terminator fan, this is probably worth seeing just because, but don't expect too much.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2606,thezenbass,The best since T2,10,2 November 2019,"I really enjoyed this film. Definitely the best since T2. The camera work, special effects and the score were solid. Watch this movie for yourself and DO NOT go by the critics, nor anyone else's opinion. I feel as any deep Terminator fan will enjoy this film especially with Linda and Arnold back at it. Who cares that the previous three flopped! It's done and over with already and time to move on from bashing them so much. Enjoy this film for what it is and go in with an open mind. This film moved me and I haven't felt this way since T2.",Terminator - Dark Fate

The writer was obviously not concerned about the million of fans that would walk out of this movie feeling molested. Of course the movie dealt with illegal immigration, amazingly tough women who might be gay but thankfully don't find out, guys that are pansies, and finally Linda must have smoked two packs of cigarettes a day for the last hundred years to get a Kermit the Frog voice. That was just gross. If you're a guy this movie is not for you. Don't waste your money. Hollywood, I'm a huge movie fan that has basically given up on movies because you're about pushing agendas rather than story writing. I would never see another terminator movie. Thanks!

The only reason I was looking forward to this movie was for Edward Furlong's John Conner.He dies within first few minutes of movie. Like myself and my entire group of family and friends, a bunch of others got up and left the theatre too, after ten minutes of movie.What a great way to crap on past movies. Why bother with T2, then? I rarely go to theaters and to see that mess, I won't bother wasting 19 bucks on a ticket again. Not impressed.I'll stick to T1 and T2 only. The rest are not to my liking at all.

2613,spbvrs,Nothing but disappointment!!,1,2 November 2019,"The film is a disappointment to another level. It is so stupid that I want to forget it.This movie is only filled with mindless action sequences with mediocre CGI.****Story sucks big time (There are so many writers for this movie that it just added more to the confusion) - Killing John's character never made sense. Linda's return as Sarah felt desparate . And in certain scenes, actors didn't even know how to react..it was plain dumb. One just could not relate to any characters. Hence there was no emotional investment unlike we had with previous 'original' installments -T1 and T2)If James wanted to continue his storyline post T2, only he should have written and directed it himself rather than asking others to ruin it up!!! This films' failure is majorly on him. This garbage was not expected.****Also there is no point of making more Terminator movies. Nobody asked for them in the first place. Please stop making more!!! The storyline has just exhausted and become redundant.***Fun fact- Two of Arnold's epic action Blockbusters(other being Predator) got ruined in storylines!!I just felt more bad for the movie's storyline than Arnold's death scene. It just aches my heart.Anyways, I hope this is the last time Arnold has played the eponymous iconic character because everybody is just tired of watching Arnold dying ....again and again and again!!!!This goes without saying - T2 is one of the best sci-fi action movie/sequel of all time - a timeless masterpiece.Thanks Arnie and Linda.For one last time - Hasta la Vista, Baby!!!",Terminator - Dark Fate
2614,edzapata,Loved it,10,3 November 2019,"I was absolutely absorbed into the story of Sarah Conner in T1 and T2 and in T3 Dark Fate I was similarly transported into this adrenaline rushed, heart pounding battle, while left with an even better sense of just how its our battle and it never ends. Its our condition. Its human courage that never gives up, not the Terminators. Perhaps we are doomed, as hinted at in T2 when John was talking with the protector Terminator. Its seen again in Dark Fate. And it all fits so well, the universe of choices we make, Sarah or John Conner or Dani or Grace even a machine that finds new purpose. Beautifully stitched together.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2615,jimmynunchucks-76630,Really disappointed.,3,3 November 2019,"I will start by saying that I had high hopes for this film after hearing about the return of original cast members Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger. I watched the film a few days ago and was bitterly disappointed within the first five minutes of watching the film. All this film ended up being is another dull action movie with a broken story.WARNING, SPOILERS ON NEXT PARAGRAPH!I read that Cameron and Miller had severe differences on the direction of T:DF. You'd think that after three failed films (3, Salvation and Genisys) they'd have enough examples of how NOT to make a Terminator film. Why in the hell would they off John Connor and remove Skynet from the equation? And no mention of Kyle Reese at all? This is supposed to be TERMINATOR. Tim Miller should have just called this movie ""Artificial Intelligence: The Beginning"". Tim Miller is just another cash-grabbing and corny action movie guy that has further sodomized the Terminator franchise. As far as I'm concerned, the series ended after Terminator 1 and 2. Save your money and your time and don't watch yet another flashy Hollywood film with unrealistic and drawn-out action sequences, with some of the worst story writing. There's so much more that could have been done with this film's story that would have made for a much more interesting movie for fans of the original Terminators. Why not make a movie that's set in the future after Judgement Day, that explores John Connor's role as leader of the resistance and his relationship with Kyle Reese?",Terminator - Dark Fate
2616,shamilmammadof,"Shame on you, people who ruined the best first 2 parts of Terminator.",1,3 November 2019,"Before watching this movie, I was thinking that nothing can be worse than the previous part. But it was the mistake. This part not only buried terminator franchise, but also ruined the original idea of the first two parts. From 3rd part you started killing the franchise, in the previous you finally killed it, but in this part you raped dead body.

What a mistake that would be! Such sad times we live in, everybody has a right to troll and share their toxic opionion. The movie is action packed all the way, just what I expected it to be, tons of tense, nonblinking scenes, andrenalin rush just like that! And Arnie humor haha!! Wouldn't miss to see it in the cinema for the world!",Terminator - Dark Fate
2618,nevanna,"Excellent Movie, Back to the Heart",8,4 November 2019,"Sarah Connor was always the heart of the resistance. This movie takes us back to her, and to message at the core...that WE are the makers of our own fate.I've been a fan of the originals since I was little. As a child I was always baffled by the obsession with John, we could SEE that Sarah was the true badass. This movie even cleverly makes a nod to that, with the now senior Sarah saying she's sick of being Mother Mary anyway.I'm sure lots of closet misogynists will hate this movie. It's very female centric, and so what if it is?Plenty of explosions too.I'd say this is the only Terminator sequel that's worth watching.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2619,espavicks,Open your heart and remember what you felt in Terminator 2...relive it,9,4 November 2019,"Great movie! Fantastic visual effects, story could have used some originality as it follows the same thread as all the previous ones but let's not forget it is made by Hollywood and Hollywood is always ever so predictable as they follow the general themes of what they think appeals because they cannot think differently. Nonetheless, it delivers. The Action is just as realistic as real life and none of that xmen or bond hits that don't deliver blood nor bruises. One thing that is different is this time we get to experience a human (enhanced of course, how else would she compete against these merciless machines) protector rather than a machine. Her emotions are transparent and palpable to make aware on screen for that is the very essence of what makes us human. The climactic ending rekindles past emotions felt as a kid witnessing ""Aaaanuld"" go down into the lava looking substance to sacrifice himself in Terminator Judgement Day. Now, as an adult, I found myself reminiscing on it as tears flowed down my cheeks. Overall, I recommend it especially if you are a fan of the franchise! If you are a women check it out, and feel the power that surges from fighting through adversity. If you are a huge fan of the franchise, watch it with an open mind and appreciate that the one thing that is always constant is change, that is the only thing we can count on. Appreciate the franchise still going and the actors that were there in the beginning & also there in the end...and the end it may very well be if it considered a flop. If anything, watch for these iconic Terminator actors, as it seems it will be their last time a part of what made their careers. Be grateful we're not living in a world being overrun my machines...yet",Terminator - Dark Fate
2620,jpoke,A *welcome* rehash,7,5 November 2019,"The consensus seems to be that the last three Terminator movies not under the aegis of James Cameron were not very good. My memory is a little foggy, but as I recall, Salvation had no character development and Genisys had a plot with so many silly twists it left audiences dizzy. I don't really remember Terminator 3 well enough to remember what was wrong with it.Dark Fate may not be a full return to form, perhaps in no small part because it rehashes (and occasionally exaggerates) old scifi / action movie tropes established in the 80s. But one thing Dark Fate does do is to reunite Cameron, Schwarzenegger, and Hamilton in a pleasing way, and in my opinion it accomplishes something the last three films in the franchise failed at, which is entertaining audiences.Is Dark Fate a groundbreaking new movie? Not necessarily.Is Dark Fate a stark reminder that entertaining movies are more than just scenic dystopian landscapes and special effects? In my opinion, yes.It's possible the bad reviews this movie has accrued so far are here in part because the movie has political slants, and the leading actors with the most screentime are women. For anyone reading this who wouldn't be bothered by that, I suggest taking the bad reviews with a grain of salt.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2622,ameerf,SPOILER ALERT of crouse. Boring movie with 3 action scenes,5,6 November 2019,"When we think of Terminator we think of skynet, lasers shots everywhere, naked attractive people falling from sky, lots of strengh showcase and Arnold taking the lead in more action that will keep you to the edge of the seat.
This movie on the other hand, gives you a tiny sample of each but gives you full plate of dead air. Yes, quiet dead air with lots of emotions and drama that has nothing and will never live up to the terminator world. Grace doesn't make sense with her abilities and inabilities. Wrinkled up sarah conor wasn't necessary and played no useful rule other than shouting. Arnold came too late with a dull background on his current life. None of this should've been picked to happen to a Spanish woman in Mexico JUST CUZ you thought: ""okay we need to switch things around and pick a random woman on the planet, but lets just pick mexico and showcase illegal immigration like its normal"" apocalypse happens around the whole planet, you could've picked USA by default or actually got creative and picked somewhere lots more random. Not sure who T800 ended up in Texas.
In conclusion, you ruined a great piece of art, a childhood memory we all lived by. A strong tall buff Arnold that kicks machines around. Skynet AI thats so smart it predicts calculations very accurately, plenty of skynet soldiers, amazing action sets and lots of thrill. You took it all to the ground and wrapped it up in a boring dead air movie that won't have any interesting sequels, killed the main reason we watched it and took it go the dumpster.

2623,jlg-19538,Make your own opinion!,9,6 November 2019,"I've read reviews saying don't bother watching this movie or stating how poorly it was written or executed and I have to say that's crap. The movie had me on edge and surprised from the very start. I believe everyone from the writers to the actors sold the story brilliantly. Now having said that, was this movie like the classic T1 and T2 movies? No I don't believe it is. Not because it's a bad movie or because the others were in someway better, but because this movie was able to take this one in a slightly different direction. You had to pay attention to what the characters were saying because they gave you a lot of information. I felt the story had a lot more of an intellectual element to it than just action action action. The moments in between the action had a lot of story to tell and then think about and piece together as the movie goes on. To me this movie was about more than 'Stopping the Machines' as it was in the first two movies. I feel this one is about humanity and the amazing strengths that human beings have.So I invite you to make your own opinion on this movie, because truthfully everyone is going to view it differently and in the end it's all an opinion so why not make your own. Though I will say that my mother and I watched it on November 5 and we were hooked from the start and we continued to converse about it for at least an hour or two afterwards. So I would most definitely say this movie is NOT a waste of time.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2624,imranchowdery,VERY DISAPPOINTED,2,6 November 2019,"Before writing this review i would like to say i am a fan of the first two Terminiator movies and a huge Arnold fan so any half decent terminator movie made would have made me happy. before i went to see the movie i heard it was better than all the subsequent terminator movies made , unfortunately it was just as bad if not worse than all of them.Grace is sent back as a protector but needs protecting herself and constantly needs injections pumped up are to keep her going, i know no terminator protector as been as advanced as the evil one but come on this was a complete joke. i dont blame the actor did the best what she was given but what a stupid role.Arnold was given a stupid character in this movie to A DIAPER MAN WTF!!!! REALLY !!Linda Hamilton has no real meaning to the movie as her son is killed off at the beginning so whats the relevance of her being alive and why is she still important as she has cannot really help the future with her existence.WEAK STORY LINE STUPID CHARACHTERS NOTHING GOOD TO SAY ABOUT THIS",Terminator - Dark Fate
2625,bradboycola,Fun ride with alot of problems,6,6 November 2019,"This film is a fun and thrilling ride from beggining to end to the amazing and sometimes overwhelming action scenes to the characters we know and love and characters we are introduced too however the changes they make to the film is that what makes it confusing and somewhat unneeded in the film the first problem is the start wear thay kill of a majour character which is john conner before the title screen even arrives a terminator just shoots him 3 times in the chest and hes gone when i saw edward ferlong in the cast list i expected a older john conner and what i thought would be cool is that hes basicly a male sara conner however he was nothing to this movie but to add to saras character arc in the movie dealing with her loss the only part i felt for her during ger times mentioning john is when she mentions that she is forgetting how he looks because they wanted to be safe by taking no pictures of him because people would think how that felt if that happened to them however thats it they didnt make it a big deal of the movie after they killed him at the start which was a bad idea making terminator 2 the greatest movie ever made said by some people the whole plot to protect john conner pointless thanks to dark fate.The other thing in this movie they messed up was removing another important plot element to the series and that was skynet and replacing it with leigon and wasnt really explained why the whole time of the war against the resistance and skynet in the movies before felt waisted now it felt like a new timeline without the leader being john conner and how much they expanded it then just to throw it away didnt make me care about the next judgement day and making the terminators changing there desighn from silver and iconic to black and forgettable the main villain doesent have a T like the others T is for terminator T800,T1000, TX they changed the name to REV9 what does REV mean revanator? Thats why its not as good as the T for terminator also why are there teeth black.The last big problem is that the plot is a mix between the first too terminators but what movies do with popular franchises is replace them with a female cast sara conner is the only person that belongs in this group and the other two characters are a female version of characters we have already seen grace being a female kyle Reese and the mexican woman being the female john conner i mean they do call him the john conner of the next judgement day and thats all the big problems.What i love about this movie is the acting the acting is pritty much spot on with sara conner being as badass as she was in the second movie and the cast putting on a great performance but what i loved the most was arnies classic terminator and how perfectly he portrayed his character of a terminator that has grown a conscience after his mission was complete and skynet was no more he made the terminator act like a termator but slightly human from his grown conscience which was done amazingly the only character that was meh was the rev9 not that he was bad hes basicly the T1000 from T2 just his abilities are slightly different which his abilities was almost cool.The final thing to talk about is the ending which was not bad but was a mix of endings we have seen before final battle area that looks like genysis the T800 sacrifice from T3 sticking a body part from thr future to kill the main villain and graces death aka just like kyle reese from the first terminator and the two survivors being just like termimator 2 sara conner and the female john conner which made the ending expected and mediocre.So its a good movie for people who enjoy a action and thrilling ride but may disappoint the hardcore terminator fans such as myself.",Terminator - Dark Fate

The Original ones (T1 & T2) will never be topped I think everyone would agree that as a fact!All in all I enjoyed Dark Fate, its not an amazing addition but it is very far from what a lot of people are saying. It has some similarities to T1 but I like what they have done with both the hero and the terminator that were sent back, I enjoyed how the 101 model was written in and the part that was played.In summary could it of been done better?

2629,Stravanov,It's a really good sci-fi movie and a worthy successor to T1 and T2,8,7 November 2019,"A lot of interesting themes about computers, robots and AI and their relationship with man were being explored. This was an entirely new theme of the time, so making a quality movie that touched the themes in a meaningful way was in itself a characteristic that made a movie ""good"".During this period, movies also underwent a transformation. We gradually abandoned a world where movies depicted an idealised world. And moved towards a world where movies, especially in this genre, depicted the brutal reality and made us uncertain whether human life is a tragedy or a blessing.Terminator 1 and 2 were released right in the middle of this transition period and made important contributions to it.But we are no longer living in that world. The themes that were considered ""artistic"" back then are no longer as special. We changed as well as the movies that touch these themes. They're now baseline. We no longer need to turn to the artists to help us during this transition.All the previous reviews on Terminator: Dark Fate seem to forget that the world has changed. They don't understand that we live in a time where giving us the same existential experience that we got with the first two Terminator movies is no longer possible. The TIMES have changed. The quality of the movie hasn't. If Terminator: Dark Fate was released in 1991, it would have gotten the same status that Terminator 2 enjoys.
****Actual review****
Terminator: Dark Fate is a quality sci-fi movie.The effects are good. The action scenes show us the brutal strength of the soldiers of the dark future, but they're not overly exaggerated.In certain franchises, the reappearance of very popular characters often feels forced. In Terminator: Dark Fate, the reappearance gave depth and meaning and allowed the movie to touch some philosophical topics that it otherwise wouldn't. I wish the movie did a little bit more work in this area, though. But I definately don't think that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Linda Hamilton were only written into the film as posterboys.With regards to the acting, I have to mention Mackenzie Davis. Her character was my anchor to the movie from the beginning to the end. I felt her ups and her downs and shared her doubts and anxieties throughout.
With regards to the other actors, I feel like the writing didn't really allow for them to shine. There are some topics and areas of personal development that could have been expanded upon, which would have really make Terminator: Dark Fate a masterpiece. While it annoys me that they missed these opportunities, it doesn't make the movie bad in any way.Another aspect of the genre that annoys me slightly is the tendency of writers to use the same idea over and over. In Star Wars I can't even remember how many times they used the ""Death Star superweapon""-idea. Terminator's version of this is the Killbox. I wish writers would try out a new idea sometimes, in stead of using the same idea over and over.In these days it's also worth noting that it didn't feel forced to have 3 female protagonists. The women are physically weak and have actual female characteristics. It's not like in certain other franchises where it feels like they wrote the script for a male, but just replaced him with a female because reasons.But all in all, I was very entertained. Movies that stand out to me make me feel and think about philosophical topics. Terminator: Dark Fate made me leave the cinema with existential anxiety and certainty that humankind will eventually engineer their own demise. To me, this is what the Terminator franchise is all about. So despite my negative comments, I feel like this is a very worthy successor to the masterpieces of T1 and T2.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Begin:
The bad Terminator, is a mexican immigrant....
I think they do it to kick as Trump, but ok, the story plays in mexican and the us border
During time travel he falls down 3 or 5 floors and is doing moves. Pffff.....She, the good Terminator, isn't a terminator, like Terminator part 1.
But an enhanced woman....
She can fall down a bridge and is just shaking to feel good again.. oh my gosh...Later in progress of the film, Sarah Connor appears suddenly and fights against the Mexican bad terminator ....
In a quite minute the three girl can talk with each other. Sarah is now a broken woman after her son died, the old T800 (Arnold) wa successful in this timeline....
She is now an alcoholic, but she is quite good in handling guns, to do kickass some terminators....
The ""old terminator"" (Arnold) has his mission accomplished and is now back. Arnold developed a conscience and is now sad..... He camouflaged as a stepfather with a single mother and her son.....
He is also working as an interior designer...... He wants to help humankind now on every layer....During the main film, they had some nice fights and very explosive shootouts, but overall the worst part ever of the whole series.Short before showdown, they really hit it, not John Connor is now the future leader of the mankind, now the latin girl which was the hole time crying is the future leader... ok dad and brother died in one day, but changing between 3 days to a leader, oh dear.....Classic: get woke, get broke
Whole story line is turned over and broken. Part 1 and 2 were the best. Part 3 was already weak, with part 4 & 5 they tried to tell the story of a near alternative future. It fits all in all from part 1 to 5.
But part 6 is a whole deaster....",Terminator - Dark Fate

It was a great and awesome spectacle based in Terminator Uniwerse. Linda and Arnold made a perfect show. Arnold was also very funny. Tim Miller did a great job as a director. I can't do a spoiler here because some scenas were to long and some to short. Yes I can understand people who blamed at this movie. There one thing which they should do but they didn't do. We need completely new story based in Skynet world. Despite the movie is made perfectly it clones to many things from previous movies.,Terminator - Dark Fate
2635,nthomas-07461,A Better sequel at least,7,11 November 2019,"Went in to watch this movie, hoping it would have better writing than the previous film. It was honestly a bit better than I expectedI really like the the introduction (well for the first 5 minutes). Then the story tried to make a shocking moment which was kind of a mistake. (Now I've seen terminator 1 and 2 and those films can't be and won't be touched). Killing off John Connor critically hits the franchise. I understand the story tried to do something that makes a switch up with a franchise by adding new characters, but this could've been handled differently (In my opinion). I know alot of people are lot more angry that John Connor was killed off in the first 5 minutes because it kills the franchise. For me it was shocking that John Connor got murdered because he was one of the very core old franchises I thought it would never happened. When someone very important towards the franchises dies, its kind of a bold move for the writers would do because that leaves them a challenging spot on how to make a great story line. The story line wasn't perfect but it was definitely not bad.Linda Hamilton was perfect in the movie and I'm glad she returned. The new characters were definitely interesting as well. The villain parred up to the same mentality as the T1000 as well which is what I like. The action is what I expectedAfter the 5 minutes, they didn't waste an opportunity on character development on the new characters as well. Its good that John Connor was still mention and the motivation for Sarah hunting down the terminators. The story kinda feels the same as the first terminator (which is a good thing and a bad thing).
The good thing about it is that being hunted by a cyborg from the future story line brings some vibe into it. Even the action is way more crazy than the first film and they introduced new characters into it.
the bad thing about it is that it is kinda the same vibe thing over and over again. Also the fact that they replaced Skynet with Legion feels cheap because the name ""Legion"" sounds like a group of people. The name Skynet sounds better because it sounds like a software that can control technology.
The story line is decent and has better writing than the previous. It also doesn't confuse the timeline as well. Arnie terminator or should I say ""Carl"" character was kinda off because the terminator is suppose to be a robot that has to have a command. (I'm talking about after he killed John Connor). But at least he brought the story line up more. As for the new 2 female characters, they at least brought some meaning into the franchise as well which is what I like about.
So if I had a specific rating for me it would be 7.2/10. The movie doesn't confuse the timeline of the terminator franchises at all (unlike the fifth). Even though the franchise should've stopped at the second movie, this one feels like a decent sequel to the second terminator movie. Its not perfect or a masterpiece like the first 2 movies, but at least it has a decent storyline, though the franchises still needs some work in terms of writing and plot. Should you still see the movie, yes
Do the actors have good acting, yes
Is the action more insane, yes
Is the story line good enough for long time and new comers of the terminator franchise, for me yes. For you guys, I will let you guys decide.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2636,mylubblythoughts,Great movie I recommend you see it,10,11 November 2019,"10/10 all the way I loved this movie.There's a ton of salty people all in their feelings who are trying to prove a point, and do their best to bury this movie without even watching it. All the complains are mostly BS from whinny ""I didn't watch watch it because of AGENDA"" people blowing hot air while very few are valid, and come from the few people who have watched it.All I can say is don't have ""sheep mentality."" If you want to see this movie go see it, and judge it yourself. Form your own opinion about it since you have a brain of your own. So if you like it then you like it, and if you hate it you then you hate it. Just don't be a mindless parrot blowing hot air out your A. S. S!I personally loved it!There was never a dull moment. I loved that it was action packed, and thrilling to watch. Keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen next, and if they'll even get a chance to breathe like dang!!!The Rev9 stole the spotlight along with Grace (if you watch the movie you'll know what I mean). I absolutely loved them!Arnold, and Linda did amazing as well! I won't spoil anything at all.10/10 all the way. I am definitely watching this movie again!",Terminator - Dark Fate
2637,davidrjewiss,Hands-down a brilliant Terminator Movie - Sod the haters!,8,11 November 2019,"As a big Terminator fan I've seen them all from T1 through to Dark Fate and, personally I loved Dark Fate. I'd happily write off all the other ""sequels"", this follows T2 perfectly.You could feel Cameron's influence mixed with a new approach from Tim Miller but still retaining that dark feel we got from T1 which was sorely missed from the other Terminator movies since.*SPOILER ALERT* All of you who are over John Connor being killed at the start, get over it! It needed to happen, have you seen Eddie Furlong? Also Skynet/Cyberdyne is no more and John was just a ""normal"" kid after the events of T2, probably a little bit mentally scarred but hey. He's not important anymore, and to compare him to the what they did to Luke Skywalker in TLJ is totally laughable, you lot need to get your heads tested seriously! Rian Johnson destroyed Star Wars and Luke was MUCH more of an important character than John Connor in this film series...anyway I digress.Ok it was no T1 or T2 but I personally the film had all the right action, nostalgia and an awesome story and it was so good to see Hamilton and Schwarzenegger on-screen together again, it felt like a proper Terminator movie.The Rev-9 was a force to be reckoned with and genuinely gave you that terror that he's coming for you which, even I felt, T2 onwards lacked, the T1000 never bothered me at all, not like the T800 in T1, that was all kinds of evil!Anyway, don't write this movie off and don't rate it a 1-star, it really doesn't deserve it, it was much better than what people are saying about it and if you're a genuine Terminator fan I would definitely say go and see it!! This is the sequel to T2 and it is absolutely brilliant, not perfect, but brilliant!",Terminator - Dark Fate
2638,greasykid,Unwarranted Backlash,7,12 November 2019,"Seems like literally everyone's a critic these days, huh?Terminator: Dark Fate is guilty of almost everything that people are now ""accusing"" it of. Yes, it kills John Connor in the opening few minutes. Yes, it rehashes the plot of a superior movie in T2 ...But the one star reviews are nothing short of ridiculous. Viewing it as a continuation of the Terminator story, yeah, it's not the best in the franchise. But it's certainly the best of the sequels that have followed T2 so far. not a very high bar, people say. Yeah, maybe so.But T:DF is undeniably an exciting ride, with slick special effects, great set pieces, and a decent storyline, penned by James Cameron himself. Seriously, if you want any continuation of this franchise at all, you need to allow Cameron to tell his story.The backlash aimed at this movie is absolutely ridiculous. I'm not going to claim that it's a masterpiece, but to me, it feels like most people are jumping on board with the one star reviews just to seem relevant and superior.This movies does for Terminator what The Force Awakens did for Star Wars. The Force Awakens got it's fair share of criticism, but in general, people gave it a CHANCE and were a little pragmatic about it.Again, if we want the story to continue, we need to introduce new characters and tell the story from their perspective. John Connor is dead because they TRIED to keep him alive, and found it impossible to tell the story believably. So Cameron has moved on and brought us a sequel that reboots the franchise.If you don't want further sequels, fine. Don't watch. But this over the top reaction from people is going to serious impact Cameron's chances of even getting the opportunity to tell the 3 movie arc that this installment has started.On it's own merits, this movie easily deserves 6 to 7 stars, and people whining about feminism and the derivative nature of the plot need to stop pusing their own narrative and realize that almost EVERY movie is derivative in one way or another.Again, watch it or don't. But giving overly negative reviews helps no one.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Arnie's dog? Come on we need to know dogs can protect us by giving advance warning of a T.All in it was entertaining, then a bit yawn worthy for a while ""oh not another battle"" and I feel the directors could have cut 30 minutes out and perhaps turned out a better movie.Like my teachers used to write in my report cards ""Could do better""",Terminator - Dark Fate

2644,kanglingyid,"the real termination, cause he won't be back.",4,18 November 2019,"This time it really the termination, cause he won't be back.With little John died at the beginning, more or less meaning that ""Dark Fate"" denies the previous three movies where the end of the world hasn't been avoided, just delay. Cameron (producer and co-writer) back with director Tim Miller (Deadpool) drag the Terminator back to the track, directly picks up after the Terminator 2: Judgment Day as in another way it is considered as the real sequel of the Terminator.The story flashes forward to the year 2020, where an enhanced human fighter Grace (Mackenzie Davis) is sent from the future to protect auto worker Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes) from a Terminator Rev-9 (Gabriel Luna). They are later joined by Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton), who has evolved from the sunshine girl in ""The Terminator"" (1984) and the fierce warrior from ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" (1991) into a solitude, bitter alcoholic ... but one who is still the most impressive hero in the film. Eventually, they meet a seemingly reformed T-008 Carl (Arnold Schwarzenegger).The film plot develops fast without giving the audience a breath, keeps the pacing and tone of the first Terminator. The road-movie structure, with its destructive freeway chases and its travel through the desert; and the balance of characters' attack suffered extent. From the sky C-5 flight chasing to the under-water hunting, it tries to refresh classic with shocking visual elements. The main fights carry out at night. In short, this is a Terminator film that feels like a proper Terminator film.The Installment -""Dark Fate"" has its limited. The core never changes: go back to the past to change the future; Same plot construction only naming differently, Legend to Skynet, John to Dani. No time to build new character but follow the ""holy rule"" innocent girl, protector, and the killer. This installment lacks the advance-tech of the first film or the revolutionary special effects of the second. All it set only for the reunion for Hamilton and Schwarzenegger. When it comes to the part that human over-reliance on technology the movie solve it by showing robots took people's job away or stupidity of the military-industrial mix; When they talking about why the ""Judgment Day"" arrived, it just follow the need of plot rather than why it comes to this stage. As simple as the future is UNKNOWN so you must alive, the reason for why this future is always touch and go.For this time feminist take on the ""Terminator"" ingredients. In fact, it has never been absent, from the beginning of the Terminator franchise, it developed along with the trend of feminist, which awakening in the 19th century and mature in the 20th century. In such an environment women were proud of the heroine of Terminator is connect with the fate of the world. Men are obsessed with heavy machinery and perfect special effects in the film. Together they made it achieve unprecedented success. On the surface ""Dark Fate"" has jumped out of "" Male Gaze"" implant a strong feminist icon lead by Grace enhanced human fighter can turn everything into weapon at her peak who has fight into people's heart, Dani a representative of female leaders and beliefs, Sarah old but a domineering powerful warrior together three form a strong ""iron triangle"". Still, they need to save by sacrificing T-008. What can we get from the plot setting? By transferring the masculine theme to the superficial female position, and supplementing with humanistic care. prepared a feminist cloak that is confusing enough to eliminate the female audience's resistance to the machismo movie, even aroused their concern and curiosity. Perhaps Cameron himself did try to set a character with strong respect and goodwill, but the market and business operations have made Terminator lose the purity of being a true feminist work.Salute to the former Terminator. The word that Sarah said ""I will be back"", but the one that T-008 is ""I won't be back"" before leaving he didn't bring sunglass, imply that he no longer the clod-blood killer machine, but a father of a boy similar with it when act as John's in T2, a protector ""Carl"" same name with the first future warrior in T1. The final word "" For John"" reminds the audience of his sacrificed with thumb up in T2. Besides they keep the classic way of dealing with terminators using guns keep shooting to the alloy skeleton. ""Dark Fate"" as it defines by Grace ""you can't fight with it you run from it"". Each of them is toughness mental and physical but all get traumas: scarred by the connect with future and desperate for an escape that may not exist. They are from dark will they move forwards to darkness?Do you believe fate, Sarah?
Or do you believe that you all can change the future by every second of every choice that you makeYou chose to change the future
You chose to destroy Skynet
You set me freeNow I am going to help you to protect the girl because I choose tooAs time has changed, the audience base has lost slowly. One classic IP won't work forever.

It could divide so it's mimetic polyalloy and metal endoskeleton, both being able to move about on their own or combine when needed to be stronger.Once again, the Terminator Rev-9 was sent back in time on a mission to kill the leader of the resistance in this new timeline. The T-800 from the original timeline, having completed it's mission to kill John Connor, now had no purpose, so over time it grew a conscious and to make up for taking her only son started to send Sarah Connor information about where Terminators show up.The best scenes in the film where the fights, particularly between the Rev-9 and the T-800. They were awesome. No matter how advanced the next model terminator may be, the original is always the best.I enjoyed the whole of the film, but of course, I didn't like it when John Connor died, but I guess he had to die or else the new timeline wouldn't have been created with a new resistance leader.I'm fan of the original films and who cares if it goes off the original timeline and the original storyline. so long as it's a good film.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2650,solmosuns,The Terminator Was Back,8,9 December 2019,"Terminator: Dark Fate is an American science fiction action film that was released in 2019. It is the sixth Terminator film, and it is a sequel of Terminator 2: Judgement Day. The film was directed by Tim Miller, with James Cameron, who is the creator of the Terminator, as producer. However, it misfired at the box office. Though it has a score of 71% on Rotten Tomatoes, a score of 8/10 on IGN, and it is mostly positive, the bad reviews have been standing out. In my opinion, because of the good action, plot, and casting, I really enjoyed this film. It was better than I expected and the best since Terminator 2: Judgment Day.The main reason I like this film is the high quality of action. In terms of action, it was the best of all the Terminator series. The actor's movements were really sharp and immersive in the battle scenes. This is because Tim Miller has directed an action film before (Deadpool). In particular, the final battle was very impressive. Also, the computer graphics looks more real than any other Terminator film. For example, the car chase scene at the beginning was very clear and spectacular, so I could get sucked into the world.An another reason I like this film is the plot. It was as good as Terminator 2: Judgment Day. It dug deeply into human emotion and focused on the mental conflict. Most of the characters including the machines had their own complex emotions and the contrast between these ideas was explored many times. It wasn't just an action film, but it was a combination of action and drama.The final reason I like this film is the casting. As you know, Linda Hamilton was back as Sarah Connor and also Arnold Schwarzenegger was back as the original terminator, T-800. Thus, I thought the story was connected because this film has the same cast as Terminator 2: Judgment Day. In the case of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, Terminator Salvation and Terminator Genesis, the different cast played the same character, so it was hard to understand. In addition, other new main cast members were so attractive, especially Mackenzie Davis who fit her role really well and her acting was wonderful.Don't listen to bad reviews.

I really don't see why people are trashing this movie so much. It is basically T2 but a modern version with better graphics and fight scenes and everyone loved T2. Action was good and was most of the movie, the story held up and made sense, the acting was good. I thought the augmented girl from the future was a bit too much. I liked her and everything but she seemed to have some pretty bad weaknesses that seemed to be overdone. They could have toned that down and bit to make it more believable, at least in my opinion.

Nothing in movie is overdone, action sceenes are very well adjusted, and at right time, REV-9 is very brutal and strong and his mission to kill Dani is his weakness, and every side kick from others make him ""slow"" which is enough to interrupt his mission complete, but ofcourse he is machine so it will keep on going. He is very fast in seek and destroy, at least very fast in seeking, smiling face and right attitude in right uniform can make all the differences, so he has be done every move right as he should and Dani with it's crew was feeling his breath on neck through whole movie. They acctualy didnt make wrong moves, you cant run away from that kind of machine wit that capabilitys, they were just buying time, and at the end when they were cronered, desperate move is only thing that were left to do. with some luck and enough ""will"" from everyone, they succeed to terminate him, not on easy way but proper.
Stroyline may be repeating in it's basics, but nothing is the same ...",Terminator - Dark Fate
2672,guy_hayward,"Not as bad as everyone says, just not a good Terminator Film",3,30 January 2020,"Don't think this was as bad as everyone says, if this wasn't billed as a Terminator film maybe it would have been received better.5 stars if not a terminator film
3 stars because its a terminator filmFor me the biggest issues with this film, was:
A) Killing off John Conner, after all we went through, to have him killed off very easily in the first minutes of the film was just a kick in the gut.
I get that they destroyed Skynet and so he wasn't the leader anymore, but why not let him live a life? Also, considering all they had been through, i doubt the Conners would just be in the open like they were.
B) It tried way to hard to be a Terminator film and to try a surpass T1 and T2, they had way too much going on in the film. Lets consider that it took two films for the first story (the Skynet saga?) to play out. Now, obviously they didn't want Dani to just be a womb for the hero and in todays climate need a female hero, but they needed to do something different, way too much happening, explosions/airplanes etc... just there because they could, not because it was needed, and whats with the super terminator/hero... too much.
Why not the first film with Dani as a child and her family, being hunted by a killing machine and being protected by a lone soldier. She is trained by the soldier and that is how she becomes a bada$$ leader.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I thought this movie was actually very entertaining and fun to watch. The new Terminator Rev 9 was awesome, lot of cool action scenes, and some new story lines to help propel the franchise forward (hopefully to new sequels of dark fate.)What I didn't like- The anti-male tone. I don't care if there is a female leader and hero. Terminator has always really been about Sarah Connor who is a great female character. There is one line in the movie though, that if they would have left out would have made this a fantastic movie. The whole belittling the need of a man was a joke in this movie and that line should have been left out. Other than that, even as a long time Terminator fan I liked the movie. As much controversy as the whole John Connor role caused, I actually think it was necessary to move the franchise forward to continue on with a new story. I think the negative reviews of this movie need to be taken with a grain of salt.

2686,roryrockettoes,By far the best Terminator movie since the original 2,9,31 March 2020,"I really enjoyed this movie, from the opening scene to the end credits it continued to impress me more and more. The only criticism of Terminator: Dark Fate I've heard that I feel is valid is the fight scene in the plane, I get that it feels unrealistic, and draws on the superhero physics of marvel movies. The rest of the film didn't do that though, and what it did do was worth so much more.The Terminator franchise has always been trying to push strong female narratives, and when we look back at the original two, they feel dated, but considering what else was around at the time, they did a damn good go of it. Dark Fate was the only Terminator film that actually properly delivered on that attempt, and it feels like a natural progression from the original two.The three stars of this film were presented with strength, deep back stories, and diverse personalities, they supported each other, and fought for each other throughout, while still have complex and interesting dialogue to work through. The dialogue was more interesting, characters more nuanced than most action films. And the journey they took together well realized.The addition of Arnie into the mix was done delicately, and was a considerate approach, as a characters he had taken a step back to empower the woman's life who he had been living with, and going forward with our three stars he continued that same intent to empower them. The men involved in the direction and writing of this film, for me, did such an impressive job of weaving deep gender politics throughout this film in a way that didn't feel.I do wish that it had been a female creative team tackling this story. But regardless this was an exciting and visceral piece of cinema. That I enjoyed as on par with the Original two, which both have their strengths and faults.I am gutted this wasn't the success it deserved to be. As I would love to see more.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2687,FeliciaPurple,Much better than people nostalgia will let them believe,9,1 April 2020,"This was a great movie, hands down in the top three Terminator Films. And while that doesn't say ton considering the others, this one really stands on its own just like the original two.
The first film was a gritty relentless scifi thriller, It had edge and a rawness which is thrilling. The sequel which I also love has a much lighter vibe, plenty of jokes, and really playing to a mainstream audience with it's bits of humor and heart, much less gritty, but lovely in it's own way.
This does away with the lightness of the second film, but retains the mainstream appeal and tone for the action, although updated to modern expectations.There's also an amazing progression throughout these films of female empowerment. Each of these three have tried to place women at the center of the narrative, but they haven't really succeeded until now. Finally three awesome female characters leading the charge, all interesting, and complex relationships, which doesn't slow down the action. And Arnie does an amazing job of playing a representation of masculinity that supports and empowers the women around him.I love it. It's only missing a star because the fight in the plane is a bit silly.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2689,hnatski,You've been terminated,3,28 July 2020,"Having seen all the Terminator's and like most I do prefer the first two, seeing this as a ""follow on to Judgement Day"", I was looking forward to it.
Yes there's plot holes, and elements of the action sequences that don't look believable, but this film was to kick start another trilogy (apparently),
Seeing Annie and Linda Hamilton back on the screen was great, but clearly this film was rushed, since Annie is in his 70's so being the big Terminator seemed to maybe past its best.
trying to re-boot this with Linda Hamilton as the top bill, clearly signals new sequel looming but will it happen after a disappointing opening weekend in the cinemas?Was it worth James Cameron trying to do a sequel after all these attempts at a reboot, yes I think so but, does he do it justice?

In the future the Legion is like Skynet and the humans are like resistance.
The rev-9 terminator is like T-1000 and his mission is to kill Sarah Connor, again in this case ""Dani"".
The T-800 sacrifices himself and he destroys rev-9.
Many things in this movie don't make any sense For example: How can the rev-9s endoskeleton just exit the rev-9.
How can a 9mm bullet go that fast in water.
Or how can a Terminator have a child.

And on YouTube, my comment was something like that, ""forget about CGI usage. It's fine. The question comes after 'how can possibly a movie be constructed/built on top of this story line?' ""Thanks to BTTF series(Marty and Doc) which introduced us complex nature of time-travelling, we know that ****ing with time that much does not work towards the advantage of humanity. So this franchise is another example of this. I mean you can end up with many more, thousands of sequels as long as you play seldom with the rules of time-travelling etc. But, hey, at some point it needs to STOP! Or else you'll find yourself drawing circles around it. This movie is metaphorically a bare example of this.On the other hand, having Arnold and Linda and the dramatic scene somewhere at the beginning was quite nice for a total-recall but eventually they were overused later on.The intimidating power of the villians AND/OR heroes come from acting, not the cheesy lines or pages of scripts. And this movie, again, falls victim to that, too. Too much garbage dialogues and too much of humanization in the wrong direction. Especially for the role of Arnold's.T-1000 was just to the point with very few dialogues but rather with more tension/acting.Visual fx's, camera angles with the return of Cameron, was quite ok for me. But, it failed in the story-telling dept.Terminator is a big franchise with lots of ideas and might not be done yet, BUT, they need to find a better TWIST through the events and should create a ""darker"" world if they are ""still"" aiming to film a sequel.",Terminator - Dark Fate

In foundation of T1 and T2 lays a time loop, skynet send terminator to the past to stop Connor and John sends his father to stop the machine, their actions results in the predictable future. In other words terminator was the reason skynet exists and John was the reason John exists. In second film the heroes stop the future from happening by breaking the loop, which made sense: past exists only for future and the future is underdetermine to people in present, before 1995 skynet could happened. After 1995 - it's not.
This movie just scraps all previous movies, importance of Connors, the terminators, and time loop just to replace main heroes with new not well defined... characters... for quick $$ and hype on current sociopolitical situation in North-America. Female version of Kyle isn't strong because the lived life in war between humanity and machines, no she's strong because augmentations in her body, in contrast to Sarah. Sarah was strong because she was strong person and she had to protect her son.
Speaking of augmentation, how in the world where humanity is in agony, under constant fear and war with machines that don't sleep, get tried or stop, have such advanced technology to perform complex operations, and flying machinery hundreds of years ahead of ours in nuclear post apocalypses? The movie doesn't make any sense.
And for me it doesn't work as mindless action movie, because CGI and effects looks pretty fake, you don't feel at any point in time that characters are in any danger.

One thing to understand is that this kind of movies are not meant to be enjoyed by the public, they are done to spend a certain amount of money on CGI and stunts, to keep the Hollywood machine going and to increase the GDP. And that's exactly what this movie is, a long series of CGI and stunt sequences with no real story or character development. The presence of Arnold and Linda Hamilton doesn't redeem it.

The entire movie follows a similar tract.The villain I am personally a fan of. It combines the false humanity of the terminators on a new scale with the inhumane relentlessness of... well.. the terminators. But it does it in a way that is a homage to T1 and T2 together. Literally.Put simply, if you like T1 and T2 and go into this movie wanting an action movie terminators put in various roles in the story, while it offers a re-telling of the ""core"" terminator mythos, give it a chance.

But the atmosphere is so much better than the previous sequels that it works somehow. It is darker and more serious.

Through our endless need for war we always end up making a machine that obliterates us.But, in this movie, a Terminator completes its mission, and has nothing to do. What happens? He becomes more compassionate and loyal than any human.Also, notice the other thread in all the movies. A Terminator is sent back in time to kill the one human with all the qualities necessary to defeat the machines. A human is never sent back in time to kill a human who will cause the rise of the machines. Why not? Because it would be like whack-a-mole.

2734,rhkat876,We loved it,8,19 November 2019,"My husband and I are also big fans of the franchise. Ofcourse, the first two are irreplaceable- they made movie history in their own ways. And the last two movies to come out, Salvation and the other with the GOT chick weren't the greatest, but I don't get why some people are hating on *this one?! And please don't call me one of those ""fake"" people who out up bogus reviews just because I liked the movie. Everyone I personally know that has been to see it, enjoyed it also.
Anyway I thought the graphics were incredible and I loved how they gender flipped it all around. It pulled me in right away and kept my attention, and that is a hard thing to do with me. And man, that girl..the blonde, biomechanical human/ hybrid...whatever.. was fantastic!Some of Linda Hamiltons lines felt a little forced to me, but I suppose that is a little how someone would be if they were in 24 hour, 367, lifelong survival mode. I mean would your ppl skills really be at peak efficiency from years of living like that? I dunno know.
And I thought the reasoning of a Terminator growing a conscience on his own was a little silly. They should have come up with something else to explain that. Like.. that he had turned that 'self aware/learning switch' thingy on, on his own somehow, to help him understand and blend with humans easier over the years( you can see Sara and John turning the same on for the Terminator sent back to protect John, in the extended scenes in T2. Which was supposed to rationalize why he started to become somewhat more emotive).Anyway, I just go to a movie enjoy it. as long as it's offensive, I don't care if it's updated in a more politically correct ways than two former movies, made all the way back in 84 & 91. I mean, so what? Times change people. I'm def watching it again, as soon as it comes out on HD. And the blonde, Mackenzie Davis, is on my radar for up and coming actresses. Fer realz.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2735,joasis1,Ridiculous Agenda-Driven Plotline,3,7 November 2019,"The entire premise was silly, the ""action"" sequences were inane, and Linda Hamilton has certainly lost her acting skills, but I thought Daniel Tosh did a pretty decent job as the transgender title character.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2736,feito_chikilin,It's a great movie.,8,3 November 2019,"I am a huge TERMINATOR fan. This movie is great. Amazing action sequences. The fight choreography between the characters is very awesome. Almost like a dance. It could easily do without those stupid feminist ""women are better than men"" one liners from McKenzie Davis' character. I loved the latino representation in the film. Diego Bonneta from the Netflix 'Luis Miguel' series was a nice treat. The story is a bit sloppy but works over all. It could have gone in a million different directions since T2, but the way they went was a good way to END it. Because I do feel this is how it should end, for good. The last scene of the final fight was VERY sad. I was crying, ALOT. It's a good movie guys. Go see it",Terminator - Dark Fate
2737,rebelfaction,Loved it,9,14 January 2020,"I thought this was a great follow up to the second terminator. I really can't understand all the 1 star reviews, maybe kids with anti feminism issues, solid story, great special effects and good acting throughout.

Imo Dark Fate completes the podium of the franchise. Now does this means it's good enough to be compared to the first two ?? Absolutely not.
It's filled up with Hollywood clichés of the moment, feminism, immigration, a love affair based on respect (lol)
The writing isn't good, CGI as it's flaws. Maybe the reason I liked the movie could be mostly cuz I had my expectations down, due to some reviews I've read and mostly cuz of T3, Salvation and mostly Genesys.Mackenzie does her job pretty well plus she's absolutely gorgeous
The rev9 is ok(ish), he could've been a bit more sinister, more machine I guess (talks a bit too much)
Linda adds a good content to the plot and she performs well enough
Didn't liked Ani character... But ok, I guess they could've done it with anyone non matter the gender colour or whatever.Now Arnold : he looks great in every aspect of the character but one. T-800 with a family???? Really??? That's the best they could do ?I'm giving a 7 cuz the movie is the best terminator sequel after T2.

2741,ZioScrooge,Recycling ideas from previous 3 sequels in a T2 plot structure,2,9 November 2020,"They failed before with single new ideas, so they thought they could succeed by using them all at once:01) Terminators coming to present days from different possible futures can coexist at the same time and even fight each other (idea from Genisys);02) John Connor is killed by a T-800 at the very beginning of the movie (from Genisys);03) T-800 can age (again from Genisys, but of course this is a forced choice if you want to keep Schwarzy in the franchise);04) You cannot change the future enough to avoid the judgement day completely, you can only postpone it or change the people involved, but it will ultimately happen (idea from T3) - however, also in this case this is a sort of forced choice, if you want to keep making Terminator movies you can never prevent judgement day from happening;05) How can you improve the T-800 and the T-1000? Mix them together and make an hybrid with solid skeleton and liquid-metal skin, just like the T-X model from T3, except that the new Rev-9 can even split the two parts: the skeleton can work as a naked T-800 and the liquid-skin can work as a T-1000 separately;06) Also humans can be upgraded and become cyborgs (from Salvation);07) In T3 we had the good T-800 killing the T-X using one of his nuclear batteries as a bomb. In Salvation we had the human-cyborg donating his hearth to John Connor to save his life. Now we have the combo of both situations: Grace donates her cyborg-power-source to be used as a weapon to kill the bad terminator while happily dying for her human leader.Basically they thought that, to make a good movie, they just needed Linda Hamilton back and to copy the plot-structure of the most successful one in the series. In fact, the series of events you are going to see in Dark Fate is pretty much identical to T2, with just an increased number of characters: we now have an all-resourceful Sarah Connor, Grace the cyborg and Carl the good T-800 to protect our future leader of the human resistance against one bad Terminator who can transform into two bad Terminators on occasions.To make everything worse, they forgot to implement the humor from T2 (only a few forced lines from Carl trying to be funny), the CGI is cheaper than ""Sarah Connor Chronicles"" and the physics is just absurd. The Rev-9 can run and jump as fast as a Marvel superhero, he is lighter than a feather and can even swim in water.Terminator Dark Fate is the ultimate demonstrations that they don't have any more fresh ideas to work with.",Terminator - Dark Fate

It's a movie about a time travelling robot wearing a 72yr old Arnold Schwarzenegger suit, a future cyborg bodyguard lady and a conjoined twin kill bot - also from the future. Seriously... Who was going into this thing expecting Citizen Kane? I find it hard to believe that people went into this movie thinking they'd be getting anything other than what it was. See the trailer? See the poster? See any of the recent Terminator movies? Just have fun at these movies, that's all it's there for. Or don't.

If I listen to it now, I think my computer and cellphone are already being controlled by Skynet. I don't even need to mention Terminator 2... a masterpiece.This is the worst film in the franchise of all time, yes, worse than Rise of Machines, Salvation and Genesis.Nothing can be worse than Dark Fate and I will explain why:2020 and they have not yet learned how to correct the mistakes of the past, have not learned that films need continuation and not reboots or copies. WHERE'S SKYNET'S FRENETIC FIGHT AGAINTS THE HUMANS? Which didn't happen in Salvation (a Madmax spin off).Skynet is much more intelligent than the human race, it would not be defeated like that. Only those who are not smart are these writers and these crazy studios that continue to destroy one of the best films and characters of all time.What happened to Sarah Connor?

The only way out for this sequel was John Connor alive and they killed JOHN CONNOR!!! HAHAHAHAHWHAT THE HELL IS CARL?! JESUS!!! Since when an exterminator finish the mission and wandering around philosophize about what his new purpose is? THE MISSION IS OVER! Why insist on making the Terminator tell jokes or try to be funny? Why they need to show a scene from a T-101, a machine made to kill... Caring a house, petting a dog, in an absurdly colorful clothes and scenario, as if giving an interview to Home n Health?
EXTERMINATOR FILMS CAN ONLY HAVE 4 COLORS: BLACK, GRAY, BLUE AND THE RED OF THE EXTERMINATOR'S EYESThey made an exterminator saying that it is very efficient when changing diapers, installing carpets and giving decoration tips ... my GOOOOOOOOOOOSHHH!!! EXTERMINATORS CANNOT BE HUMANIZED! CANNOT CHANGE DIAPERS! THEY CAN ONLY HUNT AND KILL. Finished a mission? Self-exterminated!Skynet no longer exists, now what exists is the Legion. LOL. Legion of idiots who wrote this crap.What the hell was that cyborg, with movements absurdly beyond physical? I'm glad he died at the end of the film. It is the most useful comment I can make about that character.When will you understand that there will be no better robot than the T-1000? T-1000 are so sinister in T2 that nothing or any idea in the world will surpass that machine.
They tried on Rise of Machines, they tried again now with this pathetic copy of the T-1000, called Rev9, another robot that does not obey the laws of physics and that looks like a disgusted black goo that came out of Lucy (2014).T-1000 was absurdly smart, advanced and didn't laugh, didn't joke, didn't thank anyone! He just got serious, hunted and killed anyone who looked at him.They get this idea of sending exterminators all the time to kill some resistance leader. If they follow this logic, it will be the longest franchise in the history of the universe, it will never end... they killed John Connor, they will kill the mexican girl(most bland character of all the films ever made by the human race), whether by Skynet, Legion, Rosie the Robot Maid of the Jetsons or whatever crappy technology they invent.In my whole life I only gave 1 star on IMDB for 3 films (when I don't like it, the minimum I give is 5 stars). They are Fifty Shades of Gray, Predator (2018) and Dark Fate.I wanted to be able to rate 0 STARTS. I wanted to be able for IMDB to ban Dark Fate from being rated.it took me 2 days to be able to watch this abomination, I was so astonished that I was in each scene. I've never been so angry in my life. If I have a stroke, it will be the fault of you who created this crap.So far this film is making a loss of more than 100 million. I hope it will reach 1 billion in losses, so you will get the message.My only wish today is that one day there really exists Skynet and send nuclear warheads straight to the home of the writers, directors, Paramount, Fox and other studios.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Perhaps.But I don't know. The insanity and stupidity is now DEEPLY engrained in Hollywood.If you are a Director or Producer aspiring to make a memorable, watch-worthy movie franchise, Rule #1 should be: Respect the Audience! And Respect the rules of good story-telling!!When the vast majority of audience members love the first two movies of a franchise, there are 2 GOLDEN RULES:1. Do NOT simply REHASH the first movie in sequels to the franchise!
Be brave enough to tread into NEW territory....but be TRUE TO THE ORIGINAL at the same time: Think GODFATHER PART 2 (relative to THE GODFATHER), or EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (relative to STAR WARS: A NEW HOPE).
In both instances, neither sequel did ANY retreading of the original movie, and were worthy sequels: Many can legitimately argue that both franchise SEQUELS were even BETTER then the Originals they faithfully followed IN SPIRIT only.2. As unforgiveable as Rule #1 above is, is this next Rule: Do NOT contradict the Original movie with the Sequel!
And THIS is where this horrible movie committed the greatest sin: In the utterly PATHETIC pandering to ""WOKE"" Political Correctness, this latest installment in the franchise essentially renders Terminator 1 and Terminator 2 utterly null and void.YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW? When the core team doing the first script read of this CRAP of a movie, did anyone have the courage to ask the simple question: ""Wait a minute.....if we go with this plot, why would Skynet even bother with Sarah Conner in 1980's Los Angeles to begin with?!?!""The only take-away that is ""positive"" from this whole movie, is make it painfully obvious to anyone interested in the movie industry, is that they need to REMOVE POLITICS from the MOVIES!!!",Terminator - Dark Fate

There was no doubt in my mind that going into this knowing James Cameron was at the helm with Tim Miller I was sure to be captivated. Not only did this new and dark Terminator fulfill my expectations it magically connected the dots to Terminator 2 Judgment Day which captivated my youth and imagination to this day. As well as giving me impressions of this stories universe. The special effects were just unbelievable I am so so glad I saw this in IMAX. I literally am going back to see it in 4DX for the experience and to rewatch this phenomenal movie. One drawback just in my opinion because of my Film background and passion is I think it could have done with the CG bodies. I would've loved it if we could see a return to actual animatronics and advancement in actual AI robotics. However because of the budgeting and time restrictions I understand. It's just that James Cameron is well known for using fantastic real life effects. It just cinematically adds a realness to the aesthetic. I can spot the CG with my eyes squinted and it just takes me out of moment a little like a video game.
However all in all Terminator Dark fate is by no means a disappointment. I dont understand all of the negative reviews. This movie is worthy of much regard and attention by the film world. I give it two thumbs way up. Thank you for a terrific installment!",Terminator - Dark Fate

2767,bengoff,Balanced review from MASSIVE terminator fan,6,25 October 2019,"I'm writing this within half an hour of leaving the theatre having just sat through just over 2 hours of new terminator. The franchise has given me genuine scares (T1 as a child), one of fave films of all time (T2) and then many ups and (mostly) downs since.With James Cameron 'on board' I hoped for more greatness. When you and your partner are the ONLY PEOPLE in the theatre when the trailers start to roll at 9PM On a Friday however, it seems that the terminator bug has long since worn off for most. Having seen Cameron's shameless endorsement of Genysis - I was sceptical as to what his input actually was. Writer (along with about 10 others) and Producer (again with others ). Having watched the film, I would say that his influence is there but it must have been limited. This is NOT a Cameron Terminator movie.The opening scene is either made up of deleted footage from T2 or it is brilliant CGI. Hamilton and Furlong look exactly like they did circa 1991. Furlong's input is limited to wiping out the purpose of T1 and T2. A T800 completes its mission leaving Sarah with a massive beef to settle.Fast forward to the era where the movie is set and it's a rehash of things that have happened in other terminator movies. There is a new protagonist - Dani who is the saviour of the world in this alternate future. A soldier is sent back to protect her 'Grace' (a la Kyle Reece?). She is modified mechanically. Never referred to as a terminator but reminded me of Sam Worthingtons character in salvation.Cue action sequence after action sequence. Nothing new to the franchise and as you would expect, Sarah Connor turns up and joins the party in helping to protect Dani. Hamilton's portrayal is one of a bitter woman who has spent her life dealing with terminators. I would have her as the strongest performance.And now we get on to Arnold / T800. The first appearance of the T800 is when it kills John in the opening scenes. The T800 has the opportunity to terminate Sarah (who has shot him in the back multiple times and jumped on its back). It just throws her to the floor and leaves her - REALLY? We later learn that Skynet sent back multiple terminators and T2 was when just one of them was dealt with. That being the case, why send back a T800 when they clearly had T1000's (more advanced etc). Again it just makes no sense.Then the bit I really have trouble with - Arnold /T800 (after terminating John) has no purpose on earth so it decides to rescue a domestic violence victim and play house until such time that the past catches up with him/ it. We are led / expected to believe that the terminator has begun to learn human nature and although it doesn't have a conscience - it understands what a conscience is and wants to help people. No reprogramming , just an internal decision to move from robotic killer to protector. The T800 has then spent its time (in amongst playing house) been texting Sarah (from an encrypted phone) telling her when and where terminators will appear on earth. She then turns up to destroy them.The question is never answered as to how Arnold / T800 from an alternative future knows the location of the main terminator in this film - Rev 8 sent back by 'legion' - the future alternative to Skynet (as Skynet was stopped by T2). How does a Skynet robot know what robots from an alternative future have planned ?It then becomes a protection mission where Sarah, T800, Grace and Dani all try to evade the most advanced terminator yet. The ending is predictable but the action sequences are satisfying- even if they are just a rehash of what you will have seen in other terminator movies.The best since T2? Possibly. It does deviate from previous storylines. As much as people slate T3, I did like the way that story tied up how John Connor became part / leader of the resistance. This film felt like it was done just for the sake of it however. It was a story that didn't need to be told.I think I would have accepted a 'true sequel' if it were more John Connor centric. John is/was/should be what these films are about. For that reason, I came away ultimately having enjoyed the 2 hour ride but failing to accept that it was a necessary sequel.Luna does ok as a terminator. Suitably robotic performance and he reminded me of Robert Patrick in his relentless pursuit. Davis does ok as the female 'modified' Kyle Reece. Natalia Reyes does ok as the new protagonist Dani. The film is clearly set up for more (if it ever gets there) and it ends with her and Sarah teamed up and ready for future battles. She is no Sarah though.I've scored this 6/10 - maybe a little generous due to my love for Cameron's input into the series. I don't believe that he has written a script where a terminator as ruthless as that in T1 is capable of being so self aware that it can / wants to play Mr perfect in the husband of year competition. I fear that this film will ultimately be remembered for that plot deviation and it may be what finally kills off the franchise.When it was announced Furlong was back, I hoped that despite his personal problems it would be in a substantial role where Johns story arc developed. It was just a marketing ploy however and the more I think about it, the more I am convinced that Cameron's input was far more limited that what we are led to believe and that again is another marketing ploy. Time will tell but it left me feeling sad more than satisfied. I e seen the positives in every terminator movie (amongst the many negatives of late) and I do with this one. I do think that there have been enough now. It needs to stop before the legacy of T1 & T2 are tarnished. Average at best",Terminator - Dark Fate

I know you think that makes it over-politicized, but I have a secret to tell you.You ready?You have literally never seen an apolitical science fiction film. There's always a *little* something there. Maybe you don't always catch it - that's okay! But to turn your nose up at it because GIRLS? Come on. Why cheat yourself over something that petty?Loved the cast. Hope to see more of Natalia Reyes, though Linda Hamilton steals every scene she's in. Arnold was great, and Mackenzie Davis echos Hamilton's intensity in T2 while owning it herself.I will say, my one gripe is that, previously, they dug into what Skynet was. You knew exactly what you were dealing with. It's a little vague here, and while the Rev-9 was plenty menacing in the immediate, the grand threat of Legion felt a bit diminished. That might be a huge factor for some, and while noticeable, it didn't ruin it for me.Absolutely go see it, unless girls doing things for anyone else but you bothers you, in which case, I think LiveJournal is still active.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2771,ProudTraitor,Ignoring the wokeness it's not a bad film at all,7,19 January 2020,"On it's own this is a very solid action flick. Ignore the low IMDB score, it mostly comes from dislikes by people offended by the death of John Connor and people reacting to ""wokeness"". Yes the feminism is obvious and cringey and I totally understand why Terminator fans who are mostly males in their 30s hate a social agenda being shoved down their throats. Having a 90 pound gnome girl with a Mexican accent being the leader of humanity is is intersectionality on steroids and just not very realistic on top of it. They also didn't need to make Arnie an internal decorator. Furthermore lines like ""I changed diapers without complaints"" and Mexican girl's ""I wish you two weren't so White"" are nothing more than rubbing a political agenda down faces of mostly White male fans. But baring all that it's a fast paced, intense decent action movie. It's not just best Terminator movie since T2, it's MUCH better than anything since T2.The only other reason why you might be disappointed is if you expect it to be on the level of T1 & T2, which you shouldn't. The first two aren't just very good popcorn flicks, they're legends.Overall it deserves a 7/10. If it wasn't for the wokeness I'd give it 8/10",Terminator - Dark Fate

Yes, I also was surprised by fast end of John. But please be aware, the other movies 3 and 5 killed and butchered the character long before 6. And not sure if he doesn't make a reappearance. It's time travel and robots.... do everything is possible. Sarah was dead in 3 and I just love that she is back.
If you were a strong terminator lover you would see that she was the heroine from the first movie. And in the second as well. Now she is a tragedy hero....

I think reviewers have been a bit harsh to rate it low. Viewers will enjoy it more if keep their expectations in check which were sky high due to Cameron (as producer) and Linda's return. First half an hour is mix bag but things definitely get more interesting when Arnie enters the scene. A few arguable choices with script. Natalia Reyes casting in lead role is not convincing at all. A bit overuse of CGI rather than building characters which can create bond with audiance.There's nothing new in storyline which is bit disappointing. It'll be good for frenchise if they move on from ""terminator sent back to kill saviour of human race"" and tell the rest of story. Why not show the future where a stage is set for final epic battle between humans and machines and embrace the end of the saga with a bit more dignity.I wouldn't say that I didn't enjoy it as being a die hard Terminator fan I'll enjoy anything with Arnie and Linda in it.

Linda Hamilton agreeing to be in it did send some thoughts of hope though. But more than ever before this is just a shot-by-shot remix of all the good scenes in the old movies. It's just as the creators have NO idea why the old movies are good. Saying ""I'll be back"" in a hundred different ways isn't enough. By now you just sigh. The only thing missing sometimes is the actor winking towards the camera. ""You recognized that line huh?"".
But here - the entire movie is just a repeat of scenes with new actors. The REV-9 is a emberracing copy of Robert Patricks T-1000. The way he delivers the lines, the way he drives his truck. The way he visits friends and family of his target. The way every scene he's in already happened in T2.Emberracing is the general theme here. It IS a decent action film on it's own. But it's not on it's own. It has nothing that is it's own.The only redeeming thing in this is Arnold and the humor. His caracter is funny - but not in a T3 parody way - but actually a fitting level of funny for the type of film. Not the brilliant little glimpses of humor we had in T2, but still ""tasteful"".

I like the story line and that its mostly an all female cast. I'm sure lots of men don't like that. Even more so that the leader is not only a female BUT a Hispanic to boot. I'm sure many men would hate this film just because of that. Pretty much, that's what happened.
When are the viewers going to realize that T2 is one of the greatest films ever? You cannot replicate the essence of it. How unrealistic can you be!!!! In the mean time, lots of people are going to bash everything they see. If you really love the T franchise, act like it. You don't want to give money.

I had a night out at the cinema and enjoyed elements of the film. The Good: Some decent action and effects, Arnie wasn't a parody T-800 ( I'm talking to you T3 and Genisys!) Supporting cast were pretty good, Linda Hamilton did a decent job. The Rev-9 guy was ok.(not a patch on T-1000 though) The Bad: Don't like the direction the story goes. Firstly killing John Connor off (right from the get go!!) is a no no. Skynet not existing and being replaced by Legion?? No! To end two of the major foundations of the Terminator mythos like that is unforgivable to me.

Not the child she bears. Not a white boy or man. She is. And she is amazing.The hero soldier sent back to protect her is a human femme.None of the named masc characters get to live.

2818,robert-chisholm-412-794595,Franchise Terminated,6,2 November 2019,"I had high hopes for Dark fate which ignores all other outings of the terminator franchise other than 1984's Terminator and 1992's T2. But my hopes were dashed when all this was thrown out the window in the first 5 minutes.Having stopped skynet in T2, Sarah and John Conner were free to live out their lives or so you would think. With some dubious CGI showing the twosome of similar ages to their characters in T2 living it up at a beach bar seemed a bit jarring and peace is shattered immediately as a Arnie terminator strolls in from the beach and gets the drop on a young John shooting him with a pistol and after a short altercation with Sarah finished him off with a shotgun. I felt at this point the heart had been preverbally ripped from my chest.So with the old story wiped clean skynet was no more and John Conner eliminated the terminator strolls off to assume a normal life. Sarah for years later would get texts of locations where other terminators were being sent so she take them out in a revenge 'for john'. So appears skynet had sent multiple terminators to different timelines to takeout John if the original ones failed. This seemed a bit weak given the trials of the main characters in the first two films. It also made me remember 2009's terminator salvation and in comparison to this I feel is the better film as it fits in the the original timeline is set in the future all the things I wanted from a terminator sequal and did this 10 years ago.All dark fate brings to the table to CGI in bucket loads both good and bad examples. The female lead roles are great but felt the script with skynets replacement was weak and the flash forwards to the future where humans were fighting some matrix style squid like terminators.Later in the film they catch-up with Arnie's terminator who killed John who has been living a normal life calls himself Carl and has a drapery business. This just said it all to me as felt cheated with the first 5 mins, spent the rest of the film having characters telling Sarah she wasn't important anymore in this new timeline then brings in the enforced humor.Had such high hopes but i'll stick with my terminator, T2 and Terminator Salvation and Dark fate can join the likes of T3 rise of the machines and Genisys.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2820,cheif_88,Enjoyable once you stop comparisons to the masterpiece of T2,7,17 November 2019,"I entered the theatre with some very low expectations. As a HUGE fan of The Terminator, and T2, and being extremely disappointed with 3,4,and 5, I was not planning on seeing Dark Fate until a few friends invited me to the theatre.While there are certainly a few cringy quasi-feminist moments, and some in-continuity issues, I found Dark Fate to be enjoyable and worth the watch. Once I got over the fact that CGI has NOT advanced by all that much since the mind-blowing effects of T2 (at the time), I found myself reasonably intrigued by the characters. Arnold, while limited in comparison to his past roles, was funny and on-point with his delivery. Hamilton did an excellent job finally reprising her role as Sarah Connor.In short, Dark Fate is not at T2's level (very few movies are), and you WILL be disappointed if you expect it to be so. However, Dark Fate is worth a watch if you love Arnold, Hamilton and the first 2 movies in the franchise. Just don't expect it to be a movie you can watch time and time again.I would give it a 6.5 if I could.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Those that came later, are action films, with good productions, good actors and big budgets, but they lacked ""soul"". I am so sure that they are much more recent and I do not even remember the history, nor even the details, while the first two were marked, forever, like a tattoo.

The film takes a big risk, I won't spoil it, but I had hoped that it would set up for a great movie, and while Arnold and Linda are great in their roles, I just couldn't find the magic of the movie. Some of it felt very forced and seemed like it was trying to force some of the current social issues, whether it was meant to, I cannot say. I hate to say I was really disappointed but it is what it is. Overall I would say if you are a terminator fan, watch it regardless, then make your own decision about it.

2837,yoshy_7,The thing no-one will acknowledge,7,9 June 2020,"I get it. I've been a lifelong fan of Cameron, the Terminator franchise and Sarah Connor. It wasn't what we hoped for. But after reading what people said here: I was actually pleasantly surprised. I did not go and see it in the theater when it came out because of the disastrous reviews. I actually wish that I had though.In many ways it's a modern do-over of a lot of the elements that made T2 so good. It's fun, action packed, it has kick ass female leads and a dark undertone about the end of the world. It is certainly the best sequel since T2. Why the hell IMDb rates this even lower as opposed to Terminator Genisys (which is one of the worst films ever made in my opinion), I have absolutely no idea.Something should be said that I don't see anyone else saying here. Big truth time: The reason why we still haven't had a sequel yet that's worthy as a follow-up to Terminator and T2 is not because the sequels and their creators all just simply suck: It's mostly because it's a near to impossible task to do.Apart from the fact that Cameron's original vision is one that I don't think any filmmaker will ever be able to surpass or compete with simply because he's one of the greatest filmmakers of all time, we are also living in different times where the movie business is concerned. You see, for a big-budget action movie sequel/reboot like this to get made nowadays, there is a BIG checklist that a studio needs filled in order to put the money on the table.That checklist sadly leaves very little creative room for new storytelling and ideas and mostly focuses everything on bringing back the key elements that (in theory) made the past films such big hits. Except this time we'll do it even BIGGER ofc. It's a system that sadly has worked to some regard as a safeguard for Studios to - in the worst case - get most of original the investment back. Which is sadly why it's still being implemented even though in the long run this little trick they do is slowly destroying the industry and pushes general audiences out of the theatres as it makes every film in it's genre feel completely generic...Anyway: So doing a reboot/sequel like this is a NIGHTMARE for any director, screenwriter and producer. As you have to find a way to align the fans, with the original material, with the studio, with the absolute limits of your own skills as a creator and match all this to the original movie which was one of the biggest movies of all time by one of the biggest visionaries of all time.I'm a filmmaker myself. But the idea of taking on this mission makes me want to check out early and skip straight to my grave. I'll do any film, but PLEASE NO, not a James Cameron sequel!In that respect... I think they did a pretty decent job. It has to be said. I enjoyed it. And most certainly will watch it a second time (which I have not done with the other sequels, apart from the Sarah Connor Chronicles).Some dialogue and some scenes bugged me now and then. The screenplay could have had some more work. But the overall plot didn't really. Most of the stuff is thought through and works with the original story. Acting is okay. The action especially is really well directed. Tim Miller clearly took a lot of time to prep it (though still not as tight as Jim would have) and it shows in the final result. As for the other departments: Art, VFX, Sound, Cinematography, it's all fine really. Nothing brilliant, but certainly good.You want to get a real REAL new Terminator film of the highest quality? Then we need to do a reboot and a studio that will allow true storytellers to create something completely new. But that won't happen as long as the franchise rights are in David Ellison's hands. Maybe if his sister took over...This is why the Sarah Connor Chronicles came closest. They didnt require the big budget, but they had the rights for a while. They had the freedom to experiment a bit. I hear other people saying that perhaps another series would be the way forward. I find it an interesting thought. But it has to be a NEW STORY in the SAME UNIVERSE. Instead of a SAME STORY on a SOMEWHAT ADJUSTED TIMELINE, which is what we keep getting.Don't always blame the filmmakers guys. The industry and what it demands is the real culprit.",Terminator - Dark Fate

That's it?!Why by T-800 then?! Not even by any other random overpowered robot?And somewhere in the movie, T-800 told Sarah that he was free to do on his own will after Judgement Day was averted.What on earth was done to the script?!It dosen't even make sense!

2842,MattCummings,(POTENTIAL SPOILERS) The predictable TERMINATOR: DARK FATE does nothing to elevate or redefine a franchise destined for the scrap heap.,5,30 October 2019,"The Terminator franchise is a victim of its own success. Once a proud series that probably ushered in the dystopian subgenre, THE TERMINATOR and TERMINATOR 2 painted a grim picture of humanity's future by suggesting that our reliance on machines would be our undoing. Unfortunately, that innovative element which birthed a franchise never matured beyond its original programming. TERMINATOR: DARK FATE fails to recapture the glory of the original two films, focusing instead on car chases and explosions, rather than a meaningful innovation to re-spark what's become an all too predictable cacophony.When a new Terminator is sent into the past to destroy Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes), it's up to fellow good-girl Terminator Grace (Mackenzie Davis) to defend her. The duo is joined by Sarah Conner herself (Linda Hamilton reprising the role), who knows about the attacks (and there have been several) via cryptic messages on her phone. The threat doesn't come from Skynet, but a new corporation called Legion. With the renewed threat to humanity, the team seeks out the source of the cryptic messages, only to find out that an older Terminator model (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is the sender. As the team learns about Dani's role in the coming war, former enemies are forced to work together in a now-familiar struggle.In addition to limiting itself to an action picture, DARK FATE makes another critical error in its conception: that humanity in the present is either too stupid or too divided to understand the ramifications of a connected world. None of the heroes seem willing to expose the Terminators in the present, even though literally hundreds of people in DARK FATE witness their power. This decision forces the movie into a series of overly-computerized run-and-hide action sequences, rather than focusing on the characters and their interaction with a world oblivious to the coming calamity. Meant as a palette cleanse of RISE OF THE MACHINES, SALVATION and GENYSIS, Director Tim Miller and Producer James Cameron simply want you to forget they exist. Unfortunately, neither sees the franchise for more than its ever been, and that begins to weigh heavily upon things as one opportunity after another for innovation is ignored.DARK FATE suffers from the same problem that has infested STAR WARS, refusing to advance beyond its original programming of Rebels vs Empire. That leaves the generally decent trio of Schwarzenegger, Hamilton and Davis to do little more than protect and react. There's no discussion of humanity's love affair with technology, no moment of the utter brutality of nuclear war and no wider effort to head off the crisis by exposing it. Even the explanation of John Connor's whereabouts - which could have generated an instant visceral reaction by the audience - isn't as effective as it could have been. People drop dead in such numbers that the newest Terminator actually loses our interest after one bloody encounter after another. He's neither interesting to watch, nor does he exude the stage presence of former Terminators.There are many questions about DARK FATE that have lingered throughout the series, chief among them is the decision to send single machines instead of an army into the past to kill our heroes. There are many times when our heroes barely seem able to defend themselves; imagine what adding just one more baddie could have achieved. There's also no explanation for why only one is sent at a time. Another persistent question arises with the arrival of Schwarzenegger, who instead of barricading himself behind an arsenal should have been amassing an army of robots. Imagine a battle lead by humans, fighting alongside the machines who were destined to kill us. Now that would have been some worthy watching. Instead, Arnold tells us that he's got a sense of humor and is excellent at selling and installing drapes. I'm not kidding here, these moments actually happen.TERMINATOR: DARK FATE does nothing to elevate or redefine a once worthy franchise. Its insistence on presenting humanity as doomed and reactionary, rather than hopeful and pragmatic, forces the audience into another predictable pattern of run and hide, hoping this time that the effort will stick. It doesn't. Every franchise is destined for an ending; the trouble is knowing when to end things. DARK FATE reminds us how a great concept can be run into the ground. There is a rewarding ending here for the franchise, but Hollywood ever accept it?TERMINATOR: DARK FATE is Rated R for violence throughout, language and brief nudity and has a runtime of 128 minutes.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2844,John3197,A Dark Fate for the Franchise,2,1 November 2019,"Terminator: Dark Fate is yet another attempt to revive the franchise and deliver a decent sequel to Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Dark Fate ignores every entry in the franchise post-T2 and is meant to serve as a direct sequel. Let's start by taking a look at the opening.The film begins with some footage of Sarah Connor in the asylum from Terminator 2 while Linda Hamilton narrates and provides a recap of the events leading up to the present. The film then cuts to a beach in Guatemala in 1998 and Sarah is there with her son, John Connor. In a matter of seconds a T-800 appears out of nowehere and shoots John at point-blank range with a shotgun, killing him and leaving Sarah distraught. While the de-aging effects are fantastic, this is a disgraceful opening sequence. For someone who hated how Alien 3 killed off Hicks and Newt at the beginning of the film because it was an insult to the characters and fans, James Cameron seems to have switched off his brain when he wrote Dark Fate. Killing John in this manner completely destroys the incredible ending of Terminator 2, and serves no purpose other than giving fans the finger. This opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the film quite well.The rest of the film is a rather dull game of cat and mouse that we have already seen several times before in this franchise. The action is uninspired, the script is lazy and the new characters are forgettable. Others have touched on the political themes in this film, so I won't discuss them.The acting generally ranges from average to terrible. Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers a good performance, but he is given nothing to work with and has relatively little screen time compared to the other characters. It seems like the filmmakers only included him because they knew that nobody would see the film if Arnold was not involved. Having said that, he does manage to deliver some nice moments of humor. Linda Hamilton also does her best, but is held back by the awful writing. Natalia Reyes delivers a horrible performance as Danny, the new future leader of the resistance. She completely phones it in, and is horribly miscast as an action hero.Overall, this is a film that you should avoid if you are a fan of the first two Terminator films or just a moviegoer in general.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2845,xipetotec409,Tired of negative comments,8,3 November 2019,"This is a very good movie. The idea is not what many expect from the traditional trailer, but it doesn't repeat itself in the trailer. It's a continuation for the idea that AI is something that we need to keep am eye on. The idea that AI will be our downfall is an intriguing concept. We are all about AI in our society today. This film revisits the idea of now, opposed to the original film before it existed. If you are a fan of the original movie, I think you will appreciate the timeline of this story. I grew up with this story, I may be biased, but I think it's important to remember that the idea was that we give too much information to machines...which now is above the law. Give this movie a chance.Thanks James Cameron for reminding us that reality has a way of making us feel cautious about our present situation involving our human experience versus the AI that could possibly turn upon us if given the opportunity or power.

2848,ibrinton6,"A Very Refreshing Take, Don't Believe All of the Negative Press",7,6 November 2019,"***NO SPOILERS LISTED***I watched this movie yesterday and was very happily surprised, having read a number of reviews ahead of time, my expectations were limited (at best). Bear with me, this is a bit of a read, but I think you'll find it worth your while.Let me start by saying that I'm a die-hard fan of the original Terminator movie and Judgement Day, as well as Aliens and other movies of that genre from that time. I'm not some avocado toast eating millennial, I like uncompromising a** kicking in my action movies (favourite movie quote, ""Now I have a machine gun, ho ho ho."" John McClane, Die Hard, STILL the best Christmas movie ever).Watching this you certainly feel the ""Me Too"" undercurrent throughout the entire duration of the film, but it doesn't take away from the story at any point (that I felt, anyway), like we've seen in other movies (like in Avengers Endgame, when they had to force that 5-minute joint super-attack by all female protagonists for no other apparent reason than to showcase an ""I am female, hear me roar"" moment).If you're like me, and you feel like this franchise has been suffering since T2 ended, maybe with the exception of Terminator Salvation (in my humble opinion, which I also enjoyed), then maybe you're ready for a fresh take on the story too. This movie delivers that, and does so in a way that still lovingly plays tribute to fans of the original two movies by having both Arnie and Linda Hamilton reprise their rolls.I've ready reviews stating that these two felt like they were just ""phoning it in"", and that they were just doing it for the money, but I would very much disagree and say in fact that both of them did great credit to the original characters portrayed in those first two movies. Linda Hamilton comes off tough as nails, albeit more jaded than before (which makes sense, given the story), and Arnie is his ever steady monotone robotic self (although with a little more humour than we're used to, but that's par for the course with him lately if you've seen any other recent movies that he's been in ).The new characters are effectively acted, you start out not liking how human Mackenzie Davis's portrayal of ""terminator protector"" is, but it makes sense later when the story unfolds further, and I really liked how she handled herself throughout the film otherwise.The antagonist terminator has some new interesting abilities that change things up a bit from the T1000 that we remember, and it doesn't bother me that he happens to not be a white guy.I liked very much that they chose to change the location for where much of the movie happens away from your typical American local, it's refreshing to see something outside the norm there (at least, I found it to be).I'll admit, as soon as I saw that Tencent was a financial backer for this movie I IMMEDIATELY removed two stars from my mental review, and assumed that the story here would be for sh**, filled with a ton of unnecessary special effects and CGI. I HATED the recent Godzilla movie (story was AWFUL, and just SO ridiculous), and The Meg wasn't much better...But this is where Tim Miller and James Cameron's influence can be felt, I think. The action/CGI effects are actually quite well balanced with the well-paced story, which doesn't suffer for them, but really just serve to illustrate how this generation's technology can better showcase the futuristic terminator's abilities (something that I think we've all wanted to see).This movie isn't perfect, it does suffer from what I'd argue all current action movies suffer from (which is an immersion-breaking experience, due to the way over the top stunts that the new special effects and CGI are capable of providing), BUT those effects don't feel like they really takes away from what I really felt was a decent story and what I think could be a very good platform for a decent reboot of the franchise on a go-forward basis.T1 & T2 will always sit on a pedestal for me, and I suspect for many others who supplied review here, but I think that it's important that we remember that the movie industry as a whole has changed since then and they don't make movies the way that they used to; that doesn't mean that we have to dismiss every new iteration as trash.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2849,ewhen-nebesniak-588-981375,Finally a decent Terminator film,8,25 October 2019,"There is a lot of hate swirling around this film from the first release of the images and from the first trailer. A lot of people made up their minds based on that.
All I will say is that, although not perfect, it does get the close to the beats of the first two.
The humour is more in line with the second and not over the top like it was in the other sequels.
The characters are great and bad Terminator does give off a ""relentless vibe"" which has also been missing from the other films.
Just go watch it. Tim Miller did a good job on Deadpool and does a decent job here.

The best thing in the movie was the special effects in creating T2 John Connor and T2 Sarah Connor. Then John Connor dies. I loved the first two movies. T2 is in my top 5 favorite films of all time. This movie tells you that those movies never happened, and to watch their reboot nonsense. This is like watching a bad Avengers movie. Terrible. They need to stop making these movies.

I wasn't at all keen on the Grace character; she seemed utterly devoid of good ideas with regards how to carry out her mission. Grace is a weak inferior comparison to Kyke Reece.Having had a franchise build up the whole 'John Connor, saviour of mankind' concept, it did initially feel strange to see him killed at the very start of T:DF and see a new resistance leader set up. But then, considering the fact they destroyed skynet at end of T2 it's not too surprising the future has Legion now instead of skynet. The direction that DF went in has warmed to me overnight.I think this is a good Terminator film to end the franchise on.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Then I saw so many negative reviews that I expected a bad movie. I went to the theater anyway. Surprisingly, Dark Fate turned out to be a fantastic movie.First off, it was great to see Arnold and Linda Hamilton being T101 and Sarah Conor. Secondly Mackenzie Davis provided a super awesome performance. She was impeccable as Grace. The story was pretty good, not very special or memorable, but I can say after T2 it was the best story. Not forget that the movie is full of state-of-the-art action and it won't disappoint with spectacular visual effects. I enjoyed the movie.So what is there so many negative reviews?1. The main héros are female and/or Mexican. Unfortunately some people don't like this fact. I saw this an auspicious progress of Hollywood showing the true diversity of humans, but some folks saw political correctness motive behind it.2. Many of us compare it to T2. Please don't. T2 was one-of-a-kind movie. It was a masterpiece that can hardly be reproduced.

I'm pretty sure this was his last terminator movie so this was their way of writing him out... or at least that's my opinion... he wasn't the front man of the movie and I think they r trying to pass the torch... if they make another terminator movie I'd be surprised to c him in it and then all you guys will be mad that it's not a terminator movie without him in it...

Sarah Connor may have broken one possible path / loop in Terminator 2 but fate reprises itself in ""dark fate"" - the Legion emerges instead of Skynet and Dani rises instead of John Connor. As Grace says near the end of the film... Judgement Day... A great break from films that base their success on shallow plots and special effects.

The graphics are terrible, the script is just laughable, the acting is not great not terrible and the soundtrack is ""just-another-hollywood-soundtrack"" with cheap technique and standard orchestration. Terminator settling down made me cringe and feel embarrassed for the whole idea. Who the hell came up with this insanity? Why in the name of T1 and T2 should I feel embarrassed and not the makers of this ""movie""? I presume Mr Cameron is REALLY into his Avatar 2 production, so this was just a little paycheck write-off. Didn't work out though, because the grossing for this ""movie"" is just pathetic so far. It bombed in the box office and it will stay the same pile of garbage after that. It will never become a cult classic even on the DVD release. I must give some credit when the credit is due - the cinematography was not that bad at some parts of the movie.

It is a carbon copy of T2 except that this movie had to be woke. If studios keep putting wokeness over good storytelling then I see a ""Dark Fate"".
Now I am entering spoiler territory. The fact that the T800 kills John Connor makes absolutely no sense. First of all, why did the T800 of T2 destroyed itself if some other killers could be around? Also, Skynet was destroyed because no evidence whatsoever was left of any terminator, and now there's one loose and Skynet is not created... but Legion is. And all for making the leader of the rebellion a woman... for the sake of wokeness.

Aesthetically it's awesome, has great action scenes and fights, plot now that's complicated because depending on how strongly you feel about the first two films is whether you'll like that, I went with 3 other friends to see this, myself and 1 enjoyed it, the other two walked out. Plot holes yes but who cares it's a film, like it says at the top it's such a mixed bag, it's really hard to review, the Arnie story is particularly hard to digest be warned, if you survive that you'll probably enjoy the movie.

Was far better than terminator salvation and genisys. Good action scenes and i liked the new characters - even though i wasn't expecting them.
Arnie wasn't quite the same but had some shades of his old terminator self.

Alas, I still left thoroughly satisfied with what Tim Miller has come up with.The film is basically centred around Sarah Conner's grief and redemption. The way the T-101 is introduced is similar to the other and worse, T-3, where he is the one that killed John Connor. This works and some very good de-aging is used.The rest of the cast does well, with the augmented human giving us both human characteristics with terminator attributes, however it is hard to believe the Dani girl will give birth to the new John Connor, she lacks the bite that Linda Hamilton brought at the end of T1/T2.The T-101 is brought in as a tie in to past films and also a bit of comic relief. Arnie combines the parody of T-3 with the ageing of T-5 but this time it is done well, with the laughing moments coming off.

T2 was fresh when it came out, I recall watching this film at the pictures in 91 and being blown away by the liquid metal T1000 and at the time the film has a feel of being ahead of it;s time. But not here and this new Terminator - Rev-9 has nothing fresh about it and with a black liquid covering reminds me of the film Venom.

I thought the concept that there can be Terminator machines sent from lost futures still roaming around in the past to be interesting. Casting was solid too. The old heroes were solid even considering their ages. Mackenzie Davis, as the guardian human from the future, was surprisingly intense.I like that they discarded the 3 previous films. While I can enjoy them to varying degrees, they really needed to be forgotten.One complaint would be that there is again too much extreme CG action. I feel like every Terminator since 3 has gone too far with it because Hollywood must see it was an expectation. Whenever people are stretching, bending and flipping about like they are plastic and have no weight, or flying into objects in ways that would kill a normal person but instead get up for more, the suspension of disbelief suffers.Special recognition however to that beginning CG scene with 1991-age Sarah, John and Arnold. That was some very fine CG actor work.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2914,jakerenomusic,Waste of time,4,1 November 2019,"SPOILER** Terminator Salvation was way better than this one and Salvation wasn't that great. I don't understand how James Cameron signed off on this as a producer. I read that he wanted to end the T1 & T2 terminator series with this movie, but I didn't realize he meant wrapping up the first two movie's franchise story by showing a small glimpse in the beginning of the movie of Sarah and John in Mexico and then a different terminator (that I guess sky net also sent, I'm guessing from the first movie because it was the Arnold style terminator and not the liquid terminator style, they sent a couple terminators instead of just one to try and kill Sarah or John instead of just the ones from T1 or T2 and it was trying to find them the whole time and finally found them in Mexico????) comes out of no where and kills John?? really?! So that is the way he closes that terminator's Franchise's paradox loop?! That's how you close it but only to reopen a whole different paradox loop, to start what I'm guessing a whole new terminator franchise series?! So on to the rest of the movie... an advanced human is sent back to protect a girl from a bad ass terminator but why wouldn't you get a bad ass looking dude? That dude did not look bad ass at all, he looks like a middle school soccer coach. The girl they are trying to protect sucks at acting. Why couldn't they have gotten a better actress and maybe a better looking girl too. oh GEEZ now on to finding Arnold in the cabin! WTF?! So dumb!! a robot finished its mission of killing John so it wanted to find a purpose so it found a kid and a mom and helped raise the kid and learned to be more human and got all snuggled up in a cabin with a dog and grew older and facial hair and worked a normal job. Really?! come on?! Realistically when that terminator finished its mission, it would of just went dormant or switched off or just sat down and did nothing or went on a killing spree until someone killed it or something. ANYTHING other than that dumb outcome! SO DUMB!! I could go on and on, but this movie was a waste of time. WASTE OF MONEY!!",Terminator - Dark Fate

This film picked me up and gripped me from the outset, with some absolutely stunning action sequences. The new Terminator gave me something I'd not felt since T1... a truly scary villain that absolutely will not stop... ever!As movies go - it does what it says on the tin and is well worth the time & money to go watch it. I'll definitely be heading back to the cinema for a second helping.The two most powerful entities in the film are played by men... they just don't spend most of the movie going around rescuing the women, who demonstrate that they can definitely take care of themselves.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2919,skim95,Finally A Good Send Off for The Franchise,9,2 November 2019,I have held out hope each time a new entry in the terminator franchise has come around and each time I've been let down. This one did not disappoint. Threw new curveballs into the tired story while still being respectful to the original films. No heavy handed references or one liners ripped from the classics. Well done on all accounts. Only negative thing I would have to say about this film was that the cgi could have been more polished in a few spots but overall I thoroughly enjoyed it.,Terminator - Dark Fate
2920,romanticapped,Another Franchise destroyed by todays film industry.,2,26 January 2020,"This movie is a Femdom rehash of previous Terminator films, it kills the main and most important character in order to move a Woman into the top slot, they destroy the History and the Future of the series all-together just to push an agenda. Basically they are milking it for money at this point and once again Special effects take front seat over actual plot, story line and acting. There is as usual no conclusion what-soever to the series and no moving forward either. They are caught in a loop of changing history where there is always a machine threat no matter what happens. The original is tossed aside by killing Connor and making his future and timeline meaningless as he never gets to be the savior he was supposed to be. Just so they could replace his character with a female one.
There is no sense or rhyme in the progression, it may have some entertainment value, but overall in the end was pointless as far as story and movement of events go. too bad they wasted the opportunity to use the original actors to better use.",Terminator - Dark Fate

So any way, not trying to make sense of the movie, just enjoy it, and it was very enjoyable. Great action, drama, blowing stuff up, my kind of movie.

But after Sarah Connor showed up again I lost interest in the movie. I hoped that it would do something different but no, its just Judgement Day with a lot of fan service. One of the main characters, whos name ive forgotten, is the most bland and boring character. I am talking about the John Connor replacement, the girl who Sarah Connors and the new cyborg character protects throughout the story. The action was the highlight and the effects were often great but i found it all in all a pretty boring and bland film experiance.
Just a quick note; this movie does not deserve the hate that it gets from ""fans"" which names pretty dumb reasons to hate the movie that is because them not liking that that their fanboy fantasies dont come true.

2936,weseastin,Great For What They Could Let It Be,8,2 November 2019,"Considering the trend of most big franchises built on nostalgia regularly disappointing, I couldn't find it in my heart to be mad at this film. Acting as though the last three films didn't exist was refreshing and was the easiest suspension of disbelief I've ever willingly given over.It did a lot of things very well and didn't feel like the obvious regurgitated cash grab or oblivious retconning that the last few films have stunk of. This felt like an honest attempt at, well maybe rebooting isn't the right word (please just leave it alone now) but let's just say honoring the first two films in a way we haven't seen before.The idea that every sequel you make has to be BIGGER and BADDER and EXPLODIERY is nonsense so with that tendency in mind it's no wonder there are places where the film's story completely leaves the track which feels like someone made that OH SO common call in Hollywood, ""They need to get from here to there and your script slows down. Can we just throw some helicopters and planes at them?""I'm honestly very surprised Dark Fate was allowed to be as good as it is. Too many cooks are in the kitchen these days and the results, more often than not, are dreadful, cynical messes.All of that being said, Mackenzie Davis and Linda Hamilton were super badasses and most of the action was absolutely riveting. So can we just let Terminator die, now? It's pretty clear from the opening weekend that most of us... *sigh*... Won't be back.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2956,scarlet-45219,Generic action flick with political bias,4,1 November 2019,"The first mistake was to kill John Connor, the timeline has been reset but the first two movies are now pointless as well. All of Sarah Connor's struggles to save her son from the T-1000 have now been rendered pointless. His death was shown at the start of the film and over in 5 minutes. Such a crucial character to the franchise unceremoniously killed off.Sarah Connor is now a Terminator hunter and cranky old woman. It was good to see Linda Hamilton kicking arse again but it felt forced, like fan service.The return of Arnie as the Terminator was more fan service. He's the same T-800 that gunned down John at the start of the film. A ruthless killer machine has somehow developed a conscience and understanding of humans, is now living a normal life with a woman and acting as a father figure to her son and running a business called 'Carl's draperies. This is one of the parts that bothered me the most, such weak writing. The T-800 didn't have human emotions and a human conscience, it's only goal was to terminate, it's a damn machine for Christ's sakes! There was humour with his character but he was just phoning it in.A new character Dani Ramos is introduced and is being hunted by a new Terminator-Rev-9 that can split into two Terminators, ""his whole body is a weapon"". I quite liked the new Terminator but the cgi looked crappy. He was the best part of this weak film. To aid Dani we have Grace, a cybernetically- enhanced human full of surgical scars. She assaults people just doing their jobs and kicks major arse. The actress did her best with the material on offer. The actress playing Dani however was very poor. Rev-9 kills her brother and dad and she doesn't seem very bothered for long. She's not believable as a resistance leader that inspires people or a badass.This movie is basically judgement day set partially in Mexico with a Mexican, female John Connor. Complete with a car chase on a motorway involving the Rev-9. These new characters however, just do not match up to the originals.The scenes with the US border control are cliché with all the border staff demonised for doing their jobs.The Rev-9 is immensely powerful but is destroyed too easily in the end.Most of the humour falls flat and some of the dialogue is cringeworthy, example: Grace and Sarah: ""I wish it wasn't so crowded here""
Dani: ""I wish you wasn't so white"" 🙄This movie is basically an average run-of-the-mill action movie. It feels like it was just made to cash in on the Terminator name. Nothing is new, the new characters are weak, apart from Rev-9. There is no emotional connection to any of the characters like in the first two movies, the first two were the only very good ones, the rest were weak. They need to stop flogging this dead horse because they cannot capture the brilliance of the first two movies. I struggle to remeber most of this movie it was that forgettable.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2958,SethYoungRuiz,Mehinator : Bland Fate.,3,24 October 2019,"Even with putting aside the very on-the-nose politically correct / progressist message, this is not a competent sequel to The Terminator and Terminator 2 Judgment Day.It is fast paced to the point of feeling rushed, and being not engaging : I didn't see any reason to like the new characters that much (one is ridiculously miscast, another is super powerful - long gone are the days of tha charsmatic Kyle Reese taking on a killing machine far more dangerous than him for a irrational yet deep love). Sarah Connor, sadly, is very one-note, and the T-800 is pretty much just a dude with a metal skeleton now. The dialogue is bland at best, sometimes unnatural, and often cheesy. Felt like a rushed rehash of T1 & T2. There's some interesting ideas in there (having to cross a boarder with a Terminator and a police force on your trail, Sarah Connor being a Terminator hunter...) but that too is rushed. Also, the movie was surprisingly lacking in emotion (again, rushing everything does that).Directing is meh, editing sometimes very choppy, CGI looks cartoonish compared to T2, some actors are miscast...It wasn't quite as bad as the worse moments in T3, 4, 5, but it's sometimes cringy still, and never really good.I wanted to like it, but at best it felt like there was a good movie somewhere in there, or like a little less offensively bad Genysis.",Terminator - Dark Fate

2970,dellis-71445,DO NOT BELIEVE THE CRITICAL PRAISE,3,7 November 2019,"After seeing the good reviews this film received (Empire four stars, RT 71%) I was hopeful for a film in its 6th instalment but I was left disappointed.There's nothing new here to see, just another long and dull Terminator chase, devoid of excitement, menace and tension. We've had so many new Terminators and people that MUST be protected that the whole thing has become generic and boring.John Connor is dead which for reasons I don't understand means that Skynet and Judgement Day didnt happen, but unfortunately for us a military AI project called Legion went out of control and produced exactly the same apocalyptic results of nuclear war and Terminators on a mission to eradicate the human race.This time its a woman who must live but she doesn't even seem to be surprised, scared or show much reaction at all to a robot from the future trying to kill her, her family and obliterating the world around them.Sent back to protect her is a cyber enhanced diabetic giraffe. Also helping is gravely voiced Linda Hamilton who is easily the best thing about this film and she looks older than my Nan who has been dead for 15 years.No Terminator film would be complete without Arnie, now living a family life in a woodland cabin after completing his mission of killing John Connor (uh didnt he actually save John Connor then get lowered into molten lava last time we saw him in T2?) He has apparently grown a conscience so helps out too.With the gang reunited we get a ridiculous Fast and Furious style finale with the girls falling out of a plane in a Humvee and then a final battle.I can only think that there must be some sort of media conspiracy or bribery going on, I wanted to like it but its just another Terminator sequel that shouldnt have happened. Can we send somebody back to take out all those involved?",Terminator - Dark Fate
2971,johntzane,Enough,3,24 January 2020,"Hollywood must stop making crap sequels with lazy Back To The Future storylines! Avengers End Game pulled it off gloriously, leave it to Megamind, (only one capable since 2 of his films had no1 place for 2 decades) James Cameron to reclaim his throne with Avatars 2,3,4,5,6,7....... and stop trying to integrate social, political, feminist, etc ideas in a place where we go to be entertained. The freaking movies!! Yes, no more scripts are available, it's all CGI toady, no romance, no culture, but I don't care anymore, we have iPhones and Alexa, all our 80/90s blockbusters lead up to this and future eras, with hoverboards and flying cars. why not be entertained by watching it now with better visual effects on the big screen without having to deal also with forced feminism in a terminator film. Linda Hamilton will always be remembered as a badass alongside Edward Furlong and the Governator in one of the greatest films of ALL time!! And now this. No wonder I omly just watched this film today.
We already should have been in the 2nd or 3rd film of the trilogy where J C is leading humanity into victory against Skynet in the future and be done with the Terminator saga, that's what the original films were leading up to. Enough with old crap remakes, make them good or go home. Disney already destroyed Star Wars. James Cameron, you are our John Connor, movie gowers last chance...",Terminator - Dark Fate

Boy was I wrong. Imposing 3 leading female charcters actually gets you no leading charcter. After watching the movie all I can say about charcaters is that they messed up big time. They could have found a way better actor for the Mexican girl, Sarah is a grumpy old lady, the girl from the future is clicheic and t800 is a bad joke.I have seen the first 2 films when I was a child, and I remember that I was genuinely scared by the ""coldness"" of the terminators. This terminator was mostly boring and too chatty.In the first part I liked the scene where the terminator didn't let go. No matter what the characters did he would still find a way to closely chase and attack them. This scene was the only one I enjoyd because it reminded me the first two movies.But what made me truly sad was the fact that they killed John Connor. This means that all that s**t Sarah and her son went through was in vain. They basically denied the first two movies.",Terminator - Dark Fate

Part Terminator 2 Judgement Day, with a complete rehash of the plot of The Terminator all with the diversity of a hispanic cast. A young girl is persued buy a terminator from the future. She is protected by a human sent from the future. Because thia is an alternate reality take on Terminator 2, Sarah Conner and the T101 that killed John Conner after the events in The Terminator are in it too. The new Terminator is part endo-skeleton part T1000 liquid metal, which makes it as of two terminators are after the girl instead of one. The protector human is augmented, so part human part machine, and with the help of T101 played by The Arnold they are fairly evenly matched.

2985,ctuck-82366,Why all the complaining?,8,30 November 2019,"I have read reviews for weeks and finally decided to go see it. I am really not understanding why all the super negative reviews. I'm a fan of the series and for many to state it is the worst one, I dont get it. Yes l, killing John was an aggressive move but it does make sense at a high level. Humans will always try to destroy ourselves for power and greed and there will always be some sore of resistance to big moves. The story made sense to me. The acting was good to very good in parts. The action sequences were on par with Terminator movies. Arnold was great in his iconic role. Linda did great too. Really liked Grace and the Rev Terminator. I thought writers restrained from some potential campy stuff..like if Aronold thumbed up when dying again, that would have been too much. Some of the complaints are straight made up.I do think this will be the last one in any state for many years unless a full reboot happens and the first is somehow remade.It's worth a watch if you aren't hung up on analyzing all the plot details. If u did, how u enjoyed any of the series amazes me.",Terminator - Dark Fate

I avoided the 2 installments between T3 and this because I thought they looked like they were missing all of that from the trailers.

2989,ralan-10588,Terminator: The money grab,2,3 November 2019,"""Terminator: The money grab"", a true dark fate of the franchise. This is official now, we got the Terminator movie from the bottom of the barrel. Whole movie is based on an old premise, and feels like bland of T1 and T2 and reversed T3, even the new antagonist is just that T800 and T1000 combined into one machine. Might feel like a continuation of T2 but is not true to T2 Director's Cut version. Action sequences are beyond absurd with virtually no reality feel to them, some self aware jokes thrown here and there make for at least some entertainment.
On the good note acting and characters are much better then in Genisis. - This is definitely a movie no fan of T2 will like.",Terminator - Dark Fate
2990,dowsemousei,For a stand alone film it's not terrible,7,16 November 2019,I went into the cinema thinking about all the 1* and 3* reviews. Yes it's nothing compared to T1 or T2 but considering everything its alright. Apart from the cringy one liners and at times weak dialogue the action and effects are not bad. Yes I definitely agree that it should with out a doubt be the last film. the story is average at best but for what it is it's not terrible I would give it exactly what it's worth 6.5 if I could.,Terminator - Dark Fate
2991,alchrisreal,A good movie,8,16 January 2020,In my opinion this is a good movie to watch. I don't understand why is every body hating on this.

2993,shafahmed,Dark Fate,7,16 January 2020,Terminator Dark Fate A good movie I should say I recently watched it and I do like that movie not because that I am action lover because I actually does love terminator franchise. The reason am writing the review because most of the people have criticized the movie. I don't know why but I think they are somehow wrong in some way although it was fresh with 70% at rotten tomatoes. Well back to the movie.it was very good action flick CGI was pretty much good too acting was satisfactory only weak point of the movie was the story. The story was very confusing in many ways the timeline was unexplained and they killed franchise major Character John Conner in start of the film? Can you believe that the character which all the films and franchise were based on. And they made a female major character now. After all those years. Even though James Cameron was attached to the project but still it was not a big success at box office just because of the confusing story. But this movie was better well way better than the previous installments like T3 and Terminator Genesis. If you talk about Action it was Up to the mark. A Villain terminator Rev-9 was Awesome and Grace was Superb Too. Acting of Sarah Connor was quite impressive after all the years. The Only Main problem of the film was the plot and the story And One Last Thing we all will miss Arnold Schwarzenegger as Terminator He was is and always will be Our Best Terminator. I would give this movie 7 out of 10.,Terminator - Dark Fate

It's the second time in a month a director (tim miller) more familiar with comedy (Deadpool) has been involved with a much loved non comedy franchise and whilst it wasn't terrible, the stench of virtue signalling made for a difficult watch. all female leads, casting a minority as the new John Connor figure, the plight of economic migrants and even the pedantic language used around detention centres are clunkily thrown into the story seemingly in a desperate attempt to prove wokeness rather than any great desire to push the story on. I got goosebumps when I seen Arnie feature in the trailer but was sorely disappointed when his purpose was revealed and less said about the The new terminator the better, didn't possess a fraction the menace of Robert Patrick or even Kristiana Loken in rise of the machines.

I know, I know, T3 through Genisys still exist, but this calibre of movie is what people would expect to follow T2. The special effects and action were AMAZING!!! There is literally nowhere action didn't take place-air, water, land-everywhere is covered except space!And for those who complain about strong female leads, Terminator has ALWAYS been about strong female leads from the very first movie! Clearly these people are forgetting that it was Sarah Connor who trained John to be the leader of the resistance in the future. Sarah was always the strong one. And now there are more strong women. NOTHING wrong with that. Additionally, James Cameron always has strong female leads in his movies, so why people are surprised/upset by Dark Fate is beyond me.The actors were all excellent-especially Gabriel Luna and Mackenzie Davis. They were both extremely believable in their roles and captivating to watch. And the story was tight from beginning to end. No plot holes whatsoever! The story was relevant to our time (2019) just like the first movie was to the 80s and the second was to the 90s.This movie was awesome, and I can't wait to buy it in Ultra HD so I can see it again and again.

First off, this is Terminator and with all it's glory of great action scenes coupled with a decent plot and great pacing. To answer all the negative reviews, yes the story line is very similar. Not sure what to tell those people except that what makes Terminator work in the 80s and 90s makes it work today. The big picture message in the franchise can't be shared enough...watch out for the precipice of AI!So, these action sequences in Dark Fate make the Matrix action scenes look like dated. The energy and rythm are amazing and the pacing is on time. Linda Hamilton kills it and really I was unsure about her in the movie but she just brings it home. Arnie has a good showing with his dry humor. Glad this piece left off after Judgement Day. Rise and Genesys were decent and Salvation was horrible but this new work can really hold up to the first 2 in the franchise.I saw T2 when I was 16 and this was a great full circle experience.",Terminator - Dark Fate

To replace John Connor with a girl and SKYNET with another AI with another name that does exactly the same things, triggers the same Judgement Day and even uses the same NAMES for its creatures (""Terminators"", ""Hunter-Killers"").You killed John Connor for this? For not a bit of real change? Go to hell.Arnold ""the househusband"" is pathetic and illogical too, why on earth a killing machine that accomplished its mission should care about a family out of nowhere without the long human relationship shown in T2?
For no reason at all.
And he enjoys the company of a DOG!? In the whole franchise, dogs can detect Terminators, for Christ sake.Again, go to hell.I hope that this horrible movie just flop hard at the box office and it would be the last episode of the franchise.

That we got Sarah Conner and the original terminator working togethet felt like a perfect ending of a era while the new cast got their chance to shine. And I got to say, that was probably my favourit thing about this new take. The complete lack of american white pretty boy that is usually found in 99% of all action movies.

3044,s-78369,True sequel to the franchise,10,31 October 2019,"I read all the hate on imbd by people and therefore I went in to this film with low expectations. However I was very entertained! For me it hit all the right marks. Linda Hamilton was exceptional reprising her role as one might expect her character to develop in the 2 decades since her last ordeal. The hybrid human Grace, (played by Mackenzie Davis), brought realism and intensity to her character with her no-nonsense demeanor intent on achieving her sole mission. She quickly establishes herself as a worthy guardian of the new target Dani Ramos (Natalia Reyes). Natalie nailed it as a person trying to deal with a crazy nightmare situation she had no hope of getting out from. These three characters are very well balanced against each other delivering the right balance between drama and the few moments of humour. Schwarzenegger makes a great come back as the terminator who for once is handled authentically by writers who have felt out what such a character could develop into. Tim Miller has given us a worthy Terminator film to place next to T1 & T2 judgement day. There is no fat here, just a lean, superb flick that doesn't let up. Do yourself a favour and don't listen to all the negative comments about gender ruining this film and just go watch it. I'd be kicking myself had I not seen it on the big screen.",Terminator - Dark Fate

3047,malin-36181,So disappointing,1,25 October 2019,"Was looking forward to this for months and ended up leaving the cinema an hour in. There is no heart in this film at all. The plot is just rehashed rather than moved forward, the characters are either dull or over the top and the action scenes are so long and often that it became boring.
John Connor's death scene wasn't even slightly moving in the way it was shown. Waiting for Arnie's appearance is all that kept me there. Once his unbelievably cringeworthy story was revealed that pushed me over the edge and I couldn't watch any more. I genuinely wish I hadn't watched it and just kept my fond memories of T2. People say Genisys was rubbish but at least it was an orignal story. I'd watch that over this any day!",Terminator - Dark Fate
3048,houstonjazzcouple,Ok action but tired storyline (spoilers contained),3,2 February 2020,"I really wanted to like this movie. It had the original Sarah Connor, T-800, and original director as producer. (James Cameron, who directed the original) The previous films since T3 (a good but not really memorable addition to the original franchise itself) had been off the mark disappointments that never felt like the original two. (At last T3 kinda felt like a Terminator movie) The Sarah Connor Chronicles was a fun TV show that never really added much story arc to the franchise, but was nevertheless watchable Terminator-style story.So I had hopes this might breathe some new life into the franchise while adding nostalgia from the original via Linda Hamilton and Arnold bring back. I should have known. Very few franchises have been successful when trying to bring the original cast back to try and capture what they did 20-40 years ago in a modern telling to modern audiences. Usually it winds up as bad fanboy service with terrible acting that places one liners that were once badass and making them comical, out of context memes that maybe get a precursory chuckle out of a die hard fan until they realize that the cheese lost its charm and is now really just a sucker ploy with no substance trying to draw a ""one more time"" feeling from less intellectual fans who will forgive bad story telling and senseless, even blatantly ""non-canon"" plot for one last hurrah with an actor well past their prime (at least for the role presented) and well past the role's relevance to modern events. Basically, it's a cheap way to get old fans to spend money. But that's rife with peril for a franchise.So you get this movie. Great effects and action that is vintage Terminator. Even a car chase style sequence transposed for helicopters and large cargo jets. Classic over the top 80's style action and they deserve top scores for capturing that kinda fun nostalgia where disbelief is trumped by absolute joy and laughing out loud at the audacious action that embraces the fiction part of science fiction. (And action movies in general) This is where the movie earns the couple of stars I gave it.Problem is it's a waste after that. Arnold is Arnold and that's great. Even at 70-ish, he is still in incredible shape and has a palpable screen presence. But he adds very little to the story other than nostalgia and a useful weapon, at times, that you know will probably be a sacrificial hero. Predictable. And the attempt to humanize this particular T-800 fell completely flat. Just can't buy into the attempt to give it a soul here and it feels like Arnold didn't buy it either in his performance. His classic charisma isn't gone but it's impossible to buy into the humanization of this particular T-800. Especially after they had captured it so perfectly in T2.Linda Hamilton was fine and did kinda bring back grumpy, bitter Sarah Connor from T2. But the writers failed the character by having John Connor killed and Sarah now blindly hating Terminators (even the T-800) again. It undid all of the beautiful character development of T2. So we're back to the bitter Sarah of the beginning of T2. Linda still plays the badass version of Sarah well, complete with sarcasm and bold threats and big guns. But for me, the character didn't age well and neither did the actress in the role. Not that Linda doesn't still look amazing. But without the heart the character had in the first movie and had to rediscover in a tangible and relatable way in the second, she's just not as attractive in this film because she shows almost no humanity.Mackenzie Davis is really a bright spot as Grace. She makes the most out of a character that's never fully realized and is kinda everything Arnold wasn't in the original movie. She's well cast and, admittedly, it's hard not to have a crush on her with her humanity and, honestly, incredible umm ""physical assets."" (Superior posterior) She's a girl next door character that can totally kick you but is also quite vulnerable at times as a human being. I think they wrote her a little too infatuated with Dani, but ok. They did have to have a bond beyond just bodyguard to be believable and she almost got to level Arnold did with the T2 version of the T-800 ""Uncle Bob."" Best new casting for sure.Natalia Reyes as Dani didn't quite work for me though. No fault of Miss Reyes. Her performance was fine given what she had. But the writers were terrible to the character. No mourning over her father's and brother's fate's poor writing and a total disservice to the potential of the character. And her as the new version of ""John Connor"" felt like a rip-off. There just weren't enough interesting differences and no nuance and depth to the character.Gabriel Luna was fine as the new Terminator model. Maybe a little too must dialogue when trying to seem human. But he had the physicality and expressions down enough to be a convincing soulless assassin. Ya was fine. My biggest problem with this Terminator model is that they never addressed the solid vs ""liquid"" forms of this model and how the obvious weakness was to separate the two and destroy the ""skeleton"" that appears to control the ""corporreally-challenged"" shape shifter side. The whole thing was left unanswered, unsatisfactorily.In closing (finally!) this movie was right there in terms of look and tone of a Terminator film.... but missed overall. It didn't meaningfully update the characters. It didn't really do anything substantively to move the characters or plot forward. It's just kinda predictable. Alas, it falls into the ""if you've seen one, you've seen them all"" category.",Terminator - Dark Fate

3071,newwayfarer,"Time for a spoller-free review, and some issues about how others judge the film",9,2 November 2019,"I'm going to avoid major spoilers since this film has not been out long at the time of my published review here.Let me get a few things out of the way that highlights why most of the 1 star reviews are questionable. It is for a few reasons: One is the doctrinal-type of fan or overly sentimentalist view that T1 and T2 are such masterpieces, that by those subjective and objective facts alone - warrants anything from the franchise after (by principle of existing alone) is demeaning them.As a fan who is passionate, I can say that some works after T1 and T2 left a lot to be desired... but, the issue I am addressing is the subjective angle where by default it is wrong to continue a series people are passionate about kills it, and any fiction really. T1 and T2 are products of it's time where their success was depended on how technology was developing. It was how CGI done under the right methods was paving the way to new things most US audiences (or even globally) had not seen before in published media.We can say what makes fiction good these days is how consistent the tone is, plot and characters are. Not if it is breaking new grounds or doing something we never seen before - which is impossible in the present day - as almost every plot and story possible has been seen by most audiences through time. That and/or our connections we've form over the internet with people to other media.Also technology along with budget has currently capped in terms of what it can produce visually.With all above considered, it isn't fair to judge modern titles entirely using subjective aspects of T1 and T2 as the benchmarks alone. What we can add as benchmarks is how much did this film objectively follow what is consistent trends defining this series as a whole, that those previous two films and maybe some other media that did well established. In my view, they did well with all hey were working with in terms of how the franchise has went astray with tonal and trend aspects that define the series. I think it did far more consistent with the series than prior film or media that jumped too far out of tones, trends and plots that defined the series.Actually contrary to what many say, it did do something different and unexpected with what the female ""terminator"" ended up being. There is room for improvements with how some editing, and bits of how the story was presented could of used another method that would be more characteristic of T1 and T2 tones. I think also the main antagonist could of had some quirks to make him more memorable. I felt the start of the film could of used more content before it started the story, and the ending felt abrupt from they ways I have seen T2 ended.However, I will say as is it was very decent for entertainment and building off of a franchise that has been pushed to it's knees in recent years. The humor was just right without killing the tone of the events.Another argument is the plot is the same as the other films is another argument.
(That's just the foundation of how the series is, the same plot with a different ending or some twist.) That's more of a matter of subjective taste really, and isn't an objective measurement of it's shortcomings. It's the same issue as above, people coming to see something new or groundbreaking as the only measurement of what makes fiction good, when it's about how the story, characters and tone was done for the series.Here is one I see a lot: Most of the cast were women, so it must be a US gender, modern-feminist or social-political allegory.
Actually this is one thing that surprised me... I went in ready to be disappointed by expecting what is the recent US trend of using fiction as a political medium, especially with having a mostly female cast. Instead I got what I like, strong characters that happen to be women!I also think that is a HUGE factor why this film bombed in the US. As someone learning to write fiction, I noticed in the last few years the cultural shift that has happen over here: We want fiction to be nothing more than controversy and propaganda for real world political advertisement, especially when it comes to women. If it's not, we are not going to pay attention to it. Even if the characters are good or even decent, and happen to be women? We don't like that ether, and will just throw a blanket over it as must being propaganda too. I think this plays a huge factor as to why it bombed in the US. Being interested in entertainment, or being immersed in fiction to tell a story of characters (male/female/other) or fictional concepts is something quickly dissipating in US general culture, and increasingly isolated to several niche communities only. As for this film I was surprised it never pushed any ""because I am a woman I have to prove I am strong against men"" message from the characters like the Batgirl trailer did, nor did they came off as bullies or belittling. These were heroines that were strong and caring because they had to be thanks to their environment, and showed positive human character, even when two didn't trust each other they still put their distrust aside to work together. That was inspiring and refreshing to see in a film made over here staring women. Just on those merits alone had me toss in an extra star into my rating.",Terminator - Dark Fate
3072,eamzo,I don't leave reviews but...,1,1 October 2020,"I don't leave reviews but this is probably in the top 5 worst movies I've ever seen. Yes, it is that bad. We can't all be wrong.

We don't have to keep bringing back Arnie again and again to sell the movie. Hopefully terminator can die a peaceful death now.",Terminator - Dark Fate
3073,micah_hodge,8 of 10 rated 10 out of 10 to combat the negativity,10,7 November 2019,This movie was a true sequel to the second terminator film. I know we all wanted a true John Connor story but that bridge was burnt a long time ago. This was the next best thing. It was a new timeline with a great story and everything we loved about the first two movies. It even threw in some of the good things from the average movies and made them fit in.People seem to be afraid of the strong female roles in this movie. I really don't get that. It's not new to this franchise. Sarah Conner is a total badass in T2. Even though the movie wasn't great the villain was a badass in T3. T1 was the only movie where there wasn't a powerful female but even then the stuff that happened helped Sarah Conner to become strong.My main point is get over what you wanted this movie to be. It was a great movie and a great sequel to T2.,Terminator - Dark Fate
3074,sufi-15000,WHY CONTINUE???????,5,24 October 2019,"Terminator reached it's peak after judgement day the story was told finished. Imagine making a sequel to lord of the rings it just isn't gonna work no matter what gimmicks you try. The thing you associated with terminator was ground breaking technology ( T1 metal skeleton, T2 the T-1000) there is nothing visually groundbreaking about any of these films so what's the point and why continue???? I mean they have used feminism as a gimmick and even that hasn't worked. After viewing this Film I was gobsmacked when you come out of an action film and the only scenes you remember are Carl talking about plumbing. When Sarah Connor questions Carl about his wife not noticing he's a terminator and Carl's reply and finally this takes the biscuit but it's true the sexual chemistry between Carl and sarah. Big spoiler it seems like she wants to sleep with the killer of her son this time Linda Hamilton has the best line's yet arnie steals the show yet to relegate him to fourth lead I doubt this film will gross the $440 million of the awful genesis coz no matter how awful genesis and rise of the machines are people watched it for arnie and the gross tells that and salvation a film I like had 5 minutes of arnie and tanked loss of around $25-40 million dollars. 5/10",Terminator - Dark Fate

3078,issacraman,Spoiler Alert - Ending saved the show,7,25 October 2019,"I'm not entirely sure why I felt so emotional as I left the cinema. Perhaps such characters so beloved to you that you've been waiting for so many years to revisit didn't quite turn out the way you had hoped. I think the movie starts off with an incredible pace that grabs the attention of the viewer.I think the opening scene where we revisit Sarah Connor having her rant about the post apocalyptic mental hospital which look like it had been shot using a Snapchat filter that shows the tracking lines of a VHS video player, set the tone for a good start.I think I did find myself ecstatic at various scenes especially when seeing Sarah Connor for the first time. I did clap discreetly.the first time we witnessed the CGI jumping of the rev 9 I have to say shook my head and I was incredibly disappointed. There was no need to put such poor CGI.the scene where we visit John Connor and Sarah at the beach bar, again was really upsetting and I don't think I could warm too Dani, I was still in mourning about John.I think a lot of the action scenes were very impressive, although I would have liked to have seen more drama unless action when exploring the character of Linda. wouldn't it have been a nice touch for carl to give her a picture of John.this movie isn't a radical u turn on any of the previous terminator movies. it is a rehash of the old ideas and concepts. but that necessary isn't a bad thing,maybe I'm just so set into Linda Hamilton's character and characterization but I really didn't think the leader of the resistance suited a small petite Mexican woman.having said that the ending was incredibly powerful and somewhat save the show for me. it was a good twist. and die-hard terminator fans who know the dialogue about fate will understand the relevance.it would be hard to see Arnie again in a next film because it wouldn't make sense for him to come back again.after watching this movie I'm left thinking that the first two movies really are masterpieces.",Terminator - Dark Fate

3084,mumpitz-64839,Worth Watching!,7,26 October 2019,"No this isn't as good or as innovative as T2/T1 but does that make it a bad sequel: NO.I dont think T3/T4/T5 were good sequels: Cheap plot, annoying charakters, bad CGI and so on. Watching them felt like chewing old chewing-gum. Too many inconsistencies with T1/T2 which are the benchmark for any Terminator movie.T6 clearly gave me some of that ""Terminator-Feeling"" again and I'd be happy to see another sequel made of James Cameron and Tim Miller. They know how its done.However: I think they should leave out the jokes in the future. In my oppinion the movies are living of a dark and cold atmosphere. That feeling of getting hunted relentlessly with almost no hope of survival as the bad guy is smarter, stronger, faster: Better. This is what tied me so much to my seat in T1/T2. I think they should have tried to create more of that feeling. IMO there shouldnt be any comedy in this movie. Also some of the CGI looks bad, at some point it looks like watching a cartoon. The ""Family-Terminator"" also sucked in my eyes. There were a few stretches in there where I felt the movie lost direction, as if the writers didn't know how to fill the space due to lack of ideas.Overall I think its definitely worth watching and I wish for a T7 made by the same guys, I'm sure they could even do a little better!Oh and I think Mackenzie Davis and Gabriel Luna were doing really well in this movie! They knew how to play their roles!",Terminator - Dark Fate
3085,peterrong,"Nice re-produce of Terminator 2, a terminator that has almost nothing to do with terminator.",2,4 November 2019,"Plot? Almost the same with terminator 2.
Fancier robots(It can swim now! Nice upgrade!),
More crashes
Different(but basically the same) future.
Problematic settings(Fly to Nevada from Texas in minutes, it's not C5, it's rocket; Huge power source in ur body and ur need prescriptions to stay awake; Anyone ever seen an EMP explode like that?)Connor lost her son, now she has a daughter, so nice i wanna cry.Whoever gave a 7+ score, go watch Terminator 1 & 2 and you get surprised, promise.",Terminator - Dark Fate
3086,fathish-47620,It's just a spin-off,5,25 April 2020,"This isn't a new version of terminator.It's just a spin-off with title ""the saving Dani"" :/",Terminator - Dark Fate
3087,preachercroft-63460,Pretty Great,7,26 November 2019,"I lived in France for 14 years and a half and now I live in Canada, so I have both reviews from both of those countries. In France, they say that this movie is pure garbage and that Terminator Genisys was much better but in United States, some persons say it is a decent movie, some say that's a horrible movie and some say that it is the legacy of Terminator 2.
Well for me, I would say that I think it's a pretty good movie that remembers some Terminator 2 vibes. It is not as great as T2 but it's good! At first when I known that John Connor was killed at the beginning of the movie, I was mad but now that I see this movie, I'm like ""Damn they have some big balls to kill the main character of the whole franchise at the beginning of the movie !"".
Yes it is very sad but at least, they're trying to do something different, something new (with the basics of the franchise like a Terminator come to the past to kill the leader of the Resistance).
It is much better than Genisys wich was a decent movie.",Terminator - Dark Fate
3088,pekatman,Good as old whisky!,9,15 February 2020,"I have see what I have expect to see. A very good terminator ..season. Good scenario, action, and multimillion effects. What else...?",Terminator - Dark Fate
3089,jsshagnasty,Why all the haters.,9,12 January 2021,I guess people cannot accept great fun and amazing special effects. So many hold sequels to a standard that they themselves could not make. Thanks to all the haters for taking away my enjoyment of another sequel.,Terminator - Dark Fate
3090,petarvalidzic,Just terrible,1,3 November 2019,This is the worst film I have ever seen. Complete waste of time and money for some idiots 'PC' politics on the big screen. Shame on you.,Terminator - Dark Fate
3091,michaelmoore-18472,Alt-right-types are triggered snowflakes,10,2 November 2019,"Three heroines team up with Arnold to save the future from a new AI threat. All the characters are tough as nails and like-able. Alt right types will get triggered by the lack of male lead and the extended battle inside and ICE detention center. Ha ha, bunch of snowflakes. The movie is awesome. Sarah Conner and Arnold do it again.",Terminator - Dark Fate
3092,carrieclay-38444,It's so fun!,10,3 November 2019,"I'm a big fan of the series and this movie did not disappoint! I thought it was a great follow- up to Judgement Day. The anticipation of seeing Sarah Connor on that bridge made the whole experience worthwhile! Yeah, there were a couple of things that I sucked my teeth at (whinny Dani and T-800 backstory) but the movie was otherwise awesome! Who cares that it's a reboot of the story we love? What kind of plot do people expect? We all know nothing will ever bring back what we felt when we watched T2, but this is darn close! Watch it, trust me.",Terminator - Dark Fate
3093,alexandrosbend,Congratulations to Arnold Schwarzenegger,8,16 January 2020,I enjoyed the movie very much. Arnold Schwarzenegger was excellent in his role in this action movie despite his age.,Terminator - Dark Fate
3094,havenpoint-81317,Ill not be back,2,27 October 2019,Dear me what can i say other than b movie with good special effects hurrendous acting even by the two A listers utterly disappointing.. hang it up now !,Terminator - Dark Fate
3095,avg-44483,passable,8,3 November 2019,"The terrible sequels are forget it like 3,4,genisys , terminator dark fate its a good efort of cameron to do a decent film and i watched and i have a good time watching , terminator 2 I agree is unforgetable but i think this movie works in his on way to give us justice to all the fans of the franchise",Terminator - Dark Fate
3096,john_schaffner,thought it was great... but I think you may need to be old enough to have seen all three before,9,3 November 2019,"Growing up with the main characters, I was trying to imagine what the movie was like without getting all the inside jokes historical references. For me it was like a really fun family reunion. Arnie really is pretty funny. Mackenzie is breakout in her roll and it was even topical to out political times (maybe that is the source of the bad review?). I actually through the writing and acting was good and the effects first rate. If you are of our 'vintage', you will not be disappointed. Not sure about the millennial's and gen-x'ers. Maybe the whole time traveling robots from the future is so last week :).",Terminator - Dark Fate
3097,sltepper,Has Amy Farrah Fowler seen this?,2,30 March 2020,"I don't know if any of the previous 2,639 reviews have pointed this out, but this latest entry in the Terminator saga has rendered the ENTIRE FRANCHISE pointless. As Amy Farrah Fowler from the Big Bang Theory destroyed Raiders of the Lost Ark by suggesting the title character had no impact on the outcome of the movie, so too does T:DF establish that no matter what the humans do to prevent Judgment Day, it will happen AND no matter what the machines do to kill the hero of the rebellion, a new one will emerge. Realizing that, it doesn't matter if the lead character lives or dies. So all we're left with is some cool special effects and a lot of explosions. If that's your thing, have at it.",Terminator - Dark Fate
3098,vinnytheterp,No mas!,2,12 October 2020,"Please, no more of these movies. Please! I feel obligated to watch these things, since I love the first two in the franchise so much. These last two have been laughably bad. The only thing impressive to me was the flashback scene at the beginning with the stars from Terminator 2. Obviously computer generated, this quick scene looked fantastic.Now for the bad ... the acting and dialogue in this film is, by far, the worst in the franchise. Although a lot of it could have easily been shot outside, 90% off the movie looks and feels very green screen. The 2 hour runtime does this movie no favors either.",Terminator - Dark Fate
3099,tetrapack123,100% Action from the start,8,9 November 2019,"Don't understand all the bad reviews!
It's a well directed movie with a great cast and lots of great action.
I guess a lot of people have a problem with an almost female cast. But if you get over that and just enjoy the movie for hat it is you're in for a hell of a ride.",Terminator - Dark Fate
3100,zyf-37399,"Briefly speaking, a little personal opinion",7,9 November 2019,"After the finisher 6 finished watching, it was indeed a bad film, 6.5 points, of which 0.5 points was my feelings as a Terminator fan. I didn't expect James Cameron's screenwriters and producers to be so bad, and the plots were tribute to all kinds of tributes. The governor is also unable to move. It is no wonder that he will not appear in the Terminator series in the future. It seems that there is no 3D in the entire Wuhan film. If the crazy alien at the beginning of the year (4 points) is this year I will watch it. The lower limit of the domestic movie, the dark fate of the Terminator at the end of the year is the lower limit of the film that I have seen this year. It is not the fans of the Terminator series. You don't have to go to watch it. If you like the Terminator series, you can be cheated once again. I thought that the Arita Fighting Angel was a rotten film set by a seller. I didn't expect the Terminator to be sold evenly. . .",Terminator - Dark Fate
3101,olcayokcal,I ENJOYED IT,10,9 November 2019,"Other reviews are a joke, hating the movie out of spite. For the first time I'm compelled to leave a comment because I really loved the movie. I hadn't watched the older movies since the 90s but remembered the plot. Story maybe had a few plot holes here and there but the action made up for it.Not really going to leave any spoilers here but don't be biased because of the 1 star ratings. It seems fanboys will hate on anything with strong female leads, even going as far as calling Grace a ""man-robot thing"" seriously? Those same people would have no problems if the genders were reversed.",Terminator - Dark Fate
3102,busybeefloorcare,Real Terminator fans will love this movie,9,1 November 2019,If you want a fun blast from the past then this is for you. If you have no knowledge of the Terminator movies then you might not understand some of what is going on. Very fun movie. Lots of special effects. Well worth the money spent.I knocked off 1 star because the way the movie ended could have easily been done at the beginning. I don't like to give details but if you see the movie you will understand.,Terminator - Dark Fate
