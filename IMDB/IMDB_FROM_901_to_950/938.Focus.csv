0,SnoopyStyle,Pairing has potential,6,20 July 2015,"Master con-man Nicky 'Mellow' Spurgeon (Will Smith) is intrigued by amateur thief Jess Barrett (Margot Robbie). He shows her a few moves. She tracks him down later which he expected. She begs him to be her mentor and he lets her into his crew running cons in New Orleans. However at the end, he leaves her behind. Three years later, he's running a con and is surprised to see Jess again in Buenos Aires.This is meant to be a fun caper movie and it is just that at times. I really like Margot Robbie whenever she plays up her fun side. Will Smith could smile a little more and have a bit more fun. They seem to have fun flirting but the movie needs more moments of fun. This pairing has potential which is not fully realized.",Focus
1,Horst_In_Translation,"Not bad, but just tries too be too much, too important for its own good",4,14 January 2017,"""Focus"" is an American 100-minute movie from 2015, so by now it is two years old. It was written by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, a duo of filmmakers who have collaborated for a really long time and this resulted in some good and some not so good works apparently. I guess this one here is somewhere in-between, maybe closer to the ""not so good"". It features Will Smith and Margot Robbie as the lead actors and while both are really big names, I still don't see that great talent in both of them, especially Robbie. They aren't bad actors, but they are also far from convincing unfortunately when their characters require true range and depth and they can only partially make up for these shortcomings with their great deal of charisma. Then again, they fit nicely in here because this movie (and the script in particular) are also about make-believe. The two filmmakers I mentioned earlier definitely need a lesson in subtlety. There are many many scenes and moments, and eventually the entire film, where they go way over the top and not in a good way at all. The first meeting between the two protagonists is a good example. Yes they want to depict that teacher-student relationship and show us how skilled Smith's character is, but all those tricks, all that he steals from her is just too much. Half of the items would really have been enough. This is a bit of shame as the ""angry boyfriend"" scene before that was actually not too bad. And there are more food scenes like the one with BD Wong (he gave a nice supporting performance and is probably among Asia's best in Hollywood right now), which was somewhat fun to see and the best thing is you don't even have to care about American Football to appreciate it because I sure don't.But these bright moments are quickly made up for and the negative element wins eventually. It's all so pompous, pseudo-intelligent and exaggerated that it's almost impossible to appreciate the film as a whole. Robbie and Smith are just means for the story and they also do not manage to elevate the script. The weakest moment of the film is probably the ending. I was tempted to give it a better rating before that final scene with Smith's character's father, but let's be honest here. A dad who shoots his son in the chest (even with the medical justification) is just too much and this is where the film really loses it all and hits rock-bottom. I guess you can check this one out if you really care a lot about the world of con men, but it is still not a satisfying take and elaboration on the subject either. So maybe only check it out if you are a huge Smith and/or Robbie fan. Otherwise skip it and you are not missing much, especially not in terms of realism and fraud as the biggest trick pulled off in here was to make audiences believe this is actually a convincing work. Thumbs down.",Focus
2,nogodnomasters,CONGRATULATIONS. YOU'RE A CRIMINAL,6,25 September 2018,"Nicky (Will Smith) is a big time scam artist who scams people by second nature. He recruits Jess (Margot Robbie) a pick pocket to help him fleece the crowd in New Orleans during a football event.

It involved slight of hand and scams and I felt like I was watching ""Now You See It.""

3,kosmasp,The Robbing Game,6,23 June 2015,"Focus is not a really good movie. It's not a really bad movie either though. If you don't have a problem with Will Smith (and his relationship in this movie), you might be able to enjoy this. There are a couple of things in here, that are nicely told and shot (like the explanation or ""how-to"" guide).We concentrate on Will Smith and the movie tries to keep things mysterious which works at times, though the resolution of most of those mysteries are mostly disappointing. If you don't care for that, there is light fun to be had here. The chemistry sometimes is not what the movie will or would want you it to be, but overall it's a decent con movie",Focus
4,JohnHowardReid,"Has its moments, but...",6,24 April 2018,"Starts well, but the movie, as previous reviewers have commented, is both too long and its plot seemingly too convoluted to maintain audience interest. An expert job of scissoring would have saved the day, but this does not occur. The movie goes on and on and on along a familiar track that yields only one or two mild surprises. Fortunately, Margot Robbie is not only super-beautiful but turns in an excellent performance. Unfortunately, the same could not be said of Will Smith who way out-stays his welcome.",Focus
5,sunwarrior13,Charming Con Artists,8,21 February 2016,"If there is one thing that this dark comedy thriller Focus delivered to its viewers,it is the presence of its charming lead stars in Will Smith and Margot Robbie.Without these stars,the film would have fallen flat especially on the latter part wherein the story was unbearable especially when the Will Smith character Nicky ""Mellow"" Spurgeon simply into a bad guy who use anyone for his con acts.The film starts when Jess Barrett decides to go under internship and eventually the wing of Nicky to learn more about the tricks of the trade in con acts and many other criminal activities.They go together at first in New Orleans wherein they start to con many people during the Superbowl. As Jess becomes great as a con artist,she and Nicky develop a romantic relationship.But after the Superbowl,Nicky decides to leave Jess as romance cannot be a part of being a con man.After three years,they meet again at Buenos Aires. They renew their relationship and later found themselves involved in a con that includes billionaire motor sport team owner which could eventually endanger their lives.The first act at New Orleans was good enough.But the it fall somewhat flat in the second act in Buenos Aires.Too bad that the film basically had to mainly rely on the charms of Smith and Robbie to become bearable. Sad but true.Also,it had the twists and turns of the story especially when both Nicky and Jess were captured was far from intriguing as it basically consisted of clichés seen in many movies before.",Focus

7,oscaralbert,FOCUS explores what drives people to crime . . .,8,8 March 2015,". . . specifically, low self-esteem, brought on by impotence for one of its leads and latent lesbianism (NOT the politically correct Loud & Proud Married-with-Children Ellen-type) for the other. To survive in a world filled with phallic symbols such as the cigars his potent, rich, happy marks are constantly shown waving in his face, con artist ""Marshmallow"" (Will Smith) first fixes Super Bowl XVII in 1983, then later an Indy Car race in 1986. Even with all his success at altering the outcomes of major sporting events, Marshmallow cannot get to second base with his dream girl (that is, he's able to undress her down to her brassiere before his thing apparently goes Fwip). ""Jess"" (played by Margot Robbie) may be partly to blame here, for not telling 'Mallow when they first meet that she's basically asexual, except for the unconsummated attraction to her own sex. FOCUS should be given points for its frank depiction of issues often relegated to the back shelves of the closet. Kudos also are due to Mr. Smith and Ms. Robbie for turning in such convincing portrayals of ostracized members of American Society many of their Hollywood peers wouldn't touch with ten-foot poles.",Focus
8,neil-476,Highly enjoyable,8,5 March 2015,"After carrying off a number of successful scams (during which period they also enjoyed a fling), scam empire boss Nicky abandons pickpocket hottie Jess. Three years later, their paths cross again. But who is scamming who this time? I'm sure that if I think too hard about this glossy offering, which has strong elements of both caper movie and romantic comedy in it, it may well crumble to dust. So I'm not going to, because I greatly enjoyed it. All the scamming is nicely done, and highly entertaining (albeit morally questionable), and the plotting and romance keeps you guessing all the way through. Will Smith, as Nicky, is reliable, and Margot Robbie, as Jess, is funny, sexy, and believable. I thought she was good in Wolf Of Wall Street: she is better here. She is already the go-to girl for high profile glamour leading lady work, and I suspect that she will show greater versatility as time goes on.Recommended.",Focus
9,ferguson-6,Nice Jacket,5,7 March 2015,"Greetings again from the darkness. Movies about ""the con"" have had many different looks over the years: the suave coolness of Oceans 11, David Mamet's twisted perspective in House of Games, the tongue-in-cheek teamwork of Redford and Newman in The Sting, the demented mother-son approach in The Grifters, and of course, the slapstick style of Steve Martin in Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. All of these committed to one style and made it work. The latest from the writing/directing team of Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (I Love You Phillip Morris, Crazy Stupid Love) can't seem to decide if they want the audience in on the joke, or if they rather the audience be the butt of the joke.Will Smith plays Nicky, a third generation con man who is also a very conservative entrepreneur. He runs his cons as a business and prides himself on never taking unnecessary risks, ensuring the odds are in his favor. His professional curiosity lands him in an awkward situation with Jess, played by Margot Robbie (The Wolf of Wall Street), who clumsily mistakes Nicky for an easy mark. Instead, he agrees to mentor her during Super Bowl week in New Orleans. This sequence is the best and most entertaining part of the film.The second half of the film complicates things with the do they or don't they love story between Nicky and Jess, as well as a few other messy personal relationships. The fun here lies with the con, not the love story, and that's where the focus should stay. In fact, the most interesting characters aren't Nicky and Jess, but rather a riotous Adrian Martinez (as Nicky's computer whiz assistant), Rodrigo Santoro (as a racing team owner trying to cheat the competition), Gerald McRaney (a hoot as Santoro's crusty old henchman), Robert Taylor (TV's ""Longmire"") as one of Santoro's competitors, and BD Wong as Nicky's betting adversary in the film's most ludicrous sequence (and that's saying a lot). Ms. Robbie has true star potential, but the script hangs her out a few times. She will be seen as Jane in next year's Tarzan movie, so add that to your must-see list.A very smart person I know observed that Will Smith has been conning us for years, and at least he is finally admitting it by taking on this role. It is a bit tiresome to see Mr. Smith consistently play the smartest guy in the room, the most charming guy in the room, and the sneakiest guy in the room. It seems maybe he is one of the few that still buys into that. The best actors elevate their co-stars and the script, while it seems he believes his star power is all that's required.",Focus
10,morrison-dylan-fan,Focus-Puller.,6,20 June 2015,"With a friend coming round to help out with some DIY,I started looking round for a movie we could view after sorting everything out.Talking to a family friend,I was pleased to discover that he had recently picked up Will Smith's latest movie,which led to me getting ready to focus.The plot:After meeting Jess Barrett in a night club,con man Nicky Spurgeon goes with Barrett back to her flat.As they start to undress,a man claiming to be Barrett's husband rushes in and says that he will shoot Spurgeon unless he gives him all of his money.Quickly turning the tables on them,Spurgeon discovers that the man & Barrett are fellow (amateur) con artists.Taken by Barrett's enthusiasm to the game,Spurgeon offers Barrett the chance to join his team,who will train Barrett into being a professional con artist.View on the film:For his first appearance this decade in a non-Sci-Fi/Fantasy movie,Will Smith gives a shining performance as Nicky Spurgeon,with Smith giving Spurgeon a charismatic swagger which allows for Spurgeon to play the long-con with the viewer.Along with his charming swagger,Smith also displays a keen grasp on knowing when to inject tension into Spurgeon,which helps to give the film a delightfully playful edge.Joining Smith,the very pretty Margot Robbie gives a very good performance as Barrett,as Robbie shows Barrett's nervous excitement to the art of conning,whilst a fantastic B.D. Wong steals the movie from Smith & Robbie with his zany energy as the to-be-conned Liyuan.Backed by a rolling Rock soundtrack, (which at one point,cleverly fits into a superb twist)writers/directors Glenn Ficarra & John Requa bask the title in an stylish,elegant sheen,thanks to the directors covering the movie in glass,which brilliantly shows the characters being unable to see the ""reflection"" of the con taking place.Perfectly matching the eye-catching mirrors,the directors reveal each stage of the cons with excellent,long tracking shots,which allow the audience to see every underhanded tactic used in the cons.Whilst the film has a well- designed appearance,the screenplay by Ficarra & Requa is never able to keep up with the visual charms of the title.Running for just under 2 hours,the writers leave the characters feeling rather hollow,with their attempts to go into Spurgeon background lacking clarity,and Barrett being left completely bare.During the setting up of each job,the writers appear uncertain over how to make each of Spurgeon/Barrett's cons feel like a coherent build up to the finally big game.Which leads to this being a fun film,that sadly lacks focus.",Focus
11,anaconda-40658,Focus on Robbie.,6,13 May 2015,"Focus (2015): Dir: Glenn Ficarra, John Fequa / Cast: Will Smith, Margot Robbie, B.D. Wong, Rodrigo Santoro, Gerald McRaney: Intriguing yet misguided caper film about distractions. Will Smith plays a professional con man who takes a beautiful newcomer under for mentoring. She is played by Margot Robbie who desires to excel as a con artist and she becomes a suitable student until they become romantically involved. This is where the film derails. Viewers expect a clever caper action film but are met with several pathetic sex scenes that do nothing more than manipulate viewers into thinking this relationship has merit. While the setup has promise and the ending is clever, what is structured in between is out of a really bad sexual fantasy. Smith and Robbie rise above the material especially during a great interrogation sequence where his loyalty to her is under test. Another great moment involves the one great supporting role, which belongs to B.D. Wong as a wealthy and successful gambler who really takes Smith to the test. Other roles are never fleshed out the way they should be although some identities are revealed in the end. Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Fequa are aided by festive location work where bright lights and flashy hotel rooms add some appeal when the screenplay drags. While some may dig the con profession theme, the screenplay denies this theme in favour of a relationship that nearly sabotages the film with its steamy sex. It is scenes such as this that revert the film from what it could have been thus causing it to lose focus as oppose to deliver insight. Score: 6 ½ / 10",Focus
12,phd_travel,Stylish but the ending is weak,5,1 September 2015,"Will Smith as a master con man and the alluring Margot Robbie as his protégée have chemistry and it's quite fun to watch them. It's initially fun to see them pull of their scams and petty thefts. There are cute little surprises along the way. The filming is stylish and the locations are nicely used from NYC to New Orleans to Buenos Aires. The leads have chemistry together, but who wouldn't have chemistry with Margot Robbie? The supporting cast is good too with Gerald McRaney and Rodrigo Santoro.

Didn't laugh once and I am sure you won't either. Crime, yeah okay, if you can see it like that, because honestly the way they con people is absolutely not doable. Or you must be a complete idiot, but then again how did you gather that much money if you were an idiot? Drama, yes that for sure, a lot of drama about nothing. In other words I was expecting a lot more of this movie. It's all much too cliché, the plot is not good enough compared to similar movies.

If you like a film with a big con plot, sorry it does not come off that well. If you like reality, nope. If you like action, nope.Still the film has some good points. There is a solid music sound track with a lot of good music. There are flavors of New Orleans. The cast around Smith does a very good job with their script. The acting tries to bring this movie into a top shelf effort. The script lets them down.The script tries to glorify con men by making them into a elite class. Trouble is it moves beyond reality and into the Twilight Zone some place or other. The focus is on Con but people carrying around millions of dollars in cash is just not realistic unless they are in the drug trade.There are several chances to complicate the plot over looked because Smith is hampered by being smitten. There are more than 1 con, and some of the cons are pretty complex, but when you sum it all out the ending with Gerald McRaney is a bit of a disappointment and the reality involving Smith being shot is just not practical.If you like seeing big bags of cash, and good acting it is a great film.

Nicky Spurgeon (Will Smith) is this alpha guy, but without much conscience. But I guess it's to show he still has a romantic side and also has a heart despite him scamming people out of their money. So yeah, the primary focus in on a conman, his assistant and the cons they do together. And the chemistry between the two characters is well acted and written. I couldn't help but be reminded of the ""Matchstick Men"". Except ""Matchstick Men"" was a better movie than this. However this film didn't really seem to slow down and held my interest until the end. It's a clever film, but not that great of a movie either. Watching this movie was like watching Sherlock Holmes vs. Moriarty where each person is trying to one up someone. And you don't know who has the last laugh at the end. So the focus is on ""who is conning who""? Like when you think one person is winning the other guy gets the upperhand and stuff. So during most of the most my focus was on who has the upperhand right off the bat. Without falling for the situation a character is in. Who is using who.

20,Hellmant,"Clever, witty and sexy!",7,19 March 2015,"'FOCUS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Will Smith and Margot Robbie star in this caper comedy flick, written and directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (the team responsible for directing hit comedies like 'CRAZY, STUPID, LOVE.' and writing ones like 'BAD SANTA'). It tells the story of an experienced and highly skilled con man, who takes on a beginner con artist; as his apprentice. The movie also costars Adrian Martinez, Rodrigo Santoro and Gerald McRaney and it's also Smith's first starring role in almost two years. It's a flawed film but a mostly enjoyable one.Smith plays Nicky Spurgeon and Robbie plays Jess Barrett. Spurgeon is a veteran con man who Jess mistakenly makes her mark, at a nightclub one night. She attempts to seduce him and have her partner pretend to be her jealous husband, who pulls a gun on Nicky. Nicky sees through the con and blows them off. He is fascinated by Jess though and he later makes her his new apprentice. When things become too personal, Nicky distances himself from her though; breaking her heart. Things become more complicated when she shows up at his next big con.The movie is clever, witty and sexy. Smith and Robbie have great chemistry together and although Robbie isn't a great actress (in this film at least) she's still looks great in it. Smith is very convincing in the lead though, and it's nice to see him stepping out of his usual blockbuster territory; and trying something different. The movie is full of smart dialogue and it's also pretty suspenseful, and fun, at moments. It's also kind of a mess though; in terms of story and complete character development. The way the movie transitions from the first act to the second, is very sloppy.

21,Buddy-51,Above average caper movie,7,4 April 2015,"""Focus"" is like a modern-day version of ""The Sting,"" with bits of ""Pygmalion"" and ""Pretty Woman"" thrown in for good measure.Will Smith plays Nicky Spurgeon, a seasoned thief who leads an elaborate, well-oiled cadre of fellow criminals whose activities range from simple pick pocketing to high-tech identify theft. Spurgeon plays the Professor Henry Higgins to Jess Barrett's Eliza Dolittle, as he trains this promising, attractive crook-in-the- making in the fine art of stealing. Audiences love a good con game, and ""Focus"" provides one, as Nicky and Jess hustle carefully chosen targets as well as each other. And therein lies the rub for the two characters, for when one makes one's living by being dishonest, is it really possible to establish that basis of trust upon which any romantic relationship must inevitably be built if it is to survive and flourish? Filled with the twists and turns of plot and personality that are essential to the genre, the screenplay by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (who co-directed the film) is sufficiently clever without ever being overly original, while Smith and Margot Robbie make a very appealing couple as Nicky and Jess. Moreover, there are fine performances by Rodrigo Santoro, Robert Taylor and Gerald McRaney in supporting roles. The locales range from New York City to New Orleans to Buenos Aires, which means we always have at least something to look at when the action gets a little slow - which isn't often.""Focus"" is not likely to make it into anyone's pantheon of great caper movies, but it provides enough entertainment to make it fun and enjoyable for the duration.",Focus
22,thesar-2,Auto-Focus Off,8,8 July 2015,"I love going into movies blind, or in this case, out of focus. I knew virtually nothing of this movie other than it came out this year, starred Will Smith and MERCIFULLY not his son and that he was a robber. As a matter of fact, that's all I'm giving away in my review of the synopsis. Why ruin any of the fun for you, either?Seriously, I've written this second paragraph a multiple of times and deleted it to avoid spoilers. Suffice to say and what I wanted to say was: I kept figuring out the movie and was proved wrong. BUT, before I was incorrect at any one of the many twists, I actually was betting against myself. I kept saying to myself: If I'm right, it's still good, but if I'm wrongTHIS IS AWESOME. I was wrong every step of the way, fortunately. Now, you might have gotten it, maybe quicker than most and more power to you. I'm relishing in the fact I was off the mark. To me, that made this (surprisingly quick) ride all the more enjoyable for me. After losing faith in Will Smith many years ago, namely when he became a pimp for his no-talent son, I was hesitant to return to one of his movies, even when Jaden finally stayed away. Maybe his boy was tweeting some more idiotic statements. Who knows? But, I'm glad he was absent and he allowed his father do what he does best. And Will did shine here. It was so nice to see him back to the Will I grew up with and really enjoyed.Fine. I will say this is a ""bad-guy-is-the-hero"" caper. Though I loved the Ocean's trilogy way more, this should be watched for any fan of those. Or, hell, even if you haven't seen those and want to see Will Smith return to a fun film like his 90s heyday and not so damned serious, this is for you. Funny, smart, tight and adventurous, I loved this movie. Highly recommended. * * *Final thoughts: One of the funniest revolutions I had in this movie, and, of course, I had to post this online: ""Watching a movie with about a minute or less of Super Bowl coverage and realized: that's the most I've seen of any Super Bowl in probably 10 years, fake or not."" This is true. I am not a football fan, and the Super Bowl is one of the most boring events that I've avoided for so many years. Usually, I watch some good old-fashioned movies during ""the big event,"" such as Cabaret, To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar, The Sound of Music or Burlesque.

23,FeastMode,my notes,5,25 June 2019,"I liked this movie the first time i watched it. i was debating between 3.0 and 3.5 and reluctantly gave it a 3.5. i was then very hesitant to watch it a second time, which i realize was for good reason. this movie isn't good. i was debating between 2.0 and 2.5 but decided to go higher since i enjoyed if the first time. it has some decent visual style. a lot of ppl probably like the tone of the musical score but i wasn't a fan. and that kind of set the tone for the whole movie. i remember the first time watching some of the stuff that happens and questioning whether it's believable. i gave it the benefit of the doubt and was ok with it. on second viewing, i am not. i just don't buy it, multiple parts where i have to suspend disbelief, i cannot. and i am the kind of person who tries his best to go with the flow and give the movie the benefit of the reasonable doubt. but so much didn't make sense. so many things had to happen perfectly for some of this stuff to work. so many times it could have failed if one, or eight, little things happened. i dunno if i was blinded by her beauty, but there were multiple cringe-inducing acting scenes by Margot Robbie. it's possible she was directed this way, but so many of her reactions were so cheesy and not believable. her omg moments were so lame. and the first half of the movie was so much better than the second half. which felt like a completely different movie drenched in lame relationship drama in a relationship you don't even buy. like when did that happen?

the football game betting: some of the ""priming"" was really dumb. the light fixtures in the hotel had 55 on it. did they design a new light fixture? lol. even with all that. what if he didn't look around the stadium and picked one of the first players he saw? what if Margot did that when guessing? why did he have to offer to have Margot guess? it theoretically should be just as hard for him to do it. i guess they had to have some reason to have the fat dude on the field, because there really isn't any other reason for that part of the plan. i know they ""primed"" him with a pic of the guy, but that really wasn't necessary. and she asks him what if he picked someone else, which is exactly what i was thinking, and the explanation was that he would keep going double or nothing until he picked him. but what the guy stopped after the first or second time because it would be getting out of hand and hard to trust that he would get paid. it's really dumb. also, what if will smith didn't lose all of those other early bets to get the double or nothing so high. it's madness the final scene: what if the bad guy didn't leave right away?????????? also, i dunno if i'm missing something, but wouldn't a better plan have been to run, rather than the whole confrontation and getting shot? i think there is a lot move that i am missing, this movie just hopes you won't think about it",Focus
24,bowmanblue,For a film called 'Focus' it's a little blurred,7,25 May 2017,"Okay, I'll admit one of my main reasons for watching 'Focus' is because I saw Will Smith and Margot Robbie in 'Suicide Squad' and thought they were the best part about it. It was only then that I found out they'd already starred together in a crime-caper and, based on their super-villain chemistry, thought it would probably be worth a watch. And I was pleasantly surprised to begin with.Smith plays a suave conman who stumbles on a not-so-suave conwoman, played by Robbie. However, she is endearing to him enough for him to feel like he needs to take her under his wing and teach her to refine her scamming ways in order to keep her out from the law's reach just that little bit longer. Luckily for him (and the speed of the narrative!) she takes to it pretty quickly and in a matter of seconds (well, 'screen-time' seconds anyway!) she's as much of a pro as he is. And so, he inducts her into his gang and off they go scamming people during a big festival-type event.And I was quite enjoying this. Yes, you do kind of have to leave the fact that, despite their charming exteriors and witty quips, these are criminals and although it's quite fun and cool to watch them 'work' we'd most likely be a little less tolerant if one of them lifted our camera while they pretended to ask for directions in a crowded public place. Anyway, it was fun seeing them scam – even if it does serve as a warning to watch out for these types of people and the tricks of their trade which allow them to operate.However, about a third of the way through the film everything changes. The group goes their separate ways after their major scam is complete. After this, everything sort of slows down. There's only really one storyline going on which – obviously – centres on our two attractive leads and the single scam that's now taking place. It was about this time that I stopped watching intently and enjoying the light-hearted caper and had that burning desire to check my emails on my phone. That's what happens to the plot – it sort of drifts away from you and you stop really paying attention. I think I may have checked Instagram once or twice during the second act and I'm pretty certain that I didn't miss much. It becomes the sort of film where you can quite easily nip out for a cup of tea and you won't really have missed anything vital.Overall, 'Focus' isn't a bad film. I really enjoyed the first half and the chemistry and coolness-factor of the two leads just about took me through the rest of it. I'm not sure how often I'd bother watching it again. I could probably go many years before really bothering to invest another couple of hours on this one. Definitely one of those films where you're better off watching it for free on one of the internet's 'streaming' services rather than buying the Blu-ray at full price.The first half I'd rate 7/10 and the second half just 6/10, but overall I'm feeling generous!",Focus
25,ThomasDrufke,Without Focus,6,5 March 2015,"Focus is an average film. It's not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination. It's just that it gets a little obsessed with itself at times. It has a great concept and we have seen it work in the past with Ocean's Eleven. But Focus tries to be the ultimate twisty-turny crime drama, rather than being a humble solid February release. It succeeds in areas but more often than not, you will be underwhelmed.Margot Robbie, one of the most gorgeous woman on the planet. But she is more than just looks, as we have seen in Wolf of Wall Street and About Time, she has serious acting chops. Her chemistry with Will Smith is also really good. They both are likable actresses, which is why it becomes difficult to believe all of the craziness that ensues in this films second half. The first 35-40 minutes of the film are pretty cool. We get to see this empire of sorts that Smith has built as the ultimate con-man. It's always funny, although sometimes it seems a bit far-fetched, to see people get completely deked in public. I don't really think anything this extreme happens, but it was still entertaining to watch. I actually found this film to be very similar to Hitch, especially with the character arc Will Smith's character has. But after he recruits Robbie to be a part of his team, the film takes a different turn.I wish I could say that the ending paid off all of the problems that the first half and middle section of the film raised, but it just makes everything too convoluted. But it also distracts us from what I wish the film focused (see what I did there) more on, which is the romantic relationship that builds between our leads. Robbie's character ends up contradicting itself more often than not and it just creates more confusion. I think if we became more invested in these two characters together, the ending would have been more emotionally impactful. But we end up just getting a middle of the line crime film.+Robbie & Smith are so dang likable +Cool concepts +First act is enjoyable -Inconsistent characters -Ending a bit too obsessed with itself 6.4/10",Focus
26,lesleyharris30,"Will Smith is back and in Great Form,",8,21 August 2015,"Focus is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic cast. It's a very enjoyable movie that takes you in straight away, it dosen't waste any time, and I liked that it took this approach, it brought the characters on their journey immediately and developed them throughout instead of providing most of the character development before they head off, it's quite unusual for a movie but I thought they succeeded with it and didn't leave me feeling like either of the two lead characters are underdeveloped, I also thought the ending was a very well written final act, and the twists just kept on coming. The film seemed to have a hard time balancing out between being a crime caper and a romance, I felt like it should have focused on crime much more, it was an interesting story that kept me intrigued, and though I did like the love story, I felt lit didn't necessarily have to be as vital as it was and stall the story as much as it did. Will Smith is back in action here in his first lead role since Men in Black 3 way back in 2012, he is still the charismatic and likable actor that everyone knows and loves him for, and this also goes for Margot Robbie, who stole several scenes and gets to shine as an actress here even more than she did in Wolf of Wall Street, the two made a great pair and were able to make these characters likable, which didn't seem easy as they were very flawed. A slick and well acted crime film, Focus may be forgetful, but it's while it lasts, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama or romance. A professional con man takes an amateur under his wing, but a complicated relationship soon blossoms between them. Best Performance: Will Smith Worst Performance: Adrian Martinez",Focus

I thought the storyline with this was too fast and really not getting to the point of being a conman. Its like we see stealing first, then lying and then stealing again. What job were they actually doing?I found the characters really, I liked how they were sneaky and smart in stealing peoples stuff while talking to them. It was funny when the two characters kept betting on BD Wong's character with lots of money. I would be wondering if that really is real money? I say, the cast will be paid that much for taking part in the movie anyway so they can't complain! Its an alright film, I would not consider this to be the best of their work.",Focus

Actually, I enjoyed the film, but did not like it because of the bad ending. It was a good twist, except the shooting thing. An example how a tiny part can decide the entire movie's fate.Well written crime-drama, with a touch of romance. After all the obstacles, the final cast were at their best. Heist movies always excite me because of the involvement of the tricks and thrills. Nicky, a con artist who recruits a small time thief, Jess to work with his gang. When the job and the romance advancing smoothly, an unexpected split happens. So the years passed, when they meet again, what comes is the crux of the remaining story.The first half let us know what kind of character the Nicky is. His overwhelmed dedication for his undertaking and his reliable team's the focus. Overall, it was the best portion of the movie, and the next half goes for the giant kill, but lacks enthusiasm. More like a revenge or jealousy type narration, but only until reaching the climax where it tries being a very clever and happen all the things at a brisk pace.The film was better than I thought, after learning it was criticised, mostly very badly.

35,eddie_baggins,A forgettable modern con/romance jaunt,4,19 July 2015,"While there's certainly some great on screen (and more than likely off-screen) chemistry between the slowly losing his charms Will Smith and the ever impressive Aussie starlet Margot Robbie, no amount of sizzle or pizazz can save Focus from its own lacklustre core and for a movie that was supposed to be exciting and energetic, Focus meagrely meets its mark as a Friday night time filler.Co-directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa have found success before with their impressive rom-com Crazy, Stupid, Love and while the two possess a neat visual flair, whether it be in the colourful streets or New Orleans or in the capturing of the natural beauty of Robbie, there's a sense that the core material at the heart of this con-artist tale lacks the ingredients that was going to allow it to compare to an Oceans 11 or such similar themed film and while Focus may start out in an intriguing fashion, alarmingly it drops off at such a rapid pace that by the film's final reel it's quite possible that you'll find yourself barely awake.Focus's largest hurdle in keeping the audience engaged lies within its inability to be in any way shape or form realistic and while with these caper like movies audience suspension of belief is to be expected Focus just goes too far out of its way to be spectacular when a smaller more believable scenario was often called for. Smith's well renowned con man Nicky is also a figure we don't ever get to care for and whenever his away from on screen partner Robbie it's all to evident that Smith is continuing on with the form he showed in his recent string of stinkers like After Earth and Winter's Tale with a raft of below average material and elements it's safe to say Robbie is the star attraction here and we can now hope that her upcoming turns in the intriguing looking Z for Zachariah and Suicide Squad showcase further development of her exciting career.It's meant to be exciting, it's meant to be thrilling and it's meant to be the smartest kid in its class but Focus barely scraps by with it's over the top situations, set ups and twists and unlike most films of this ilk slowly dies a death as time goes on when it should've been ramping up the fun at every turn.

37,leonblackwood,Poor storyline! 3/10,3,12 July 2015,"Review: This movie starts off well but it goes down hill once the love story kicks in. I honestly don't think that Will Smith was the perfect choice for this film because he is so much better in action and comedic roles. Anyway, the film is about a con man who shows his new recruit the tricks of the trade but he ends up falling in love with her and he loses his appetite to trick people. He then separates from the lady to gain his Focus but when he goes for the big con, she turns up and he loses his Focus again. The storyline wasn't too bad and some of the cons were quite amazing. I found the pick pocketing and purse snatching quite intriguing but the actors weren't that great. We all know that Will Smith is great when it comes to action/comedic roles but he's not suited to serious, romantic drama. Anyway, when his final con goes completely wrong and his life is in danger, the movie becomes quite boring and uninteresting. You really don't know who to trust throughout the film, which made it watchable in some parts but the ending was awful and it lacked intensity. Personally, I think that the love element spoilt the movie and the director should have stuck with the con concept which was quite clever. Disappointing!Round-Up: As soon as Will Smiths name is tied to a movie, it's bound to bring in loads of money. It doesn't actually mean that he movie is good though! In this case, I heard a lot of negative reviews and after watching it, I can understand why. Smith should definitely stay away from the romantic roles and stick to the big budget action movies because that's were he really puts in great performances. Anyway, he has quite a view movies in the pipeline, like Bad Boys 3, the Redemption of Cain and Bounty so I'm sure this film will go down as a bad day at the office. The film was directed and written by Glenn Ficarra & John Requa, who brought you Crazy, Stupid Love, Bad Santa, Bad News Bears and Cats and Dogs so there not really known for romantic dramas. I was quite surprised that Will Smith took on this project because of his strict family values and his complete devotion to his wife, which was why he didn't do love scenes. With that aside, the whole project wasn't put together that well and it glorified criminals without any feelings to real people who have suffered from being conned. Budget: $50.1million Worldwide Gross: $154millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their romantic/dramas about a con man who falls in love with his new recruit, which affects his work. 3/10",Focus
38,matthewssilverhammer,Unspectacular and Kinda Boring,4,7 March 2015,"Focus isn't nearly as cool as it thinks. Outside moments of decent humor-based dialogue and Soderbergh-light flourishes of style, it's basically one long plot exposition...and with so much over-talking, the story shouldn't be so blurry. At least give us some intriguing characters to pull us through, but even they are hard to grasp onto here. So although it has lulling entertainment value at points, mostly Focus is unspectacular and just kinda boring. Smith plays a successful conman who runs into trouble as he breaks his own code of never losing focus on the job at hand, falling for his new femme-fatale apprentice. This could've been an Ocean's Eleven-style caper flick, if only the sense of team and mission drove the film. Instead, it seems much more interested in the corny, boring, and completely unconvincing romance between a desperate Smith and an annoying Robbie. We're asked to be invested in this cloying courtship when we are never convinced there is anything to really get behind. It should've just stayed in the caper-con- thriller lane. Unfortunately, just like Smith's character suffers as his focus shifts from crime to romance, so does the movie's quality. I'm someone who's rooting for Smith to return to his glory days of box-office domination. I even think he's the right guy to play a conman: easy to root for even when being bad. His charm almost makes this a passable Saturday morning channel-surfing session choice. But despite the smart casting, great soundtrack, and sporadic moments of fun, Focus too often loses that focus in over-seriousness and bad romance.",Focus

It is well-made, has some good twists like a con film should, has excellent lead actors and is all-around enjoyable to watch.

The final twist, while certainly surprising yet hinted at well enough, is standard.But then, that's movie business for you. It's not like I cannot enjoy generic action films. Do I wish they were more original? Of course, but they still give me the explosions, shoot-outs and guns galore I want. And this film gives me slick locations, charming rogues and good twists.

41,jtindahouse,Like Ocean's Eleven without as much fun,6,21 June 2015,"Con man movies are a lot of fun. Or at least they should be. Nothing is ever as it seems and there's always a twist around every corner. What more could you want from a film? And yet 'Focus' somehow manages to extract the fun from the fun - if that makes sense. All the usual elements of this type of movie are there but it just feels flat. Is it Will Smith's performance? Is it that the jokes just aren't funny? Or is it that we are getting used to this type of film and are able to see the twists coming from a mile away? I'd say all of the above.Smith and Margot Robbie play the leads. Robbie was fine playing a character that really offered her little room to shine, as unfortunately so few female roles in Hollywood do these days. Smith though just came across as bored. He actually looked psychically tired in a number of scenes. Is he just sick of the acting game or did he not buy into this project? Ten years ago he was in a mildly similar film 'Hitch' and any flaws the script may have had were more than made up for by his charisma. Fast forward to this performance and it's very disappointing.Heist movies became all the rage after 'Ocean's Eleven' did it so successfully. There have been plenty since then and they're never dull. But 'Ocean's' had the element of surprise going for it. We had no clue just exactly how intricate and convoluted their plan was and it was a pleasant and brilliant surprise when we were given the reveal. Since then though (as both the sequels found out) we expect the world from the twist reveal and almost judge the entire movie based purely on that - so it had better be damn strong. Was it strong enough on this occasion? I'd have to say no. It's still better than most films but doesn't live up to what it could have been.",Focus

The premise of the film sees an experienced con man performing cons until an old romance turns up and he is thrown into a situation where everyone is looking to con each other. Now will Smith got a lot of criticism for his last film after earth but this is Smith back at his finest. He is such a charismatic actor and in this film the role completely suits him and his interesting character has the best lines in the film. Margot Robbie is clearly a great actress and she was great in this film, her role was interesting and her character was more interesting then a simple love interest. Also her chemistry with Smith was great and was one of the best things in the film. I do wish however, that there was a big villain in the film that they could con with and I think that could have added to the film. The first half of the story was Gregreat and seeing Smith and Robbie con people is great and their interesting characters drive the film. But about half way through the film the story takes a direction that I was not a big fan of and I think it took the story down and didn't focus on the right things. The script was fantastic and a real surprise with all the dialogue really working and making the characters feel unique and alive. The style of the cons were good and it allowed for allot of different unique locations. But the problem was that there was allot of soundtracks over the dialogue which took away from the film.

The brain is slow and it can't multitask. Tap him here, take from there.""When Will Smith is on his game it's hard to resist his films and Focus is one of those movies that benefits from his charismatic performance. The main problem with After Earth was that he was stripped away from all his charm, but in Focus Smith is back in full force doing what he does best. He plays Nicky, a con artist who is very good at what he does. When a young woman tries to con him, he picks up on it right away and decides to teach her a few things about being a successful con artist. Her name is Jess (Margot Robbie) and with her distracting good looks she seems to be a perfect fit for the job so he hires her as a sort of intern for an upcoming job he is performing along with his personnel in New Orleans during a major football sporting event. Romance blossoms but there are several unexpected twists that take the audience for a ride. Focus benefits from the strong lead roles and the fantastic chemistry between Smith and Robbie. Other than that there is really not much more worth recommending considering the film suffers from one too many plot twists. I do have to admit that I had fun during most of its running time and it's light entertainment, but the movie does lose a bit of its appeal towards the end. It's one of those films that are easy to the eyes, but forgettable in the long run.Focus was written and directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa who had already worked together in other solid films such as I Love You Phillip Morris and Crazy Stupid Love. I would rank Focus below those movies but I still had a good time thanks mostly to the charismatic lead performances. Crazy Stupid Love is one of my favorite romantic comedies of the past five years so I have a lot of respect for these writer/directors. They have a strong sense of comedy and like to play with genre conventions at times. Focus feels like it is two movies in one because there is one strong segment taking place in New Orleans during the first half hour and then there is another segment taking place in Buenos Aires that despite being amusing, it keeps us guessing so much that it ultimately begins to lose its appeal. I had some issues with some of the character motivations and so on, but in a light breezy film like this it is easier to enjoy without thinking too much about it. It is similar in tone to the Ocean's Eleven franchise and it is never dull to look at thanks to the dreamy cinematography. However when it comes to the con element I didn't find it as witty or engaging as other films. Matchstick Men still remains as one of my favorite in this department and if you haven't seen it I highly recommend it. The highlights of Focus other than the strong performances from the good looking duo of Smith and Robbie are the early scenes where we are introduced to the con activities. There is a thrilling scene during a football game where Smith's character is making some crazy bets with a millionaire played by BD Wong. It's probably the highest point of the film, but I was still entertained throughout the movie. There are also some solid supporting performances from Rodrigo Santoro, Gerald McRaney, and Adrian Martinez, who has some funny scenes here. In the end it suffers a bit from being too self explanatory and taking some crazy twists and turns, but if you are bored you will be entertained for a couple of hours. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Focus
46,jimbo-53-186511,I 'Bet' You Won't Like This Very Much!!!!,3,9 February 2016,"I watched Focus this evening and whilst watching it I couldn't help but be reminded of a TV Series called The Real Hustle which aired a few years ago. In that series, the presenters would carry out con tricks on unsuspecting members of the public and would then explain how they performed each con trick and would provide some advice on how to make sure you don't become victim to any number of con tricks highlighted in any given episode. It was a TV Series that was both entertaining and educational which are sadly traits that most definitely do not apply to Focus.Maybe it's because I've seen The Real Hustle that I found a lot of what I saw on screen to be rather uninspired and boring (the first 30 minutes just basically consisted of scenes involving minor pickpocketing) with very little in the way of plot development. The film maintains this monotonous tone pretty much from start to finish and there were only two occasions when I found that the picture held a modicum of interest (the con at the football game and the con in Buenos Aires) were the high points in this dreary and rather forgettable affair. Although this film clearly has an overly-familiar plot line this might not have been as bad if the film had any sense of fun about it, but sadly it doesn't. This is perhaps down to a combination of uninspired writing and rather lacklustre performances (both Smith and Robbie share rather weak chemistry which is something that has to be present in order to make any sort of caper film work).The only real positive that I can say about this film is that it does have a 'surprise' twist (although I do believe it's one that cheats the audience slightly). There are also one or two moments in the middle third of the film that I can also pass off as mildly entertaining.When all is said and done, Focus is a glossily wrapped up package which offers very little in the way of entertainment or audience involvement.",Focus
47,juneebuggy,Decent but forgettable con movie,7,4 May 2018,"This was pretty good but not great, honestly pretty forgettable. A few funny bits mostly thanks to Adrian Martinez but I wouldn't call this a comedy as its labelled. Will Smith plays a con artist who takes on Margot Robbie as an inexperienced apprentice and then struggles to keep his eye on the prize after he develops romantic feelings for her. I liked Will Smith in this, he down plays his over the top Will Smithyness taking a more serious approach to his charcter. His chemistry with Margot Robbie is mediocre even though I felt like they were trying to set up a George Clooney/J-Lo sort of thing like in Out Of Sight but missing the fireworks. The locations added significantly to this and you're never really sure who is playing who. The scams are big and over complicated though -honestly that one at the football game with BD Wong had way too many variables to work. Decent back up cast especially with Martinez and Wong and a surprise appearance from Robert Taylor of Longmire who keeps his Aussie accent. Nice.",Focus
48,lukem-52760,I LOVE WILL SMITH BUT THIS FILM IS HIS WORST!!!,1,16 December 2019,"First off I'm a huge Will Smith fan & have been since a young teen, i grew up watching & loving ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air"" series & have followed his fantastic career from being my favourite Rapper & to big budget blockbuster movies like ""Independence Day"" & ""Men In Black"" & I've followed this great guy all the way up to now 2019, Smith is my favourite actor & my favourite Rapper as well as abit of a role model for me & he's an icon but even the best have their bad ones & his ""Focus"" is the absolute worst film Smith has ever made!!!
This crime caper is just completely Boring as hell & so uninteresting that i had to turn it off halfway through!!!
Even Will Smith's cool charm couldn't save this BORING film.Lots of people have blasted his sci-fi Adventure film ""After Earth"" as his worst but it's definitely Not!!!
I enjoyed After Earth for a what it was & that's a simple sci-fi survival adventure & although Smith is more robotic in his ways & not very emotional he gave a strong serious & intense performance, yes he played 2nd to his son Jaden Smith but i liked the troubled father son relationship, it wasn't terrible & i liked it.Now back to the boring as hell ""Focus"" here although Smith is always very Cool he's very boring & the film is slow & pointless, even Margot Robbie was boring to watch here & yet they were both Excellent in the extremely underrated Suicide Squad 2016, where Robbie played crazy villain Harley Quinn & Smith played the deadly Assassin Deadshot & both worked perfectly together!!!
The chemistry is just boring & dull in ""Focus"" & i couldn't get into it at all, so yes Smith is great & still my favourite actor ever but this is one of his extremely rare ""Bad films""",Focus
49,TdSmth5,A disaster,5,2 January 2016,"Some guy Nicky is approached by a stunning girl, Jess, in a restaurant to play her boyfriend. They end up going to her room. Before things get intimate, a guy barges through the door with a gun demanding Nicky's money. Nicky challenges the guy to kill him, which completely confuses the gunman. Nicky comes clean, he knew all along this was a setup by this couple. Jess is blown away by Nicky's skills and knowledge. Later on he follows her and she begs him to teach her something. He does a stunning demo of his pickpocketing skill. This guy is so amazing he can steal your underpants without you realizing it.Some time later she trails him and finds him in New Orleans. Of course he knew that she would show up. She demands she wants in on whatever he's up to. After a quick demo on her part he introduces her to his operation. 30 criminals pickpocketing on a large orchestrated scale and selling everything that night. She takes part and excels. Then they're off to Vegas and do really well. They steal a total of 1.2 million dollars worth of stuff. Another guy, Horst, who's also in charge hands the money to Nicky so he'll wire everyone their part. Why not just give everyone their cut in cash? Don't ask.Nicky and Jess and the money are off the Superbowl in New Orleans. She doesn't like football so she bets against Nicky on silly stuff they see. An Asian guy (BD Wong in an embarrassing role) asks, begs, ""I want to play, I want to play."" So he and Nicky start betting on some more weird stuff related to the game. Nicky loses every single time but returns for more until he bets the 1.2 mill....and loses. One more time he bets double that (without any money no less). And wins. Of course it was all planned by him. On their way back, he gives Jess 80 thou and leaves her for no good reason, for the better though because they don't make a good couple.Three years later in South America Nicky is involved with some auto racing magnate who proposes Nicky sell some fake gas-saving software to his rival team. Nicky accepts and on the day of the ruse he sees...Jess. Here we go again. Jess is the magnate's girlfriend. Nicky is ready to give up the job but is forced to continue by the magnate's right hand man. The scam works, in fact it works so well that Nicky ends up selling the same software to all the racing teams. In the process he's fallen completely in love with the unavailable Jess and tries and ultimately succeeds in seducing her. On their getaway with the money, the magnate's hit-man crashes into them and drags them to a confrontation with the boss where we again learn that we've been led around by the nose all along and there's a final twist that's just infuriating.The first act of Focus in New Orleans and Vegas works well, a bit too orchestrated and choreographed perhaps. Having a great actor like Brennan Brown take charge a bit also helps. The stunning Margot Robbie steals the show and smiles and seduces her way into our hearts. But from there the movies goes downhill fast and relentlessly digs its hole deeper and deeper with every single scene as we focus exclusively on the Will Smith character. Gerald McRaney's performance tough shines as the movie gets worse and worse.I like caper movies as much as any one else, but there's an art to those movies about balancing truth and lies to the audience which was completely lost on the writers/directors of Focus. Here the filmmakers thought themselves so bright and they thought the audience would enjoy being made fools of for 1:45 hours. The sad thing is that somewhere in this mess, if you...focus...hard enough, there was probably a good story to be told, one with lesser ambitions and that doesn't treat the audience like morons.",Focus
50,peterp-450-298716,"A rom-com mixed with crime. A pure popcorn movie with Smith, thank God, not acting as in ""After Earth""",5,3 July 2015,"""When you have their attention, you can take whatever you want. You have to be safe.""""Focus"" is a romantic crime movie in which the art of pickpocketing, manipulating and swindling is the point of focus (how appropriate). The end result isn't memorable cinema, but a typical popcorn movie with a scam duo fluttering around each other as lovestruck butterflies, playing a masterful game of seduction. Or is it also a con game? The whole film is a succession of ingenious orchestrated scams and ruses. Unfortunately, the ultimate scam is explained in detail very early in the film, so you can predict which direction its heading. Although, it's as entertaining as ""Ocean's Eleven"", filled with illusions as in ""Now You See Me"" and with a romantic storyline squirming itself through it.It all starts in a restaurant in New York where Jess (Margot Robbie) tries to get rid of an annoying date by using Nicky (Will Smith) as a way out. What she doesn't realize is that Nicky is an experienced swindler who knows all the tricks of the trade and who recognized the subsequent attempt to defraud him immediately. Jess manages to become an apprentice of Nicky. Afterwards, they end up in New Orleans, the place to be at that time to steal as much generously stuffed wallets and other trinkets. Only Jess realizes too late that the personal world of Nicky is all about telling lies and cheating. And also that there's no place for romance in this life full of trickery. And certainly not, as his father taught him, with someone from the same milieu. After the appalling movie ""After Earth"", Will Smith is back to give shape to this crook (a kind of mature version of The Fresh Prince). Luckily he hasn't invited one of his offspring to participate in this stylish film with enchanting interiors, glitzy hotels, luxury clothes and haute-cuisine scenes (before you know it Jaden could appear in it, while wearing a skirt). And he's accompanied by the breathtaking and tantalizing Margot Robbie, who previously showed her sensuality in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". And this also happens to be a brilliant film with conning people as main topic. Besides being amazingly beautiful, this Australian actress can act too. Next to these two main actors, there were some who seemed familiar to me, but I couldn't place them immediately. Except BD Wong, who recently played the chief geneticist Henry Wu in ""Jurassic World"". He's the eccentric Chinese gambler Liyuan.And Liyuan was also the key figure in the most (in my opinion) fascinating scene of this film. The Asian gambler who'll bet on anything. The crazier, the better apparently. This crucial scene shows what Nicky is capable of. How he manipulates his victims and indoctrinates them in a psychological way. As he recites somewhere in the movie : ""You have to get inside the head of your victim."". But at the same time this also shows the weaker portion of the film. At a certain moment this film becomes highly confusing and it's getting more difficult to discern the difference between truth and deception. The first part is better than expected and sometimes brilliantly portrayed. For example the part where Nicky and his gang hit the streets of New Orleans and demonstrate their palette of pickpockets techniques. The second part looks nice when it's about scenery (which is really beautiful) but lacks passion. Hopefully there aren't any individuals who are going to bring, what is shown here, into practice on a large scale ! More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",Focus
51,TheOneThatYouWanted,Second half fails,6,24 September 2017,"Focus What a shame. The first half of this flick is actually entertaining and fun. The mid-movie climax should have been the final climax. Or they should have just built the film around taking down the big mid-flick mark. Whatever, the only thing that matters is that the film is entertaining, which it is. But like I said before, the second half of the film does disappoint and fall flat, just to set up some stupid twist that nobody cares about. 6/10",Focus
52,Seraphion,A decent comeback for Smith,7,15 March 2015,"The story itself for me is nothing new since it's not as good as other con movies like the Ocean series. The second emphasis on the romance feels little bit thwarted in focus compared to the grift and con crime focus. What makes this movie interesting is instead the live action depiction of the smaller time pickpocket teamwork and the attention grabber scenes. Those really gave this movie a differentiation and set this movie apart from other con artist movies. The acting overall is just a decent job. Will Smith did quite okay here, he used his usual character as the one in Hitch. Margot Robbie did also quite nice here since her last appearance at Wolf of the Wall Street and About Time.",Focus
53,rgkarim,"Twists and Turns, will teach you more about Focus",7,1 March 2015,"The might Will Smith has been a wide variety of movies, some great, some good, some we wish to forget, (like After Earth). Regardless the legendary actor and artist has come back with a new movie entitled Focus. For those who haven't seen the surprisingly limited aired trailer, here is what you might expect in the film.Expect: A romance of some sort with sex thrown in, a tale about pulling off the big con, Margot Robbie showing off her body, and Will Smith playing a relaxed, devil may care role. What you get:1. Like any movie that has an elite team with both male and female members, you expect a relationship of some type. Focus does not disappoint you as a complex relationship forms that sets a key foundation for the film. Where good relationships take time to develop, this film's on screen love is rather hasty, and unrealistically perfect. Despite the rushed relationship, it is not the simplistic mess that we frequently see in these movies, but instead one that has a lot of charisma, fun, and edge to it. Yet even better is the obstacles the love of these two brings, and the pressure for our characters to evolve. The forbidden taboo of finding love in the world of thieves helps build suspense, and kept me more in to the movie and our characters life. You can see the obvious trouble this will cause down the line, but despite the predictability the romance is entertaining and a bit steamy at times too. For this reviewer though, the strongest factor to this romance is the chemistry between the two leading roles. Smith and Robbie nail the emotional spectrum, from simplistic sex and bliss to dependence and desperation. It all makes for a relationship that many in TV land fall for, and holds so much more than meets the eye. 2. Relationship aside though, what about the story in general? The plot of Focus is like any con adventure, that starts with a prospective member being introduced into the game and undergoing the tutelage of their mentor. Then comes the big con where so many obstacles obstruct their goal that the team begins to be pushed to the limits. Yet here are some things that helps give Focus some unique aspects. One training doesn't take long in this film as Robbie's character already has a set of skills that need quick refinement. During the few training gigs, the audience is introduced to a plethora of thievery plans, many coordinated ruses that are quite impressive despite their illegality. However, the really great aspect of this is the twists that are around every corner. I found my mind blown more than once at the big revelations, as the more complicated tricks began to unfold. Despite the cool and unexpected things you see in this movie though, the plot is overall the same and at times the movie is slow and boring. Attempts to tie the romance into the story sometimes resulted in prolonged, unnecessary scenes, that were just more fluff than pertinent to the story. 3. As I mentioned earlier, Margot Robbie is the leading lady of this film and you might wonder what she has in store. I'm pleased to report that the intense, and constant sex, as well as the drug addictions have been put aside, though that doesn't mean her looks have been downgraded. The sensational blonde is just as stunning in this picture, dazzling the audience with incredible hairstyles, cute stylish outfits, lavish jewelry, and for the gentleman an incredible portrayal of her physique. Guys will drool over the half dressed scenes as she flaunts her figure, and that gorgeous face still dazzles me. As for acting, she has improved since Wall Street, as her character actually has some respectable skills and characteristics that didn't make me cringe. At times I felt sorry for her character, especially when she found herself tormented by the darker aspects of the game. Other times she was respectable, especially the control she held in many harsh situations. While still not the best, Margot brings some dynamic qualities to a stereotypical role. 4. Will Smith on the other hand is back on the road of making respectable movies. In this film he plays his devil may care card, who has a hard edge and clever mind to get the goods. Yet this suave, egocentrically, shallow side is only one part of the equation. Smith plays the vulnerable side as well, showing that within the moot, monotone shell beats the gigantic heart of a real hero. No surprise there right? Oh well, Smith's character is entertaining on some parts, especially in the dialog, but his acting still remains impressive when given the right part. Nevertheless he will most likely hook you into the story and the adventure in hopes of uncovering the truth behind his story. Focus is not the best movie in the world, but it has some intricate mechanics that keep you on your toes. I admit it is not the most exciting adventure, but there is more than enough drama and romance to keep most engaged. The acting is good, the techniques are entertaining, and the movie is only 100 minutes long, all positives in my book. Worth a trip to the theater? Not really, but if you are looking for a movie to fill the void the last few weeks then consider this film. Smith still has got his spark though and I hope this movie is the start to some future hits. Scores:Crime/Drama: 7.5 Movie Overall: 7.0",Focus
54,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Focus,6,21 March 2015,"Margot Robbie is one of the co-stars of Focus (the film I'm about to review). I gotta admit, she's gorgeous. I mean absolute perfection. So it was difficult for me to concentrate on the gist of everything when all I could do is uh, ""focus"" on her (ha ha). Will Smith is in Focus as well. In the last three years he's appeared in the bomb After Earth and made a guest appearance in an even bigger bomb, Winter's Tale. He hasn't really been the blockbuster stud we've been used to seeing lately. Was this 2015 release the draw that gave him his mojo back? Hardly. Based on the last three weeks, its box office take has been dropping faster than the ball on New Year's Eve. Together these two good looking people make their debut as a full fledged screen pair. Their characters (Nicky and Jess Barrett) are con artists. One is the teacher and the other is the student. They steal from denizens good and bad, they fall in love, and they contend to build a small fortune until one of their fumbled cons leaves them within an inch of their lives. The result is sadly a mixed review from me. And to borrow from the definition of the word focus, I'll say this: what we have on screen is something that fails to be the center of interest or activity.Focus, in its hour and forty-five minute running time, is somehow split up into two halves. The first half involves theft of watches, pickpocketing, and an organization of pickpocketers. The second half (taking place three years later) chronicles a scam within the backdrop of motorsports (IndyCar racing). There are cons, double cons, multiple double crosses, and revisited relationships. Yet nothing seems at stake and variable tension is at times, omitted. Granted, with all of this going on, it's a Warner Bros. production that still feels unfinished. Basically, I just threw my hands up in the air and decided to call it a mundane love story between Smith and Robbie's characters. However, the fact that Focus is slick, contains a few cool whip pans, is locale based (Buenos Aires and New Orleans to name two), and has a breezy tone, sometimes negates from its shortcomings.In terms of the acting, it's substantial if not unchallenged. Smith as Nicky, reinvents the typical cool cat in sunglasses. Just think his Hitch character with the same confident strut but posing as a thief and a habitual liar. Then there's Margot Robbie. She plays it dumb as Jess Barrett, the con world's young Padawan in training. She's not necessarily miscast and as mentioned earlier, incredibly easy on the eyes. It's just that this is no where near as strong a turn as she posed in 2013's The Wolf of Wall Street. That leaves B.D. Wong giving the highest caliber performance in Focus. He does the whole scene-stealing, cameo thing. I'm a Law & Order junkie and he's been on that show for a countless number of years. Here he goes unrecognizable playing Liyuan Tse, a compulsive gambler and obvious millionaire who hinges on taking Nicky for everything he's worth (at an NFL game). I had to watch the closing credits to confirm that it was actually him.In the realm of directing, John Requa and Glenn Ficarra shoot the film at times, as a tribute to Martin Scorsese. They become cinematic masturbaters with some of their set ups (there's a drawn out sequence having to do with betting at The Super Bowl). Also at the same time, they are clearly filming a variation of Ocean's Eleven complete with a saucy 60's/70's throwback soundtrack. These guys keep Focus at a barely rated R punch. There is one violent confrontation and everything before it is suggestive innuendo/filtered-in f words.Anyway, I'm not recommending this flick but I will almost refrain: if you decide to take in a viewing, this exercise will make you think twice about standing near someone in a crowded area (who knows, you might get lifted). And as I left the theater, I stayed at least ten feet away from the nearest patron. Overall, it's a sketchy affair, a slight disappointment. Here's my sage advise to Will Smith: it's not too late to sign on to do Independence Day 2. It hasn't started filming yet and you could continue your life plan as a superior box office likeness.Of note: I love The Rolling Stones as much as anybody and I even dig the song, ""Sympathy For The Devil"". But gee whiz does it have to appear in every darn movie these days (including this one). The novelty of this 1969 ditty is getting really tired. In the case of Focus, I don't care if its lyrics have something to do with a major plot point. There are other songs out there that spout ""woo woo"" you know.",Focus
55,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,Lack of Focus,3,20 August 2021,"Movie deserves two stars for its, well, two beautiful stars.Far as I can tell, it's a movie about Will Smith and Margot Robbie rolling around in bed every 5 minutes or so, and alternately living a fraudulent life of the rich & famous. Which would be OK if, like Depression-era Hollywood movies, the scripts were super witty.Unfortunately, there is nothing witty or charming about this movie at all. It's just a tedious grind.In Act 1 we get a bunch of good-looking well-organized grifters working New Orleans tourists for nickels and dimes. At the end of the week, where a limitless number of people have been working the streets together, Smith announces they hauled in a WHOLE $1.2 million. Wow. After travel, hotels and meals for a week at the Super Bowl, that oughtta work out to, what, about $10,000 per person. I make better money in construction.Apparently, Smith took his 10-grand cut and, for Act 2, managed to get two seats in a private booth at the Super Bowl. Tickets which would easily set him back a quarter million. What follows is about 20 minutes of the most tedious gambling-addict nonsense I have even seen in a movie. Am I supposed to care about the Japanese dude?At that point I turned off the sound because I couldn't take it any longer. I kept watching the beautiful people for a while. Robbie is a great actress. Even the Fresh Prince did a fine job, which is more than I can say for his performances in most of his dreadful movies.Dropping in for the Third Act is some good looking guy with a Euro accent, some super-cool F1 cars and Gerald McRaney. Any movie with Rick Simon/Major Dad can't be all bad. So I bump my rating up to three stars.",Focus

57,quincytheodore,The best con this film pulls is making a romantic comedy appears like a crime thriller.,6,27 February 2015,"Will Smith is back in Hitch: How to Get the Girl, Also Some Cash. There's overwhelming opulence, exotic setting and beautiful ladies at display here for the grand dramatization of thievery. It showcases a glamorous lifestyle, riches and ladies, portrayed by the charismatic leads. However, the movie recycles this material too often and having too much investment in lovey-dovey banters does wear the tension thin.Story follows Nicky (Will Smith), a veteran thief who meets with Jess (Margot Robbie), an aspiring thief. Together they embark on a swindling journey, manipulating people and each other into giving what they want. Led by the charismatic Will Smith, Focus boasts an interesting anti-hero. He's very versatile, able to perform in comedic as well as more serious tone. Robbie has a wide range of acting too, she seems natural although sometimes leaning heavily on femme fatale cliché.This is at heart a romance movie, with the backdrop of felony, not the other way around. The liaison aspect is scrutinized deeper than the actual thefts. This should be fine as both Smith and Robbie are capable leads, but it tends to lose momentum after the many times it uses ""He loves me, he loves me not"" gimmick. It's more of a light relationship than an intense trickery exchange, while pretty entertaining it's barely enough to keep the suspense.The film possesses a stylish colorful cinematography. Design for costume and the vista are very suave, something out of a page of rich people magazine. It offers fantasy celebrity nuance, a brighter side of crime, so to speak. Its choice of soundtracks reflects it as well, playing classy tunes to serenade heist and courtship. While the plans might not be masterful, there are some good plot twists to unveil here.With fascinating set and actors Focus is a decent drama film, but to reach thrilling suspense it needs to focus more on plundering instead of plowing.",Focus
58,tomsview,Glamorous grifters,7,24 June 2015,"I'm a sucker for a good conman movie. The best of them get me in every time: ""The Sting"", ""House of Games"", ""The Grifters"", ""Harry in Your Pocket"" even a film like ""The Score"", which is a caper film with a con in the tail.As far as conman movies go, ""Focus"" is pretty good – not right at the pinnacle, but streets ahead of films such as ""Confidence"" (a ""Sting"" rip-off buried in bad language) or ""Deadfall"", (perversely watchable only for Nicholas Cage's breathtaking, out-of-control performance).Movies in this genre work best when there is a mentor and a student, almost as though the audience is taking a crash course in grifting as well. In this case, Nicky Spurgeon (Will Smith) takes novice Jess Barrett (Margot Robbie) under his wing and teaches her the tricks of the trade – watching Nicky and his crew operating their pick-pocketing and betting scams are the best sequences in the movie.However when Jess gets too close, Nicky backs off. This all leads to the major scam at the end of the movie, which could be just a little too clever for its own good. However, this is a movie where any relationship to real life is definitely coincidental; to enjoy it properly, the best thing is to just sit back and enjoy the ride.The two stars carry the film. Will Smith's instantly likable persona is perfect for the part – after all who ever heard of an unlikeable conman. The camera loves Margot Robbie. Move over Nicole, Naomi and Abbie, there is a new Aussie golden girl in town. She's so glamorous and assured it's hard to believe she is only 24 years old – and very funny on TV talk shows.The movie is helped by the locations; the final section of the movie is set in Buenos Aires against a backdrop of Formula One racing. This draws us into a world of big money, beautiful people and opulent lifestyles; much as Hitchcock's ""To Catch a Thief"" did decades ago set on the French Riviera.In fact, much of the appeal of ""Focus"" could be that it is a throwback to the movies Hollywood used to make with glamorous, romantic stars who in reality only played variations of themselves – despite all the modern references to downloading from hard drives etc., it's not impossible to imagine Cary Grant and Grace Kelly playing Nicky and Jess.The film has been criticised in some quarters for lack of depth, but I think it was always intended to be a lighter entry. As far as I'm concerned, it delivers pretty much what I'd hoped for.",Focus
59,Screen_Blitz,"Clever thriller has great performances, but is incoherent at times",6,9 June 2015,"Will Smith plays Nicky Spurgeon, an expert con artist who comes meets a beautiful woman named Jess (played by Margot Robbie). As they fall in love, Nicky teaches Jess the fundamentals of being a con man. When they are forced to split up, Nicky and Jess find each other in Buenos Aires, Argentina three years later, where they find themselves caught in a dangerous scheme. Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, writers of the romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011), Focus has a very interesting premise as it deals with the complicated life of a con man. The film is quite intriguing and suspenseful at times as well as having strong character arc, but throws so many twists and turns that it occasionally becomes hard to follow. Will Smith and Margot Robbie showed off great performances as the main characters, they showed a great amount of chemistry between each other. I would have to say that this is probably Will Smith's best role in recent years. Margot Robbie also does pretty well as the main woman too. The plot was very interesting as well, but there were several points in the movie where I was just lost. I found myself as asking ""Okay, what is the point of this scene?"". The main problem is that it throws so many twist and turns that its hard to understand where everything is going. On the other hand, there are some suspenseful scenes that had my heart pumping, like the scene where Will Smith goes on a gambling spree against the Chinese man at the football game. The film also does a great job with creating engaging characters, this, in my opinion, is the best aspect of this film has to offer.If you are big fan of Will Smith, this film may be worth a try. However, this film has some flaws and I don't recommend to everyone.",Focus
60,punishmentpark,"Not bad, not good.",5,29 November 2015,"A free ticket and a bored late night convinced me to try this one, too. I've always been a fan of 'The fresh prince of Bel-Air', and thusly, Will Smith has been on my film radar for a long time. He's been in quite a few blockbusters, but lately, I haven't been much interested. 'Focus' showed me why.Will Smith is not a great actor (who could always lean on his energetic youthfulness in the past), and hardly chooses interesting projects to play in. And, also, my own taste in films has changed. 'Focus' is something along the lines of an 'Ocean's eleven' or an 'Out of sight' (both Steven Soderbergh movies), and maybe it's not even half bad. Of the two mentioned, 'Out of sight' worked really well, with its mix of crime and romance, while 'Ocean's eleven' was just merely okay - but still, Soderbergh is good (sometimes even great) at making movies.Unfortunately, I wasn't much impressed with most of the dialogue here, the chemistry between Smith and Margot Robbie (goodlooking, for sure) is hardly there, and the whole plot, though reasonably clever at some moments, is nothing special. Cinematography and soundtrack were pretty good, too, but it's just not enough for this movie to be convincing altogether.5 out of 10.",Focus
61,Troy_Campbell,Full of swagger... and convoluted plot twists.,6,5 March 2015,"If ever there was a movie that should use LMFAO's ""I'm Sexy and I Know It"" as its theme song, this is it. Full of swagger and sizzle, this glossy thriller amps up the sex appeal all the way to boiling hot, even when the other cinematic elements can't quite keep up. What stops this from becoming 2015's Thomas Crowne Affair (the racy McQueen / Dunaway original, not the ho-hum Brosnan / Russo remake) is the convoluted script from Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who also take on directing duties. Their con-within-a-con-within-a-con plot is so cumbersome and complicated that the last act becomes a slog to get through. The nonsensical finale all but confirming just how far the twisted storyline had spiralled out of the filmmaker's control. Yet for all of its narrative flaws – which also includes an abundance of con-artist clichés – there is still an enthusiasm and seductiveness to the proceedings that primarily keeps it fun. There are a few amusing sleight of hand sequences, a streak of raunchy humour, and an abundance of only-in-our-wildest-dreams glitz and glamour that successfully adheres to the tried and tested formula of the genre. And then, of course, you also have the ridiculously attractive leading duo of Will Smith and Margot Robbie, together sharing a saucy chemistry in a relationship that sees the power dynamic continuously ebb and flow between them. A more, umm, focused screenplay could have leant the film a lasting influence, as is Focus offers enjoyable in-the-moment popcorn thrills that will be quickly forgotten.",Focus

When he meets a beautiful young lady, things begin to get a bit hot with serious trouble awaiting him.I actually like the atmosphere of this movie. It combines the nonchalant vibe of the genre with a very professional and clean look. Unlike other reviewers, for me the film is above average and sticks out between the many forgetable Hollywood blockbusters. It caught me by surprise witha few clever twists and made me want to watch until the bitter end. It is of course not a game changer or something never seen before but it is very well made for what it is.All in all I can undoubtedly reccomend a watch.

To talk more about the plot would constitute a spoiler so let's just say that Smith is excellent, Robbie does a nice acting job although her looks are a tad too model-ly for me, Martinez does another solid side role as in Secret Life, and it was nice to see McRaney again.

From the title and synopsis to its stylish posters, everything suggests a cool, fresh and different film. In reality, it's pretty average. The plot fell well short of my expectations and Will Smith looks as uninvolved in this film as I think I've ever seen him.This title of this movie is quite ironic given that I found my mind wondering on more than one occasion. Any decent film should be able to hold your attention for a couple of hours, but 'Focus' fails to do that, no thanks to an underwhelming plot and unsatisfying ending.

65,blott2319-1,"Not a great con artist film, but still quite enjoyable",8,16 September 2020,"I've always been a bit of a sucker for movies about con artists. I think part of it is the fact that these movies tend to have a built in twist ending because there's always someone being tricked, and we are rarely in on the con, so this makes the entire movie feel a bit like a mystery that I get to solve as I watch. Many of those elements are present in Focus, and that's why I enjoyed it so much. I did feel like I was a few steps ahead of people in this film, because they telegraph some of the tricks ahead of time, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the ride until the final reveal. The charming cast didn't hurt, as Will Smith is a great leading man for this kind of role, and Margot Robbie has a good report with him (even if their romantic connection wasn't the most convincing.) I also love Adrian Martinez any time he shows up for some comic relief, so it was nice to see him in a supporting role here.I'll admit that Focus is loaded with flaws, though. As I already mentioned they foreshadow elements of the cons way too early, and make it too obvious what is coming. There's also the fact that these people are genuine criminals who aren't preying on worse crooks or evil people. They are straight-up thieves who take from the innocent. We really shouldn't be rooting for any of them, but there's a playful lightness to the crimes that make you think it's not that big of a deal. I also wish they made Margot Robbie's character a stronger part of the film. For most of the runtime, she is just there to receive the exposition, or as a prize for Smith to win. I can totally understand someone thinking Focus is a bad movie, or saying it is horribly flawed, because I can see the problems with it. However, I found enough to like that I'll probably watch it again.",Focus
66,thekarmicnomad,I would Focus on kicking this guy in the nuts!,6,3 September 2015,"This is a heist movie much as we have seen before. Traditionally the likable rouge and his buddies throw a big caper, with an inevitable twist at the end. Then of course there is an obligatory flash back scene where it turns out the twist was revealed through tiny hints and Easter eggs all through the film.Focus pretty much follows the format, and it has Will Smith in it who is very likable and easy to watch.This format has been around for a bit so, unless you are new to the caper scene, the movie needs to offer a little more. This doesn't. Where for instance in Oceans 11 you had some good character interaction and whit; Focus relies solely on a pretty girl and Will Smith's charisma to carry it.But that is OK. Or it would be if...Will Smith's character wasn't a disgusting thief. Not a morally good, Robin Hood style desperado who cheekily punishes the bad and the greedy. No he is a -steal your passport, credit card and grannies Holocaust ring whilst you are having an asthmas attack- kind of guy. Then he sells all your possessions on to an organised network of scum bags; possibly the Mafia or Al Qaeda who knows? If I saw Will's character get a beating in an alley way I would run over to put the boot in.This is not in the vein of the caper\heist movie. Will's character is not a hero or likable in anyway.I like to imagine that after the credits roll Will Smith's character (not the actor) goes off, gets cancer of the scrotum before being caught by the authorities, all the stolen goods returned, and he is shipped off to Mexico to serve life in a maximum security, pound you in the butt prison.",Focus
67,Andy-296,Waste of time,2,8 March 2015,"I went to this movie knowing nothing about it, we have planned to see other movie with my date, but when we arrived at the multiplex, that movie has sold out, so we choose this one. Basically we have here Will Smith (one of the most unbearable actors working today, he's impossibly smug in this) as a kind of criminal mastermind, a sort of CEO of an underworld company, always ahead of what others are thinking. He takes as an intern the blonde bombshell Jess (Margot Robbie, from the Wolf of Wall Street, playing again a groupie of a criminal). The movie's running joke is that the Smith character always ends up fooling her.In general, I don't like very much movies about criminals, since I don't find criminality to be very amusing. This movie, however, is too silly, too stupid, the absurd plot twists too ridiculous to offend. But it is really a waste of time to spend two hours of your life seeing this. And the movie is infused in a lot of what I find about US young urban contemporary culture to be abhorrent.The last part of the movie was filmed in my hometown, Buenos Aires (gratuitously so, since it involves a con operation involving a Formula 1 race, which hasn't been set here for many years), but even that part I didn't find to be terribly interesting, as it's all shown with a tourist lens.The only good scene in the movie here has Smith playing a game of escalating bets with a Chinese businessman (BD Wong).",Focus

72,bob-the-movie-man,Blurred lines in Focus,4,17 March 2015,"In ""Focus"" Will Smith plays Nicky, a con artist from a long lineage of con artists, who takes under his wing the beautiful and talented pickpocket Jess (Margot Robbie): a great example of the sort of apprentice system that the UK Government is looking to encourage! Margot learns the more advanced tricks of the trade including the importance of distraction (hence the Focus of the title). Nicky and Jess feel an immediate attraction, with Nicky constantly fighting against his feelings to maintain his professional focus. The action moves from New York to more picturesque locations in New Orleans to Buenos Aires, building to the ultimate con in the febrile gasoline-fuelled environment of the Formula 1 circuit.The key requirements of a first class con/heist movie like ""Ocean's Eleven"" or ""The Sting"" is a charismatic lead, a clever and intriguing story and getting the audience to really care that the characters succeed in their quest against their (typically well deserving) mark. Focus differs in just three respects.Will Smith has to be one of the more charismatic stars in the A-list today: on talk shows (like the recent edition of the Graham Norton show) he just shimmers with fun and good humour. Unfortunately in this film, he just seems to leave it all in the dressing room. For 80% of the film he is sullen and dour – – I think he was going for 'cool and aloof', but it just comes off as 'bored'. I'm a fan of Smith, and after ""After Earth"" he could do with a hit vehicle – unfortunately this is not it.The surly performance largely destroys any chemistry between his character and Jess, which is a great shame since Margot Robbie is otherwise the best thing in the movie: aside from looking absolutely stunning (both in and out of an F1-babe bikini), she also knows how to act: following on from ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" she is building a great name for herself.Elsewhere Adrian Martinez is effective as Nicky's foul-mouthed side-kick Farhad and for female fans of ""Love Actually"", the Brazilian 'hunk' Rodrigo Santoro appears as Garriga, the owner of an F1 team (shirt on though this time).The script aims for ""Ocean's"" levels of cleverness, with some good comedy lines, but falls short. The story lurches from the 'training' section in New Orleans to the Buenos Aires section (""three years later"") like a needle skipping on an LP (kids, ask your parents about that simile!).Above all, the film's lack of moral compass makes you wish that the perpetrators get caught rather than get away with it. There is no evil mobster that they are ripping off: the marks, in the first half of the film at least, are regular wage earners like you and me that abhor theft and card fraud. How then is the audience supposed to warm and get onside with characters that cause personal misery? (""Oh look, she's stolen his wedding ring – how clever!""). The story builds to an unsatisfactory Hollywood finale, where a cliffhanging ""Italian Job"" approach might have worked much better.The film showed in the UK with a '15' certificate for ""strong language, violence, sex, sex references"", although it is difficult to see why it really merited this rating, at least from the sex angle – – the scenes between Smith and Robbie are very tame indeed.Directors – plural, never a good sign – are Glen Ficarra and John Requa (""Bad Santa"", ""I Love You Philip Morris"") who also wrote the screenplay. The one flash of brilliance for me was in a long build up sequence as one of Garriga's henchmen prepares for an act of violence (note: though spoiled by the trailer).In summary, whilst I'm a fan of the genre, this is one to miss.(If you enjoyed this review please see the multi-media version at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address on the site to receive future reviews.

73,bryank-04844,'Focus' is a fun-as-hell film with great performances and some solid twists and turns.,8,12 August 2015,"The art of deception and the big con job are at the center of 'Focus', which is a very sleek film full of charm, wit, and a giant basket of twists and turns that will have you yelling in your seat. There isn't anything relatively new or fresh here in the form of changing the game or genre of the 'con-artist' film, but with Will Smith and Margot Robbie's performances and the luxurious and glossy look this film has, this deceptive film has a place of its own with the rest of the fun thief movies we've seen. Whether it be 'Ocean's 11', 'Confidence', or even 'Dirty Rotten Scoundrels', you can bet that you won't see at least a few cons running full force at you.Instead, the story sneaks up behind you, gives you a thrill followed by a smile. And that's what's fun about these types of films. Yes, these are bad guys who steal from regular people every day, whether it be your credit cards, jewelry, or wallets. We've all gone through the hassle of canceling credit cards or having to replace stolen goods at some point in time. But with characters like Nicky and Jess (Will Smith and Margot Robbie) or Danny Ocean and Rusty Ryan (George Clooney and Brad Pitt from 'Ocean's 11'), you can't help but want to be a part of their team. Hell, you even root for them to steal and get away with it.It's their charm and humor that you're attracted to. Well that and the fun parties they have when the job is done and the amount of money they make. Smith plays Nicky, a con man who has been stealing by sleight-of-hand from people in public places for many years. He's a pro who within five seconds have your watch, ring, and wallet in his possession without you knowing about it. He meets Jess (Robbie) at a restaurant who tries to con him, but Nicky can see it coming from a mile away. He calls her on it, but instead of walking away, he takes a liking to her and wants to train her to be a part of his team, which actually consists of a few dozen people, working together to steal as many wallets, pieces of jewelry, and credit cards as they can from your average joe's walking down the street.The entire crew, led by Nicky end up in New Orleans for the big Superbowl game, where tourists and fans of football have flocked with all their hard earned cash. Over the course of the weekend, Nicky and Jess, along with several others rack up a couple of million dollars in stolen goods, which is shot very well over a few montage scenes. But it's when Nicky takes Jess to the actual game where Nicky starts to place bets on the Superbowl with a flamboyant wealthy man named Liyuan, played by an impressive BD Wong, where things start to go sour.In a strange time jump, we fast forward three years to find Nicky in Buenos Aires, working a con on a wealthy man you owns some Formula One cars and racers named Garriga (Rodrigo Santoro). But Nicky's world is turned upside down when he sees Jess again, whom he hasn't seen since New Orleans, and things start to spiral out of control quickly for Nicky due to Garriga's jerk of a partner Owens (Gerald McRaney).Writer-director's Glenn Ficarra and John Requa have done a wonderful job here in telling a highly entertaining film that keeps you guessing and having fun from start to finish. Their script is not only very suspenseful at times, but is also quite hilarious. Ficarra and Requa wrote 'Bad Santa' back in 2003 and directed 'I Love You Phillip Morris' with Jim Carrey back in 2009, so you can see they have some skill in the humor department.As far as Will Smith and Margot Robbie go, they are both excellent here. Smith, as always, is quite the likable and appealing character without any of the melodramatic baggage this time. He's quick, funny, and mysterious. He's done one hell of a job here. And Robbie turns in another solid performance, delivering on every level, even if her character doesn't get the chance to shine as much as Smith's character does. 'Focus' is a fun-as-hell film with great performances and some solid twists and turns. I look forward to a sequel, which I hope there is.",Focus

75,CANpatbuck3664,Gratifying Conman/Heist Movie With Good Acting and A Quick Pace,8,16 December 2015,"There were some interesting factors at play for the cast of this movie. Will needed to rebound after the debacle that was After Earth. Margot was looking to build off of her breakout performance in The Wolf of Wall Street. When I was looking at the trailers it definitely looked like the movie could be a lot of fun so I went into this with low expectations, due to the February release date but I was hopeful and I do enjoy a good heist/conman movie.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* Nicky (Will Smith) pulls some strings to get a table at a club and while he's at his table, an attractive woman named Jess (Margot Robbie) asks him to pretend to be her boyfriend to ward off some creepy guy at the bar. They get to talking and after a while, Nicky is invited up to her room. Just as things start to heat up, some man bursts in claiming to be her husband. Instead of panicking, Nicky cracks jokes, realizing almost immediately that they are setting him up. He leaves but follows Jess when she leaves the hotel. After telling her more about his family's past, he agrees to show her some moves and he begins to steal everything that she has on her. He lectures her on maintaining focus and to pay attention to detail and when there is nothing left to teach (or to steal) he leaves for New Orleans to set up a crime ring while the Super Bowl is going on. Jess tracks him down though and begs him to let her be part of his crew. He reluctantly agrees to and reveals he knew about her being there the whole time.The first thing that I want to say about this movie is that it feels slick and I mean that in a good way. The locations are stunning, the cinematography is beautiful and the movie takes full advantage of that. Focus radiates a sense of cool (helped along from the efforts of the cast)and you want to see what will happen next. Adding to the well-polished feeling is that the film moves at a pretty quick pace (especially in the first half). There are small flaws in the plot (more on that later) but the movie moves fast enough that you sense the creators were aware of this and knew that they needed to deliver a tight story to help it along. I got the feeling that there were some experienced people at the reigns and they knew what they needed to do to make this movie appealing which I would say they did in spades.I found the acting in this movie to be impressive. I would say this is the strongest Will has been in a while. I don't understand the hate around his acting but he did try something distinctive here, playing a more unlikable main character. He was funny and suave, he always is but he's occasionally given the chance to do something more and he performs well. It felt like he was giving it his all and I think that came through in his performance. I also walked away really impressed with Margot Robbie's performance. Her character of Jess isn't given much back story so it's up to her to carry her share without added depth and she really pulled it off. Getting past the fact that she's beautiful between this and The Wolf On Wall Street, she really comes across as a pro and someone who is talented beyond her years. I'm definitely looking forward to what she does next. I also want to credit Adrian Martinez and BD Wong for being very funny in their respective roles. Rodrigo Santoro gave a surprisingly subtle performance and Gerald McRaney is great but he's given probably the worst dialogue out of the group. He does his best to sell it but it doesn't always work.I see this movie split into two distinct halves. I thought the first half of this movie is really strong. There's two interesting characters you are introduced to that have excellent chemistry, the dialogue is funny and most importantly, it finds a way to subvert most of the heist/conman movie tropes. Nicky and Jess concentrate more on working on a small scale, poking fun that in every story it's always about ""the big con."" The low key action scenes find an ideal balance between fun and interesting and from scene to scene you have something different to have fun with(the Super Bowl con was my favourite). The second half is still good but it's decidedly weaker. It becomes more of a romantic comedy, targeting the relationships as opposed to the con. It works because of the strong acting but it moonwalks back into conventionality. It's not predictable but you know it's all going to have a happy ending.My other complaint is with the ending itself, it seems like they went with a couple of twists too many. It's disappointing because the scene previous has an interesting take on a familiar device where the heroes are picked up by the villain's head henchman. They even spit out what would have been the most logical conclusion on the way to the finale. To me it felt like when you're caught doing something wrong as a kid, you rattle off too many excuses until one sticks. They go through many possible endings until they find what they think is the best one. I didn't affect the grade too much but after a promising start, Focus didn't quite stick the landing.Critics weren't kind to this movie and while it is solid as a whole, there are missteps. What elevated this movie for me is the efforts of the cast and the excellent first half. I enjoyed the movie for what it is and I believe if you go into it with low expectations, you'll find it's a fun entry into the genre.",Focus

It's nice to see Will Smith having fun in a role again, and the talented Margot Robbie makes for a good partner in crime. The leads are appealing together, and that turns out to be the most crucial element of the movie. Smith plays Nicky Spurgeon, an exceptionally gifted and accomplished con man who takes an amateur con artist, Jess (Robbie), under his wing. Nicky and Jess become romantically involved, but with Nicky's profession of being a liar and a cheater for a living, he realizes that deception and love are things that don't gel together. They split, only to see each other three years later, in the midst of Nicky's latest scheme - probably his most daring and grandest yet - and her reemergence throws his entire plan for a loop.""Focus"" offers a fair dose of giddy pleasure, just like any entry in the crime-caper-comedy genre should, but it also suffers a tad from being overtly smooth, slick, and sure of itself - accusations that are sometimes thrown the way of the movie's leading man. And this is where the film loses a bit of ""focus"" as it peters out towards its climax, which is a darn shame because it most certainly had the potential to end up as one of the great con movies made.""Focus"" would like nothing more than to evoke the easy style, playful personality, and infectious charm of ""The Sting"", ""Ocean's Eleven"" (the Clooney-Pitt starrer), or even ""The Italian Job"" (both the original and its remake) for that matter. But its surface glamor, while attractive, cannot substitute for its lack of character and depth. You end up with a feeling of being entertained yet not completely satisfied, especially in the second half where the twists and turns end up being more confounding than beguiling. Still, for the most part, ""Focus"" neatly skates by on its style, confidence, delectably teasing con-jobs (mostly in the first half), and the suave charm of its lead stars.",Focus
79,RevRonster,The characters are great but the story is weak...,6,19 September 2015,"The strongest thing about ""Focus"" and the one thing that made it an absolutely great film is the performances from Will Smith and Margot Robbie. Separately they are incredible but when they get together they are a force of nature and really make scenes very engaging and incredibly addicting to watch. This easily could have made for a great film but being this film is about con people doing con stuff, you kinda need some conflict and a flashy and neat con to go with it. This film achieves this on a case by case basis and has some cool con scenes but the major con, the focal point of the film in the final half, feels very weak and isn't as developed or feathered out as well as some of the minor con scenes that occur earlier in the film. This ends up crafting a weak point of conflict for the characters and it makes for an antagonist who barely feels like he's in the story. ""Focus"" is a decent movie with some absolutely awesome acting in it but it fails at doing what films about con men (and women) are suppose to doand that is actually have a cool con going on.",Focus
80,danielmanson,I enjoyed this on the whole,8,24 June 2020,"Yeah I quite enjoyed this film in all honesty. I got Now You See Me vibes quite a lot as the viewer is often left wondering when something happens if it is part of some sort of con/trick. I personally enjoy that kind of thing as you're left guessing a lot of the time and when it gets revealed it's a great feeling.Characters I thought were likeable and I thought the romantic side of things wasn't overdone and the thriller side was more evident, which is a good thing because I didn't click on this to watch a romance film.My only issue with this film is that
1: all other characters weren't in it enough to give me any sort of connection for them
2: the ending was a bit odd. I felt like the film needed another 15 mins or so before ending, but it just dropped to credits. The film ended and you got what you wanted, but I feel like there's unanswered questions still that really needed to be answered.",Focus

The art direction was very stylish. Everything was made to look very sleek and sexy. Although, Will's eye candy, Margot Robbie did not need much help in the sexy category.So the movie can hold it's own with a sophisticated story of the art of the con game, that was more interesting and less predictable than most movies about the subject, but it does not hurt that this is Will Smith's vehicle, as he proves he's still got what it takes behind the wheel.Definitely ago see.",Focus

This film is slowly moving forward, giving a lot of room for the plot and story to unfold, but the pace is not high, there are certain scenes more fast moving, but in general it is strolling along, minding its own business and doesn't really care what others think.I actually found it entertaining, even though I usually like more action and a faster pace, but in its own subtle way it was just a good con story. They try mixing in some romance and that doesn't really work for the story, it does add something to the plot, but it seems a bit too obvious that it should influence the parts it does.All-in-all it is an okay movie, entertaining, funny and well acted, but it never gets really exciting, it never gets really up there, it just stays at okay good entertainment for a couple of hours.",Focus

Until I sawed my favorite YouTube reviewer Chris Stuckmann reviewed the movie and give it a positive rating and shortly after that I sawed this movie hit number one at the box office, and now I was interested and after seeing the movie I can say that the movie was...okay.Will Smith is the kind of actor that he can be in a good or bad movie and it will be a box office hit, but I think his range of be successful is going side ways for him and I thought Focus was going to be another one of those movies that Will Smith is trying to be a success again, but this time I was wrong because Will Smith was actually pretty good in this movie.Margot Robbie won me over in The Wolf Of Wall Street. Shes a pretty face actress that actually can acted not like some other actress in Hollywood. Margot Robbie did a excellent in this movie. I'm so looking forward to see her play Harley Quinn, I mean she already wowed me enough.Smith and Robbie chemistry together in this movie was just perfect. I liked they back and forward with each other and it came off pretty funny and well done.Now for the things that didn't really work: The second half of the movie I got to say got sloppy and the ending that I won't give away but it ended in a way that I don't pay it, like at all.Focus is overall a surprising movie for me, because I didn't really expect much for this movie but after seeing it I was surprised that I got more out of it.",Focus

85,ArchonCinemaReviews,Moments of fun and entertainment but imperfect and lacking chemistry,6,1 March 2015,"Focus is an entertaining and comedic enough film - doesn't hurt the filmmakers to exploit the beauty of the actors and locations in the film.If you think too much about the film Focus, the film begins to unravel as the glaring pitfalls and weaknesses pile up well after the film concludes.Jess (Margot Robbie) is an ingénue thief, boosting wallets and watches in New York City. When her latest mark Nicky (Will Smith) turns out to be a veteran con man, she rebounds quickly and pleads to be his apprentice. Nicky declines and is on his way to his next crime of fast handed deception. Not taking ""No"" for an answer, she follows him and takes part in a high stakes scheme, falling for Nicky in the process. But you know the saying, there's no honor amongst thieves and there's little trust too.Within Focus there are moments of fast paced fun that allows the audience to get lost in the movie. And then there are juvenile sub-par jokes by writers/directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa that pull you right back out of the movie and into the stiff chairs of the movie theater. In the end, the balance between these two types of moments is about half and half.Most of these moments include Jess, who it seems neither men knew how to write. She is awkward, unpolished and at times bordering on foolishly and unprofessionally stupid. The character shows no growth, despite being under the mentorship of Nicky, which is improbable and unbelievable. However, when Jess is across from a table from Nicky's sidekick Farhad, played by the scene stealing Adrian Martinez, or in an ensemble action scene she is a fast-learner and worthy member of the group. This character shows the flaw and lack of clear vision in Focus that causes it to fail at being spectacular or even very great.The writers and directors of Focus fail to find the a consistent tone or mood in the film or even the film's niche, sometimes action, sometimes romance, sometimes fun caper and other times idiotic comedy. The film could have done without the romance, since Smith and Robbie have about as much chemistry as shoe polish.Focus's faults are exacerbated by the poorly paced plot that relies upon telling rather than showing, a lazy tactic typical of a substandard story and script. It saves itself by having ridiculously good looking and well dressed lead actors set in the richest locations imaginable, once again letting the viewer get lost in the film living vicariously through the leads.This isn't to say that Focus is a bad movie, the audience I was with laughed consistently and regularly at the film and even waited with baited breath when things went awry. The problem is, it is far from perfect or even close to the same level as the filmmakers' previous project.",Focus

I mean, just how GOOD does a movie have to be to please these guys? I don't know... I'm genuinely very curious as to precisely what the deal is with these people who write some of the 'reviews' here... (Bad gene pool? Toxic environment? Dropped one too many times? Tainted Mushrooms? {speaking of 'Taints', I couldn't possibly come up with a more appropriate name, since the 'official' definition of a 'Taint' is what lies directly between the Nutsack and the @sshole. Sounds just about right to me...})Anyway... FWIW, I honestly felt that this was a great film. I thought it was VERY funny, especially the heavy guy. Hilarious! Will Smith's performance was excellent; I felt that he gave it PRECISELY the right tone for what he was trying to do. The writing was very good, and the story was most involving, created some nice suspense, and ultimately was quite entertaining. The acting was excellent by all involved. I frigg'n LOVED the Asian guy! (sorry to classify by 'race', but I don't know his name right off :) He was fantastic! There were so many great characters in this film, that I felt that it really added a LOT to this movie.I would say that if you appreciate a very sharp, intelligent, and funny 'Con' oriented movie, and especially if you happen to like Will Smith, I truly cannot think of a single reason why you wouldn't like this film. I honestly felt that this was a great, quality, highly entertaining movie. I am genuinely puzzled and surprised (as if you couldn't tell...) at all the critical comments in some of the reviews.This is easily one of the better films that I've seen in a while, and CERTAINLY one of the better Will Smith films that I've seen in some time (and I frigg'n ***LIKED*** 'AFTER EARTH'...! :)Highly recommended...",Focus

Not in a Kevin Spacey kind of way, i just see him now as the very charismatic leading man everyone else sees him as.Focus is the name. Focus is the game as this film features a sharp script with entertaining characters and the direction achieves genuine suspense and misdirection. Con men are hard to make sympathetic with the whole identify theft stuff, so it shows how good Will Smith is that he can pull it off. The protagonist comes off as smart, charming and vulnerable. Everything you want in an Alfie type film such as this.Margot Robbie is also good, being convincing in her arc from novice to less than novice. A very natural presence and her and Smith have great chemistry. Another shout out would be in a all round solid cast would be Gerald McRaney who though isn't in the film for that long has an equal amount of charm as the two leads.The cinematography is great, but some shots look flat. I don't know why, just some of them lack depth. Maybe it was the editing. Perhaps I'm too used to montages and the like. But really, I'm struggling to find anything bad to say about the film. Maybe the misdirection goes a little too far and makes the drama a bit floaty. But that's it.

If you add to his unbeatable charisma someone with the talent of Margot Robbie and you will definitely have something fun going on. And that is exactly what Focus is. Some interesting dynamics and ideas are made entertaining only because of the two likable leads, the colorful and eye popping locations and cinematography and most of all the fun aspect of Con-Heist movies, for which I personally am a sucker for. So despite how much bad things I could say about this film, I can't deny that for some periods of time I actually pleasantly kept on my seat.But, that's where positives end. I talked about how I am a sucker for Con-Heist films and this one manages to get most of it wrong because it uses if for pure eye candy, there is no relevance of it to an interesting storyline nor to the characters. Moreover, this film is so stupidly convoluted it thinks it is smart and thinks it can get away with it by explaining things really fast with witty faces on characters, but as soon as you think about it you realize the movie is actually treating you like you're stupid. You know I was about to give this film a 5, because it really doesn't have huge technical issues except its editing, which by the way is really off, but the more I think about it the more it makes me angry: not only it treats you as an idiot, it also has a disgusting message and portrayal of robbers and Morgot Robbie's character is so one note it actually comes close to being misogynistic.I will admit I had some fun in the theater, but overall the film fails both on a storytelling-filmaking side and even more on the ""intellectual"", for the lack of a better word, side.",Focus

Writers of the movie had a great story in their bag all along but the moment they put it down on paper it went chaos. Direction is poor. The plot lacks substance. Screenplay doesn't impress much either. Editing is average too.Even though the story took off at a great note manifesting the genius Will sells subtly, it started heading on a belt of shoddy towards the mouth of indifference in no time. One moment it seemed as if Wong was going to take it towards impending awesomeness but then boom!.comes another jackhammer and we are left without a great story. Okay so this keeps happening throughout the movie. Yet these twists and turns don't lift you off your seat. You just end up with a 'meh'. Then enters Rodrigo Santoro but alas he has a screen time of a blink. Without any power to his role he vanishes without posing a threat too. Character detailing is simply absent. You don't even get to know Nicky's team, forget others.The chemistry between Will and Margot wasn't engaging at all. It lacked spark and seemed more animated than real. You could literally see Margot flinching in her act (poor casting choice). Adrian Martinez was in there to throw in a few laughs. One time his humour goes so bizarre it becomes literally unfunny.Really poor script, I would say, for a con movie. There are needle dropped songs replacing score here. Also, nothing flabbergasting that would blow your minds away. You almost see the end coming. Very predictable at times and quite average story build up. Can pass this!",Focus

93,ginocox-206-336968,Brilliant con artist movie blended with flawed romantic comedy,8,27 February 2015,"""Focus"" blends two different movies in roughly equal measure. One is a movie about con men, scam artists and hustlers, in the tradition of ""The Sting,"" ""Ocean's Eleven,"" ""House of Games"" and ""Shade."" The second movie is a romantic comedy between two people who are strongly attracted to one another, but who cannot and do not trust each other. The movie about con men is brilliant. The hustles and scams are clever and cleverly executed with excellent skill and tradecraft. Dramatically, the double-blinds and double- crosses are well executed. The players con their marks, one another and the audience with finesse and aplomb. The cinematography, choreography and editing are crisp. The reveals are plausible within the film's cosmos of reality. The romantic comedy is not bad. One can understand and believe the attraction between the two characters. Will Smith's character is hunky, clever, confident, successful and wealthy. Margot Robbie's character is gorgeous, sexy, vulnerable, clever and charming. But the major plot points in this boy finds girl, boy loses girl, boy wins girl back subplot seem contrived, while the intriguing aspect of their relationship (How can two con artists with a history of deceiving one another learn to trust one another?) isn't explored in a satisfactory manner. Instead we get a breakup for reasons that are never explained, a repeated gag involving a wallet, and a massive coincidence that leads the audience to believe one of them has a hidden agenda involving the other. The relationship between them works best when they are conning one another, but it needs resolution. Technically, the film is beautifully done. Cinematography, locations, wardrobe, make-up, editing, audio -- everything is polished. It's a movie that merits a second or third viewing, not only to see the cons played out, but also to appreciate some of the subtle foreshadowing.",Focus

95,luke-a-mcgowan,"Focus looks shiny and nice, but even a passing glance will reveal there's no substance.",3,20 July 2015,"Focus does the one thing it keeps telling its main characters not to do - it completely loses focus.Will Smith and Margot Robbie might be two of the most charismatic and likable people kicking around Hollywood at the moment, but when that is the only selling point of the film, you're going to have trouble around 10 minutes in. And that's just what happens to Focus - with any semblance of plot jerked around by forgettable characters, repeatedly vapid pickpocket montages and a constant one-upmanship in the twist department.It feels like Requa and Ficarra had two short stories to tell, and in the interests of making a feature film, slapped them together and said ""she'll be right"". Predictably, the film's second half feels more like a sequel than a second act, and the first act ends so definitively (and inexplicably, by the way) that to pick up with the second act felt like the directors thought they were finished and had to jump right back into it.Robbie and Smith are likable people but they don't share much chemistry together and therefore I didn't buy their relationship. Unfortunately, that was the whole movie. They both pretty much did whatever they wanted. They were also pretty shallow characters, without much development. When Smith faces a gambling loop, I thought we were about to get into some serious character work, and I felt for him every time he lost the double or nothing stakes. Especially with earlier set up with Smith being warned not to get carried away gambling. Turns out that he was in complete control the whole time and there is a very long and highly unlikely explanation about how the whole thing was a long con. It takes what could have been a very personal scene and then makes it brainless nonsense with little sense and less purpose. Robbie's character is just as bad - early in the film she is laughed off as an amateur, and a short while later she's the best Smith's ever seen. He gives her this compliment as he inexplicably leaves her by the side of the road and leaves because....well, plot I suppose.Requa and Ficarra's previous film I wasn't a big fan of either, and in my review of Crazy, Stupid Love I pointed out their love of genre clichés. Well guess what - here they are again. A smooth charming leader, lots of quick crime shot montages, hot babes being hot babes and a big reveal at the end. Roll credits. But here they lack even the likable cast that CSL boasted - outside Robbie and Smith, only BD Wong has any real scenes. Finally, the film's twists were so stupid and unlikely that I gave up and just rolled with it at the end.Focus looks shiny and nice, but even a passing glance will reveal there's no substance. Spend your time on a much more fulfilling crime story like Gone Baby Gone or Inside Man - its got less hot babes, but its probably better for your brain.",Focus
96,trublu215,Focus looks great but ends up being ultimately forgettable,5,25 February 2015,"I was lucky enough to catch an early preview of Focus last night. I must say, the film surpassed many of my already low expectations of the film. Despite this plus, the film never really has that WOW factor to it. Written and Directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Reque, the same duo behind Crazy, Stupid Love, Focus feels more like a love letter to Steven Soderbergh than a film that can stand on its own two feet. Much like its inspirations, Focus aspires to be a great film and almost succeeds but the difference between Focus and films such as Ocean's Eleven and The Grifters is that this ends up feeling like it is trying too hard to wear its inspirations on it sleeve rather than be its own beast. Following Nicky, a brilliant con man and Jess, his sultry apprentice, as they fall in love all while trying achieve the perfect con, the story is decent enough to warrant a feature film but executed really poorly. Lets be honest here, there are no shortage of films very similar to this but what sets Focus apart from the rest is its sleek look. The look of this film is intoxicating, every shot is crisp and clear but also has a constant cloud over it all, as if the murkiness of these characters are affecting their environment. I'm sure there is a sub text to it all, its a shame the film isn't as cool as it looks because if it were, this really could have been something. The performances here are merely OK. Will Smith feels like a miscast here. The role of Nicky feels more like an Idris Elba type, a bit more suave and skinnier. Will Smith feels one step behind the entire cast when he really should at least try and act as if he is ahead of the curve. Margot Robbie is good but she is merely rehashing her sultry goddess performance from The Wolf of Wall Street minus the Brooklyn accent, adding very little substance to Jess and making her merely something nice to look at which is really troublesome considering Jess is probably the best character in the film. It made me wish Ficarra and Reque wrote the film around her rather than Nicky. But in the end, after their worlds collide, there's very little to take away from it all and the story plays out with a slight twist and a turn but nothing really surprising or original. Overall, Focus benefits from its sleek and sexy look but fails to deliver a good con man film, instead it delivers a lackluster romance film surrounded by crime elements that just don't really click",Focus
97,ghost_dog86,A fun movie nobody will watch,7,5 March 2015,"How long has it been since Will Smith headlined a movie worth a damn? In fact, his stock has plummeted so much so that the only real reason I saw this film in the first place was to see what Margot Robbie was up to (as I believe she is a true rising star)and because ""Focus"" was the subject of a podcast I'd been invited to participate on. The last thing I expected was to be absolutely blindsided by how fun this movie actually was.Synopsis: A female pickpocket (Robbie) is recruited by the head of a con-man empire (Smith) to join his ""crew"" in a series of well choreographed and highly elaborate heists.Sounds like a ""fun little"" ""Ocean's Eleven""-type film, right? Well, I'll say it again: ""Focus"" was a lot of fun. That said, this ""fun little"" movie could have been considered one of Will Smith's best, if not more memorable films, if not for three aspects which were treated rather clumsily: 1.While there were sequences in this I absolutely loved (the gambling sequence during a football game, the car crash, etc.) that were manufactured solely to make audiences squirm in their seats in anticipation, directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (I Love You Phillip Morris) curiously allow most of this film to be shot in a way that could only be described as ""flat"", during points when what I was expecting was the height of slick camera movement. I mean, for the amount of actual pick-pocketing on screen, the camera (for the most part) stays pretty stagnant.2.And I shall tread cautiously here, but if you know me then you know that I'm all about interracial relationships. I didn't even want to go there, but I say this to (in a way) head anybody reading this off at the pass when I say: Will Smith and Margot Robbie look more than a little odd together. I don't know if it's the age difference or what, but while there was a semblance of chemistry between the two leads, I never got past the fact that as an on screen couple the two were distractingly mis-paired.3.Lastly, the ending. All I'll say is that while well earned and well explained, it was still super awkward to sit through, simply due to the piles of explanatory information stuffed into a final three minute span of dialogue.Final Thought: Though I'm still recommending people see ""Focus"" and I will be the first to admit that its flaws are nit-picky at best; with all the good that comes out of this film (Will Smith's performance, the story itself, those standout action sequences) ""Focus"" will ultimately be forgotten because it is nothing more than a ""fun little"" movie, that had the potential to be more.

99,CleveMan66,"""Focus"" is an original and worthy addition to the heist movie genre.",7,28 February 2015,"Starting with one of the first movies ever made, 1903's ""The Great Train Robbery"", heist films have a long and distinguished history in American cinema. Some of the best more recent examples include ""Quick Change"" (1990), ""The Grifters"" (1990), ""Hudson Hawk"" (1991), ""The Score"" (2001), ""The Town"" (2010) and ""Man on a Ledge"" (2012). And sometimes, an original heist movie is so good that it leads, a generation or so later, to a remake that, thankfully, is often as good as the first one (if not better). ""Ocean's 11"" (1960 and 2001), ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" (1969 and 1999) and ""The Italian Job"" (1969 and 2003) all fit that mold. Caper flicks tickle the brain and often inject a little comedy into the equation, but mainly, they're just fun to watch. Unfortunately, we movie fans don't seem to get good ones often. Now, into that void, steps ""Focus"" (R, 1:44) – a crime drama that stars one of Hollywood's most popular stars and is original – both in its concept and its script.Will Smith stars as Nicky Spurgeon, a third-generation criminal who never holds a gun and never hurts anyone – besides the financial losses they suffer at his sticky hands. He doesn't steal big things, like, say, a load of gold bullion, a famous painting or the cash-on-hand from three Las Vegas Casinos. He steals watches and necklaces, wallets and handbags, credit cards and cash. He calls it a ""volume business"". He can steal so quickly and so frequently that he makes quite a good living for himself – and sometimes for his friends. He has a crew that he occasionally uses for big events, like the Super Bowl, where there are big crowds with lots of money and valuables on hand. And there is honor amongst this group of thieves. Everyone gets a fair cut. No back-stabbing involved. Well, almost none.Into this world stumbles Jess Barrett (Margot Robbie), an aspiring thief who is foiled in one of her ill-conceived ""jobs"" by Nicky and begs him to teach her a few things. Rather than a thief, he calls himself a con man. That tells us a couple important things about Nicky: He takes pride in his cerebral approach to stealing and he's cut out for more than glorified purse snatching – and he knows it. Jess knows it too, but for now, she's content with learning as much as she can from this very talented criminal. Nicky and his cohorts put Jess to the test in a crowd of people. She does well enough to earn a spot with the Super Bowl Snatchers (my term, not theirs, but it fits) – and in a bigger con that follows. Three years later, they both find themselves in Buenos Aires, Argentina for a big Formula One race. They're each involved in some way with Garriga (Rodrigo Santoro), the shady owner of one of the race teams. This situation opens the door for Nicky's biggest con yet – and one with a lot more at stake than ""just"" money.""Focus"" makes its mark by shedding light both on small-time thievery and on how knowledge of human behavior plays into the calculations of a successful criminal. It's almost like watching a documentary on a magician explaining his greatest, yet simplest tricks – and without spoiling the fun. Then, the film goes beyond that. As in all great magic shows – and caper flicks – as you watch the slight-of-hand unfold, you feel the tension build. You know there's something bigger coming and you enjoy trying to figure out what it is, what's happening in plain sight and how it's all going to come out in the end. You root for the magician, or, in this case, the crooks and con men (and women), even though you know their job is to fool you and everyone else. ""Focus"" brings that sense of fun to the screen – with a little humor to sweeten the deal. The leads are strong. It's great to see Will Smith on the big screen again – and in a different kind of role – and Margot Robbie shows that she has more going for her than she displayed as Leonardo DiCaprio's sex kitten wife in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". The supporting cast is adequate, but mainly disposable. That is, except for Nicky's best (and probably only) friend Farhad (Adrian Martinez) who's character is integral to the plot and, ahem, fully fleshed out, plus Gerald McRaney, who makes an excellent grumpy old body guard. There are moments when this film loses a little, well, focus on what it's trying to accomplish, but basically, it's an original and worthy addition to the genre. Will this film be remade a generation from now? I'm not sure that it's THAT good, but it's good enough for this generation to enjoy just fine. ""B+""",Focus
100,blakiepeterson,A Fizzy Game of Con Artistry,6,2 May 2015,"Focus is the film equivalent of a particularly well-made margarita: for a while, it works as a scrumptious concoction of flirtatious flavors, but if you treat yourself to a few too many more, things are inevitably going to get out of hand. Focus Mrs. Robinson's our logic — as a con movie, we initially put ourselves in the mindset that we will, without question, be ahead of all the fun and games, always skeptical and never ready to lose our intellect in the madness. Then a few minutes go by, and then a few more, and by the time we've seen two or three tricks and twists, that skepticism is gone, replaced with a fascination set by astonishingly shot scenes of grifting and abnormally gorgeous people and locales. It's a fun film, nothing more, and if it's too breezy for its own good, at least it's a cool, invigorating gust. Nicky Spurgeon (Will Smith) is an experienced con man who moves in- between jobs like a chameleon on the move — at this point, pickpocketing is stuff for the kiddos; why not do something a little more complex, a little more daring? Shortly after another successful grift, he catches the attention of Jess (Margot Robbie), a young con artist who attempts to pull her usual tricks on Nicky but can't quite match his slick abilities. Attracted to her promise, her personality, and most importantly her, Nicky decides to take Jess under his wing, making her a sort of protégé and, eventually, a lover. They work well together on the streets and in the sheets, but after a massive heist, Nicky unexpectedly dumps her, leaving her heartbroken.Cut to three years later, Nicky is plotting another job in Buenos Aries, working alongside billionaire Rafael Garriga (Rodrigo Santoro) in hopes to sabotage a motorsport race for profit. But after only a few days into the job, Nicky runs into Jess, who has become Rafael's latest girlfriend and latest predator.I'll be the first to admit that Focus will be forgotten within the next five years, most likely replaying non-stop on the FX movie channel — but that shouldn't suggest that this isn't a worthwhile, entertaining movie. These are only blandly suggestive words, I know, but Focus is the kind of movie you watch on a Friday night with your friends; it's amusing, inoffensive, and provides you with enough smarmy thrills to keep you on your toes like some sort of intrigued sucker. Smith, after years of unrewarding roles, is finally back in a performance that parallels the same easygoing charm of his earlier days, and Robbie, fresh off from her acclaimed supporting turn in Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street, is as likable as she is physically stunning. The stars align and the chemistry is fiery, and Requa and Ficarra write plenty of perceptive pieces of dialogue to suit both the actors and the romanticized scenery.The main issue with Focus is that it simply has too many tricks up its sleeve. The fluid thefts are adept, and they do knock us off our feet when we least expect, but after a while, nothing feels sincere. It's difficult to forge an emotional bond with the characters; like all grifters, we just can't trust them. Even the ending, which contains a major plot twist, is underwhelming; we've seen so many other conning routines throughout the film that a big, fat that's it? stamps the screen rather than a gratifying closer. But I can only complain for so long. There are many more positives to Focus than negatives, and there's a good chance that you'll like it. I did. It isn't anything new and it won't change your life, but I doubt watching sexy actors pull tricks all over the globe is healthier for you than reading about Kim Kardashian's latest ""struggles"" in People.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com",Focus
101,faithless4734,OMG BAD.,1,9 May 2020,"This movie was completely lost in the first minutes. The scene at the start where Smith goes to the hotel room with Margo and they do the ""my husband"" routine was incredibly bad. I had to go vomit it was so disgustingly acted and written. First we are to believe that Margo's character is going to take HOURS, they closed the bar down, to get this guy to the hotel room? Seriously, these kinda scams are fast. Second and this is the big one, Smith's character tells the guy to shot him? Completely unbelievable. I and likely you have seen scenes like this where the guy says ""go ahead shot"" or something like that and they have been very believable. This was not one of them at all. Third, the guy never beats him or pistol whips him? They all just become great friends and walk off into the sunset? Complete lose of credibility. (I know they did not walk off as friends in the movie, what I did there was use hyperbole, look it up). Then the scene where he is teaching her some skill for stealing items, the one in the snow, it was again overplayed and not believable. The only way it could be was if she were playing him and pretending to not have any scam skills. That is not at all how that scene played out, it completely seemed to me and the people I watched with as if she really had no idea how to do any of that and was seeing it for the first time. The New Orleans all of a sudden she the most talented person he has ever seen in his life? complete rubbish start to finish. It is a shame really because Smith and Robbie are both good actors and it would have been great to see them in a film that was better written and better directed.",Focus

Surprisingly I pretty much enjoyed this movie, Will Smith did not impress me in his last movies, at least his children aren't in this one. It's actually one of his best movie in recent years. This film is entirely based on the stars chemistry and charisma; it has an excellent cinematography and lightning. I loved the look of it. Plus, it doesn't have a typical structure which feels original and unique in that way. In fact, you think the movie is going in one way but twists and turns happen because obviously it's a conman movie so it moves in all kind of ways and things are happening back and forth; and all of this because of the structure which is very very different than the usual 3 acts type of movie. However, the emotional core of the film is broken from time to time and it's a little bit hard to grasp as you don't know what the characters are thinking and how they'll react, but for the most part it's a plus. We're thrown in the middle of this world of conning and conmen which is pretty interesting. The hopes are high. Focus feels like a twisty and strange Ocean 11 with a little bit of drama in it and little bit less fun and silly part. Finally, for the first half of the movie it might have been similar to Ocean 11 and then in the second act it feels more as a sequel to the first half, dealing with Smith and Robbie relationship. Will Smith and Margot Robbie are both excellent. Smith is charismatic and Margot Robbie isn't just a pretty face, she's a pretty who can act, as she already proved in The Wolf of Wall Street. Overall both of the main characters work well together. The first half of the movie is good, I loved how immersive this movie is into the con world, but the second half try to be so clever that it overreaches and slows down a bit.",Focus
104,stephendaxter,A fun heist drama that will keep you engaged right until the very end,8,15 March 2015,"I was very pleasantly surprised by Focus. After seeing the trailer i didn't think much of the film, it looked interesting at best. And after hearing nothing extremely good about it leading up to the release i figured i may have been right about it. But man was i so wrong. This was a very fun heist drama that kept me engaged for most of the film. It had a really good blend of comedy, and fast paced scenes and a good amount of more slow paced sections. Although one or two moments i felt like it had slowed down a little too much but then it picked itself up right away. This film did a really good job of keeping you interested, it stays really unpredictable for pretty much the entire film, once you think you are starting to figure things out it throws a curveball. That was something i thought really helped the film throughout but kinda hurt it a little by the end. I have to say i thought the first half of the film was a lot more fun then the second half, and that was mainly due to the on-screen chemistry between Will Smith and Margo Robbie.Their chemistry was there throughout the film and was at all times very entertaining, but the first half was where we got a lot of the humour and just overall fun scenes. Not to say that the second half was bad, but it lost a little of that back and forth between Will and Margot. All the performances in this film were great, not too comical and not too serious a really good blend. They also did a good job of making all of the characters really likable despite some of their actions not being very 'good'. In the end this film really surprised me with its great character chemistry and an engaging plot. The main letdown would be the extensive twists and turns they take as the film goes on but wasn't enough to ruin the film for me. - 8.2",Focus

This comes complete with twists, trust issues, rich people, and all kinds of Oceans 11 style problems.-For what it was, I really enjoyed Focus. It has a few small problems, but was good.-The story felt original and was hard to predict, making the twists even better and more shocking. Even if they were a tiny bit forced.-The pace was really good for the first half, and the second half. But the first half is all fun and the second half is all plot. Neither was bad, but the second half was less fun.-The acting is really good. Both Will and Margot did a great job! -The characters are deep and interesting. Will Smiths character especially had a lot to offer in the way of charisma and twists.-The music was fitting and some of it was memorable.-Another thing I liked was seeing the inside of the whole con-man thing you see in movies. Like stealing watches looks so much cooler in this because they explain it.-Really the negatives are small. There are some inconsistencies and some added drama that takes the audience out of reality alittle, but it was compelling, well-made, and entertaining! There is not that much else to say, because Focus is worth seeing in theaters! -It is rated-R for some language, a moderate, but not heavy amount, and some brief sexual content.

Will Smith put on his usual acting charm to play the role of Nicky, a con man who's plans are thwarted by a girl from his past. All of the acting in this film was good but it wasn't enough to make it the film I thought it was going to be. There were some things in this film that were a little too far fetched as far as chance and betting goes. Now I know some readers might say it's just a movie but in a crime drama film I do like a lot of reality to be in place. The relationship between Nicky (Will Smith) and Jess (Margot Robbie) in this film was played out well, being that it was an important part of this film, but again, it still wasn't enough to make it the film I thought it was going to be.

Depressing to see such obvious errors dominating the movie-this is the first time I've seen WS in an outright bomber.

109,marc5477,Enjoyment is inversely proportional to your intellect,1,23 June 2015,"My review title sums it up. If you have a high IQ you will want to walk out of this film. As you intellect drops, this movie gets better because you don't notice the flaws. I would have enjoyed this movie back in high school, but as an adult I walked out and asked for a refund because I was bored out of my mind. I really did not mind the acting and thought all the actors were adequate but the problem is that the movie has bad direction. For example, the comedy aspects did not connect and the cons were very poorly chosen as nothing I saw in the movie could ever work in reality. That said, this would be OK if this were a show about magic or fairies but this is where the problem begins. The movie takes itself very seriously and they want the audience to believe that these cons are possible... well I am sorry, but Santa is not real nor are any of the cons. They try to make them more plausible with deep explanation that go into human psychology and behavior (and stupid stuff like human programming lol) but the problem is that if you actually studied any of these things scientifically then you already know that they are not true. So basically, its a matter of what you know. If you didn't research this stuff at some point in your life, you might believe it and the movie might be OK for you. Hence, enjoyment is inversely proportional to intellect. The more you study and research and learn, the stupider this movie becomes. Its no different than a sci-fi movie that gets all the science wrong and wonders why it failed to capture that audience. Well duh!",Focus
110,paul_3-960-896774,Smith redemption movie works but lacks refinement,7,11 March 2015,"The Will Smith redemption movie, Focus, was a bit of a step up from After Earth. He could honestly only go up following After Earth. Focus is a better movie than I anticipated, actually that's a lie. Despite the cast my expectations were low, so I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't much of a stinker. The movie is entertaining, the story is somewhat interesting, but - of course there is a but - it could have been much better.My main problem with Focus is that I wasn't engaged in the story, it wasn't because it's poorly written, it's not. I walked into the movie theater knowing that it was about con-artists - the marketing never hid it, if you've seen the trailer you know this. Anyway, knowing that it was about con artists and the tag-line is ""Never loose Focus"" I never really let my guard down and I didn't let myself believe what I was seeing. I was busy trying to figure out what the con was before it happened and that's where the movie kind of disappoint.They did not play on the fact that the audience may be looking for clues as to what is going on. There are no real clues for the audience to find, there are very little things for you to think back on and say ""That's right I saw that."" They either show how it or explain it once it already happened. So if you're like me, looking for bread crumbs for you to figure out the con Focus hardly leaves any. I only got sucked into one scene and totally believed what they fed me for a little while. But much later when the big twist came I wasn't shock or surprised.I probably would have had a better experience of the film if there were hidden clues leading up to the cons or if there was one character, who wasn't a con artist, that I could have trusted allowing me to let my guard down and get conned.The leads, Will Smith and Margot Robbie, work well on screen. Will Smith is not his usual happy, upbeat, self in this movie but it suits the character. As for Margot Robbie, she plays the sex symbol cliché well without letting herself get trapped by it. She's more than a dumb, interchangeable pin up, she showed it in The Wolf Of Wall Street and also in interviews you quickly get that she knows how and when to wield the power than she has. She's talented and it shows in the movie. Focus is a decent movie, it lacks refinement but it's entertaining, Smith is slowly getting back on top after the stinker that After Earth was.",Focus

The research of the criminals, the characters, the personalities and the psychological issues behind the story is solid. Could have been even more; as it is it is good enough.

115,rjsf96,The Only People Getting Conned Are the Audience,4,6 April 2015,"No one had heard of Margot Robbie until 'The Wolf of Wall Street' came about. Now, it seems that every Director wants her in their film. How could they not; when she enthralled audiences everywhere with an exceedingly rare female role in a film. A character that is determined and strong willed. Don't get me wrong Robbie is entitled to further roles, I just cannot shake off the feeling that the Directors pulled off a con involving her, so that she could become the female lead in 'Focus'. It should be noted that never has a title had less relevance for a feature film. Because if anything the majority of this film is out of focus and you can include the script in that statement as well.It's not all bad though. The first thirty minutes is entertaining. However, I mean this in a, if you leave your brain at home way. Don't think too much and you may have a blast, but that's only if you never use your brain during a film. If you do, then there's the door, I suggest you walk through it.Nicky is a con artist played blandly yet again by Will Smith, who has only ever been well cast in a film once – 'Men in Black'. He takes up Jess played by Margot Robbie mustering her acting talent and trying as hard as she did in 'The Wolf of Wall Street' to impress. She becomes his protégé, con artist and lover. They try to become romantically involved and it does not work out. Nicky eventually tracks her down to win back her affection and talent as a con artist.Unfortunately, cracks in the film appear frequently, too large to brush aside and ignore. Consider the opening scene where Nicky tries to bed Jess. It works to his advantage and all of it happens according to his plan. But, we as an audience do not buy it. He barely knows the girl and not five minutes of chit chat has taken place, when they decide to get down to business. I know he is Will Smith and all. I'm sure he has women falling at his feet. But this seems rather far-fetched. Especially when this love turns out to be more than a one night stand and they are fully fledged romantically. The decisions that they partake seem rash, perhaps it was this lack of character development that led me to become distanced from the film in the process.The script thinks it's very clever and is far too cock sure. This brings to mind another film about deception, trickery and cons. That made no sense at all in the slightest and was all too lacking when it came to character motivation and plausibility. 'Now You See Me'. Both of these films are firmly rooted in the nineties, with old jokes and plot twists so dumb it would have a toddler second guessing the events of the film. Another comparison to be made is that they both possess visual gleam. Take that away and they are just cheap parlour tricks to conceal their true identity.If I am putting my points across to you again and again, then I'm sorry. But at least it parallels the repetitiveness of the film itself. What starts out as clever movements of characters who steal wallets and other personal belongings from random citizens grows tiresome quickly. Seen one con and you have seen them all. Don't get me going again about the romance that has been stamped on so that couples will flock to the cinema. Do we ever feel involved in their emotions? Do we feel for the characters? Do we in fact buy their romance at all for a second? The answer to all of them above is a definite no! The con clearly is on with 'Focus', not on the oblivious characters, but by and large on the audience themselves. How long can you watch the same old, same old trickery on screen that never changes? It drags and drags and drags. Gets old quickly see? Want a dull Will Smith? A flavourless story? Dumb plot twists that make no sense for a climax? You can have it all. Just do not expect witty dialogue, engaging scenes or interesting characters for that matter. Now excuse me while I burn all copies of the film.",Focus

117,rabbitmoon,Truly as bad as you feared it would be,3,3 March 2015,"Every once in a while you get a great film that is undersold or mis- sold by the marketing - and you don't want to miss these films. You think to yourself ""the actors are good, con films are always fun - its worth a punt"". Then you sit to watch it, and gradually realise you were the ""mark"" - once again, by the ever untrustworthy con- machine of Hollywood. There is so much wrong with this film, any potential for right is squeezed away before you can even consider it. The life of a pickpocket or conman would surely be a conflicted life - after all, its immoral (something the film never reflects on or even attempts to justify) and peoples lives are ruined in the process. Here its glamourised like the gangster life of a Scorsese film (but without the usual fall from grace where Scorsese DOES eventually ground it to reality). Will Smith shows her this warehouse of operatives all pouring money into a kitty, where everyone is seemingly a highly successful, slick pickpocket and thief - and the audience is supposed to think ""oh how cool!"" as part of this feather-light rom-con. At no point in the movie are we to consider Will Smith or the girl are actually criminals - which leaves a nasty taste over the whole thing. Margot Robbies acting is weak - her character is given no depth whatsoever. Smith has his usual one-note moments of ""acting"" a pained frustration, but between his usual so-cool-its-not-really-a- person schtick. The story is incredibly weak - even for a con film, it feels more like a tepid pilot for a TV show that you know you'd never continue with because there's no substance, depth, engagement or genuine intrigue. The last half gets confused between a con and a strange romantic drama that really doesn't know what its doing. The climax, where you get the obligatory clichés of a con film, were embarrassing and distracting in the same way that the heart- transplant at the end of Terminator Salvation was. Overall, its just as weak and superficial as the poster.",Focus
118,vistheindian,Lost a little focus,6,1 March 2015,"Quickie Review:Nicky (Will Smith), a professional con man comes across Jess (Margot Robbie) who he thinks has a lot of potential. After an abrupt end to their relationship, their paths cross again while Nicky plans his latest scheme. Only this time Nicky might just lose his focus on the job. With two charismatic actors taking the lead, Focus had the perfect casting for a potentially exciting con film. There are certainly things to like about this movie. However, apart from the acting talent and the initial intrigue behind the schemes, the movie as whole has trouble excelling beyond an acceptable level of mediocrity.Full Review:With Will Smith and Margot Robbie starring, Focus seemed like a promising con movie with some good amount of drama. You see that promise at the outset, but as the movie unfolded I started to lose sight of that potential.I have always liked Will Smith as an actor, not including the charisma vacuum that he was in After Earth of course (though that movie had multitude of other problems). As for Margot Robbie, this is her chance to move away from the great supporting role in The Wolf of Wall Street and take a leading role. They are definitely the best part about the movie with good chemistry together on screen. Since they are both talented con artists, it was interesting to see who was manipulating who (whom? Grammar Nazi away in the comments). The most exciting part of the movie was the first half when you are just starting to learn how Nicky leads his team of con men and women. I enjoyed seeing them pull off all the tricks and deceptions on the job. Then again you know the phrase ""too much of a good thing,"" well that's exactly what Focus suffered from.The latter half of the movie starts to become a series mini reveals on who and how someone is being mislead. An example of a movie that handles a heist or a con better is Ocean's Eleven. In this example the movie concentrates on the characters and the team dynamic. You are shown majority of the plan without ever suspecting there are alternative objectives being hidden from you. So when the big reveal happens it is immediately impactful because you weren't even thinking about it. On the other hand, Focus is constantly barraging you with scenes that scream ""look how manipulative we can be!"" You can never trust the actions being taken by the characters causing you to regularly question everything. As a result the movie becomes extremely distracting because you start to break down every scene to see what was authentic.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Focus
119,CowherPowerForever,It's about Distraction. It's about Focus.,7,11 March 2015,"Focus is the newest Will Smith movie, and with his recent track record many moviegoers will likely stay away from this film. However, Focus is actually a fun film with many twists and turns. The acting is excellent, and the movie is an overall joy, though it is not perfect by any means. The following is my review of Focus.The film was written by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who are known for writing such films as Bad Santa and I Love You Phillip Morris. The film follows master conman Nicky(Will Smith) as he plans on making some big money conning at an American Football event similar to the Super Bowl(the term Super Bowl nor any NFL trademarks are actually used in the film). Along the way to this big event he runs into Jess(Margot Robbie), and she desperately wants in on this big con job Nicky has planned. As I mentioned above this film has some excellent twists and turns, so I really don't want to get into deep details of the story. The film continues over the course of the next few years, ending with a really good climax. Ficarra and Requa deliver a good story, but it does have it's issues. For example some of the twists are so absurd that you wonder if they simply pulled them out while shooting the ending. It seems thrown together rather loosely. Without the proper buildup the film had, this film would have fallen at or below an average film. Overall though Ficarra and Requa do a good job on this film, and most should enjoy this story.The film was also directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa. Both of these directors worked in the past on films like I Love You Phillip Morris and Crazy, Stupid, Love. The film is not some big action film like many of the films Will Smith tends to do. Though it does interject some much needed comedy, and Smith is excellent at delivering this in that aspect. The film is shot wonderfully and looks amazing on the big scene, though I can't honestly say that there is a wow moment that makes this a must see in theaters. The acting is also another major aspect that this film excels at. Will Smith and Margot Robbie work fabulously together, and their chemistry only grows throughout the film. This is a good sign for their upcoming film they are working together on. Anyway, even the secondary actors like Brennan Brown, BD Wong, Gerald McRaney, and Adrian Martinez are such a joy to watch, and I would have to say BD Wong steals the show in his big scene of the film. So really watch out for that one. The directors really did a fabulous job with these talented actors, and they really deserve much credit in that aspect. Overall Ficarra and Requa do a fabulous job in the directing department, and really makes me look forward to their future outings as directors.The film was composed by Nick Urata who worked with Glenn Ficarra and John Requa in the past on Crazy, Stupid, Love and more recently worked on the 2014 film Paddington. His work on this film is not that impressive at all. It seems like a go through the motions type of score. Urata's score doesn't add much depth at all to the film, and since I'm someone who really enjoys the score aspect of a film, this is a big disappointment here. I cannot honestly say the score was bad or awful, but it was average at best.In closing, Focus is a fun film with an overall good story even if the story gets absurd at times. The film is shot great, and the acting is top of the line from all the stars of the film. Since I watched this film at a matinée showtime spending only five dollars, I would have to say it was well worth the money seeing this in theaters. If you aren't lucky enough to see this film for a cheap price, then the best thing to do is wait for home video where this film is a must own.7/10",Focus

The last 15 minutes of the film pushed it a little bit too much for me and undid a lot of the rest of the film.

121,C-Younkin,Smith and Robbie are terrific in sexy romantic thriller,7,27 February 2015,"Those that had to get Fifty Shades of Grey out of their system did so on opening weekend. Those who were curious did so the following weekend. Those that are going this weekend are probably just going to be drunks and guys who wear trench coats a lot (even in summer). We need a new adult romance now and Focus fits the bill, and also puts way more of an emphasis on the word ""adult"". It's also a return to form for Will Smith, looking for a boost after that After Earth debacle in 2013. He's still every bit the playa we want him to be in a movie directed by Glenn Ficcara and John Requa (Crazy, Stupid, Love) that has a stylish sexiness in almost every scene.Smith plays Nicky, the kind of confident, well dressed mystery man who doesn't seem to mind eating at a fancy restaurant alone. He's approached by Jess (Margot Robbie), they get to talking, and soon they're both going back to his hotel room. It's a con but Jess is an amateur, leading to a scene of sly humor that Smith plays to perfection. But Jess wants to learn how to ""dance in the dark"" as Nicky puts it and so after learning a few tricks from him, she follows him to New Orleans where she finds herself a member of his team of pickpockets. Through sleight of hands and various scams, Nicky has a whole network of people focusing on gambling, credit card fraud, tricking adulterous married dudes and more. They clean up, which is part of the fun.This movie is all about being smooth and it revels in that almost as much as it does in the beauty of its two stars and the vibrancy of the place they're in. New Orleans, from Mardi Gras to a casino to the Superdome, supplies a perfect backdrop as these two get frisky and flirty with each other. They have great chemistry, it's sexy but shows just the right amount of restraint for two people who are into each other but can't risk distraction in their line of work. By far the best scene in the movie though comes when Nick bets with an Asian businessman (an excellent B.D. Wong) during a football game. It's crazy just how out of control it gets and it ends awesomely.The movie can only go downhill from a scene as audacious as this and it does. Nicky and Jess suddenly go separate ways only to reunite three years later in Argentina where Nicky is helping out a grand prix owner (Rodrigo Santoro) that Jess just happens to be dating. Do these two share real feelings or is one or both just playing the other? Who knows, but we're pretty sure that Ficarra and Requa lose the playful spark between these two in Argentina and there's an ending plot twist that I'm not sure really works. Gerald McRaney has a few good scenes as a hard-ass, suspicious bodyguard here but it's Smith, playing a guy with a gift of gab, and Robbie, a beauty with not just a great smile but also poise, charm, and humor, who keep Focus afloat even when the movie doesn't seem quite sure of itself.",Focus
122,nzswanny,"Stylish and fun, however Margot Robbie ruined the second half.",7,13 August 2017,"I would of rated the film a 9 if it just continued in the first half as a good, flashy, stylish and intelligent film but the second half then turned the film into another horrible Mr And Mrs Smith all because of Margot Robbie and Will Smith's romance. I was cautious about rating this film as high as I did at first, but then I decided that I would because the first half was so good, but the second half was a real stinker and deserved a 5. The film had so much potential at the start but then just slipped off the rails, I guess, and I never actually thought that I could of felt this way for a movie before. The cinematography could of also been a lot better, but because the editing is so good, the humour is funny and the fact that the first half was genius I think I will say that I enjoyed this.

The movie Focus has BOTH Wong AND Santoro, which makes it even more irresistible. And as a bonus, the leads are played by Will Smith and Margot Robbie, who also deliver engaging performances although their talents are wasted here. The two Oscar nominees are not challenged to act other than simply be charming. The writing is sharp and sexy, although the story is clearly a far-fetched one. This flick is meant to be mere entertainment, so don't bother wracking your mind trying to make too much sense of the plotting.

125,malcp,Twisting the time away,6,28 February 2015,"Polished, professional performances, but the twist lacks the punch of ""The Sting"", the drama of ""Ocean's Eleven"" or even the humour of ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"". Ultimately, we need to care for someone at the end who doesn't seem to have any redeeming qualities and I didn't buy it. From the start, it's clear that this will be a twist in the tale drama, and our sympathies focus on Jess (played by Margot Robbie), an out-of-her-depth con-artist who foolishly targets Nicky, a master con-artist (played by Will Smith). Without giving too much away, for this film to really work, we need to love and care about both characters and their relationship with each other right up to the end of the film. Unfortunately for the twists to work, one of them has to completely betray the other more than once. It would be incredulous for any relationship to survive this, and one of this pair is too nice for us to really forgive the other. The story really wants to be too clever, and in striving to surprise us, also hopes we'll overlook an implausible, unbreachable divide to buy into it's happy ending. It's not an unenjoyable romp, but in the end I think that makes it a twist to far.",Focus
126,MovieSonic,Outstanding romcom,8,12 May 2015,"All romcoms have a hook and with Focus that hook is con artistry. As a pure 'con' film, I would have rated it slightly lower due to the superficial con scenarios and over-the-top premise but when judged as the genre it is at heart, the film exceeds expectations.This is the perfect romcom for everybody; there's a beautiful woman (who is funny and endearing), a stunning man (who is also funny and acting for his life), the jokes come hard and fast and the script manages to maintain the prerequisite level of romcom predictability while delivering clever twists along the way. Bonus: it's not an obvious romcom i.e. there are no cringeworthy or sappy moments.The two leads, Will Smith and Margot Robbie, don't necessarily have that undeniable chemistry that makes them instantly believable as soulmates but both actors have so much likability and charm that I found myself rooting for them straight away. I loved that we saw them developing a bond (as opposed to just looking into each other's eyes and 'knowing') and there's a lot of intelligence to the romance aspect; we see them have a friendship and interact on a level which explains why they care about each other and therefore, why we should too.No matter how silly, I did enjoy all of the cons, much like in Now You See Me (2013). I probably enjoyed Focus a little bit more than that film as Focus had more...well...focus! In the sense that, there's always a sense of purpose and control i.e. nothing ever becomes too convoluted.I enjoyed the ending too, there's nothing new here but there was a nice little twist and overall, I felt like it was a well-spent hour and half.Worth noting: Having watched so many films, I often 'drift' and when I return I find I haven't missed much and don't care to check if I have. On the two occasions where my mind wandered, I found myself frantically rewinding as there are so many clever and/or hilarious one liners that I didn't want to miss even one. Also, the trailer didn't spoil all the best bits. In fact, I think they went for understated appeal which beats overhyping any and every day of the week in my book.Highly recommended 8/10",Focus
127,KATO-SUBZERO,"Good con movie, Multi Racial upgrade of ""The Sting""",9,13 December 2015,"I saw ""Focus"" in the movie theater and later on cable. Will Smith did a good job and The Australian cutie, Margot Robbie work really well together. They should do a sequel to this movie. It is a modern day ""Sting"" that starred Robert Redford, Paul Newman, Robert Shaw and co-starred Harold Gould. However the only non white actor in that movie was actor, James Earl Jones' real life dad, Robert Earl Jones in a small supporting role.This version ""Focus"", I liked for several reasons. 1 The multiracial cast with Asians and Hispanics in supporting roles. 2. I especially love that art imitates real life with the interracial love between Will Smith and really cute, Margot Robbie. They have really good chemistry together.All the scenes in the football stadium was right on the money. I too thought he was going to lose it all at the game. The only part that I did Not get was Gerald McRaney playing his dad until it was announced in the end and even then I was not sure, if Will's character was his adopted son, real son or just some young man, he was to look after and he loved like a son.I give this movie two thumbs up and a 9 on the scale of 1-10.",Focus

131,kieranbattams,Seeing Focus will not be a con,7,1 March 2015,"Will Smith and Margot Robbie (especially Margot Robbie) are two of the most attractive actors today and here we have them in their first film together, Focus. I didn't know a lot about the film going in, I knew the basic plot line but my expectations weren't high and like most people the thing that did draw me to see it was the main stars who I think are two of the best in the acting business, Will Smith always has been one of my favourite actors and since I saw The Wolf of Wall Street I knew Margot Robbie was someone to look out for, and both do great in the film in their own right.The film follows Nicky (Will Smith) who is an accomplished con-artist and Jess (Margot Robbie). Focus opens on her attempt to con Nicky, but because he is in the same trade this fails as to be expected. She asks him to teach her the tricks of the con trade, however falls in love with him, when he breaks it off they meet again after three years and he realises what he lost back then. There is more to the plot than that but that is where we venture into spoiler territory and I like to keep my reviews spoiler-free. The start is really promising, it was great to watch the cons take place, we were given some incredibly intense sequences. One in particular took place at a football game which really made me feel the heart-racing tension that Will Smith's character was feeling at the time. The film does slow down towards the middle before picking up again which let it down a bit, because it could have been more given the cast and promising start.Whilst there is a lot of good things that I have mentioned, the parts where the film slows down are parts of the film that try to throw twists and turns at you and this didn't work as well as the director was planning on, but you can see that effort was at least put into the film as whole. Of course this film is also marketed as a romance as well so we do get a few scenes where you see the relationship grow between Nicky and Jess, which isn't a bad thing because I don't mind romance movies as long as they are done right. I do sort of even feel that we could have seen more of it, as you buy into these two characters being together and feel like it is a natural thing, that being said after the three year gap that we get, when they do meet again it did almost feel like they hadn't been apart. The chemistry between Margot Robbie and Will Smith is to me surprisingly strong and I really wanted to see them together by the end for the simple fact that they play so damn well off of each other.I enjoyed Focus a lot more than I expected to, loved the cast and it is also beautiful to look at. There is some nice humour as well, a couple scenes had me chuckling and I like to see that sort of unexpected comedy in a film. Was definitely worth a watch and if I caught it on TV in a years time I would give it another watch for sure. Plus it made stealing look so damn stylish. I'm telling you, if Margot Robbie stole my wallet i'm not even sure I would mind just for the fact she makes it look so good.",Focus
132,russellingreviews,Die for the lie,7,5 March 2015,"""It's about distraction. It's about focus."" Nicky SpurgeonWalking into the cinema... Will Smith has been out of the game for awhile. I am not talking about the con game, but the cinematic game. After Earth was an anomaly and the random cameos do not add up to much acting over the past four years. I was looking forward to seeing a new Will Smith film. Overall rating: 3 stars Cinematic value: 3 stars Family value: 2 starsThe touch of the nose, the tip of the hat or the simple wink and you know the con is on. These films have been a key part of cinematic history. Some have successfully tricked us into believing the con and some give away their 'tells' too early. Focus attempts to distract for the sake of entertainment, but falls in the middle of the pack of film con-artistry. Nicky Spurgeon (Will Smith) is at the top of his con-artist trade. Like the artful Dodger of Oliver Twist, the con has been part of his family history. Now he finds himself as a veteran of the game. He decides to to take on a new apprentice, Jess (Margot Robbie), for a set of scams in New Orleans. The success of this series of cons brings the couple to a crossroads in their relationship. Nicky has to decide to stay true to the con or allow his heart to get involved. Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (Crazy, Stupid, Love) have been given a stellar cast, but do not rise to the challenge of pulling off the con. The long con is telegraphed early in the script and diffuses the suspense for the conclusion. They give themselves away too soon and the film had the feel of watching a shell game, but knowing where the ball was the whole time. The script and the direction merely take us along on observing how an effective con should happen instead of showing the inevitable twist. Will Smith is back wisecracking his way through a film, but there is a maturity to his role as the con man. This maturity does not help in Smith's performance. He seems to fail in finding his timing and Margot Robbie comes off as a starstruck fan of Smith. They are an attractive couple, but they lack chemistry on the screen. Smith was been given great lines and his appeal does remain, but the lines some too infrequently for the needed comedic timing. The support cast makes up for the weaknesses in the their relationship. Adrian Martinez (The Secret Life of Walter Mitty) is brilliant as Farhad and their band of con artists add the needed spice to help this tale along. Unfortunately, there were no real surprises which leaves it with a slow, but interesting analysis of the life of con-artists. Even with the poorly executed telling of the life of con-artists, they were put into some beautiful settings, but this was not enough to be convincing as con-artistry or more than a mediocre heist film. In the end, the direction and cast seem to be distracted by their own motives and in inevitably they lost focus.Interestingly, a key element missing from this film was justice. Their actions seem to go without any challenge or any remorse. Since there were no law officers to add to the tension, the story dragged. But the pacing was a minor drawback, the true effect of this overlooked detail caused an amorality to the film. Minus any remorse or consideration for their actions as illegal minimises the depth of the storyline. Even though the law officials are usually the comic relief through their incompetence, they give a moral element that was missing in Focus. There was a need for light and shade, but this cinematic journey seemed to remain in the shadows and never brought anything into the light. Even with the celebration of the con-artist's conquests, there still needs to the potential for justice for there to be satisfaction in the end. Leaving the cinema: I wanted this film to work for Smith, but in the end all I felt was pick- pocketed. Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What is the Bible's view on theft? (Exodus 20:15, Ephesians 4:28) 2. Is there truly justice in this life? (Proverbs 21:15, Isaiah 30:18) 3. Who can we truly trust?

133,the-fearless-america,Dull drama and incompetent works for an thief intrigues story.,4,18 July 2016,"Well I'm not imputing young director for this bland and nonstriking work. I think the director is just not having much experience to step into grandiose world of Hollywood. He just not making enough movie to contest and this is what will happened.Scenes by scenes which thief techniques showed, it should be more establishing. Director too much focusing on dialogue in those scenes rather than imagery information, maybe he did too much focus you know haha. This movie needs to increase its cuts rather than frames, it needs more cut to cut style so it would be more fast paced and more thrill. Drama seems so bland, in the first place drama not expediently needed in this kind of genre. It only made it inchoate and impaired. Intrigues seems cheap, it ends with Nicky meeting with his father who shot him first because his father don't want get caught. The plan ruined because it coincide with the love story of Nicky. So needless to say, its all about dilemma, the easiest aspect to made a drama was using a dilemma formula.Mediocre movie, one credit only given to Robbie's acting.

135,bob-rutzel-239-525430,It's Okay,7,5 June 2015,"Nicky (Will Smith) is a Con man, who runs a team of about 30 and is very successful. He trains Jess (Margot Robbie) and they get involved for a time, and then Nicky lets her go and then 3-yrs later Jess returns. Let the fireworks begin.This is both a con movie and a love story. Perhaps more of a love story than a con. Okay: both. You get the sense that when Jess comes back that Nicky wants her back. However, whenever you see a movie regarding a con, you just never know what to believe. There are some good lines throughout. Margot Robbie is more than eye-candy and can hold her own with big stars like Will Smith. The chemistry between them only works because Margot Robbie is the one who is the most convincing. Hey, I fell in love (you're too easy).In the beginning, when Nicky is training Jess we see the art of pickpocketing and the choreography is stunning, clever and enjoyable to watch - almost like a symphony in motion. So be careful out there in crowds as pickpocketing can happen to you, too. The best scenes are at the Super Bowl - with made up teams - when Nicky engages Liyuan (B.D. Wong) in a betting game re the players on the field. Here we see the most tension and suspense. Brief trivia for you: Margot Robbie is Australian but doesn't talk (in this movie) like she is from Down Under. However, we see a notable in Robert Taylor who used to be in the TV show Longmire and I didn't know he was Australian as he talked like he came from Down Under. Yeah, shocked (you also shock easily).The ending con was very disappointing for me. It kind of reminded me of a story where the explanations involve an imaginary friend who was really the blame for everything. However, we do see tension and suspense here too and it is here we see the biggest twist.Over all, as I look back on the story, it was okay and the cons were good except for the last one, which I found disappointing (you said that before).

This flick doesn't seem to know if it is a romance, which it isn't, a caper movie, which it really isn't, or a drama which it kinda is.Will Smith is an immoral con man and crook. He is a crook in that he isn't anything more than a petty thief who fishes in deep waters. We are supposed to like him because he takes from fat men, drunks, etc. Problem is he takes from everyone. The total lack of conscience from Smith and his compatriots is stunning. He and his team are remorseless. It is just a business with no concern for its victims. It is presented as a victimless crime in that only high dollar watches and expensive jewelry are mostly the items taken. But regular people lose money and credit cards, too.At least Butch Cassidy and Sundance avoided hurting people.So here we have this soulless schmuck who hooks up with an equally soulless woman who gleefully go about stealing.I won't go into the rest of the movie. It is difficult to care about characters with such sociopathic tendencies.In the end this isn't a movie about some antihero; it is a movie about a narcissistic jerk.",Focus

He, feeling the cold breath of age, pushes the limits of a May/December romance with Ms. Robbie, in more on screen make out sessions than a Friday night at the Satellite Drive In back in high school. I looked for a chap stick product placement but may have missed it during my nap. The plot is more lifeless than the kind found in a cemetery. In general, 'Focus' was so boring that it encouraged the conjugation of obscure Latin verbs, and recalling second cousins. Half the audience left after Will's fifth wander about his hotel room in search of a shirt. I stayed until the bitter end, feeling bitter about the cost in time and money associated with a movie that sails between tedium and apathy to steal a line from 'Mr. Roberts'.

160,One_slice_of_pizza,Meh,5,4 March 2015,"Will Smith had a lot of pressure on his shoulders because of his latest movies flopping big time. Focus was a mile stone in his career and it had to be successful otherwise he was probably going to lose his A star brand.Unfortunately, Focus is most likely another flop at the box office with an open just shy of 20 million. Considering the budget being around 50 mil plus unannounced marketing costs, it will be a loser unless it does extremely well in world wide box office.One of the main reasons of the failure is the problems with the story structure. The movie cannot decide what genre to be and constantly goes in and out of romantic comedy. This causes us to lose ""Focus"" and prevents us from connecting with the story. Although the acting is successful, the roles are not believable. Margot Robbie plays the adorable sweetheart successfully however, her character traits couldn't convince me that she could be a successful con artist that easily. Will Smith, does not look convincing enough as a con artist, as Nicholas Cage or Leaonardo Di Caprio does. I didn't even bite it for one second.These problems along with an uninteresting story line caused me to disconnect from the movie altogether and especially during the 50-60th mark of the movie, I started looking at my watch every few minutes. Focus opens with an interesting scene where we get to meet the lead cast and witness their semi romantic start of their relationship. Robbie is a beauty for sure and a pleasure to watch and her good acting abilities help us wonder what's coming next. The chemistry between Smith and Robbie is not enough and pushes you away from the believability of it. They look awkward together and I can assure you, Will Smith is not the right cast for this role. His performance is too wooden at times and he is having trouble reflecting back the chemistry he gets from Robbie at certain scenes.Focus is aware of the story structure problems so it comes up with a twist after a twist, especially during the final stage to keep things relatively interesting. It does succeed but the unconvincing romantic scenes drag the movie and causes us to feel we are watching a chick flick rather than a con artist movie.Focus is definitely not a ""Catch me if you can"" nor it is ""Matchstick Men,"" it doesn't claim this either. It just tries to be an entertaining heist movie with romantic elements attached to it. It doesn't fail altogether but it doesn't succeed either. One of the things that Focus failed was the most important aspect of a heist movie, the con job. They were not artistic, impressive nor believable. Especially the gambling scene felt far fetched and borderline ridiculous rather than impressive. Also there was no tension built up for the final job and for the sake of a one last plot twist, they decided to make it ""coincidental"" rather than planned which was a huge mistake. A heist movie is known for its tension. Ocean's Eleven is all about the job along with lots details and the movie tells us how they are going to pull it off. Focus on the other hand has none of this. This probably was may be the main reason of the failure. There was no tension building up for the one last job. A big mistake the producers felt to see which probably will cost them millions of dollars.Also the movie cannot convince you that Robbie and Smith really has the skills to pull these jobs and you never have this issue with similar movies like Ocean's Eleven or Catch Me If You Can.Overall, Focus is an okay movie which you should just watch on your favorite movie platform instead of going all the way to a movie theater. There's no reason to see it on the big screen.My advice, save your money and give this a pass. Just wait for it to come out on netflix or red box.5/10",Focus

As a lead character, Will Smith did a great job. Margot Robbie was fine aswell and fitted her character ""Jess"" who is a little bit spoiled girl and a hot thief.

Will Smith seems as if he's trying to make this film worth watching.
The soundtrack (with The Rolling Stones and other fantastic old rock songs like that) is too good for this hot garbage.
The cinematography is some of the best of 2015, the only reason this film is not a 1/10.

Smith plays Nicky, a master con artist who's at the top of his game when he meets Jess (the drop-dead gorgeous Margot Robbie), a down-on-her-luck small-time scammer. Nicky initially wants nothing to do with Jess, but her beauty, charms, and persistence pay off and he brings her into his organization of highly skilled con artists and thieves. In an amazingly filmed scene, Smith's band of pickpockets and hustlers proceed to separate a reveling New Orleans Super Bowl tourist crowd of more than one million dollars of their money, jewelry and credit cards. Jess is a quick learner and it's not long before she's one of Nicky's top scammers, it's also not long before the sexual chemistry between the two ignites and they become lovers. However, for Nicky, that's an emotion that a con man can do without. He unceremoniously breaks ties with Jess, who has obviously fallen in love with him. Three years past and Nicky is working on a new scam that could net him millions, when in walks Jess on the arms of the man whom Nicky is working his con. Seeing Jess again has triggers feeling inside Nicky that he has subjugated all his life. He loses his focus and becomes consumed with thoughts of Jess. With millions on the line, as well as his life if he's caught, the last thing he wants is to fall in love. However, it soon becomes the only thing he desires.While Smith has the charm necessary to play a charlatan, it's Margot Robbie who steals the film. Robbie's Jess is the game changer; her emotional roller coaster is the ride that keeps us in suspense. Robbie has the smoldering sex appeal of the old school Hollywood movie stars such as Marilyn Monroe or Jane Russell. Her presence on screen often upstages Smith, and while the story is Nicky's, it's Jess who has won our hearts and in whose story we've become invested.Smith's performance isn't bad, in fact his somber, ""good guy"" persona is what makes him a credible con artists (who wouldn't trust that face?). However, in a film as slick and sexy as this, he often comes off as too subdued, almost dull. You can almost picture smoother actors such as Denzel Washington, Lawrence Fishburne or Terrance Howard having better control of the character. Had Smith or directors Glen Ficarra or John Requa decided to make use of Smith's endearing wit or street charms, I feel the film would have had the prerequisite fire and edge to make it a classic. All in all, Smith still manages to pull off an admirable performance and with Robbie, creates a high-class film, filled with enough suspense, action and twists to keep audiences entertained.",Focus
174,benoit_03,"Fun, flirty rom-'con', just misses reaching that bar.",8,13 March 2015,"There have been many con artist pictures to fill the silver screen over the years, and while this never quite reaches that bar set by the likes of Ocean's Eleven and American Hustle, there's still a sense of uniqueness about this decent attempt by writing-directing duo Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, whose backgrounds include Crazy, Stupid Love and I Love You Philip Morris.We start in New Orleans where Will Smith's master conman Nicky Spurgeon - props to the naming department for that one - meets the stunning Margot Robbie's rookie con Jess, in her failed attempt at playing him. After sympathising for her, he begins to coach her in the art he does best. Both actors have a good turn playing here and are very convincing, and it's a delight to see Smith back in the game, playing a less serious role after a couple of underwhelming films as of late, that's not to say it isn't a delight also to see Robbie up there too and getting more into the mainstream after Wolf of Wall Street.It takes a steady narrative that is, thankfully, interrupted by a suspenseful 10 minute segment that takes place at a football stadium which, save for the closing scenes, makes for some of the most 'I don't trust her, oooh now I don't trust him' second-guessing in a film for some time. Numerous twists and turns in the plot keep the pace going, most of which is never even seen coming.Ultimately, the on screen chemistry between Smith and Robbie, twists and turns and a few cheap thrills thrown in for good measure, leave you with an enjoyable and entertaining experience, but not one deep enough to linger for long.",Focus

176,MediaPanther,"Interesting mix of crime, romance, suspense and comedy",7,26 February 2015,"Throwing his hat into the ring of the con artist sub genre, Will Smith stars as Nicky Spurgeon in Focus. These types of film are never easy to do well because like a magic trick, the audience has to always be in the dark. Or to put it another way, the film (or magician) has to be one step ahead of the audience. If you know it's a magic trick or some type of confidence game going on, you might try to figure everything out instead of just going with it. In the case of Focus, the reveal is a pretty good one.With that being said, if you are a fan of Will Smith then that's great. Some people think it's hard to think of him as a character and not as himself. So be it, then in this case you have Margot Robbie (The Wolf of Wall Street) to scrutinize as well. She comes along early in the film as a would be, up and coming grifter that insists on learning the finer points from Nicky. She's a quick learner and soon becomes part of his crew and more. This is where things get fuzzy because you're unsure if everyone is on the up and up.The filmmakers that brought you Crazy, Stupid, Love have assembled a fine cast (Rodrigo Santoro, Gerald McRaney, BD Wong) that take on interesting and integral parts of this jigsaw. It would be a shame not to mention Adrian Martinez as Nicky's main man Farhad. If Focus is considered a Ro-Com, then Martinez is definitely the comic relief. Robbie's performance should not go unnoticed by any stretch either. Although she's still a newcomer and not hard to look at, she more than holds her own with a blockbuster star of Smiths caliber. One can only hope that she doesn't get pigeonholed as the bombshell girlfriend/wife, etc.Focus is an interesting mix of romance, crime, suspense, comedy, formula one racing, football, New Orleans and Buena Aires.

180,misterphilipj,Weak from start to finish,4,4 March 2015,"One of the weakest crime syndicate movies I've ever seen. I know most crime films like fast and furious aren't really that believable, but they do a good job with ""suspension of disbelief"" so you don't sit there questioning the events that you are watching. This movie for some reason never did that for me, I kept seeing things and thinking they were too far fetched. Also the acting from the main actress in the beginning was terrible. Her performance got better as the film progressed, but this also spoiled it for me. I suspect the directors told her to act that way because she matured throughout the film along with her better acting. Also the chemistry or lack-thereof between Will Smith and her never really clicked for me. What really made me dislike the film the most was that I felt like I saw two movies in one. Instead of a subplot or subplots going on there is just a first half and a second half. The continuity between parts A and B were not well connected, causing me to daydream during the film and think about other distractions in my life such as what I needed to do after the movie ended, which rarely happens to me during a movie. The lack of comedic relief was also something that this movie needed which it lacked. The only jokes were toilet and sex jokes, which were poorly delivered. I've loved all of Will Smith's movies up until this one, stay away.",Focus

This was a stylish, different and a very creative kind of movie. It takes us into the world of con artists and the creative ways they get away with crime. This was very entertaining the whole way through and has a cast of very colorful characters. The character of Farhad had me laughing at every scene he was in and the stunningly beautiful Margot Robbie gave an excellent performance as she usually does. And of course, the King of Cool, Will Smith is slick and charming as ever. This is an excellent comeback after the disasters that were After Earth and Winter's Tale.

183,CoolKid23,Never knew Will Smith was this good.,10,28 February 2015,"I gave this movie a 10 for the simple reason that this was a slow paced movie and still managed to excite and make you not lose interest. How many movies in history are capable of that? The answer is not many. Will Smith transforms into an extremely believable con man making it look easy. Robbie was sexy and stunning and and her acting continues to shine bright. The entire tone of this movie was so balanced that it really does not take effect until the movie is over and you are able to stabilize your thoughts and come to the conclusion that you just watched a darn good movie. I thought this would be a copy of like Oceans 11 but I as wrong on some many levels. I am happy to say that Focus is very much it's own movie. Forget about After Earth because really that was a movie made to target a younger audience. This movie is the first showing of what the grown up version of Will Smith looks like. He's daring and cunning all with the same charisma he has always had. There is no need to ask anymore if Will Smith can act. He did a movie that was not in his comfort level and he nailed it proving that Will Smith is not this ghost of a man that does not exist, but he is very real and he continues to grow as an actor. I am convinced that any movie starring Will Smith is worth watching. I hate Wild Wild West but somehow I watch it every time it comes on TV because Will Smith will reel you in not matter how much you try to get away.",Focus
184,imaadnabil,Excessively Stylish,3,13 December 2015,"If you are in the mood for a heist/con film with a classy style, I recommend 'The Italian Job'. It is perfect when you want to watch a good film in a relaxed mood. 'Focus' is quite the opposite. It is overly-sexualized, and quite frankly, the storyline is completely muddled. Random relationships fly out of nowhere and whilst starting quite light-heartedly, it becomes disastrously awkward. The first half-an-hour of the film is actually promising, but as the relationship between Margot Robbie and Will Smith develops from nothing at all, the film loses focus (pun intended :)). This film should only be watched if you leave your brain elsewhere; and even then it is not worth the watch. 3.0/10",Focus
185,onetogrowon,Requiem for Mr. Smith,1,15 March 2015,"The plot of Focus is predictable, the characters shallow, stereotyped and banal, but the unpardonable sin; Focus is not interesting. I like Will Smith and have enjoyed many of his movies, but there are limitations. The most evident limitation is that he needs at least an average co-star as his counterpart. In other words, even his broad shoulders cannot carry the entire weight of a movie successfully. Mr. Smith, like most mortals, needs a modicum of assistance for success.Mr. Smith is not entirely innocent is the disappointment that is Focus, but while lackluster, his performance is satisfactory and based on previous performances, his talent for clever and lusty scenes is unquestioned. The responsibility, for this cinematic failure, lies at the feet of sloppy writing and boring casting.Margot Robbie's performance was uninspired. Her one dimensional, mean sorority girl persona, lacked passion. The bedroom scenes between Ms. Robbie and Mr. Smith were common, at best. It must be assumed that her inability to reach any depth of character was overlooked, because of standardized, unoriginal beauty. Focus is not worth watching, save your money and your time.",Focus

187,jbrowning-w,Twists and Turns Trick and Titillate the Technical Encheplon (brain),8,29 May 2015,"Focus may not be the best film to have graced the screen but it is by far one of the most underrated films I have ever encountered. The plot was intricate and well devised. Will Smith finally impressed me as I have not been particularly happy with him since After Earth. I was prepared to be happy with his acting as I needed him to be picking up since he has Suicide Squad coming up.Margot Robbie was sensational (in every sense) and kept me gripped to her character from the first second to the last. Will Smith and Margot Robbie's chemistry is strange but surprisingly fitting to their characters. The rest of the actors were nothing special but they seemed good next to these two stunningly, spectacularly sensational actors who broke rank throughout the film.The plot to the film is dependent on the intelligence of the plays the characters undertake. The plot jumps from one point to another with a three year gap in between. The movie starts with a grifter group, led by Will Smith's Nicky, going through every con in the book on New Orleans. There is quickly a addition to the team when Margot Robbie's Jess joins the group. A natural born con artist and natural born beauty, Jess presents herself again in Nicky's life but three years later. I would say that you keep a little bit unsettled as you settle with the story in New Orleans and then you jump three years later. The pace is good but the set up and structure is a bit out of sync.The script is uneven but the times when it is well done it can be enjoyed and when it is not well done you just have to deal with the problem of the fact that the dialogue is jumping from one point to another and feels unnatural. The screenplay may be a bit off at some points but I did enjoy the storyline to the point that it made the film very well paced.To summarise, Focus was good and enjoyable but was not the best film I have ever watched. I am most happy with Will Smith and Margot Robbie breaking rank against the other actors. The story was clever and the ending to both of the two main parts where clever and well thought out. If it was not for the bad structure to the film and the uneven writing the film would be even better.+acting: smith and Robbie were brilliant and had a good dynamic.+Story: the concept behind the story and the characters is the most interesting in the whole film.+ending: the ending was enjoyable and fitting to the rest of the film.-Screenplay: uneven and jumpy in places.-structure: badly presented which lead to me losing interest in the film.Rating:Acting;8Story;9Screenplay;7Plot;8Pace;9Ending;9Music;7Overall;8.2/10",Focus

I find a lot of the characters to be stupid and only a few to be actually ''funny''. The movie left me hungry for more, i was not expecting amazing things, to be honest i went to see this movie, mostly for Margot and Will's comeback, good acting, as i said Margot looks amazing but this is just not what you expect from Will. 6/10! i'd recommend this movie for everyone just for the OST and Margot, but only when it comes on DVD.

191,kari-lh,The Toledo panic button didn't really work after all,7,17 August 2015,"Focus is a very enjoyable movie. It takes you on a fast paced journey through a life of a professional criminal with many unforeseen twists along the way. The plot itself is a rather simple one. The characters are pretty straight forward and the twists are easy to follow once they are revealed, at least up until the end. This is basically a great popcorn movie, which keeps you interested throughout the whole story.The best thing about this movie is that it runs smoothly and keeps you entertained at all times. That is because of it's superb editing. It lets you follow a certain character's view as different events unfold. That makes the story flow really and easy to connect with.What this film lacks is proper character development. You don't really get to know Nick, the main protagonist. The only real thing we know about him is that he is a gambler by instinct. Other than that, we only know that he is a tough criminal who had a bad childhood and has a soft spot for beautiful women. We don't really know about his past or former jobs. Same with Jess, we hardly know anything about her. To fix this the movie had to be longer. It wouldn't have made it boring adding 15 - 25 minutes in character development.The main theme of this movie is the twists. Their point is always to surprise the audience. The biggest twist however is not the ending but the constant struggle between Nick and Jess. Their relationship always bounces between being true and false. The climax is the end where their status is finally revealed along with the movie's second biggest twist. The twists always manage to surprise you. They are in no way cliché and have a clever plot to them. They are however often very far stretched, especially at the end. The biggest problem about them is that they don't leave an evidence trail before they happen. The evidence is explained after the twist has happened, so the viewer has no prior knowledge of them. In order to not only surprise you but to amaze you, these kind of twists have to have breadcrumbs of evidence before they happen. So when the twist unfolds, you are not only surprised but amazed that you didn't see it coming, just like the victim itself.Spoilers: After the final twists were unfolded in the ending I was a bit shocked at the path they choose. I found it interesting but I couldn't help to be a little unsatisfied once the shock wore off. I expected more. It simply didn't quite add up to me. The Toledo panic button was a cheap finish after all. It felt like an unnecessary trick. There had to be an easier way out of it. The events prior to the emergency stunt didn't fit into the ending. Although I couldn't really accept his dad's character it was Jess who really bugged me. Did she really go through all this effort just to get revenge and then not tell him about it once they were together? The problem with the ending is as I mentioned earlier is the lack of planted evidence. The twists are explained after they happen instead of being explained before they happen. For that sake, what we see prior to the events doesn't add up to the outcome, at least in our minds. The ending twist does have clever aspects to it however but I feel it didn't quite deliver properly. Focus is by no means a masterpiece and probably won't become a classic. It still has it moments and manages to be unpredictable all the way to the end. It's both fun and entertaining which makes it an ideal popcorn movie. It is fun to watch but won't leave much behind.",Focus

The viewer is then left with typical he-knew-all-along cons, mixed with random shots of luck that could have been planned out, leaving everyone with events that don't match the characters' pretended omniscience.If the movie doesn't believe in its own tricks, neither can the audience.

198,joekanuck,Pretty just ain't enough...,2,1 March 2015,"This movie was terrible... so terrible I walked out, something I have done maybe a half a dozen times in my life. Sure, it looked good, as did the main characters, (though Will looked old when he was trying to put on a 'serious actor' face) The sad fact is, he can't do drama. He has two characters; Fresh Prince and the Men in Black guy. He can do those guys well if he has strong enough fellow actors to balance out his shtick. In this case, the other main character can't act either, so we ended up with 2 pretty people trying to organize their faces into realistic expressions... and failing miserably. Margot Robbie is absolutely stunning. She makes Barbie look like a 60 year old plumber. She does a great job of distracting the audience with her looks, but looking hot is about all the depth she can handle. In contrast, the supporting cast was quite good, and their performances were the only reason I stuck around as long as I did. They randomly appeared throughout the movie with little impact on the plot. It's almost if the director(s) accidentally hired a bunch of actors then couldn't figure out what to do with them.This movie really could have done with some light hearted banter from the main characters, but they wanted to aim for gravitas... and missed the mark by a mile. It was almost painful to watch. Neither the characters or their scams were realistic or believable in the least. As someone else said; I really wanted to like this move...but it turned out to be a gigantic waste of my time and 12 bucks. At least the popcorn was good. Learn from my mistake; just say no.",Focus

They say anything can happen in the movies, but unfortunately this amazing quality sometimes can take us out of the movie as fast as it can leave us with some timeless moments, for Will Smith's new film, focus this is just the case. Despite how charismatic Will Smith is, his performance in this was just a rehash of his same punk attitude and quick whitted one liners that I did not find funny. The writing in this movie was bad. I feel like they tried to throw in these ridiculous stats to make it believable but it just made it stupid. The chemistry between Margot Robbie and Will Smith was stale and bland, Which makes me a worried about Suicide Squad even more. This film really did not impress me, but I will say this, the general story line minus the BS stats, the poor performances, and the chemistry between Robbie and Smith kept me wanting to stay and find out if it was as predictable as I thought it was, which it is with one twist at the end that I didn't see coming. If you are a fan of either actor I could see how you could dig this movie, or if you looking to watch some mindless fun with absolutely no substance, I could also see how someone could like this. Me personally, I compare some of these theatrics to Steven Seagal using a two liter bottle as a silencer, just over the top stupidity that I didn't find fun at all. I give focus a 4 out of 10.

Of course a few humor here and there is always required for a film to be successful and this movie perfectly delivered on it.

203,arnoramon,"Focus Review by Arno Ramon - Ingenious Cons, too much Love",6,3 April 2015,"""Focus"" is a 2015 Blockbuster Movie starring Will Smith and newcomer Margot Robbie.Will Smith plays a con-artist named Nicky. First 20 minutes of the movie they play the short-con, meaning robbing as many people as possible in the least amount of time. This delivers some fun and high-pitch scenes which make you wanna steal your neighbors"" wallet. Character Jess, played by Margot Robbie gets introduced in the plot as being a gorgeously good-looking woman desperate to get in the short-con game. The movie continues but slows down the pace a little as the focus shift to the long-con. This is a great angle as it covers a large portion of the con-artist genre's spectrum, which reminds me of TV-Series like 'Hustle'.Will Smith's acting is great, as he proves again to be worthwhile and entertaining to watch. Margot Robbie does a fine job in convincing she's a deceitful and seductive force to be reckoned with.As much as I enjoyed the con-scenes which were delicately developed, the love-side-story put me off. I would've loved to see more on the insides of the con-artist world rather than the successful guy gets beautiful girl angle.All in all, I enjoyed watching this movie and do not regret having spent my hard-earned cash to view it in the cinema.

I just hope it was mine.First of all, I really hated that one of the main characters was everything that Will Smith is... because I'm not Will Smith, yet.Second of all, I don't even know her name, I didn't even know she is in FOCUS... but she did get my undivided attention, at times, all the time... probably for sure.The next of all, we should really be careful to steal, and let stolen, only what is of value to us... maybe just because no one will miss that, and will cherish it for all it represents to us.The last of all, one should make sure something is stolen before the movie ends... as I definitely was so much so, even more so because I knew everything that was going on... I mean, almost everything... probably - let's say 42 out of 55, mas o menos, as Buenos Aires is a nice country... and so much more, as less is all about that.P.S.

208,neilbenammar,A heist/caper extravaganza that ultimately fails to rely on the charm of its stars to deliver a comprehensive storyline- with a lack of depth.,6,21 March 2015,"Have we witnessed the emergence of a new film star? Focus stars the slick Will Smith and the striking Margot Robbie in this dark comedy - that could have been something special. First and foremost, this film juggles with different genres. At its core it is a gritty heist/crime- comedy mimicking Ocean's 11. The humor is mostly hit and miss but it is entertaining enough to keep us invested in the plot. The real issue with Focus is that throughout its lengthy 104-minute runtime, it divides itself into two separate films. Let me elaborate- Focus, delivers a palpitating first hour, so enthralling it was truly reminiscent of the Ocean's trilogy. In the first act- we are immersed into the fascinating art of deception and thievery with such style and finesse. Director Glenn Ficarra masterfully captures the essence of the con-artist universe, showcasing Will Smith as this seasoned and chic con-man planning a large-scheme of sorts at a Super Bowl-like event. Nicky meets Jess Barrett(Margot Robbie) at a hotel, where Jess tries to seduce Nicky by using her charm and a minor con- involving her fake-husband, to steal from him. This might sound complicated at first but it perfectly introduces us into the mind-set and personality of both characters. The attraction between Nicky and Jess is the driving force behind the somewhat convoluted plot line and is perhaps one of the only elements that function's well in the narrative. The master- apprentice dynamic could only work with co-stars that have a viable rapport. Margot Robbie and Will Smith play off each other to perfection as their characters try to separate business and pleasure. Banter usually comes across quite cliché in films like this but both actors do a terrific job at selling their unconventional partnership. The romance aspect of Focus falls short in trying to convince the audience that what they are seeing is actually real. Both Jess and Nicky have their own personal agendas -understandable, but why does nothing backfire- they always seem to get away with whatever they are plotting against each other. This grows tiresome and really becomes detrimental to the storyline.All in all, Focus does enough to keep us entertained without distinguishing itself from the dense pool of caper flicks that we all grew to love - but that don't leave a lasting imprint on our minds. Focus remains a fashionable and hip entry nonetheless.",Focus

Why can't screenwriters stick with plausible story lines instead of interjecting nonsense? Robles character ostensibly shows up in second act to steal a watch and then uses cliché excuses to avoid becoming intimate with her mark. This just seemed silly and inane.

This is not a movie you watch when you expect something big, it is just a really fun drama with scents of comedy that doesn't really teach you anything, you just have fun watching it. I loved Margot Robbie in this movie, i couldn't imagine anyone else in this role, mostly because her character has that something special, that feminine vibe that goes well with her beauty and personality. And will smith... I won't even get started with him...he is a very very good actor and i like all his work.In conclusion, it is a good movie to watch but don't go to the cinema expecting something mind-blowing, it is just good.",Focus

They steal from ordinary people and relish that fact, referring to victims as 'suckers'.OK then, this must be a serious caper movie in the vein of The Grifters? The kind of caper movie where you're supposed to hate the lead characters and everyone comes to a sticky end? Well, no. The film just isn't bleak enough. Largely absent are gratuitous lashings of realistic violence; overly profane language and there are no dark overtones.When we finally come to the consequence of the lead characters actions it's a weak conclusion.

I don't want to lay the blame with Smith or Robbie, who both do good work here. The issue has to do with construction. Simply put, the script fails to sell us on the movie's central romance, which appears to boil down to ""you're fun to hang out with and to screw, so of COURSE we're soulmates."" Without the foundation of a believable (or even comprehensible) relationship, this movie ends up being empty.

Usually afflicts viewers after seeing ""The Sixth Sense"" and subsequently wanting to be the first one to ""get it."" To be fair, Focus isn't the first movie to be a victim of ""Shyamalan-ism."" Every movie directed by M. Knight Shymalan since the Sixth Sense has been a victim of it. The Oceans 11 trilogy was a victim of this, as were many more movies I'm sure you can think of.The problem with Focus isn't that the viewer spends the entire time trying to figure out if there is a plot twist and if so, what it is. The problem with Focus is that it assumes the viewer will do this, so the writers try to ""trick"" the audience. However, it is done in a way that indicates to the viewer that the writers are aware of their detective skills which therefore forces the viewer to second guess his/her initial prediction and make another.Are you focused yet? The movie screams for the viewer to focus, which plays to its detriment rather than it's charm.Smith and Robbie have great chemistry and deliver great performances despite the over thought plot which starts as interesting and then unravels in the third act.It is definitely worth a watch and has moments of entertaining quality.In the end though, ""Shyamalan-ism"" leaves the viewer feeling unsatisfied and wanting more from the plot that is so frail it's practically a ghost itself.",Focus

Would Cruise/Clooney have been better? Maybe, but its marginal. Margot was great in the her role and I can't really fault her performance.When you think casting is the best part of the film and script writing is the worst you've got a stinker on your hands - and that's what we have here.Someone saw Derren Brown do his stage show with the classic misdirection, the subtle implanting of subconscious thoughts and then pitched up this premise to the studios. Actually not a bad synopsis but boy did they eff it up.I used to enjoy watching stupid people make fools of themselves by trying to be smart, but nowadays its just bugs me - in fact it somehow bores me yet at the same time begins to send me into a rage! How can I begin bored and then have 200 blood pressure?The entire American Football scene drove me potty. I majored in Maths but my 13 year daughter immediately questioned the economics - its that obvious. It really is. And from handing over and counting cash he's suddenly given a vast credit line. Why?I know you fans out there are saying 'Take a chill pill' but why don't the script writers just do their job?Now for the finale. OK, for the first time in the film I was a little surprised - most 'twists' are about as subtle as a plane crash - and was wondering where we were going but after the big reveal I'm just left fuming. Why? Why did they go to all this trouble? There are a thousand ways to have done it. I just wanted to shout at the screen - why are you so effing stupid?I know I've railed the scrip writers here, but I've met a few in my life and none of them have been idiots, in fact they have all, without exception, been very intelligent so I'm guessing the film has been deliberately dumbed down.And that, I'm afraid, is my take on this movie.

The plot is a double-edged sword on the one side it's absolutely entertaining and unpredictable and with all its twists totally adding to the coolness of this movie, but on the other side many reviews criticize the ""obvious"" plot holes. Still I could enjoy the movie very much, cause the plot holes never actually happen on screen. Everything that is going on does make sense and the characters are well drawn. Problematic is everything that happens off-camera. Basically Nicky controls and knows waaaay to much to be realistic what so ever, and the moves rarely get explained in detail. It suggest that the characters are just good at what they do. Also the unpredictability of the plot lives of its unrealistic nature. Still the plot is highly unlikely, but never impossible.Well this is the only weakness of this movie, but should the plot really be adjusted to get realistic?

When the movie was over I was left trying to sort out what didn't make sense vs what the director tried to cover up by adding more twists and punches, much like someone trying to hide a lie by telling a bigger one.What saved it from being a waste of 1h40 was Margot Robbie's charisma, Will Smith just played his own self but was enough for both actors to show convincing chemistry.For a movie centred around con-artists and their schemes, I was disappointed at the fact that they didn't show the darker and more realistic side of these criminal underworld organizations. In fact nothing portrayed in the movie about con games truly is believable. But the movie does a decent job of portraying it all in a fun and stylish way.The movie's intent seems to have been to play with the viewer's intellect and to force audiences to ''focus'' on the brilliancy of the movie's plot.

Smith plays 'Mellow' - short for Marshmellow (which isn't even a thing - they are marshmAllows) - a petty thief/big-ticket con artist.Therein lies the first problem - why someone with the skills and connections required to make multi-million dollar heists, would risk getting pinched for stealing wallets, is beyond me.The New Orleans operation is massive - too big to avoid: a) members keeping their horde, rather than handing it to a fellow criminal; b) someone getting caught and arrested. These criminals all just trust Nicky to fence their gear and give them a fair cut? Riiiight.Margot Robbie is good in the film, but her acceptance into the crew seems a little light - she could be anyone infiltrating their gang. No references - nothing. Just pretty.

Unfortunately it's just one of those films where the magic doesn't happen. I think the basic story is a bit muddled and while the two leads do a good job the material they have to work with just isn't good enough. The characters are not well developed and while there are hints of backstory there isn't enough for the audience to latch on to and start rooting for them. The con aspects are a bit far far fetched and seem to hinge on the premise that if you catch someone's attention with some sort of distraction you can basically relieve them of their wallets, watches, rings, contents of handbag etc. All a bit too silly.

But the thought of seeing the future pairing of Deadshot and Harley Quinn on screen before the 2016 Suicide Squad movie was too tempting to pass up. Sprinkle in that I'm a sucker for heist/con movies, and off to the movies I went.Focus stars Will Smith as con man Nicky who happens upon Jess (Margot Robbie) and teaches her some of what he knows about running a con. In the process, romantic feelings surface between the two of them. Later, while running another con, Nicky runs into a now more experienced Jess and it creates problems both with the con and with his life.I didn't buy into the romantic angle between Nicky and Jess in the movie. The two just didn't seem to really be in to each other and it showed in the film. However, they chemistry between the characters when they would just talk to each other about the con was fantastic. This chemistry is what I'm hoping to see in the Suicide Squad movie. Also, Adrian Martinez was fantastic in the role of Farhad and was by far my favorite character in the film. I could see myself actually hanging out with a person like this, and I actually have as he reminded me of many of my Marine friends with his off-color sense of humor. The addition of Gerald McRaney as Owen was also very well done and he completely sold me on his character. Major Dad is always a win in my books.Major Dad Major F'n Dad! Overall, if you like a good heist movie or if you just want to get a good look at Deadshot and Harley together on screen, then go see this movie.

The charming but not over-the-top humour consistently keeps the story entertaining and by not following the usual structure of a movie this kind, and ultimately the one the trailer promised, it offers something new to the mix.

Short frames, cool results but poor realism And that's what made me feel like the movie authors were only imitating cool conning, not actually knowing anything about it. I expect that soon there will be huge number of goofs listed in the appropriate section. The only scene with real explanation _was_ cool, but it was different and it was only one time, in the beginning...2) The final and major tricks also weren't revealed at all (you can't count the ""explanation"" seriously)So speaking about conning, my ultimate expression from the movie was like ""If the authors were not going to really explain anything, why the hell did they invite me to watch the movie?""Or, in more harsh words, I could say the authors were only capable to imitate really cool con movies, trying to make cool impression but being totally unable to create any basis for it... Like ""Let's make the hero walk through the wall! How will we explain it? Ah... the hell with explanation, we only care about making a cool moment, no matter how we sell it to the viewers!""And the romance/human part of the movie... Maybe some people like it, but Will Smith in this movie is as mighty and as cartoonishly invincible as.... Steven Seagal is in his own movies. No weakness, not a single tough situation for him... But even Seagal at least shows skills, while the hero of the FOCUS is cool just because... just because.",Focus
249,JFitzStudios,Snore-Fest I felt like we were watching a remake of an average movie,2,1 March 2015,"The cinematography was beautiful. The locations, the sets, the wardrobes, the sound, the lighting (very Good), the supporting cast...all was very good. The story (which should be thee MOST important thing) was very average. The Chemistry between the leads was non-existent. It was obvious that they were trying to create an obvious lack of heat. That killed the film. Two usually very good actors, were forced to create an unusually strained and uncomfortable relationship, that didn't ring true for a second, on the big screen.",Focus

In a way it seemed to surround great scenes with ""some other stuff"" but the great scenes and humor kept me from being sorry I showed up. There is a major plot twist at the end, and it was interesting, just not fully fleshed out; and see what you think but I think it contained an error. Will was enjoyable, very easy-breezy (not silly) and cool and funny. He and Margot had excellent chemistry. It can get tricky when the couple is mixed race if the actors themselves appear cautious or nervous about how it will be received. But these two were just a couple in love. I liked that. I really enjoyed Gerald McRaney too. I always wanted more from him and couldn't wait for him to show up again. It wasn't great, but it felt fresh.",Focus
251,pantekhis_iacovos,Never drop the con.,7,12 March 2015,"Focus is a con movie and it's at its best when it's trying to con you into believing you know what is going to happen. The plot unfolds at a steady pace and you are left guessing what is going to follow. There are many twists and it's hard to keep up, as you would expect. The regular cons work best in the first half, when the movie is trying to be fun and entertaining. During the second half of the movie the plot deepens and works around character development. That's when Will Smith and Margot Robbie come to life, they are at their best when they are given more to work with and they keep the movie interesting. However the movie gets caught juggling too many cons which by the end of the movie may feel just a bit flat; but still make for an unexpected and enjoyable finale. Definitely worth watching. PS. The directors did a good job showing the importance of FOCUS in keeping the camera Focused at the right place.",Focus

The costumes, sound, production etc. are all top class. The lead actors are beautiful, and we see enough of both of them to satisfy any gender preference.The problem is the script. It is just plain ... bad. It's predictable and relies on the same clichés throughout. The result is, it's disappointing and the end is, frankly, ridiculous. I'm all about suspending belief while watching a movie, but this is a 'con' movie, not a fantasy movie.Overall, I would say that it's reasonable escapism and worth 105mins of your time. But, wait until you can either see it at a 'cheap' cinema or the DVD has been reduced - which probably won't take long.",Focus

Yes, not by much but at least I was entertained 98% of the time. Oh and honestly there was a bit of a twist and it made me rethink the whole logic of the movie after wards. YUP... go watch the movie, but don't go in with the highest of expectations. and ps. I knew it was going to be an O.K movie after the first 30 minutes.This is my first review and I need 10 lines of text. I'm hoping this will fill the rest of the lines because I really don't want to get into more detail about how much this movie sucked. But since I still need to write more I guess I will. Margot's hair was pissing me off through out most of the movie. #1- She had roots which is pretty normal for us norms because lets face it, most of us can't go to the salon every 3 week. BUT when your in a higher profile movie, make sure your roots are fixed or at least make it look better. #2 Even her hair styles were bothering me. They looked nice face on, but when they got to the side and back profiles they were really untamed and well... how my hair may look like which isn't always good. Lets face it, Shes beautiful so she can pull it off, but come on HAIR PEOPLE ON SET. Step up a little bit.

All around a great movie from beginning to end. Definitely one of my favorite films from will Smith. It's also great to see Margot Robbie in a lead role, not only is she drop dead gorgeous but she can hold her own in a movie like this. Really didn't know what to expect walking into the theater to see it. But I definitely don't regret spending the money. I really look forward to see what Will Smith's next movie is going to be like.

The girl was a knock-out, but would have liked to have seen a Latino woman, maybe because I could see myself in that role, if I were 30 years younger and 50 pounds thinner that is. LOL It had it's funny moments, but I should have waited to watch it on Netflix rather than going into town. Not worth the theater ticket, but okay for a boring Saturday afternoon at home. W. Smith hasn't really done a good movie for awhile. I think we can add this one to his list of bad ones, but I still think he still has some great movies in him.",Focus
257,kenrigua,Focus Review,7,9 April 2015,"Heist movies come and go, but a good con film is little different. Trouble in Paradise, The Sting, The Spanish Prisoner – these are films more about manipulating people than just stealing something. Focus, which stars Will Smith as a master con man and Margot Robbie as his new apprentice, spends much of its running time convincing you it is the best entry into the genre in years. Alas, this is merely a setup, as the film's second half eventually reveals that it's all been a facade. Once the scaffolding crumbles, we're left on a limping getaway. We didn't land the big score, but we did come away with a few sparkly trinkets.Focus opens in a swank New York restaurant where small-time grafter Jess (Robbie) thinks she's spotted a mark in Nicky (Smith). He plays along out of curiosity, then takes pity. As the colored lights of midtown Manhattan shimmer against Lincoln Center's snow-topped campus, Nicky playfully educates Jess in the art of the psychological graft. It is one of many remarkable scenes that directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa shoot in a very straightforward manner, taking advantage of the obvious beauty right in front of them. Usually the phrase ""very visual"" is critics' code for complex camera moves or unusual angles, but it can just as well mean casting gorgeous actors in breathtaking costumes and plopping them in a great urban or interior setting. The hotels and high-end clubs in Focus are extraordinarily furnished, and Smith and Robbie look splendid gallivanting among them. They are both terrific in this, especially relative newcomer Robbie who shows tremendous comedic range.The film's action soon heads to New Orleans where a ""big football game"" (not the Super Bowl, though, should lawyers be watching) has the town swimming in easy money. Jess fits in nicely with Nicky's crew as they bop around the French Quarter boosting wallets and watches. They do brisk business, gobbling up every bag and briefcase they can find. That is, until the twist comes and Nicky manipulates Jess into helping him pull off an enormous (and, admittedly, ludicrous) con inside the Superdome.If the projector broke after the New Orleans job and I stopped watching there, I'd be over the moon about this picture. Unfortunately, after a ""three years later"" card we meet up with Nicky in Buenos Aires as he starts planning a con involving a car race. He isn't trying to steal, but to infiltrate an opposing team and slip them a thingamajig that will lead them to think they have an edge, but will actually do just the opposite. It's a little confusing, and gets more so when characters from the past keep showing up.Even in this second half, which has considerably less steam than the first, Focus must be applauded for sticking to its mission. There's not a wisp of moralizing within 50 feet of this film. Theft on a large and small scale is considered a noble art. There's also a sense of sexual candor wafting throughout. Jess doesn't exactly encourage lechery, but she seems somewhat at peace with the chauvinism of her chosen profession. (""Hello?!? I'm right here!"" she cries out in one of the funnier moments when one of Nicky's colleagues makes a lewd remark.) Like a Bond villainies, the power of feminine wiles is presented as a piece of equipment. Men have upper-body strength, women have batted eyelashes. The final third is obviously building to some rug-from-under-you reveal, and all I'll say is that while I knew something was coming, it's a twist that no one will be able to predict. This is partially why it is somewhat disappointing, as it feels like Ficarra and Requa went so far afield as a mandate. Hard to get too upset, though. When you rerun certain scenes in your head, it all checks out. Plus, Margot Robbie looks so damn beautiful with her hair back lit by the street lamps in the final scenes you'll realize that's more interesting than any far-fetched plot pretzels. It's almost as if the movie is trying to focus your attention elsewhere.",Focus
258,cntctjhunt,"An effort to play up Smith's strengths, and an excellent hand by the actor.",7,29 April 2015,"Will Smith has struggled to maintain his status as a box office draw in recent years; what the business-driven 'After Earth' didn't do to stain his reputation, the wholly unnecessary 'Men In Black 3' did.'Focus', however, is a suitably more concentrated effort to play up Smith's strengths and reconnect with his fan base. Here he plays the suave, witty entrepreneur Nick, who has amassed his fortune as the ringleader of a group of highly-skilled con artists. It's the kind of role that seems was wrote for Smith, instantly regaining his likability and erasing all thought of him promoting his son as a serious actor in an M. Night Shyamalan feature. The beautiful Margot Robbie gets the most out of her co-star, and the result is some strong, sexual chemistry.Director Glenn Ficarra toys with the audience constantly, playing plenty of red herrings and bluffs that maintain tension and doubt befitting of a movie where fraud is a central concept; it also becomes Ficarra's central conceit, bordering on tiresome but saved by its metaphysical role to the film's hook. Its repetitiveness remains a minor frustration until the plot finally kicks (quite literally) into gear a little too overdue.Will Smith has undoubtedly played an excellent hand with 'Focus', catering to his briefly neglected fan base and reminding the casual cinema goer that he isn't quite yet ready to abandon his position atop the box office.",Focus

Also Margot Robbie is proving to be a revelation and excelled again after her great performance in ""Wolf of Wall Street"". The chemistry between the two is evident which only improves the film whilst also simultaneously making me excited for the next collaboration between the two in ""Suicide Squad"".

At the beginning until middle of the movies, it is very interesting. But, nearly end of the story, it becomes anti-climax. I'm dissapointed with the presentation of the ''final mission'' which i think done really mediocrity. The only thing helps this film up at the end is the third party which almost unpredictable.

It is extremely far fetched that a pickpocketing crime organization involving 100s of members who are able to celebrate in fancy clothes with champagne, will not have a single member arrested and be able to conduct this without suspicion from law enforcement. How about a gambling Asian ""businessman"" who happens to carry a suitcase with a few million dollars in cash at all times? This movie has it all.

AND HERE I AM - DOING IT.If you can watch the first 30-40 minutes without feeling like walking out, I give you credit. We actually felt awkward for most of the movie..The fact that this script got through to Will Smith and he accepted.. That is just mindblowingly unbelievable.",Focus
284,coldrush-16998,Lack of Script,6,12 March 2015,"FOCUS Excellent Actuations from Will Smith and Margot Robbie. The first hour the movie is spectacular, the rest it's just looks like the script was finished in a hurry. This movie could been pure gold, if it would had followed the path it had at the beginning. I was really disappointed at the end. Cinematography is nice, they have some takes playing with reflections which i liked very much. I give this movie a 6 because the actuation and some shots are worth to watch. If you want to see really good actors and 1/2 a shitty script, here you have it. Don't WATCH IT EXPECTING SOMETHING. a one time to see movie, And Margot Robbie's hotness is worth the ticket.",Focus
285,corinthiust,Well centered but unintelligent in approach,7,14 March 2015,"The title ""Focus"" had potential among the quantitatively declining Con- Artist genre. Although brilliantly centered and set up with a decent cast and setting - the execution of intelligent criminal activity was poor and often justifying or explaining trickery and illusion as ""he's just so good at it."" - failing to satisfy the audience with an insight into the brilliance that is a con-centered plan. I love heist movies. I love intricate con movies. I love crime movies and I'm sad to say this doesn't really come close to fitting anywhere between those genres best and brightest. Instead you're left feeling slightly amused, slightly tired, slightly relieved that it's over but kind of happy you saw it anyway - I dread to think how badly this movie would have been were it not for will smith.",Focus
286,king-smith-264-596219,How has this got so many good reviews? Most predictable movie ever.,3,15 March 2015,"This is my first online review of a movie. I felt I had to register and write a review on Focus purely because I was shocked it received so many high ratings, especially so many 9's and 10's. Really? I honestly worry about people's intellect. First of all this is a typical hustle/con artist type movie that, for me, has so far been the most predictable of them all. This movie has taken it to the point where I am actually sick and tired of the 10-steps-ahead-every-single-person-on-screen, with a plan B through to Z to back it up just in case plan A should fail (which inevitably was planned) formula that is so common in todays hustle movies. Secondly I am really not a fan of glorifying criminal activity where the innocent, hard working average Joe on the street is the victim and the person committing the crime lavishes, unpunished, in wealth and riches. Sure by all means if the person footing the bill is a bad guy; a villain, a corrupt member of parliament or a bent cop for example, then that reinforces means for a scam. But Will Smith, with a drop dead gorgeous girl, banking millions and living a life of luxury on money stolen from regular civilians made me want them to feel heat and get caught and lose everything as soon as his methods were revealed. Anyway, as the title suggests, I predicted every scam, every plot, every twist, everyone who was in on things (out of the main characters anyway. I mean how far does his empire stretch for crying out loud? There were way too many extras in the movie who were involved in scams for anyone to be able to manage and brief to successfully run that kind of operation, let alone pay accordingly). I had no idea what this movie was about and had read no reviews prior to watching it so didn't no what to expect. It started off so promisingly. I got the impression Will Smith was a business man or a spy or something of that status. He came across as a good guy, an honest man rescuing the girl from an unwanted guy hitting on her. I breathed out an air of disappointment when it was revealed that he was basically a con man. A scumbag one at that with no morals on who he targets. This movie was basically a hash of other con movies all thrown into one. Very little depth and very easy to watch. This is one to see on a first date. Worth a watch but only a one time viewing. How anyone can give this movie anything more than a 6 or a 7 absolute tops is beyond me.",Focus
287,radialdrift-08148,"Bland, unfocused and lacks pacing",3,17 March 2015,"Sophistication, well developed and exciting are just some of the things that you won't get from this film. The premise is far from interesting, believable nor is it new or done well. It was so easy to see what was going on from the start with this film. The several attempts to make the audience wonder who was playing who are so evident, that the surprises are more like a delayed plot that the audience has already figured out. The pacing of the film is off by a long way and so the film lacks any real momentum when it is heading towards the climatic scenes. This culminates in yet another poor film from Will Smith and another pointless film from the most uncreative time in cinemas history. It's films like this, that really turn me away from the US film industry.",Focus
288,sgseanguy,Margot Robs the spotlight,8,25 April 2015,"The only problem with ""Focus"" is, ironically, focusing too much. I was so entranced by Margot Robbie that I didn't even see Will Smith until about 30 minutes through the movie, and he's the main character. She's not just gorgeous, but a really great actor, and every scene featuring her seemed to shine. But the best part is I don't even have to go home and Google her, because we've already seen her naked in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" last year. That was tasteless. But seriously, she's gorgeous.As for the rest of the movie? Well yeah, it's pretty good. The tension runs high, the plot moves quickly, and there are some pretty funny lines mixed in to liven it up. An age old formula, but pulled off pretty well. What I'm trying to say without using the cliché is that there's never a dull moment. Even when nothing's happening, something is happening, you're just not noticing it. Very strong beginning, no slacking off in the middle, and a hit-and-run ending. Even though it played out in more-or-less the way I expected, there were some nice curve balls in there to keep it fresh like the prince of Bel-air.Special shout out to the supporting cast: the good-looking guy from ""Love Actually"", the hairy guy from probably something, and a budget Johnathan Banks. They completely hold their own, and in a way they make the film. Margot and Will are great, but without everyone else around them it wouldn't be much more than a relationship drama. Guy meets girl, guy abandons girl, they reunite; shenanigans ensue. It's hard to give a film like this a rating out of ten, but I'd have to say a solid eight. Unlike most of the dull movies I've watched this week, I could actually watch this again without dying of boredom (looking at you, ""Insurgent""). Will there be a sequel? I guess there could be, but it's not necessary. An x-rated spin-off? Now that would be worth watching.",Focus
289,anuradhaneo,A total dumb movie,1,3 June 2015,"I would give the rating zero or even minus if I could, This is a total unrealistic dumb movie I have seen. Everything I have seen in this movie is made for people with very primitive mindset, of course but this could be a superb movie ever made for some folks but it depends on the mindset of the viewer. I am not going to point out case by case where these pathetic unrealistic scenes are because otherwise my review will be flagged as a spoiler, anyway lost the faith and the respect I had for Will Smith, he was a true star back in those days, but not anymore. Just ignore this movie, its a total time waste, this is just an unsuccessful creation.",Focus
290,bgiant,The absolute worse use of music for a movie I have ever seen,4,3 June 2015,"Tedious application of music that does not apply to the scenes makes this movie almost unwatchable. We get it, he's a lonely man, we don't need the soulful Sax in every romantic scene, nor the lounge act music at every nightclub. Let the movie develop itself instead of forcing it down our throat with these not so subtle nudges. I would have paid extra if they filmed Music Coordinator getting fired while that stupid cruise ship lounge music played one last time.Tries to be too stylistic instead of just telling a story that actually has an interesting plot. Minimal character development outside the two main, even though these supporting characters play a pivotal part.",Focus
291,dianesflim,Oh my God! Terrible!,1,7 August 2015,"I cannot express in words how horrible this waste of time was/is! We kept watching just because we kept hoping it would get better. Hell the bar was set low and kept getting lower as the movie went on. You would have thought a movie with Will Smith would have at least been a half way good one. But oh no it was beyond bad. Character development was very poor. Come on the whole black man with a white blonde girl - so stereotypical! Oh then to top it off it is a black man who was homeless and raised by a white man. Can you get anymore Brad and Anjolinaish? The story was riddled with corniness throughout. My eight year old could have written a better script with crayons on a paper napkin. Will needs a better director to help bring out his best. Oh and one more thing - this was way too much hitchish as well. If you like Will as a know it all who teaches someone else how to do something, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise keep on walking and spend your money on something which can leave you feeling good or at least numb your senses enough to watch crap like this.",Focus
292,thomasjackson-24065,lame,6,19 November 2015,"There is a reason why ""caper"" thriller are so universally popular among the audience. They are like sweets - they must be seriously bad to be perceived as bad. While the swindle in real life often viewed as a crime (fully justified), the gentleman crooks and bandits brave adrenaline in fiction and sometimes the news harbor respect. The reason is clear: we are usually not the victims, we are too smart and / or poor for that. Their victims are rich or at least well-off people with character flaws: unfaithful husbands, compulsive gamblers, greedy or simply inattentive types. Focus is one such, average to solid ""caper"", which evokes memories of some of the older movies that is perceived as better, you might then time for their innovation, perhaps because of nostalgic patina.",Focus
293,MusicDivine,Focus actor,8,28 February 2017,"I really would like to give you my review about the part BD Wong played in the movie Focus, and I hope you will place it on IMDb.com for everybody to read.As a partly Surinam/partly Dutch 50 year old woman and absolute filmfan, living in the Netherlands, I have seen quite a lot of movies, mainstream or not, documentary, art-house movies, it doesn't matter, I find almost everything interesting. Two years ago, 2015, I've seen about 300 movies, if not more . . .In the movie ""Focus"" all elements were superb : the script, the actors, the director, the cameracrew and the music. It was one big, beautiful symphony, like perfectly braided hair.AND in particular, I have never – and I mean NEVER EVER – seen a greater star shine in his role than BD Wong did in the movie ""Focus""!!! He plays a dandy, deadserious yet humorous Asian gambler, a business man with too much money to spend , too much free time apparently to spend it, and nobody to stop him from acting like a child when he doesn't get what he wants and setting him straight when crossing the line.I say BD Wong outplayed everybody in this movie, even Will Smith and Margot Robbie, who acted great also and shared some sort of rare chemistry, seldom seen, like between Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper. But BD Wong outshines them all. I mean, he got his 15 minutes to play and by God, did he play! He deserves an Oscar for this role because you don't see BD Wong, but you see only his character, Liyuan, and I think not even the script writers Glenn Ficarra and John Requa could have dreamt of a better performer than actor BD Wong for this small yet utterly well played part. (together with a defining good choice of music and camera shooting angles). In Holland (and France), when somebody excels so greatly, we say ""Chapeau!"". So here's to my new movie hero, whose beautiful voice I also LOVED in ""Mulan"", mister BD Wong : Chapeau!",Focus
